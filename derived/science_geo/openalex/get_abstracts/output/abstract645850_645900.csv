https://openalex.org/W2999027176,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma presents as a spectrum of a highly aggressive disease in patients. The basis of this disease heterogeneity has proved difficult to resolve due to poor tumor cellularity and extensive genomic instability. To address this, a dataset of whole genomes and transcriptomes was generated from purified epithelium of primary and metastatic tumors. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that molecular subtypes are a product of a gene expression continuum driven by a mixture of intratumoral subpopulations, which was confirmed by single-cell analysis. Integrated whole-genome analysis uncovered that molecular subtypes are linked to specific copy number aberrations in genes such as mutant KRAS and GATA6. By mapping tumor genetic histories, tetraploidization emerged as a key mutational process behind these events. Taken together, these data support the premise that the constellation of genomic aberrations in the tumor gives rise to the molecular subtype, and that disease heterogeneity is due to ongoing genomic instability during progression."
https://openalex.org/W2999272357,"Mutations in ARID1A, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, are the most common alterations of the SWI/SNF complex in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. We identify that ARID1A inactivating mutations are present at a high frequency in advanced endocrine-resistant ER+ breast cancer. An epigenome CRISPR-CAS9 knockout (KO) screen identifies ARID1A as the top candidate whose loss determines resistance to the ER degrader fulvestrant. ARID1A inactivation in cells and in patients leads to resistance to ER degraders by facilitating a switch from ER-dependent luminal cells to ER-independent basal-like cells. Cellular plasticity is mediated by loss of ARID1A-dependent SWI/SNF complex targeting to genomic sites of the luminal lineage-determining transcription factors including ER, forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) and GATA-binding factor 3 (GATA3). ARID1A also regulates genome-wide ER-FOXA1 chromatin interactions and ER-dependent transcription. Altogether, we uncover a critical role for ARID1A in maintaining luminal cell identity and endocrine therapeutic response in ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2999893607,"Though skin fibroblasts (FB) are the main cell population within the dermis, the different skin FB subsets are not well characterized and the traditional classification into reticular and papillary FBs has little functional relevance. To fill the gap of knowledge on FB diversity in human skin, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Investigation of marker genes for the different skin cell subtypes revealed a heterogeneous picture of FBs. When mapping reticular and papillary FB markers, we could not detect cluster specificity, suggesting that these two populations show a higher transcriptional heterogeneity than expected. This finding was further confirmed by in situ hybridization, showing that DPP4 was expressed in both dermal layers. Our analysis identified six FB clusters with distinct transcriptional signatures. Importantly, we could demonstrate that in human skin DPP4+ FBs are the main producers of factors involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. In conclusion, we provide evidence that hitherto considered FB markers are not ideal to characterize skin FB subpopulations in single-cell sequencing analyses. The identification of DPP4+ FBs as the main ECM-producing cells in human skin will foster the development of anti-fibrotic treatments for the skin and other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2999365647,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-containing enzymes that play a key role in the oxidative degradation of various biopolymers such as cellulose and chitin. While hunting for new LPMOs, we identified a new family of proteins, defined here as X325, in various fungal lineages. The three-dimensional structure of X325 revealed an overall LPMO fold and a His brace with an additional Asp ligand to Cu(II). Although LPMO-type activity of X325 members was initially expected, we demonstrated that X325 members do not perform oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides, establishing that X325s are not LPMOs. Investigations of the biological role of X325 in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor revealed exposure of the X325 protein at the interface between fungal hyphae and tree rootlet cells. Our results provide insights into a family of copper-containing proteins, which is widespread in the fungal kingdom and is evolutionarily related to LPMOs, but has diverged to biological functions other than polysaccharide degradation. The X325 protein family is highly similar to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in regulation, structure and copper coordination by a histidine brace, yet lacks LPMO activity and suggests the evolution of an alternative function in fungi."
https://openalex.org/W3000029748,"Infection by the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes lethal meningitis, primarily in immune-compromised individuals. Colonization of the brain by C. neoformans is dependent on copper (Cu) acquisition from the host, which drives critical virulence mechanisms. While C. neoformans Cu+ import and virulence are dependent on the Ctr1 and Ctr4 proteins, little is known concerning extracellular Cu ligands that participate in this process. We identified a C. neoformans gene, BIM1, that is strongly induced during Cu limitation and which encodes a protein related to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). Surprisingly, bim1 mutants are Cu deficient, and Bim1 function in Cu accumulation depends on Cu2+ coordination and cell-surface association via a glycophosphatidyl inositol anchor. Bim1 participates in Cu uptake in concert with Ctr1 and expression of this pathway drives brain colonization in mouse infection models. These studies demonstrate a role for LPMO-like proteins as a critical factor for Cu acquisition in fungal meningitis. In the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, Bim1 is a copper-binding lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase-like protein that participates in copper uptake in concert with the Ctr1 importer to drive virulence mechanisms during fungal meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W2999369432,"Understanding the perspectives and preferences of clients eligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is essential to designing programs that meet clients' needs. To date, most PrEP programs in limited-resource settings have been implemented by partner organizations for specific target populations, but the government of Zimbabwe aims to make PrEP available to the broader population at substantial risk in public sector clinics. However, there is limited information on general population perspectives about PrEP in Zimbabwe.A qualitative study was conducted to explore clients' motivation to take or decline PrEP and continue or discontinue PrEP. Through a PrEP pilot in one urban family planning clinic and one rural youth center in Zimbabwe, 150 HIV-negative clients screened as being at high risk of HIV and were offered PrEP between January and June 2018. Sixty semi-structured interviews were conducted with clients who agreed to follow-up (including 5 decliners, all from the rural youth center, and 55 accepters, with 42 from the rural youth center and 13 from the urban family planning clinic). Interviews were conducted after either the first or second PrEP follow-up appointment or after the client declined PrEP. Interviews were audio recorded, de-identified, transcribed, and coded thematically.PrEP uptake was driven by risk perception for HIV, and in many cases, that risk was introduced by the unsafe behavior or HIV-positive status of a partner. Among sero-discordant couples (SDCs), the desire to safely conceive a child was also cited as a factor in taking PrEP. Clients who opted for PrEP preferred it to other forms of HIV prevention. SDCs reported decreased condom use after PrEP initiation and in some cases were using PrEP while trying to conceive a child. After initiating PrEP, clients had more confidence in their sexual relationships and less stress associated with negotiating condom use. Family and partner support was critical to starting and continuing PrEP, but some clients stopped PrEP or missed appointments due to side effects or logistical challenges such as transportation.Results of this study can be used to provide operational guidance for national public sector roll-out of PrEP as part of combination HIV prevention in Zimbabwe. Based on feedback and experiences of clients, the training materials for health workers can be refined to ensure that health workers are prepared to counsel clients on the decision to start and/or continue PrEP and answer common client questions. Program advertisements should also be targeted with key messages that speak to client experiences.Clinical Trial Registry Number: PACTR201710002651160."

FGF23 regulates phosphate homeostasis and deficiency in GALNT3 or FGF23 results in hyperphosphatemia and familial tumoral calcinosis. We explored the molecular mechanism for GalNAc-T3 glycosylation of FGF23 using engineered cell models and biophysical studies including kinetics, molecular dynamics and X-ray crystallography of GalNAc-T3 complexed to glycopeptide substrates. GalNAc-T3 uses a lectin domain mediated mechanism to glycosylate Thr178 requiring previous glycosylation at Thr171. Notably, Thr178 is a poor substrate site with limiting glycosylation due to substrate clashes leading to destabilization of the catalytic domain flexible loop. We suggest GalNAc-T3 specificity for FGF23 and its ability to control circulating levels of intact FGF23 is achieved by FGF23 being a poor substrate. GalNAc-T3's structure further reveals the molecular bases for reported disease-causing mutations. Our findings provide an insight into how GalNAc-T isoenzymes achieve isoenzyme-specific nonredundant functions."
https://openalex.org/W2999742058,"Genetic screens in cultured human cells represent a powerful unbiased strategy to identify cellular pathways that determine drug efficacy, providing critical information for clinical development. We used insertional mutagenesis-based screens in haploid cells to identify genes required for the sensitivity to lasonolide A (LasA), a macrolide derived from a marine sponge that kills certain types of cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations. Our screens converged on a single gene, LDAH, encoding a member of the metabolite serine hydrolase family that is localized on the surface of lipid droplets. Mechanistic studies revealed that LasA accumulates in lipid droplets, where it is cleaved into a toxic metabolite by LDAH. We suggest that selective partitioning of hydrophobic drugs into the oil phase of lipid droplets can influence their activation and eventual toxicity to cells."
https://openalex.org/W3000126016,"Hyaluronan (HA) is one of the most prevalent glycosaminoglycans of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM). Abnormal HA accumulation within blood vessel walls is associated with tissue inflammation and is prominent in most vascular pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) is the main hyaluronan synthase enzyme involved in HA synthesis and uses cytosolic UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-GlcNAc as substrates. The synthesis of UDP-glucuronic acid can alter the NAD+/NADH ratio via the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which oxidizes the alcohol group at C6 to the COO− group. Here, we show that HAS2 expression can be modulated by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the master metabolic sensor of the cell, belonging to the class of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Our results revealed the following. 1) Treatments of human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs) with SIRT1 activators (SRT1720 and resveratrol) inhibit both HAS2 expression and accumulation of pericellular HA coats. 2) Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induced HA-mediated monocyte adhesion and AoSMC migration, whereas SIRT1 activation prevented immune cell recruitment and cell motility by reducing the expression levels of the receptor for HA-mediated motility, RHAMM, and the HA-binding protein TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG6). 3) SIRT1 activation prevented nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65), which, in turn, reduced the levels of HAS2–AS1, a long-noncoding RNA that epigenetically controls HAS2 mRNA expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that both HAS2 expression and HA accumulation by AoSMCs are down-regulated by the metabolic sensor SIRT1.

It is composed of the repeating disaccharide d-glucuronic acid (GlcNAc), and differently from other GAGs, HA does not possess any chemical modifications (sulfation, acetylation, and epimerization), lacks a protein anchor, and can reach millions of Da of molecular mass (2Karamanos N.K.

In tissues, HA has a rapid turnover, and its synthesis is catalyzed by a family of three isoenzymes HAS1, -2, and -3. Conversely, its degradation is due to different hyaluronidases (HYAL1–6) that work at acidic pH, and other related enzymes (i.e. TMEM2 and KIAA1199) that have an optimum pH around the physiological value (21Yamamoto H.

HASes are very unusual proteins as they are transported to the plasma membrane where they are able to form homo- and heterodimers and are activated to extrude the nascent HA chain into the extracellular space (23Heldin P.

Interestingly, the stoichiometry of the cytosolic UDP substrates has a critical role to define HA polymer length, and the C-terminal region of HASes appears to have regulatory functions (27Baggenstoss B.A. Harris E.N.

At the cellular level, the specific role of each HAS isoenzyme is still unknown, but among the three HASes, HAS2 is considered the most important one. Its genetic deletion leads to early embryonic death due to cardiac defects, whereas the HAS1 and HAS3 knockouts are viable and fertile (28Siiskonen H. Oikari S. Pasonen-Seppänen S. Rilla K.

Interestingly, HAS2 activity is strictly regulated by several mechanisms that can act both at the protein level (as phosphorylation, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, and ubiquitination) (29Vigetti D.

HAS substrates are cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), which are synthesized by UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) dehydrogenase (UGDH). We previously showed that UGDH overexpression and silencing led to an increase and a decrease of the HAS2 transcript, respectively, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving cytosolic UDP-Glc that is able to coordinate the expression of HAS2 with the presence of its substrate (36Vigetti D.

Interestingly, UGDH catalyzes the double oxidation of the C6 of UDP-Glc converting the alcoholic group into a carboxylic group by using two molecules of the cofactor NAD+ that are converted to NADH.

It is generally accepted that when nutrients are not limiting, NAD+ levels are low, although when there is nutrient shortage or caloric restriction NAD+ increases and activates sirtuins (41Guarente L.

As HAS2 is a critical enzyme involved in atherosclerosis with vessel thickening and its transcription is regulated by NF-κB (46Fischer J.W. Role of hyaluronan in atherosclerosis: current knowledge and open questions.Matrix Biol. 2019; 78 (29510229): 324-33610.1016/j.matbio.2018.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this study investigated whether HAS2 expression could be regulated by SIRT1 in human aortic smooth muscle cells and whether SIRT1 could control pro-atherogenic behavior of AoSMCs after TNFα proinflammatory treatments. AoSMCs generally produce high amounts of HA, which is the main component of vascular ECM, along with type I and III fibrillar collagen, elastin, and versican (47Viola M. Karousou E. D'Angelo M.L. Caon I. De Luca G. Passi A. Vigetti D. Regulated hyaluronan synthesis by vascular cells.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2015; 2015 (26448750): 20830310.1155/2015/208303Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Gene expression analysis of AoSMCs showed that HAS2 is the prevalent HAS isoform with mRNA levels 30 times higher than HAS3, whereas HAS1 expression was not detected (Fig. 1A). To determine the contribution of each isoform on HA synthesis, AoSMCs were nucleofected with 50 nm siRNA against the three HAS isoforms, and after 48 h of incubation, the amounts of HA secreted in cell culture media were analyzed by PAGEFS (Fig. 1B) (48Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fluorophore-labeled hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate disaccharides: application to the analysis in cells and tissues.Electrophoresis. 2004; 25 (15349930): 2919-292510.1002/elps.200406034Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic analysis showed that the silencing of HAS2 caused a 70% decrease in the levels of unsaturated HA disaccharides (ΔHA), whereas the knockdown of HAS3 and HAS1 reduced HA disaccharides amount by only 5 and 10%, respectively, providing evidence for a pivotal role of HAS2 in AoSMC HA synthesis. No effects were detected on the band corresponding to the unsaturated chondroitin 0–sulfate disaccharide (ΔCS-0S). Considering the importance of HAS2 with respect to HAS1 and HAS3, our study focused primarily on HAS2 expression. To investigate the effects of SIRT1 on HAS2 expression, we treated AoSMCs for 24 h with resveratrol (RESV), an antioxidant polyphenol nonflavonoid compound that is able to indirectly activate SIRT1 (49Beher D. Wu J. Cumine S. Kim K.W. Lu S.-C. Atangan L. Wang M. Resveratrol is not a direct activator of SIRT1 enzyme activity.Chem. Biol.

The exposure to SRT1720 showed a dose-response effect on HAS2 mRNA expression, with a stronger inhibitory effect at the concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 2A). A similar trend was observed with increasing amounts of RESV, where the concentration of 100 μm was the most efficient to decrease HAS2 mRNA levels to near zero (Fig. 2B). Considering the effects on HAS2 transcript, all the following experiments used 1 μm SRT1720 and 100 μm RESV. At these concentrations, both the compounds did not show any effects on cells viability (data not shown). The effects of SRT1720 and RESV were specific on HAS2 mRNA as these compounds failed to modulate HAS3 transcript levels (Fig. 2C). As HAS2 expression can be regulated by HAS2–AS1, we found that SRT1720 and RESV were also able to inhibit the expression of HAS2–AS1 by 85% (SRT1720) and 80% (RESV) (Fig. 2D), confirming the co-regulation of HAS2 and HAS2–AS1 in these cells (33Vigetti D. Deleonibus S. Moretto P. Bowen T. Fischer J.W. Grandoch M. Oberhuber A. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Cinquetti R. Karousou E. Viola M. D'Angelo M.L. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A.

Western blotting experiments showed that SRT1720 reduced HAS2 protein ∼30% after 24 and 48 h, whereas RESV did not have any effects on HAS2 protein levels at 24 and 48 h of treatment (Fig. 2, E and F). As HAS2 is the most important enzyme in AoSMCs for the production of HA, we measured HA levels after the treatment with SRT1720 and RESV and did not find significant changes in the levels of secreted HA in the culture medium (Fig. 2G). However, both SRT1720 and RESV caused significant reductions of the pericellular coats of AoSMCs (Fig. 2H and in Fig. S1) comparable with the treatment with HYAL, suggesting that the pericellular matrix of AoSMCs is predominantly composed of HA, which can be stimulated by the two SIRT1 activators. To confirm whether SIRT1 could regulate HAS2 expression, we transfected AoSMCs with an siRNA against SIRT1, which silenced SIRT1 ∼60% (Fig. 3A). The silencing of SIRT1 caused an ∼60% increment of HAS2 mRNA expression with respect to the control (Fig. 3B). Moreover, Western blot analysis using a HAS2-specific polyclonal antibody showed the presence of an immunoreactive band at 63 kDa, and the relative densitometric quantification revealed a 30% increase of the HAS2 protein levels (Fig. 3C), indicating that SIRT1 was able to regulate both HAS2 mRNA and protein expressions.

Although grazing exclusion has been studied elsewhere, the consequences of alleviating the disturbance regime in grassland ecosystems remain unclear. In this paper, we present results of the first five years of an experiment in native grasslands of southern Brazil. Using a randomized block experimental design, we examined the effects of three grazing treatments on plant and arthropod communities: (i) deferred grazing (i.e., intermittent grazing), (ii) grazing exclusion and (iii) a control under traditional continuous grazing, which were applied to 70 x 70 m experimental plots, in six regionally distributed blocks. We evaluated plant community responses regarding taxonomic and functional diversity (life-forms) in separate spatial components: alpha (1 x 1 m subplots), beta, and gamma (70 x 70 m plots), as well as the cascading effects on arthropod high-taxa. By estimating effect sizes (treatments vs. control) by bootstrap resampling, both deferred grazing and grazing exclusion mostly increased vegetation height, plant biomass and standing dead biomass. The effect of grazing exclusion on plant taxonomic diversity was negative. Conversely, deferred grazing increased plant taxonomic diversity, but both treatments reduced plant functional diversity. Reduced grazing pressure in both treatments promoted the break of dominance by prostrate species, followed by fast homogenization of vegetation structure towards dominance of ligneous and erect species. These changes in the plant community led to increases in high-taxa richness and abundance of vegetation-dwelling arthropod groups under both treatments, but had no detectable effects on epigeic arthropods. Our results indicate that decision-making regarding the conservation of southern Brazil grasslands should include both intensive and alleviated levels of grazing management, but not complete grazing exclusion, to maximize conservation results when considering plant and arthropod communities."
https://openalex.org/W2999027133,"In wheat, adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina), is effective in restricting pathogen growth and provides durable resistance against a wide range of virulent forms of P. triticina. Despite the importance, there is limited knowledge on the molecular basis of this type of resistance. We isolated and characterized the wall-associated kinase encoding gene in wheat, and assigned it as TaWAK6. Localization of TaWAK6 homeologs in A and B wheat subgenomes was consistent with the presence of the gene’s orthologs in T. urartu (AA) and T. dicoccoides (AABB) and with the absence of its orthologs in Aegilops tauschii (DD). Overexpression of TaWAK6 did not change the wheat phenotype, nor did it affect seedling resistance. However, the adult plants overexpressing TaWAK6 showed that important parameters of APR were significantly elevated. Infection types scored on the first (flag), second and third leaves indicated elevated resistance, which significantly correlated with expression of TaWAK6. Analysis of plant-pathogen interactions showed a lower number of uredinia and higher rates of necrosis at the infection sites and this was associated with smaller size of uredinia and a longer latent period. The results indicated a role of TaWAK6 in quantitative partial resistance similar to APR in wheat. It is proposed that TaWAK6, which is a non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinase, represents a novel class of quantitative immune receptors in monocots."

Patient and GP characteristics and encounter management data were extracted. Results are reported using descriptive statistics with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. A secondary analysis over a 16 year period (2000-2016) examined management data for RCRP in four year periods.RCRP was the most common shoulder condition managed by GPs at 5.12 per 1,000 encounters; and at an estimated 732,000 times nationally in 2015-2016. Management rate was higher among male patients (5.5 per 1000 encounters c.f. 4.8 for female patients) and was highest in the 45-64 year old age group (8.6 per 1000). RCRP was most frequently managed with medications (54.7%), steroid injection (19.5%) followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (19.1%). Imaging was ordered for 43.4% (ultrasound 41.2% and x-ray 11.6%) of all RCRP presentations (new and returning). Over half (53.0%) of new RCRP presentations were referred for ultrasound imaging. In the 16 year period 2000-16 ultrasound imaging more than doubled from 19.1% to 41.9% of management occasions. In parallel, prescribed steroid injection increased from 9.8% to 19.7%.The usual care provided by GPs for RCRP relies on the use of ultrasound and steroid injection. This is not consistent with recommended care and clinical guidelines that recommend these are delayed until after 6-12 weeks of NSAID medication, exercise and activity modification. There has been a significant increase in the rate of steroid injection and ultrasound imaging, which may be due in part to policy change."

In this work, we studied porcine eyeballs with intact eyelids to describe and characterize the different structures that form the ocular surface, including the cornea and conjunctiva that covers the bulbar sclera, tarsi, and the nictitating membrane. We determined the distribution of goblet cells of different types over the conjunctiva and analyzed the conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT). Porcine eyeballs were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, fixed, processed, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Tissue sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Alcian blue/Periodic Acid Schiff, and Giemsa. Slides were also stained with lectins from Arachis hypogaea (PNA) and Helix pomatia (HPA) agglutinins and immunostained with rabbit anti-CD3. We found that the porcine cornea was composed of 6–8 epithelial cell layers, stroma, Descemet’s membrane, and an endothelial monolayer. The total corneal thickness was 1131.0±87.5 μm (mean±standard error of the mean) in the center and increased to 1496.9±138.2 μm at the limbus. The goblet cell density was 71.25±12.29 cells/mm, ranging from the highest density (113.04±37.21 cells/mm) in the lower palpebral conjunctiva to the lowest density (12.69±4.29 cells/mm) in the bulbar conjunctiva. The CALT was distributed in the form of intraepithelial lymphocytes and subepithelial diffuse lymphoid tissue. Lenticular-shaped lymphoid follicles, about 8 per histological section, were also present within the conjunctival areas. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the analyzed porcine ocular structures are similar to those of humans, confirming the potential usefulness of pig eyes to study ocular surface physiology and pathophysiology."

Here, we assign a key role for atypical C1 domains in mediating DAG fatty acyl specificity of diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) in live cells. Activity-based proteomics mapped C1 probe binding as a principal differentiator of type 1 DGK active sites that combined with global metabolomics revealed a role for C1s in lipid substrate recognition. Protein engineering by C1 domain swapping demonstrated that exchange of typical and atypical C1s is functionally tolerated and can directly program DAG fatty acyl specificity of type 1 DGKs.

Methods This was a retrospective cohort study including 707 single FBTs after preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) that were performed from October 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. The effects of patient-, cycle- and embryology-related parameters on the live birth outcome after FBT were assessed. Results In the subgroup analysis based on live birth, patients who achieved a live birth had a significantly lower body mass index (BMI) than patients who did not achieve a live birth (22.7 (21.5–24.6) kg/m2 vs 27 (24–29.2) kg/m2, p<0.001). The percentage of blastocysts with inner cell mass (ICM) A or B was significantly higher among patients achieving a live birth, at 91.6% vs. 82.6% (p<0.001). Day-5 biopsies were also more prevalent among patients achieving a live birth, at 82.9% vs 68.1% (p<0.001). On the other hand, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels were significantly lower among cases with a successful live birth, at 18.7 (15.45–23.68) vs 20.55 (16.43–25.22) (p = 0.001). The logistic regression analysis showed that BMI (p<0.001, OR: 0.789, 95% CI [0.734–0.848]), day of trophectoderm (TE) biopsy (p<0.001, OR: 0.336, 95% CI [0.189–0.598]) and number of previous miscarriages (p = 0.004, OR: 0.733, 95% CI [0.594–0.906]) were significantly correlated with live birth. Patients with elevated BMIs, cycles in which embryos were biopsied on day-6 and a higher number of miscarriages were at increased risks of reduced live birth rates. Conclusion A high BMI, an embryo biopsy on day-6 and a high number of miscarriages negatively affect the live birth rate after single euploid FBT."

However, long-term peritoneal dialysis treatment causes peritoneal fibrosis. In recent years, the application potential of molecular hydrogen in the biomedicine has been well recognized. Molecular hydrogen selectively scavenges cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acts as an antioxidant. In this experiment, a high glucose-induced peritoneal fibrosis mouse model was successfully established by intraperitoneal injection of high glucose peritoneal dialysate, and peritoneal fibrosis mice were treated with hydrogen-rich peritoneal dialysate. In addition, in vitro studies of high glucose-induced peritoneal fibrosis were performed using MeT-5A cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that molecular hydrogen could inhibit peritoneal fibrosis progress induced by high glucose effectively. Furthermore, it has been found that molecular hydrogen alleviate fibrosis by eliminating intracellular ROS and inhibiting the activation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway. The present data proposes that molecular hydrogen exerts the capacity of anti-peritoneal fibrosis through the ROS/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore, molecule hydrogen is a potential, safe, and effective treatment agent, with peritoneal protective property and great clinical significance."
https://openalex.org/W2999910000,"Background Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with risk of stroke. This study aimed to define the morphological and functional characteristics of MAC that are related to stroke. Methods A total of 460 subjects with MAC from transthoracic echocardiography in a single center from 2012 to 2016 was retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were classified into two groups according to history of stroke [Group 1 (n = 366): without stroke; Group 2 (n = 94): with stroke]. Morphological and functional features of MAC on echocardiogram were scored from 0 to 3 according to MAC mobility, presence of echodense mass with central echolucencies in the periannular region suggesting caseous necrosis, and functional stenosis. Results Significantly more patients in group 2 were men and had history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, or infective endocarditis. Although MAC thickness and extent did not differ between the two groups, group 2 showed a considerably higher MAC score than group 1 (0.50 ± 0.77 vs. 0.23 ±0.52 p<0.001) as a result of the higher prevalence of each component in group 2 [mobility (22 vs. 11%, p = 0.003), echodense mass with central areas of echolucencies suggesting caseous necrosis (23 vs. 7%, p<0.001), and functional mitral stenosis (12 vs. 7%, p = 0.042)]. On logistic regression analysis, MAC score was independently associated with stroke and showed significant incremental value to demographic factors and comorbidities in association with stroke in a consecutive manner. Conclusions In conclusion, morphological and functional characteristics of MAC had incremental value in association with stroke over traditional risk factors. MAC score consisting of MAC mobility, typical echodense mass with central echolucencies suggesting caseous necrosis, and functional mitral stenosis was independently associated with stroke. MAC with high-risk features may act as a source of stroke or more potent composite surrogate markers for stroke-related risk factors."

However, to the authors knowledge, intranasal administration of ketamine and its pharmacokinetics have never been described in dogs. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the pharmacokinetics, absolute bioavailability and tolerability of intranasal ketamine administration compared with intravenous administration. Seven healthy, adult laboratory Beagle dogs were included in this randomized crossover study. The dogs received 2 mg/kg body weight ketamine intravenously (IV) or intranasally (IN), with a two-week wash-out period. Prior to ketamine administration, dogs were sedated intramuscularly with dexmedetomidine. Venous blood samples were collected at fixed times until 480 min post-administration and ketamine plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Cardiovascular parameters and sedation scores were recorded at the same time points. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a rapid (Tmax = 0.25 ± 0.14 h) and complete IN bioavailability (F = 147.65 ± 49.97%). Elimination half-life was similar between both administration routes (T1/2el IV = 1.47 ± 0.24 h, T1/2el IN = 1.50 ± 0.97 h). Heart rate and sedation scores were significantly higher at 5 and 10 min following IV administration compared to IN administration, but not at the later time-points."

Yet, there is limited information regarding catch composition and diversity of these fisheries, especially in Guatemala. Surveys of catch landings were conducted in two of Guatemala's primary Caribbean coastal shark and ray fishing communities, El Quetzalito and Livingston, between January 2015 and July 2017. Biological data from 688 landed chondrichthyans were collected, with 31 species (24 sharks, six rays and one chimaera) identified. The four most frequently captured species included Carcharhinus falciformis (30.2%), Sphyrna lewini (12.7%), Hypanus guttatus (12%) and Rhizoprionodon spp. (6.7%). Landed sharks contained most size classes with a high proportion of juveniles of species with low productivity. The large-bodied species C. falciformis and S. lewini were often recorded at sizes below known maturity; 96.6% and 85.1%, of the captured individuals were immature, respectively. This study can serve as a baseline to determine future trends in the elasmobranch fisheries conducted by Guatemala's Caribbean coastal communities and support assessments on the persistence of the fisheries."

After OPCs are specified, they rapidly proliferate and migrate into the surrounding white matter areas, where they undergo morphological and molecular changes to become myelinating OLs.

NKX2-2 protein contains three highly conserved regions: the tinman (TN) domain, the homeodomain (HD), and the NK2-specific domain (SD) (18Harvey R.P. NK-2 homeobox genes and heart development.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178 (8812123): 203-21610.1006/dbio.1996.0212Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Beyond the SD domain is the C terminus region, which has been shown previously to activate transcription in luciferase reporter assays (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S.

The N-terminal TN domain is a 12-amino-acid sequence highly homologous to the core region of the engrailed homology 1 domain, which acts as a transcriptional repressor (20Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P.

Through this domain, NKX2-2 controls spinal cord V3 interneuron development by recruiting Groucho corepressors to form a large complex (22Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J.

The TN domain also plays an important role in pancreatic β cell differentiation by recruiting different transcriptional repressors (23Doyle M.J. Loomis Z.L. Sussel L.

The most conserved HD domain carries two nuclear localization signals and functions as the DNA-binding site of full-length NKX2-2 (25Tsao D.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A.

The short SD domain has been suggested to mask the function of the adjacent C-terminal (CT) domain (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although the CT portion has been implicated previously in transactivation activity, a more recent study suggested that it may possess a repressor function in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (27Chen H. Liu W. Zhong L. Liao D. Zhang R. Kang T. Wu Y. NKX2-2 suppresses osteosarcoma metastasis and proliferation by downregulating multiple target genes.J. Cancer. 2018; 9 (30210629): 3067-307710.7150/jca.26382Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C-terminal region of the related NKX2-5 protein also has an inhibitory effect on target gene expression (28Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Identification of novel DNA binding targets and regulatory domains of a murine tinman homeodomain factor, nkx-2.5.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7797561): 15628-1563310.1074/jbc.270.26.15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional nature of the CT domain is somewhat controversial and remains to be clarified. In this study, we characterized the functions of various NKX2-2 structural domains in the oligodendrocyte differentiation process. We demonstrated that the CT domain, like the TN domain, also behaves as a transcription repressor to promote oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin gene expression. Moreover, the TN and CT regions exhibit a synergistic role in promoting OL differentiation, possibly by recruiting distinct transcriptional corepressors or epigenetic factors, including GRG3, HDAC1, and DNMT3A. The highly conserved NK2-SD domain functions to attenuate the repressive activity of the C-terminal domain. Together, our results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of NKX2-2 protein can be modified by structural effects of specific sequences and by the transcriptional cofactors with which it interacts. NKX2-2 has been implicated as a transcriptional repressor in the control of cell differentiation and function (15Zhou Q. Choi G. Anderson D.J. The bHLH transcription factor Olig2 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in collaboration with Nkx2.2.Neuron. 2001; 31 (11567617): 791-80710.1016/S0896-6273(01)00414-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 16Zhu Q.

Besides the DNA-binding HD domain, NKX2-2 protein also harbors two other evolutionarily conserved structural motifs (the TN and SD domains) and a less conserved CT domain. To assess their individual contribution to the regulation of OL differentiation, we first generated a series of NKX2-2 deletion mutants lacking each of the four motifs (Fig. 1A). These four derivatives were cloned into RCASBP avian retroviral vector in tandem with the mouse Olig2 gene separated by a P2A sequence to ensure their simultaneous expression in the same cells. The electroporated cells can be identified by immunostaining with the antibody, which specifically recognizes mouse but not chicken Olig2 (Fig. S1). As reported previously (15Zhou Q. Choi G. Anderson D.J. The bHLH transcription factor Olig2 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in collaboration with Nkx2.2.Neuron. 2001; 31 (11567617): 791-80710.1016/S0896-6273(01)00414-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), coexpression of Olig2 and WT NKX2-2 was sufficient to induce formation of MBP+ and PLP+ mature OLs on the electroporated side (Fig. 1, B and B'). However, coexpression of NKX2-2 derivatives lacking the TN or CT domain yielded a much smaller number of mature OLs (Fig. 1, C, C', and F–G), indicating that the TN and CT domains are partially required for NKX2-2 activation of OL differentiation. In contrast, deletion of the SD domain caused stronger expression of MBP and PLP (Fig. 1, E, E', and G), suggesting that this domain normally has an inhibitory effect on NKX2-2 function. As expected, the DNA-binding HD domain was absolutely required for NKX2-2 induction of ectopic precocious OLs in electroporated tissue (Fig. 1, D, D', and G). As both TN and CT domains contribute to NKX2-2 function, we wondered whether each of these two structural motifs alone is sufficient for driving OL differentiation when combined with the HD domain. Although the HD domain itself was not able to activate OL differentiation (Fig. 2, B, B‘, and F), the chimeric proteins consisting of HD+TN domains or HD+CT domains in the absence of other sequences were now capable of inducing the appearance of MBP+ or PLP+ mature OLs (Fig. 2, C–D‘ and F). Noticeably, neither of these two chimeric proteins could fully recapitulate the effect of the full-length NKX2-2 protein in activating MBP/PLP expression, suggesting possible synergistic cooperation between the TN and CT domains. To test this idea, we included both domains in the expression construct, and in ovo electroporation analysis revealed that the combined TN–HD–CT construct indeed led to a higher number of mature OLs than those containing either the TN or the CT domain (Fig. 2, E–F). It has been demonstrated previously that the CT region activated gene transcription in a cultured NIH 3T3 cell line (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine whether it acts in a similar manner in activating OL differentiation, we replaced this domain with a VP16 sequence, a strong transcriptional activator, at the C-terminal position (Fig. 3A). Contrary to our prediction, no expression of MBP or PLP was induced by this NKX2-2ΔCT-VP16 fusion protein in conjunction with OLIG2 (Fig. 3, D and D'), implying that the CT domain did not work as a transcriptional activator in promoting OL differentiation. Therefore, we tested the alternative possibility that this C-terminal region may function as a repressor by substituting the CT sequence with EnR, the transcriptional repressor domain of Drosophila Engrailed protein (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this notion, the NKX2-2ΔCT-EnR chimeric protein induced ectopic MBP+/PLP+ OLs, suggesting that the CT domain can be functionally substituted with a known transcriptional repressor motif (Fig. 3, E–F). There was no evidence that showed high homology of the C-terminal sequences among various NK2 family members. However, short stretches of conserved sequences were noticed between NKX2-2 and NKX2-5, corresponding to the 252–264 position in the NKX2-2 protein (Fig. 3G). This homologous sequences exhibited a strong repressive activity in the NKX2-5 protein (28Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Identification of novel DNA binding targets and regulatory domains of a murine tinman homeodomain factor, nkx-2.5.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7797561): 15628-1563310.1074/jbc.270.26.15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In line with this finding, deletion of this short fragment (Tyr251-Pro264) from NKX2-5 protein dramatically decreased its ability in inducing precocious OL differentiation (Fig. 3, H–J). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the C-terminal domain acts as a transcriptional repressor in initiating OL differentiation. The SD domain has been shown previously to mask the transcriptional activity of the C-terminal region in reporter gene assays (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the SD domain may regulate the activity of NKX2-2 during OL differentiation. To test this possibility, we inserted the SD sequence between the HD and CT domains (Fig. 4A) and then examined its effect on inducing ectopic OL formation. Compared with the HD+CT construct, the HD+S.D.+CT protein induced a significantly smaller number of MBP+/PLP+ mature OLs (Fig. 4, B–C' and F), reinforcing the idea that the SD domain diminished the function of the C-terminal fragment. Because the CT region acts as a transcriptional repressor, we next investigated whether the SD domain would similarly antagonize the function of EnR repressor protein and TN domain. Using the same experimental approach, we found that the HD+SD+EnR protein induced considerably fewer OLs than the HD+EnR construct (Fig. 4, D–E' and F). Similarly, insertion of the SD sequence between the TN and HD domains nearly completely abolished its ability to induce OL differentiation (Fig. 4, H–I' and K). Interestingly, when the SD domain was placed on the other side of the HD domain, it did not compromise the induction of OL differentiation (Fig. 4, H, H', J, J', and K), indicating its short-range inhibitory effect. Together, these results demonstrate that the SD domain negatively regulates the activity of adjacent transcriptional repressors. A previous study revealed two important sequence motifs in the SD domain, the potential mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation site (PLPSP) and the highly hydrophobic core region (VAVPVLV) (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the Ser199 site is indeed phosphorylated by mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. S2). These two motifs are highly conserved among different species (Fig. 5A), suggesting their possibly important roles in SD function. To address this possibility, we first substituted the phosphorylation residue serine with alanine (S199A) in the SD domain (Fig. 5B) and found that the S199A mutation significantly attenuated the function of the SD domain, leading to an increased number of ectopic OLs (Fig. 5, C–D‘ and G). On the contrary, when the serine residue was replaced with aspartate (S199D), this simulated phosphorylation activated function of the SD domain (Fig. 5, E, E‘, and G). Similarly, we replaced the hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic glutamates (A204E and L208E) and discovered that disruption of the hydrophobic core had little influence on the function of SD domain (Fig. 5, F–G). These results indicate that the MAPK phosphorylation site Ser199, but not the hydrophobic core sequence, is critical for function of the SD domain, implying that NKX2-2 protein function may be regulated by a protein phosphorylation process. A previous study demonstrated that NKX2-2 functions as a transcriptional repressor in controlling tissue development by forming a protein complex with DNMT3A, HDAC1, and GRG3 (24Papizan J.B.

Immunostaining confirmed that GRG3, HDAC1, and DNMT3A were indeed expressed in OPCs (Fig. S3). These OPC-transcribed repressor genes were then tested for their physical interaction with NKX2-2 in 293T cells by cotransfection followed by coimmunoprecipitation. In these experiments, GRG3 displayed strong binding to NKX2-2 protein, whereas HDAC1 and DNMT3A exhibited slightly weaker bindings (Fig. 6). The portion of NKX2-2 protein that interacts with those interacting corepressors were further mapped with domain-specific deletion mutants using the coimmunoprecipitation approach. This line of study revealed that deletion of the TN domain abolished NKX2-2 binding to GRG3 but had no or little effect on its binding to DNMT3A or HDAC1 (Fig. 6, A–C). Similarly, deletion of the CT domain eliminated its binding to DNMT3A but not to GRG3 (Fig. 6B). Intriguingly, interaction between NKX2-2 and HDAC1 was significantly reduced by CT deletion but completely abolished when both the TN and CT domains were absent (Fig. 6C). Based on these findings, we postulate that NKX2-2 physically interacts with GRG3 through the TN domain, with DNMT3A through the CT domain, and with HDAC1 through both the TN and CT sequences. The NKX2-2 transcription factor contains the HD domain and three other structural motifs. As the HD domain is responsible for nuclear localization and DNA-binding specificity of all homeodomain proteins, it is no surprise that deletion of this motif fails to initiate OL differentiation (Fig. 1). Previous studies demonstrated that the TN domain is necessary for development of V3 interneurons and pancreatic β cells (22Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2001; 104 (11290324): 861-87310.1016/S0092-8674(01)00283-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 24Papizan J.B.

This study showed that the TN domain is also partially required for NKX2-2 initiation of OL differentiation and that deletion of this structure significantly reduces NKX2-2 induction of myelin gene expression in embryonic chick spinal cords (Fig. 1, C, C', and G). Moreover, when combined with the HD domain, the TN domain alone is sufficient for formation of MBP+ mature OLs (Fig. 2). There is a large sequence between the TN and HD domains in the N-terminal of NKX2-2 protein. This region appears to be dispensable for NKX2-2 induction of OL differentiation. Absence of this domain from various expression constructs (e.g. TN+HD, HD+CT, and TN+HD+CT) did not abolish or even affect the NKX2-2 activation of OL differentiation (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The role of the C-terminal region in cell differentiation and tissue development has not been clearly defined. In this study, we demonstrated that NKX2-2 lacking the CT domain had a significantly weaker effect on induction of mature OLs compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 1, F and F'), indicating that the CT domain is also crucial for NKX2-2 control of OL differentiation (Fig. 2). Although the TN and CT domains take part in the OL differentiation process, neither of them could fully replace the function of intact NKX2-2 protein. However, the combined TN+CT domains exert a strong differentiation effect comparable with the full-length protein (Fig. 2), indicative of their cooperative function in initiation of OL differentiation and maturation. Earlier studies showed that the TN domain functions as a transcription repressor motif to control the development of V3 interneurons and pancreatic β cells (20Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Nkx-2.5: a novel murine homeobox gene expressed in early heart progenitor cells and their myogenic descendants.Development. 1993; 119 (7910553): 969PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the CT domain has been described previously as a strong transcriptional activator based on luciferase reporter assays (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, when this domain was replaced with VP16, which acts as a strong transcriptional activator, the resulting fusion protein did not induce formation of mature OLs (Fig. 3, D, D', and F), implying that the CT domain does not function as a transcriptional activator in promoting OL differentiation. When the CT domain was replaced with the EnR domain, which possess strong transcriptional repressor activity, the fusion protein mimicked the function of full-length NKX2-2 protein in stimulating OL differentiation in collaboration with OLIG2 (Fig. 3, E–F). Based on these findings, we concluded that the CT domain, like the TN domain, also acts as a transcriptional repressor in promoting OL differentiation. In keeping with this notion, the NKX2-2 and NKX2-5 proteins shared some degree of sequence homology in this region (Fig. 3G), and this homologous sequence in NKX2-5 protein possessed a strong inhibitory effect on downstream gene expression. Deletion of this homologous region in NKX2-2 greatly reduced the function of the CT domain in promoting OL differentiation (Fig. 3, H–J). In addition, it was recently reported that this C-terminal structure also functions as a repressor domain in suppressing tumor growth and metastasis (27Chen H. Liu W. Zhong L. Liao D. Zhang R. Kang T. Wu Y. NKX2-2 suppresses osteosarcoma metastasis and proliferation by downregulating multiple target genes.J. Cancer. 2018; 9 (30210629): 3067-307710.7150/jca.26382Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the CT region is likely to function as a repressive domain in promoting OL differentiation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this C-terminal region could function as a transcriptional activator, depending on cell context or developmental stages. Previous studies suggested that NKX2-2 regulates the development of other cell types by recruiting transcriptional corepressors to suppress the expression of its downstream genes (24Papizan J.B.

In this study, we demonstrated that three transcriptional corepressors, GRG3, HDAC1, and DNMT3A, which are abundantly expressed in immature OPCs (Fig. S3), display physical interactions with the NKX2-2 protein. Detailed domain mapping studies revealed that NKX2-2 binds to the GRG3 repressor through the TN domain and to the DNMT3A protein through the CT domain (Fig. 6, A and B). The HDAC1 protein appears to interact with both the TN and CT domains (Fig. 6C). Based on these results, we postulate that strong repressor activity is necessary for NKX2-2 activation of the intrinsic OL differentiation program and that the TN and CT domains work synergistically to achieve robust suppression of downstream genes (e.g. Pdgfra) that normally inhibit OPC differentiation (Fig. 7). It has been suggested that GRG3, HDAC1, and DNMT3A suppress gene expression through distinct mechanisms. For instance, GRGs suppress gene expression in various tissues by recruiting a variety of transcriptional corepressors (22Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2001; 104 (11290324): 861-87310.1016/S0092-8674(01)00283-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). HDAC1 silences gene expression by histone deacetylation, with an important role in oligodendrocyte differentiation (30Egawa N. Shindo A. Hikawa R. Kinoshita H. Liang A.C. Itoh K. Lok J. Maki T.

DNMT3A inhibits gene expression by promoting site-specific methylation (24Papizan J.B. Singer R.A. Tschen S.I. Dhawan S. Friel J.M. Hipkens S.B. Magnuson M.A. Bhushan A. Sussel L.

These observations have raised the possibility that the NKX2-2 transcription factor promotes OL differentiation and maturation by repressing the expression of some key differentiation inhibitors (such as the Pdgfra, Hes, or ID genes) through multiple mechanisms. Although highly conserved among the members of NK-2 family, the function of the NK2-specific domain in NKX2-2 regulation of OL differentiation remains to be defined, especially under in vivo conditions. Watada et al. (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) proposed that the SD domain functionally masks the transcriptional activity of the CT domain. Consistently, we found that an NKX2-2 derivative lacking the SD domain induces a higher number of mature OLs than the full-length NKX2-2 protein (Fig. 1, E, E', and G). Conversely, insertion of the SD domain between the HD and CT domains or between the HD and EnR domains markedly reduced the number of induced mature OLs. Interestingly, insertion of the SD domain between the TN and HD domains also significantly diminished formation of mature OLs (Fig. 4). Thus, the SD domain is capable of inhibiting the activity of various repressive domains when physically adjacent to each other. It is unclear how the short SD motif antagonizes the function of the CT domain in OL differentiation. It has been noted previously that the SD domain contains a potential MAPK phosphorylation site and a hydrophobic core sequence (19Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97 (10944215): 9443-944810.1073/pnas.97.17.9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We found that it is the phosphorylation site, not the hydrophobic sequence, that plays a key role in the function of the SD domain (Fig. 5). This result suggests that NKX2-2 activity may be regulated by protein phosphorylation through the SD domain. It is conceivable that serine phosphorylation may cause a conformational change that destabilizes the adjacent repressive domain. It will be interesting and important to investigate how NKX2-2 function is regulated by protein phosphorylation induced by extracellular signals and signaling molecules. All chick embryo experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines drafted by the Laboratory Animal Facility of Hangzhou Normal University (Hangzhou, China) and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of this university. For expression of NKX2-2 variants in chicken spinal cords, mouse Nkx2.2 mRNAs with deletions of various structural domains were subcloned into the chicken replication-competent retroviral vector RCASBP(B) (33Morgan B.A. Fekete D.M. Manipulating gene expression with replication-competent retroviruses.Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51 (8722477): 185-21810.1016/S0091-679X(08)60629-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NKX2-2 proteins were tagged with a Myc sequence at the N terminus. The procedure for in ovo electroporation has been described previously (34Huang H. Teng P. Du J. Meng J. Hu X. Tang T. Zhang Z. Qi Y.B. Qiu M. Interactive repression of MYRF self-cleavage and activity in oligodendrocyte differentiation by TMEM98 protein.J.

Briefly, a DNA solution containing 2.5 μg/μl RCASBP(B) plasmids, 1 μg/μl pCAGGS–enhanced GFP plasmids, and 1% fast green was injected into the central lumen of embryonic chick spinal cords with a glass capillary at Hamburger and Hamilton stage HH13–HH15 (cE2). The injected embryos were then subjected to five short pulses of electrical shock (25 V, 50 ms for each pulse, 950-ms interval) with an Electro Square Porator (BTX, ECM 830). Embryos of either sex were then allowed to develop for 5 days prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for gene expression analysis. Chicken spinal cord tissues were isolated from whole embryos and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C in PBS. Tissues were then transferred into 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), and sectioned on a cryostat at 16-μm thickness. Immediately adjacent sections from control and experimental tissues were used for ISH and subjected to immunohistochemistry as described previously (13Qi Y. Cai J. Wu Y. Wu R. Lee J. Fu H. Rao M. Sussel L. Rubenstein J. Qiu M. Control of oligodendrocyte differentiation by the Nkx2.2 homeodomain transcription factor.Development. 2001; 128 (11526078): 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The digoxin-labeled RNA probes used in ISH corresponded to the 270–1110 nucleotides of chicken MBP mRNA (NM_205280.1) or 100–970 nucleotides of chicken PLP mRNA (NM_205277.1). Tissues sections were subjected to in situ hybridization for PLP, followed by antigen retrieval in citrate sodium buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Sections were then examined by anti-OLIG2 immunofluorescent staining. The primary anti-mouse OLIG2 antibody (Millipore, AB9610, 1:1000) only recognizes the exogenous OLIG2 protein expressed by the RCASBP constructs but not the endogenous chicken OLIG2 protein. NKX2-2-FLAG–, NKX2-2ΔTN-FLAG–, NKX2-2ΔCT-FLAG–, and NKX2-2Δ(TN+CT)-FLAG–expressing vectors or control vectors were cotransfected with Grg3-HA–, Hdac1-HA–, or Dnmt3a-HA–expressing vectors into HEK293T cells by FuGENE. After 48 h, cells cultured in 10 cm dish were treated with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% NP40, and 1 mm EDTA. 0.2 ml of cell lysate was used for input, and 40 μl of anti-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma, catalog no. M8823) were added to the remaining samples and incubated in a vertical shaker at 4 °C overnight. Beads were subsequently washed with TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) three times, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 120 μl of TBS buffer containing 10 μg of 3×FLAG peptide. Both input and immunoprecipitation samples were subjected to Western blotting with anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804, 1:10,000) or anti-HA (Abcam, ab9110, 1:10,000) antibody. NKX2-2–FLAG protein was overexpressed in the CG4 oligodendrocyte cell line for 2 days, and then cells were lysed in lysis buffer. After centrifugation, anti-FLAG magnetic beads were added to the supernatant and incubated in a vertical shaker at 4 °C overnight. Beads were subsequently washed with TBS buffer three times, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 120 μl of TBS buffer containing 10 μg of 3×FLAG peptide. The eluent was subjected to electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band of 38 kDa was excised from the gel for mass spectrometry analysis (Micrometer Biotech Co., Hangzhou, China). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 10% BisTris/PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and blocked with 5% (w/v) milk dissolved in TBST (TBS (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (Beyotime) as follows: anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804, 1:10,000) or anti-HA (Abcam, ab9110, 1:10,000) antibody. Secondary antibodies were from goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega, W4021) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, W4011). Blots were developed using PierceTM ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific, TD264271D) and imaged with a medical X-ray processor (Carestream).

https://openalex.org/W2999902041,"Multiple observations implicate T-cell dysregulation as a central event in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we investigated mechanisms for suppressing T-cell activation via the inhibitory receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1). To determine how LAIR-1 affects T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, we compared 1) T cells from LAIR-1–sufficient and –deficient mice, 2) Jurkat cells expressing either LAIR-1 mutants or C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) mutants, and 3) T cells from mice that contain a CSK transgene susceptible to chemical inhibition. Our results indicated that LAIR-1 engagement by collagen or by complement C1q (C1Q, which contains a collagen-like domain) inhibits TCR signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation of key components in the canonical T-cell signaling pathway, including LCK proto-oncogene SRC family tyrosine kinase (LCK), LYN proto-oncogene SRC family tyrosine kinase (LYN), ζ chain of T-cell receptor–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), and three mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal–regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2, and p38). The intracellular region of LAIR-1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs that are both phosphorylated by LAIR-1 activation, and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Tyr-251 in LAIR-1 binds CSK. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we demonstrate that CSK is essential for the LAIR-1–induced inhibition of the human TCR signal transduction. T cells from mice that expressed a PP1 analog–sensitive form of CSK (CskAS) corroborated these findings, and we also found that Tyr-251 is critical for LAIR-1's inhibitory function. We propose that LAIR-1 activation may be a strategy for controlling inflammation and may offer a potential therapeutic approach for managing autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2999666436,"Recent evidence indicates that elevated placental adenosine signaling contributes to preeclampsia (PE). However, the molecular basis for the chronically enhanced placental adenosine signaling in PE remains unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is crucial for the enhancement of placental adenosine signaling. Utilizing a pharmacologic approach to reduce placental adenosine levels, we found that enhanced adenosine underlies increased placental HIF-1α in an angiotensin receptor type 1 receptor agonistic autoantibody (AT1 -AA)-induced mouse model of PE. Knockdown of placental HIF-1α in vivo suppressed the accumulation of adenosine and increased ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) in the placentas of PE mouse models induced by AT1 -AA or LIGHT, a TNF superfamily cytokine (TNFSF14). Human in vitro studies using placental villous explants demonstrated that increased HIF-1α resulting from ADORA2B activation facilitates the induction of CD73, ADORA2B, and FLT-1 expression. Overall, we demonstrated that (a) elevated placental HIF-1α by AT1 -AA or LIGHT upregulates CD73 and ADORA2B expression and (b) enhanced adenosine signaling through upregulated ADORA2B induces placental HIF-1α expression, which creates a positive feedback loop that promotes FLT-1 expression leading to disease development. Our results suggest that adenosine-based therapy targeting the malicious cycle of placental adenosine signaling may elicit therapeutic effects on PE."

https://openalex.org/W2998796160,"The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita has a wide host range and it is one of the most economically important crop parasites worldwide. Biological control has been a good approach for reducing M. incognita infection, for which many nematophagous fungi are reportedly applicable. However, the controlling effects of Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain B-22 are still unclear. In the present study we characterized the parasitism of this strain on M. incognita eggs, second-stage juveniles (J2), and adult females. The highest corrected mortality was 71.9% at 3 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) mL-1 and the estimated median lethal concentration of the fungus was 0.96 × 108 CFU mL-1. Two days after treatment with Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain B-22 eggshells were dissolved. A strong lethal effect was noted against J2, as the fungal spores developed in their body walls, germinated, and the resulting hyphae crossed the juvenile cuticle to dissolve it, thereby causing shrinkage and deformation of the juvenile body wall. The spores and hyphae also attacked adult females, causing the shrinkage and dissolution of their bodies and leakage of contents after five days. Greenhouse experiments revealed that different concentrations of the fungal spores effectively controlled M. incognita. In the roots, the highest inhibition rate for adult females, juveniles, egg mass, and gall index was 84.61%, 78.91%, 84.25%, and 79.48%, respectively. The highest juvenile inhibition rate was 89.18% in the soil. Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain B-22 also improved tomato plant growth, therefore being safe for tomato plants while effectively parasitizing M. incognita. This strain is thus a promising biocontrol agent against M. incognita."
https://openalex.org/W2998868589,"Salicylic acid (SA) plays a role in several physiological processes in plants. Exogenously applied SA is a promising tool to reduce stress sensitivity. However, the mode of action may depend on how the treatment was performed and environmental conditions may alter the effects of SA. In the present study the physiological and biochemical effects of different modes of application (soaking seeds prior sowing; spraying leaves with 0.5 mM NaSA) were compared at normal and moderately elevated temperatures (4 h; 35°C) in Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. plants. While soaking the seeds stimulated plant growth, spraying caused mild stress, as indicated by the chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction parameters and changes in certain protective compounds, such as glutathione, flavonoids or antioxidant enzymes. Elevated temperature also caused an increase in the glutathione-S-transferase activity, and this increase was more pronounced in plants pre-treated with NaSA. Both seed soaking or spraying with NaSA and exposure to heat treatment at 35°C reduced the abscisic acid levels in the leaves. In contrast to abscisic acid, the jasmonic acid level in the leaves were increased by both spraying and heat treatment. The present results suggest that different modes of application may induce different physiological processes, after which plants respond differently to heat treatment. Since these results were obtained with a model plants, further experiments are required to clarify how these changes occur in crop plants, especially in cereals."

The assays were carried out in a pilot AS reactor operating for two-weeks under continuous dosage of pollutants. The microbial activity was tracked by measuring oxygen uptake rate, esterase activity, oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. It was found that IBU and TCS had no acute toxic effects on reactor biomass concentration. TCS led to significant decrease of COD removal efficiency, which dropped from 90% to 35%. Continuous exposure to IBU, TCS and their mixtures increased the activities of glutathione s-transferase (GST) and esterase as a response to oxidative damage. A high increase in GST activity was associated with non-reversible toxic damage while peaks of esterase activity combined with moderate GST increase were attributed to an adaptive response."
https://openalex.org/W2998847174,"In Italy anthrax is an endemic disease, with a few outbreaks occurring almost every year. We surveyed 234 B. anthracis strains from animals (n = 196), humans (n = 3) and the environment (n = 35) isolated during Italian outbreaks in the years 1972–2018. Despite the considerable genetic homogeneity of B. anthracis, the strains were effectively differentiated using canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (CanSNPs) assay and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The phylogenetic identity was determined through the characterization of 14 CanSNPs. In addition, a subsequent 31-loci MLVA assay was also used to further discriminate B. anthracis genotypes into subgroups. The analysis of 14 CanSNPs allowed for the identification of four main lineages: A.Br.011/009, A.Br.008/011 (respectively belonging to A.Br.008/009 sublineage, also known Trans-Eurasian or TEA group), A.Br.005/006 and B.Br.CNEVA. A.Br.011/009, the most common subgroup of lineage A, is the major genotype of B. anthracis in Italy. The MLVA analysis revealed the presence of 55 different genotypes in Italy. Most of the genotypes are genetically very similar, supporting the hypothesis that all strains evolved from a local common ancestral strain, except for two genotypes representing the branch A.Br.005/006 and B.Br.CNEVA. The genotyping analysis applied in this study remains a very valuable tool for studying the diversity, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of B. anthracis."

Results In diabetes, mean attenuation, standard deviation, variance, entropy, homogeneity, surface area, sphericity, discrete compactness, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) contrast, and GLCM entropy showed significant differences (P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher variance (adjusted OR, 1.002; P = .005), sphericity (adjusted OR, 1.649×104; P = .048), GLCM entropy (adjusted OR, 1.057×105; P = .032), and lower GLCM contrast (adjusted OR, 0.997; P < .001) were significant variables. The mean AUCs for each feature were 0.654, 0.689, 0.620, and 0.613, respectively (P < .05). In subgroup analysis, only larger surface area (adjusted OR, 1.000; P = .025) was a significant predictor for T2D. Conclusions Computerized 3D CT texture analysis of the pancreas could be helpful for predicting diabetes. A higher variance, sphericity, GLCM entropy, and a lower GLCM contrast were the significant predictors for diabetes."

In this paper, we provide evidence that cadherin-11 (CDH11) binds to and promotes cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo in synergy with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ). Engagement of CDH11 increased the sensitivity of cells to PDGF-BB by 10- to 100-fold, resulting in rapid and sustained phosphorylation of AKT, ultimately promoting and cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Indeed, wound healing experiments showed that healing was severely compromised in Cdh11-/- mice, as evidenced by significantly decreased proliferation, AKT phosphorylation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis of dermal cells. Our results shed light into understanding how intercellular adhesion can promote cell proliferation and may have implications for tissue regeneration and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3000240927,"Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function due to airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation. CF patients are particularly susceptible to respiratory infection by a variety of pathogens, and the inflammatory response in CF is dysregulated and prolonged. BPI fold containing family A, member 1 (BPIFA1) and BPIFB1 are proteins expressed in the upper airways that may have innate immune activity. We previously identified polymorphisms in the BPIFA1/BPIFB1 region associated with CF lung disease severity. Methods We evaluated whether the BPIFA1/BPIFB1 associations with lung disease severity replicated in individuals with CF participating in the International CF Gene Modifier Consortium (n = 6,365). Furthermore, we investigated mechanisms by which the BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 proteins may modify lung disease in CF. Results The association of the G allele of rs1078761 with reduced lung function was replicated in an independent cohort of CF patients (p = 0.001, n = 2,921) and in a meta-analysis of the full consortium (p = 2.39x10-5, n = 6,365). Furthermore, we found that rs1078761G which is associated with reduced lung function was also associated with reduced BPIFA1, but not BPIFB1, protein levels in saliva from CF patients. Functional assays indicated that BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 do not have an anti-bacterial role against P. aeruginosa but may have an immunomodulatory function in CF airway epithelial cells. Gene expression profiling using RNAseq identified Rho GTPase signaling pathways to be altered in CF airway epithelial cells in response to treatment with recombinant BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 proteins. Conclusions BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 have immunomodulatory activity and genetic variation associated with low levels of these proteins may increase CF lung disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3000353335,"Enhanced levels of antioxidants, phenolic compounds, carotenoids and vitamin C have been reported for several crops grown under organic fertilizer, albeit with yield penalties. As organic agricultural practices continue to grow and find favor it is critical to gain an understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the factors that limit the yields in organically farmed crops. Concomitant phytochemical and transcriptomic analysis was performed on mature fruit and leaf tissues derived from Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘Oregon Spring’ grown under organic and conventional fertilizer conditions to evaluate the following hypotheses. 1. Organic soil fertilizer management results in greater allocation of photosynthetically derived resources to the synthesis of secondary metabolites than to plant growth, and 2. Genes involved in changes in the accumulation of phytonutrients under organic fertilizer regime will exhibit differential expression, and that the growth under different fertilizer treatments will elicit a differential response from the tomato genome. Both these hypotheses were supported, suggesting an adjustment of the metabolic and genomic activity of the plant in response to different fertilizers. Organic fertilizer treatment showed an activation of photoinhibitory processes through differential activation of nitrogen transport and assimilation genes resulting in higher accumulation of phytonutrients. This information can be used to identify alleles for breeding crops that allow for efficient utilization of organic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2998745965,"The BEST1 gene product bestrophin-1, a Ca2+-dependent anion channel, interacts with CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). BEST1 mutations lead to Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. A common functional defect of these mutations is reduced trafficking of bestrophin-1 into the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that this defect affects the interaction partner CaV1.3 channel affecting Ca2+ signaling and altered RPE function. Thus, we investigated the protein interaction between CaV1.3 channels and bestrophin-1 by immunoprecipitation, CaV1.3 activity in the presence of mutant bestrophin-1 and intracellular trafficking of the interaction partners in confluent RPE monolayers. We selected four BEST1 mutations, each representing one mutational hotspot of the disease: T6P, F80L, R218C, and F305S. Heterologously expressed L-type channels and mutant bestrophin-1 showed reduced interaction, reduced CaV1.3 channel activity, and changes in surface expression. Transfection of polarized RPE (porcine primary cells, iPSC-RPE) that endogenously express CaV1.3 and wild-type bestrophin-1, with mutant bestrophin-1 confirmed reduction of CaV1.3 surface expression. For the four selected BEST1 mutations, presence of mutant bestrophin-1 led to reduced CaV1.3 activity by modulating pore-function or decreasing surface expression. Reduced CaV1.3 activity might open new ways to understand symptoms of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy such as reduced electro-oculogram, lipofuscin accumulation, and vision impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3000518440,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most frequent causes of brain injury and mortality in young adults with detrimental sequelae such as cognitive impairments, epilepsy, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. TBI modulates the neuronal excitability resulting in propagation of a neuronal activity-driven gene expression program. However, the impact of such neuronal activity mediated gene expression in TBI has been poorly studied. In this study we analyzed mouse mutants of the prototypical neuronal activity-dependent transcription factor SRF (serum response factor) in a weight-drop TBI model. Neuron-restricted SRF deletion elevated TBI inflicted mortality suggesting a neuroprotective SRF function during TBI. Behavioral inspection uncovered elevated locomotor activity in Srf mutant mice after TBI in contrast to hypoactivity observed in wild-type littermates. This indicates an SRF role in modulation of TBI-associated alterations in locomotor activity. Finally, induction of a neuronal activity induced gene expression program composed of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Egr1, Egr2, Egr3, Npas4, Atf3, Arc, Ptgs2, and neuronal pentraxins (Nptx2) was compromised upon SRF depletion. Overall, our data show a role of neuronal activity-mediated gene transcription during TBI and suggest a molecular link between TBI and such post-TBI neurological comorbidities involving hyperactivity phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2999213317,"Purpose To evaluate early recovery of urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with urethral realignment using bladder neck preservation (BNP) and maximal urethral length preservation (MULP). Methods Patients who underwent RARP between 2014 and 2017 owing to prostate cancer with a Gleason score ≤ 7 (3+4), ≤ cT2c stage, and prostate-specific antigen level < 20 ng/ml were investigated. Patients with tumors of the bladder neck or apex on magnetic resonance imaging were excluded. A total of 266 patients underwent the operation using the standard method between 2014 and 2015 (group 1), while 305 patients underwent urethral realignment between 2016 and 2017 (group 2). Continence was defined as wearing no pad or one security pad. Results The continence rates immediately after Foley catheter removal, at 2 weeks, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after operation in group 2 were 46.9%, 63.0%, 73.4%, 90.1%, 94.8%, and 98.7%, respectively. The continence rate at 1 month in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 (65.4% versus 73.4%, p = 0.037). The multivariate regression analysis showed that age and surgical method were factors affecting early continence recovery. The positive surgical margin rates were 18.0% and 14.8% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.288). Biochemical recurrence occurred in 14.7% and 8.2% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.015). Conclusion Urethral realignment using BNP and MULP resulted in rapid continence recovery and good oncological results after RARP in young patients with a Gleason score ≤ 7 and organ-confined disease."

This study intended to address the injury severity of expressways in Beijing by proposing Bayesian ordered logistic regression model. Crash data were collected from urban express rings and expressways in 2015 and 2016. The results showed that crash location, time and crash season are significant variables influencing injury severity. The findings revealed that the proposed model can address the ordinal feature of injury severity, while accommodating the data with small sample sizes that may not adequately represent population characteristics.

https://openalex.org/W3000538598,"Clinical isolates of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum) would facilitate study of prevalent strains. We describe the first successful rabbit propagation of T. pallidum from cryopreserved ulcer specimens. Fresh ulcer exudates were collected and cryopreserved with consent from syphilis-diagnosed patients (N = 8). Each of eight age-matched adult male rabbits were later inoculated with a thawed specimen, with two rabbits receiving 1.3 ml intratesticularly (IT), and six receiving 0.6 ml intravenously (IV) and IT. Monitoring of serology, blood PCR and orchitis showed that T. pallidum grew in 2/8 rabbits that were inoculated IV and IT with either a penile primary lesion specimen (CDC-SF003) or a perianal secondary lesion specimen (CDC-SF007). Rabbit CDC-SF003 was seroreactive by T. pallidum Particle Agglutination (TP-PA) and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) testing, PCR+, and showed orchitis by week 6. Euthanasia was performed in week 7, with treponemal growth in the testes confirmed and quantified by qPCR and darkfield microscopy (DF). Serial passage of the extract in a second age-matched rabbit also yielded treponemes. Similarly, rabbit CDC-SF007 showed negligible orchitis, but was seroreactive and PCR+ by week 4 and euthanized in week 6 to yield T. pallidum, which was further propagated by second passage. Using the 4-component molecular typing system for syphilis, 3 propagated strains (CDC-SF003, CDC-SF007, CDC-SF008) were typed as 14d9f, 14d9g, and 14d10c, respectively. All 3 isolates including strain CDC-SF011, which was not successfully propagated, had the A2058G mutation associated with azithromycin resistance. Our results show that immediate cryopreservation of syphilitic ulcer exudate can maintain T. pallidum viability for rabbit propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3000620233,"Objectives Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral infection in children, with a significant disease burden due to its high contagion rate. This report studied the epidemiological characteristics as well as the chronological and geographical distribution of HFMD in children younger than 6 years of age in Korea. Methods This report established a database by integrating population and geographical data from health insurance claims for HFMD between 2011 and 2017, with an age restriction of ≤6 years, and explored the epidemiological characteristics of both HFMD patients and hospitalized cases in Korea. The relative risk ratio and spatio-temporal scan statistics were calculated by administrative district, using SaTScan. Results Over a 7-year period, 1,879,342 children under the age of 6 were diagnosed with HFMD (8.4 of 100 persons younger than 6 years of age). Seasonal incidence tended to increase from week 17 (May) peak between weeks 29 (July) and 39 (September), and increase rapidly in 1- to 2-year cycles. HFMD primarily occurred in children younger than 4 years of age. Furthermore, the greatest proportion of cases occurred at ages 1 (39.2%) and 2 (25.7%). Overall, 92.6% of all cases occurred before the age of 6. The proportion of cases before the age of 6was slightly higher in males. The timing of HFMD epidemics differed over the years. In 2015, the HFMD cumulative incidence was the lowest (5.5/1,000), and the spatio-temporal cluster (RR 2.32) was predominantly located south-central Korea, covering 65 counties for twenty-two weeks. In 2016, however, its cumulative incidence was high (RR 6.34) over a short period (11 weeks) in specific areas such as Ulsan, Daegu, Busan, and Gyeongnam. Also, the southern parts of Korea were found to have a higher rate of hospitalization. Conclusions HFMD in Korea is common in children younger than 6 years of age, and it tends to peak in the summer."
https://openalex.org/W2998972040,"The transferrin receptor (TfR) of the bloodstream form (BSF) of Trypanosoma brucei is a heterodimer comprising glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored expression site–associated gene 6 (ESAG6 or E6) and soluble ESAG7. Mature E6 has five N-glycans, consisting of three oligomannose and two unprocessed paucimannose structures. Its GPI anchor is modified by the addition of 4–6 α-galactose residues. TfR binds tomato lectin (TL), specific for N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) repeats, and previous studies have shown transport-dependent increases in E6 size consistent with post-glycan processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Using pulse-chase radiolabeling, peptide-N-glycosidase F treatment, lectin pulldowns, and exoglycosidase treatment, we have now investigated TfR N-glycan and GPI processing. E6 increased ∼5 kDa during maturation, becoming reactive with both TL and Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL, terminal LacNAc), indicating synthesis of poly-LacNAc on paucimannose N-glycans. This processing was lost after exoglycosidase treatment and after RNAi-based silencing of TbSTT3A, the oligosaccharyltransferase that transfers paucimannose structures to nascent secretory polypeptides. These results contradict previous structural studies. Minor GPI processing was also observed, consistent with α-galactose addition. However, increasing the spacing between E6 protein and the GPI ω-site (aa 4–7) resulted in extensive post-translational processing of the GPI anchor to a form that was TL/ECL-reactive, suggesting the addition of LacNAc structures, confirmed by identical assays with BiPNHP, a non-N-glycosylated GPI-anchored reporter. We conclude that BSF trypanosomes can modify GPIs by generating structures reminiscent of those present in insect-stage trypanosomes and that steric constraints, not stage-specific expression of glycosyltransferases, regulate GPI processing.

African trypanosomes of the Trypanosoma brucei ssp. (referred to hereafter as “trypanosomes”) are kinetoplastid protozoa that are the causative agents of human and veterinary trypanosomiasis throughout sub-Saharan Africa, wherever the insect vector (tsetse flies, Genus Glossina) is found (1Welburn S.C. Molyneux D.H. Maudlin I. Beyond tsetse: implications for research and control of human African trypansomiasis epidemics.Trends Parasitol. 2016; 32 (26826783): 230-24110.1016/j.pt.2015.11.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes represent an ancient branching group within the Excavata (2Walker G. Dorrell R.G. Schlacht A. Dacks J.B.

For instance, nuclear gene expression involves concerted polycistronic transcription and trans-splicing to generate typical mature mRNAs with a 5′ cap and 3′ poly-A tail (3Clayton C.E.

Even more “otherworldly” is mitochondrial RNA editing in which as much as 50% of mitochondrially encoded mRNAs are formed by post-transcriptional insertion/deletion of uridine residues (4Read L.K.

All GPIs, with minor variations, have the same core structure (ethanolamine-P-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6PI), and these can be decorated with various modifications (reviewed in Ref. 10Ferguson M.A.J.

In yeast and mammals, a set configuration of ethanolamine moieties are in phosphodiester linkage to the trimannosyl core, and these regulate the exit of nascent GPI anchor precursor from the ER. Limited and variable attachment of hexoses to the core can also occur. In trypanosomes, the common core GPI structure, albeit with life cycle stage–specific lipid configurations, is attached to nascent polypeptides in the ER, and subsequent processing leads to distinct glycan structures in BSF and procyclic insect stage (PCF) parasites (Fig. 1A). In BSFs, a spectrum of side-chain galactose residues are added during post-ER trafficking (11Bangs J.D. Doering T.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W.

On procyclin, the major surface protein of PCF trypanosomes, a complex branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) and lacto-N-biose (Galβ1-3GlcNAc) structure is elaborated, presumably also in post-ER compartments, although this has not been formally shown. Upon arrival at the cell surface, this GPI structure serves as the acceptor for transfer of terminal sialic acid residues from host serum sialoglycoproteins by an endogenous cell surface trans-sialidase (13Pontes de Carvalho L.C.

Trypanosomes also differ markedly from the standard eukaryotic model systems in regard to N-glycosylation. Both yeast and mammals (and most other eukaryotes) transfer glucosylated triantennary Glc3Man9GlcNac2 structures from lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) donors to Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor sites (sequons) in nascent secretory polypeptides. This reaction is carried out in the ER by a multicomponent oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST) (14Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R.

Although these OSTs can utilize abbreviated LLOs, in vivo there is an overwhelming preference for the full-sized glycan structure. In contrast, the kinetoplastids typically transfer nonglucosylated structures (16Parodi A.J.

In T. brucei, there are three isoforms, TbSTT3A–C, with distinct LLO and sequon substrate specificities (17Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodriques J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A.J. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28 (19629045): 2650-266110.1038/emboj.2009.203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TbSTT3B, which is constitutively expressed in BSF and PCF stages, has a strong preference for Man9GlcNAc2 oligomannose LLOs (Fig. 1B) and is nondiscriminatory for sequon acceptors. TbSTT3A is up-regulated in BSF trypanosomes, is highly specific for biantennary Man5GlcNAc2 paucimannose LLOs (Fig. 1B), and has strong preference for acidic sequons. TbSTT3C is not expressed in BSF or PCF stages, and nothing is known about its in vivo substrate specificities. All three genes are found as a tandem repeat in a single genetic locus (17Izquierdo L.

These peculiarities of N-glycan addition have significant consequences for subsequent stage-specific N-glycan processing. In PCF trypanosomes, because TbSTT3B is the dominant OST, all sequons are occupied by oligomannose structures. These can be trimmed down to triantennary Man5GlcNAc2 structures, but no further because the Golgi α-mannosidase II that removes the inner α1–3- and α1–6-linked mannoses of the “b” and “c” arms (Fig. 1B) is not present in trypanosomes (18Manthri S.

In contrast, because the biantennary Man5GlcNAc2 glycans attached by TbSTT3A to acidic sequons in BSF trypanosomes are already missing these mannose residues, they can be elaborated in the Golgi into complex type N-glycans, following removal of the α1–2-linked mannoses of the “a” arm. Typically, this involves the addition of a limited number of N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) moieties, sometimes capped with terminal α1–3 galactose residues (19Izquierdo L. Nakanishi M. Mehlert A.

All of these features are illustrated by p67, a highly N-glycosylated (14 sequons) lysosomal type I transmembrane protein (22Kelley R.J. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Processing and transport of a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein is developmentally regulated in African trypanosomes.Mol. Biochem.

In PCF trypanosomes, p67 is synthesized as a 100-kDa glycoform (gp100) that contains only oligomannose N-glycans. In BSF trypanosomes, p67 is likewise synthesized as a gp100 precursor but contains a mixture of oligo- and paucimannose structures. During subsequent transit of the Golgi, at least a few of the latter are processed to hypermodified pNAL-containing N-glycans, thereby generating a mature gp150 glycoform. Another trypanosomal protein that displays a wide range of glyco-modifications is the BSF-specific transferrin receptor (TfR). TfR is a heterodimer of the expression site–associated genes 6 and 7 (ESAG6 and ESAG7) (24Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E.

The two subunits are highly similar (Fig. 1C), but whereas ESAG6 has a GPI anchor that is structurally similar to the galactosylated GPIs found on VSGs, with up to six galactose residues (28Mehlert A. Ferguson M.A.J. Structure of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the Trypanosoma brucei transferrin receptor.Mol. Biochem.

Structural analyses using lectin reactivity and exoglycosidase treatment of purified TfR and high-performance TLC of released TfR N-glycans indicated that each is synthesized with a mixture of oligo- and paucimannose N-glycans (29Mehlert A. Wormald M.R. Ferguson M.A.J. Modeling of the N-glycosylated transferrin receptor suggests how transferrin binding can occur within the surface coat of Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 (22496646): e100261810.1371/journal.ppat.1002618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ESAG6 (E6) has three oligomannose (N28, N237, and N362) and two paucimannose (N112 and N252) structures; ESAG7 (E7) has two oligomannose (N28 and N236) structures and one paucimannose (N112) structure (numbering relative to start codon). All of these have been trimmed by the removal of some or all of the external α1–2-linked mannose residues during intracellular trafficking, but no evidence for processing of the paucimannose glycans to complex type LacNAc-containing oligosaccharides on either subunit was observed. Overall then, this paints a picture of modest post-ER processing—trimming of oligo- and paucimannose N-glycans and attachment of limited GPI side-chain galactose residues. However, other data sets suggest a more complex situation. The existence of pNAL-containing N-glycans was first inferred from binding studies with tomato lectin (TL) (20Nolan D.P. Geuskens M. Pays E. N-Linked glycans containing linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine as sorting signals in endocytosis in Trypanosoma brucei.Curr.

TfR was shown to be part of the total set of TL-binding proteins in BSF trypanosomes, which includes p67, suggesting some degree of conversion of paucimannose oligosaccharides to complex LacNAc-containing N-glycans on TfR (20Nolan D.P.

Second, in our experience, pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments consistently show a time- and transport-dependent increase in the size of E6 (∼5 kDa), but not E7 (33Schwartz K.J. Peck R.F. Tazeh N.N. Bangs J.D. GPI valence and the fate of secretory membrane proteins in African trypanosomes.J.

Such an increase in size cannot be accounted for by minor trimming of N-glycans and limited GPI galactosylation. In this work, we use in vivo biosynthetic assays in conjunction with sequential lectin pulldowns to investigate the relative contributions of N-glycan and GPI processing to the maturation of native TfR, specifically the GPI-anchored E6 subunit. Our results both confirm (GPI processing) and contradict (N-glycan processing) the previous structural studies of these glycoconjugates (see Refs. 28Mehlert A. Ferguson M.A.J. Structure of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the Trypanosoma brucei transferrin receptor.Mol. Biochem.

However, manipulation (loosening) of the steric environment immediately upstream of the GPI anchor results in significant GPI glycan processing reminiscent of the branched poly-LacNAc side chains seen on the GPI anchors of procyclic trypanosomes. These results suggest that stage-specific differences in GPI structure are controlled by steric access of substrates in the Golgi to constitutively expressed glycosyltransferases responsible for side-chain attachment, rather than by stage-specific expression of the glycosyltransferases themselves. To initiate our studies, we first reinvestigated the N-glycosylation status of newly synthesized E6 and E7 and the corresponding mature glycoforms by pulse-chase radiolabeling (Fig. 2; shown in annotated format in Fig. S1). In each case, radiolabeled polypeptides were specifically immunoprecipitated and then treated with either endo-β-N-acetylglycosidase H (Endo H), which removes oligomannose N-glycans, or peptide-N-glycanase F) (PNGase F), which removes all N-glycans. Note that Endo H will not cleave paucimannose Man5GlcNAc2 structures (11Bangs J.D. Doering T.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. Biosynthesis of a variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei: processing of the glycolipid membrane anchor and N-linked oligosaccharides.J. Biol.

At T0, both newly synthesized E6 and E7 are detected as single prominent species, which PNGase F treatment reduces to fully deglycosylated forms consistent with the removal of five and three N-glycans, respectively (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 3). Endo H treatment generates ladders of partially de-N-glycosylated species, indicating the presence of variable numbers of resistant paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2, lane 2), but in each case, the major remaining glycoform is consistent with the assignments of Mehlert et al. (28Mehlert A. Ferguson M.A.J. Structure of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the Trypanosoma brucei transferrin receptor.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 151 (17140675): 220-22310.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.11.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (E6, 2 paucimannose; E7, 1 paucimannose). Equivalent analyses of mature E6 and E7 from the end of the chase period (T60) indicates that, whereas the overall patterns of Endo H sensitivity are unaltered (Fig. 2, lane 2 versus lane 5), a number of changes indicative of glycan processing have occurred. First is a decrease in the size of mature E7 (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 4), which we ascribe to trimming of terminal α1–2-linked mannose residues on all three N-glycans (Fig. S1, shift 1). Second is an increase in the size of mature E6 (lane 1 versus lane 4) that is mirrored in the partially de-N-glycosylated species (Fig. 2, lane 2 versus lane 5). These shifts could be due to processing of paucimannose N-glycans to complex glycoforms and/or processing of the GPI anchor (Fig. S1, shifts 2 and 3, respectively). However, there is also a clear increase in size of the fully de-N-glycosylated species (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus lane 6) that, absent some heretofore unknown post-translational modification, must be attributed to processing of the GPI anchor (Fig. S1, shift 4). As this processing is not large enough to account for the full increase (∼5 kDa) seen in intact E6, we conclude that both N-glycan and GPI modification occur during intracellular transport of TfR. We have previously defined a rubric for assessing the post-ER addition of N-acetyllactosamine to N-glycans on trypanosome secretory proteins using TL and Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) (32Schwartz K.J. Peck R.F. Bangs J.D. Intracellular trafficking and glycobiology of TbPDI2, a stage-specific protein disulfide isomerase in Trypanosoma brucei.Eukaryot.

TL binds linear repeats of three or more LacNAc, but also binds to paucimannose glycans (30Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D.

Expectations for time spent on teaching, research, and service are aligned between individuals within varying ranks of the L(P)SOE faculty and between L(P)SOEs and administrators. L(P)SOEs and administrators are also in agreement about what constitutes acceptable professional development activities.

The host genetic variants associated with dyslipidemia in HIV patients on ART in Ghana have not been fully explored. The study constituted a total of 289 HIV-infected patients on stable ART for at least a year. Fasting blood was collected into EDTA tube for lipids measurement. Lipid profiles were used to define dyslipidemia based on the NCEP-ATP III criteria. HIV-infected subjects were categorized into two groups; those with dyslipidemia (cases) (n = 90; 31.1%) and without dyslipidemia (controls)(n = 199; 68.9%). Four candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genes (ABCA1-rs2066714, LDLR-rs6511720, APOA5-rs662799 and DSCAML1-rs10892151) were determined. Genotyping was performed on isolated genomic DNA of study participants using PCR followed by a multiplex ligation detection reaction (LDR). The percentage of the population who had the rare homozygote alleles for rs6511720 (T/T), rs2066714 (G/G), rs10892151 (T/T) and rs662799 (G/G) among case subjects were 5.5%, 14.4%, 6.6% and 10.0% whiles 2.0% 9.1%, 6.5% and 4.0% were observed among control subjects. There were statistically significant differences in the genotypic prevalence of APOA5 (p = 0.0357) and LDLR polymorphisms (p = 0.0387) between case and control subjects. Compared to the AA genotype of the APOA5 polymorphisms, individuals with the rare homozygote genotype [aOR = 2.38, 95%CI(1.06-6.54), p = 0.004] were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of developing dyslipidemia after controlling for age, gender, treatment duration, CD4 counts and BMI. Moreover, individuals with the rare homozygous genotype of ABCA1 (G/G) [aOR = 10.7(1.3-88.7), p = 0.0280] and LDLR (rs6511720) G>T [aOR = 61.2(7.6-493.4), p<0.0001) were more likely to have high levels of total cholesterol levels. Our data accentuate the presence of SNPs in four candidate genes and their association with dyslipidemia among HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian population, especially variants in APOA5-rs662799 and LDLR rs6511720 respectively. These findings provide baseline information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for monitoring dyslipidemia in ART-treated HIV patients. There is a need for longitudinal studies to validate a comprehensive number of SNPs and their associations with dyslipidemia."

https://openalex.org/W3000423820,"Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency in glucocerebrosidase that can result in non-neuronal as well as neuronal symptoms. Common visceral symptoms are an increased organ size, specifically of the spleen, and glucosylceramide as well as glucosylsphingosine substrate accumulations as a direct result of the glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Neuronal symptoms include motor deficits and strong alterations in the cerebellum. To evaluate the effect of new compounds for the treatment of this devastating disease, animal models are needed that closely mimic the human phenotype. The 4L/PS-NA mouse as model of Gaucher disease is shown to present reduced glucocerebrosidase activity similar to human cases but an in-depth characterization of the model was still not performed. We therefore analyzed 4L/PS-NA mice for visceral alterations, motor deficits and also neuronal changes like glucocerebrosidase activity, substrate levels and neuroinflammation. A special focus was set at pathological changes of the cerebellum. Our results show that 4L/PS-NA mice have strongly enlarged visceral organs that are infiltrated by enlarged leukocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, animals present strong motor deficits that are accompanied by increased glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine levels in the brain, astrocytosis and activated microglia in the cortex and hippocampus as well as reduced calbindin levels in the cerebellum. The latter was directly related to a strong Purkinje cell loss. Our results thus provide a detailed characterization of the 4L/PS-NA mouse model over age showing the translational value of the model and validating its usefulness for preclinical efficiency studies to evaluate new compounds against Gaucher disease."
https://openalex.org/W3000116465,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in many patients and causes high morbidity and mortality. Because TRD subjects are particularly difficult to study especially longitudinally, biological data remain very limited. In a preliminary study to judge feasibility and power, 25 TRD patients were referred from specialty psychiatric practices. All were severely and chronically depressed and mostly had comorbid psychiatric disorders as is typical in TRD. Nine patients were able to complete all required components of the protocol that included diagnostic interview; rating scales; clinical magnetic resonance imaging; medication washout; treatment with maximally tolerated olanzapine-fluoxetine combination for 8 weeks; and pre- and post-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This drug combination is an accepted standard of treatment for TRD. Dropouts arose from worsening depression, insomnia, and anxiety. One patient remitted; three responded. A priori regions of interest included the amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC; Brodmann area BA25). Responders showed decreased metabolism with treatment in the right amygdala that correlated with clinical response; no significant changes in BA25; better response to treatment the higher the baseline BA25 metabolism; and decreased right ventromedial prefrontal metabolism (VMPFC; broader than BA25) with treatment which did not correlate with depression scores. The baseline metabolism of all individuals showed heterogeneous patterns when compared to a normative metabolic database. Although preliminary given the sample size, this study highlights several issues important for future work: marked dropout rate in this study design; need for large sample size for adequate power; baseline metabolic heterogeneity of TRD requiring careful subject characterization for future studies of interventions; relationship of amygdala activity decreases with response; and the relationship between baseline sgACC and VMPFC activity with response. Successful treatment of TRD with olanzapine-fluoxetine combination shows changes in cerebral metabolism like those seen in treatment-responsive major depression."
https://openalex.org/W2999172795,"Natural competence allows bacteria to respond to environmental and nutritional cues by taking up free DNA from their surroundings, thus gaining both nutrients and genetic information. In the Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, the genes needed for DNA uptake are induced by the CRP and Sxy transcription factors in response to lack of preferred carbon sources and nucleotide precursors. Here we show that one of these genes, HI0659, encodes the antitoxin of a competence-regulated toxin-antitoxin operon (‘toxTA’), likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a Streptococcus species. Deletion of the putative toxin (HI0660) restores uptake to the antitoxin mutant. The full toxTA operon was present in only 17 of the 181 strains we examined; complete deletion was seen in 22 strains and deletions removing parts of the toxin gene in 142 others. In addition to the expected Sxy- and CRP-dependent-competence promoter, HI0659/660 transcript analysis using RNA-seq identified an internal antitoxin-repressed promoter whose transcription starts within toxT and will yield nonfunctional protein. We propose that the most likely effect of unopposed toxin expression is non-specific cleavage of mRNAs and arrest or death of competent cells in the culture. Although the high frequency of toxT and toxTA deletions suggests that this competence-regulated toxin-antitoxin system may be mildly deleterious, it could also facilitate downregulation of protein synthesis and recycling of nucleotides under starvation conditions. Although our analyses were focused on the effects of toxTA, the RNA-seq dataset will be a useful resource for further investigations into competence regulation."

The highest number of seronegatives was in the youngest (1 year) age group (44.7%), followed by the group aged 24-49 (6.4%) and 2-11 years (6.2%). The absence of a higher percentage of children with protective anti-rubella antibodies in the group aged 2-11 can be explained by a lower immunization coverage during certain years. Participants in the group aged 24-49 were born during the pre-vaccination period with lower rubella incidence, leading to the conclusion that not all individuals of that age came into a contact with the virus. Comparing levels of anti-rubella IgG antibodies of seropositive males and females of different ages reveals that the immunity after a contact with the virus and a previously acquired infection is stronger than the immunity after the vaccination. Although the incidence rate of rubella in Vojvodina has been low for the last ten years, there is still a risk of an outbreak due to a decrease in immunization coverage. This study shows that the percentage of susceptible individuals is high, especially considering women aged 24-49, and that additional (""catch-up"") immunization is required."

Intranasal insulin administration has been suggested as a potential approach to overcoming brain insulin resistance and improving cognitive functions. Islet transplantation into the cranial subarachnoid cavity was used as an alternative route for insulin delivery into the brain. Recently, the authors showed the short-term beneficial cognitive effect of a small number of intracranially grafted islets in rats with cognitive dysfunction induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (icv-STZ). This was associated with continuous and safe insulin delivery to the rat brain. The current study investigated the long-term effect of intracranial grafting of islets on cognitive functioning in icv-STZ rats. Severe dementia, associated with obesity and cerebral amyloid-β angiopathy, was induced in Lewis inbred rats by icv-STZ. Two months after icv-STZ, one hundred syngeneic islets were transplanted into the cranial subarachnoid space. Two and six months later, cognitive alterations were assessed by Morris water-maze tests. Islet graft survival was evaluated by immunohistochemical and biochemical assays. Improvement was found in spatial learning and memory of grafted rats as opposed to the sham-operated icv-STZ rats. The grafted islets showed intact morphology, intensive expression of insulin, glucagon and glucose transporter 2. Normoglycemic obesity and cerebral amyloid-β angiopathy were found in both grafted and sham-operated icv-STZ rats. In conclusion, islet grafting into cranial subarachnoid space provides an efficient and safe approach for insulin delivery to the brain, leading to a long-term attenuation of icv-STZ-induced cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2999499490,"Given the limited evidence available, the impact of nasogastric (NG) tube placement on swallowing in children is not well understood. When a child needs to be fed enterally, the current standard is to initially place an NG tube and leave it in place for the first few months of supplemental or total enteral nutrition. It is important to understand if placement of NG tubes has a negative effect on a patient's swallow.We retrospectively reviewed the charts of those children who had videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) to identify all children who had an NG tube in place at the time of swallow study. Age and sex matched children were identified who had undergone VFSS without an NG in place. These charts were reviewed for diagnosis at the time of the VFSS and presence or absence of aspiration or laryngeal penetrations.Sixty-three children with NG tubes were identified, along with 63 age and sex matched children without NG tubes in place, at the time of VFSS. Ages ranged from 7 days to 13 years. The NG group had a significantly higher proportion demonstrating aspiration (46% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.0089).This study supports the need for further prospective evaluation of NG tubes and their effect on swallow, as well as more careful consideration of prolonged NG tube placement in patients with feeding problems. Consideration should be given to removal of the NG prior to VFSS to prevent the impact of NG placement on results of the swallow study which could lead to inappropriate modifications to the patient's care plan."

Although microvascular ultrastructure of TT patients' skin is well-documented, little is known about functional aspects of their microcirculation. We aimed, for the first time, to evaluate, in vivo, the microcirculation of TT cutaneous lesions. Seven TT patients, males, under treatment were included in the study. The spectral analysis of frequency components of flowmotion (endothelial, sympathetic, myogenic, cardiac and respiratory) was performed using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Endothelial dependent and independent vasodilatations were assessed by LDF associated to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) iontophoresis, respectively. Vessel density (VD), perfused vessel density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV%), microvascular flow index (MFI) and flow heterogeneity index (FHI), reflecting tissue perfusion and oxygenation, were evaluated through sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging. All microvascular analysis were performed in TT lesions and in healthy skin in the contralateral limb of the same patient, used as control skin. VD, PVD and PPV% and MFI were significantly lower in the cutaneous lesion compared to contralateral healthy skin. The contribution of different frequency components of flowmotion, endothelial dependent and independent vasodilatations and FHI were not statistically different between control skin and cutaneous lesion. Our results suggest that TT cutaneous lesions have a significant impairment of tissue perfusion, which may aggravate peripheral nerve degeneration caused by Mycobacterium leprae infection."
https://openalex.org/W2999941394,"Phospholipid N-methyltransferases (PLMTs) synthesize phosphatidylcholine by methylating phosphatidylethanolamine using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. Eukaryotic PLMTs are integral membrane enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently Opi3, a PLMT of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was proposed to perform in trans catalysis, i.e. while localized in the ER, Opi3 would methylate lipid substrates located in the plasma membrane at membrane contact sites. Here, we tested whether the Opi3 active site is located at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, which is a prerequisite for in trans catalysis. The membrane topology of Opi3 (and its human counterpart, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, expressed in yeast) was addressed by topology prediction algorithms and by the substituted cysteine accessibility method. The results of these analyses indicated that Opi3 (as well as phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) has an N-out C-in topology and contains four transmembrane domains, with the fourth forming a re-entrant loop. On the basis of the sequence conservation between the C-terminal half of Opi3 and isoprenyl cysteine carboxyl methyltransferases with a solved crystal structure, we identified amino acids critical for Opi3 activity by site-directed mutagenesis. Modeling of the structure of the C-terminal part of Opi3 was consistent with the topology obtained by the substituted cysteine accessibility method and revealed that the active site faces the cytosol. In conclusion, the location of the Opi3 active site identified here is consistent with the proposed mechanism of in trans catalysis, as well as with conventional catalysis in cis."
https://openalex.org/W2998862830,"Homeotic selector (HOX) transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression that determines the identity of Drosophila segments along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. The current challenge with HOX proteins is understanding how they achieve their functional specificity while sharing a highly conserved homeodomain (HD) that recognize the same DNA binding sites. One mechanism proposed to regulate HOX activity is differential post-translational modification (PTM). As a first step in investigating this hypothesis, the sites of PTM on a Sex combs reduced protein fused to a triple tag (SCRTT) extracted from developing embryos were identified by Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). The PTMs identified include phosphorylation at S185, S201, T315, S316, T317 and T324, acetylation at K218, S223, S227, K309, K434 and K439, formylation at K218, K309, K325, K341, K369, K434 and K439, methylation at S19, S166, K168 and T364, carboxylation at D108, K298, W307, K309, E323, K325 and K369, and hydroxylation at P22, Y87, P107, D108, D111, P269, P306, R310, N321, K325, Y334, R366, P392 and Y398. Of the 44 modifications, 18 map to functionally important regions of SCR. Besides a highly conserved DNA-binding HD, HOX proteins also have functionally important, evolutionarily conserved small motifs, which may be Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs). SLiMs are proposed to be preferential sites of phosphorylation. Although 6 of 7 phosphosites map to regions of predicted SLiMs, we find no support for the hypothesis that the individual S, T and Y residues of predicted SLiMs are phosphorylated more frequently than S, T and Y residues outside of predicted SLiMs."
