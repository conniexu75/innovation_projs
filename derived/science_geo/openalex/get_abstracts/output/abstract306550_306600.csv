This result establishes with certainty the botanical origin of this compound and substantiates the supposition that it is this species which furnishes the active constituent in certain types of curare. The extract from this plant furthermore yielded two new tertiary alkaloids which could be converted into physiologically active quaternary bases. Methylation of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the quaternary bases resulted in a 3-9-fold increase in physiological potency."

https://openalex.org/W2050929976,"Superphenix, France's seemingly jinxed fast breeder reactor, which has not produced a single kilowatt of energy in more than 3 years, looks set to rise up next year like the mythical bird it is named after. The $5 billion reactor, the largest fast breeder in the world, has just been given the seal of approval by a public commission ordered by the government to look at the pros and cons of restarting. It still has hoops to jump through: a safety check and approval from the ministries of industries and environment. But the consortium of French, Italian, and German power utilities that run the plant are confident they can get it running by next summer. The Superphenix that rises out of the ashes will, however, be a different species of bird from the one planned 20 years ago. The consortium plans to turn the reactor into a debreeder, one that will incinerate more plutonium than it produces and so eat into Europe's plutonium stockpile. Calculations by Superphenix staff and the Atomic Energy Commission indicate that a plutonivorous fast breeder could incinerate 15 to 25 kilograms of plutonium while producing 1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity-scarcely enough to make a dent inmore » the tonnes of plutonium produced by Electricite de France's reactors each year. The Superphenix consortium is anxious to get the reactor back on line. The annual cost of upkeep and repair of the idle plant and salaries for its 700 staff may reach $140 million this year, 20% more than if the plant was running normally. If restarted, the existing core and a second one ready on the shelf will generate electricity worth $1.3 billion.« less"

https://openalex.org/W4230248875,"In the article "" Evidence found for a possible ' aggression gene' "" by Virginia Morell (Research News, 18 June, p. 1722), the collaborative teams of Peter Seeburg at the University of Heidelberg, Germany; Jean Shih at the University of Southern California; and Creed W. Abell at the University of Texas, Austin, should also have been credited with cloning the human monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B genes. Seeburg and his colleagues published their research in the July 1988 issue of the Proceedigs of the Nationl Acaderny of Sciences. Xandra Breakefield and her colleagues reported their cloning of the MAO A gene in the October 1988 issue of the Joumal of Neurochemistry. Although Breakefield's group also cloned the MAO B gene, they did not publish this research."
