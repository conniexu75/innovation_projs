https://openalex.org/W3207993568,"This paper focuses on the application of deep learning (DL) in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The novelty of this work is in the introduction of optimized InceptionResNetV2 for COVID-19 (CO-IRv2) method. A part of the CO-IRv2 scheme is derived from the concepts of InceptionNet and ResNet with hyperparameter tuning, while the remaining part is a new architecture consisting of a global average pooling layer, batch normalization, dense layers, and dropout layers. The proposed CO-IRv2 is applied to a new dataset of 2481 computed tomography (CT) images formed by collecting two independent datasets. Data resizing and normalization are performed, and the evaluation is run up to 25 epochs. Various performance metrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve are used as performance metrics. The effectiveness of three optimizers known as Adam, Nadam and RMSProp are evaluated in classifying suspected COVID-19 patients and normal people. Results show that for CO-IRv2 and for CT images, the obtained accuracies of Adam, Nadam and RMSProp optimizers are 94.97%, 96.18% and 96.18%, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown here that for the case of CT images, CO-IRv2 with Nadam optimizer has better performance than existing DL algorithms in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Finally, CO-IRv2 is applied to an X-ray dataset of 1662 images resulting in a classification accuracy of 99.40%."
https://openalex.org/W3209919317,"Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines a well-established approach from transportation modelling that uses person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of different room sizes, air exchange rates, disease import, changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), masks, indoors vs. outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. It is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. It predicts the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, masks, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall, and is thus able to quantitatively predict the consequences of interventions. It is shown that these effects are best given as additive changes of the reproduction number R. The model also explains why contact reductions have decreasing marginal returns, i.e. the first 50% of contact reductions have considerably more effect than the second 50%. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, or consequences of wearing masks in certain situations. The results can be used to inform political decisions."

We studied how localized odor cues are recognized as landmarks by recording the activity of neurons in CA1 during a virtual navigation task. We found that odor cues enriched place cell representations, dramatically improving navigation. Presentation of the same odor at different locations generated distinct place cell representations. An odor cue at a proximal location enhanced the local place cell density and also led to the formation of place cells beyond the cue. This resulted in the recognition of a second, more distal odor cue as a distinct landmark, suggesting an iterative mechanism for extending spatial representations into unknown territory. Our results establish that odors can serve as landmarks, motivating a model in which path integration and odor landmarks interact sequentially and iteratively to generate cognitive spatial maps over long distances."
https://openalex.org/W3211250349,"As safe and effective vaccines become widely available, attaining herd immunity and limiting the spread of COVID-19 will depend on individuals choosing to vaccinate-and doing so quickly enough to outpace mutations. Using online surveys conducted across six Latin American countries in January 2021, we experimentally assess messages designed to counteract informational deficiencies and collective action problems that may drive hesitancy. We first find that basic vaccine information persuades around 8% of hesitant individuals to become willing to vaccinate, reduces intended wait to vaccinate by 0.4 months, and increases willingness to encourage others to vaccinate. Rather than facilitating free riding, learning, or social conformity, additional information about others' behavior increases vaccine acceptance when respondents expect herd immunity will be achieved. Finally, priming the social approval benefits of vaccinating also increases vaccine acceptance. These results suggest that providing information and shaping social expectations and incentives could both significantly increase vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3209017784,"In April 2020, the United Nations predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a 'calamitous' impact on the lives of women. This was based on concerns about an upsurge in Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) arising from increased opportunities for relational conflict due to forced co-existence and therefore additional time spent with abusive partners.Research has shown an increase in IPV during times of crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated unprecedented circumstances and stress, and opportunities to do research to understand whether the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on IPV experiences were limited. Thus, the present study aimed to understand women's experiences of being in and leaving an abusive relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic.Individual, telephonic interviews were conducted with 16 women living in domestic violence shelters within three Provinces during South Africa's lockdown period.Findings reveal that the public health measures implemented by the South African Government to curb the spread of the virus, may have placed vulnerable groups at increased risk of violence. Specifically, lockdown likely magnified the risk for escalation of abuse in families already experiencing IPV prior to COVID-19. The study highlights an IPV and COVID-19 relationship, showing that the gender insensitive pandemic control measures, such as stay at home orders and travel restrictions, likely placed women at risk of increased abuse. Given the recurrency of COVID-19 epidemic waves, attention must be given to gender disparities or many South African women may experience worse outcomes.This study reminds us that being ordered to stay at home is not always the safest option for women and thus, in a country with one of the highest levels of GBV, it becomes imperative to ensure that IPV safeguards are integrated into COVID-19 measures. It also becomes evident that COVID-19 requires enhanced ways of responding by paying attention to gender disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3210163542,"The coexistence of undernutrition and obesity is an emerging problem for developing countries like Bangladesh. Anemia is another critical public health threat, prevalent predominantly among women and children. Undernutrition is linked with a higher risk of anemia, and lower dietary iron intake might be the possible reason. However, the risk of anemia among obese/overweight individuals is controversial. The study explores the relation of BMI with anemia and blood hemoglobin level among women and children in Bangladesh.Multiple statistical approaches were employed to nationally representative secondary data (BDHS 2011) on women (n = 5680) age 15-49 years and children (n = 2373) age 6-59 months to illuminate the relation between BMI and anemia. BMI was categorized according to the WHO recommended BMI category for Asian people. Descriptive statistics were used to measure mean hemoglobin level. Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, Two-way ANOVA, binary, ordinal, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression were used to study the association of BMI with anemia and hemoglobin level.Chi-square test reveals significant association, though not intense, among BMI and anemia categories of women (15-49 years) (χ2 ≥99, p<2.2e-16 and Cramér's V = 0.0799-0.1357). From ANOVA analysis, a significant difference in blood hemoglobin level was found among women (total sample and nonpregnant) with different BMI categories (p≤0.05). Binary (Severely Underweight: OR 1.2680, 95% CI 0.755-2.161; Obese: OR 0.4038, 95% CI 0.120-1.177), Ordinal logistic regression (Severely Underweight: OR 1.337, 95% CI 0.842-2.115; Obese: OR 0.504, 95% CI 0.153-1.411) and restricted cubic spline regression (Severely Underweight: OR >1.5; Obese: OR ~0.5) reveal that the risk of anemia was higher among underweight and lower among obese/overweight women compared to normal women. Lower anemia risk among richest women indicates probable higher dietary iron intake among obese/overweight women.In the current study, women with overweight/obesity from Bangladesh were shown to have lower likelihood of being anemic, while underweight women more likely to be anemic. However, no relation between BMI and anemia was found among children."
https://openalex.org/W3210844847,"Background E-learning is a relatively trending system of education that has been placed over conventional campus-based learning worldwide, especially since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess e-learning readiness among university students of a developing country like Bangladesh and identify the independent predictors of e-learning readiness. Methods From 26 December 2020 to 11 January 2021, a total of 1162 university students who had enrolled for e-learning completed a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were collected online via “Google Form” following the principles of snowball sampling through available social media platforms in Bangladesh. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to investigate the association of e-learning readiness with perceived e-learning stress and other independent predictor variables. Results A total of 1162 university students participated in this study. The results indicated that with the increase of students’ perceived e-learning stress score, the average e-learning readiness score was significantly decreased (β = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.20). The students did not seem ready, and none of the e-learning readiness scale items reached the highest mean score (5.0). The age, gender, divisional residence, preference of students and their parents, devices used, and having any eye problems were significantly associated with the students’ e-learning readiness. Conclusion During the prolonged period of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning implication strategies are needed to be assessed systematically with the level of readiness and its’ impacts among students for the continuation of sound e-learning systems. The study findings recommend evaluating the e-learning readiness of university students and the mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 catastrophe in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3208422419,"The complex cellular milieu can spontaneously demix, or phase separate, in a process controlled in part by intrinsically disordered (ID) proteins. A protein's propensity to phase separate is thought to be driven by a preference for protein–protein over protein–solvent interactions. The hydrodynamic size of monomeric proteins, as quantified by the polymer scaling exponent (<i>v</i>), is driven by a similar balance. We hypothesized that mean <i>v</i>, as predicted by protein sequence, would be smaller for proteins with a strong propensity to phase separate. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed protein databases containing subsets of proteins that are folded, disordered, or disordered and known to spontaneously phase separate. We find that the phase-separating disordered proteins, on average, had lower calculated values of <i>v</i> compared with their non-phase-separating counterparts. Moreover, these proteins had a higher sequence-predicted propensity for β-turns. Using a simple, surface area-based model, we propose a physical mechanism for this difference: transient β-turn structures reduce the desolvation penalty of forming a protein-rich phase and increase exposure of atoms involved in π/sp<sup>2</sup> valence electron interactions. By this mechanism, β-turns could act as energetically favored nucleation points, which may explain the increased propensity for turns in ID regions (IDRs) utilized biologically for phase separation. Phase-separating IDRs, non-phase-separating IDRs, and folded regions could be distinguished by combining <i>v</i> and β-turn propensity. Finally, we propose a new algorithm, ParSe (partition sequence), for predicting phase-separating protein regions, and which is able to accurately identify folded, disordered, and phase-separating protein regions based on the primary sequence."
https://openalex.org/W3209978310,"Productivity growth in smallholder agriculture is an important driver of rural economic development and poverty reduction. However, smallholder farmers often have limited access to information, which can be a serious constraint for increasing productivity. One potential mechanism to reduce information constraints is the public agricultural extension service, but its effectiveness has often been low in the past. Digital technologies could enhance the effectiveness of extension by reducing outreach costs and helping to better tailor the information to farmers' individual needs and conditions. Using primary data from India, this study analyses the association between digital extension services and smallholder agricultural performance. The digital extension services that some of the farmers use provide personalized information on the types of crops to grow, the types and quantities of inputs to use, and other methods of cultivation. Problems of selection bias in the impact evaluation are reduced through propensity score matching (PSM) combined with estimates of farmers' willingness to pay for digital extension. Results show that use of personalized digital extension services is positively and significantly associated with input intensity, production diversity, crop productivity, and crop income."
https://openalex.org/W3210379058,"An unresolved issue in social perception concerns the effect of perceived ethnicity on speech processing. Bias-based accounts assume conscious misunderstanding of native speech in the case of a speaker classification as nonnative, resulting in negative ratings and poorer comprehension. In contrast, exemplar models of socially indexed speech perception suggest that such negative effects arise only when a contextual cue to the social identity is misleading, i.e. when ethnicity and speech clash with listeners' expectations. To address these accounts, and to assess ethnicity effects across different age groups, three non-university populations (N = 172) were primed with photographs of Asian and white European women and asked to repeat and rate utterances spoken in three accents (Korean-accented German, a regional German accent, standard German), all embedded in background noise. In line with exemplar models, repetition accuracy increased when the expected and perceived speech matched, but the effect was limited to the foreign accent, and-at the group level-to teens and older adults. In contrast, Asian speakers received the most negative accent ratings across all accents, consistent with a bias-based view, but group distinctions again came into play here, with the effect most pronounced in older adults, and limited to standard German for teens. Importantly, the effects varied across ages, with younger adults showing no effects of ethnicity in either task. The findings suggest that theoretical contradictions are a consequence of methodological choices, which reflect distinct aspects of social information processing."
https://openalex.org/W3209083285,"Flowering and fruit set are important traits affecting fruit quality and yield in rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei). Intense efforts have been made to elucidate the influence of vernalization and phytohormones on flowering, but the molecular mechanisms of flowering and fruit set remain unclear. To unravel these mechanisms, we performed transcriptome analysis to explore blueberry transcripts from flowering to early fruit stage. We divided flowering and fruit set into flower bud (S2), initial flower (S3), bloom flower (S4), pad fruit (S5), and cup fruit (S6) based on phenotype and identified 1,344, 69, 658, and 189 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in comparisons of S3/S2, S4/S3, S5/S4, and S6/S5, respectively. There were obviously more DEGs in S3/S2 and S5/S4 than in S4/S3, and S6/S5, suggesting that S3/S2 and S5/S4 represent major transitions from buds to fruit in blueberry. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated these DEGs were mostly enriched in phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling, transporter proteins, photosynthesis, anthocyanins biosynthesis, disease resistance protein and transcription factor categories, in addition, transcript levels of phytohormones and transporters changed greatly throughout the flowering and fruit set process. Gibberellic acid and jasmonic acid mainly acted on the early stage of flowering development like expression of the florigen gene FT, while the expression of auxin response factor genes increased almost throughout the process from bud to fruit development. Transporter proteins were mainly associated with minerals during the early flowering development stage and sugars during the early fruit stage. At the early fruit stage, anthocyanins started to accumulate, and the fruit was susceptible to diseases such as fungal infection. Expression of the transcription factor MYB86 was up-regulated during initial fruit development, which may promote anthocyanin accumulation. These results will aid future studies exploring the molecular mechanism underlying flowering and fruit set of rabbiteye blueberry."
https://openalex.org/W3209794115,"This study aimed to identify the 15-year trends of handgrip strength-to-weight (relative HS) and assess the association between relative HS and hypertension among Chinese adults aged 20-69.Using a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling, we analyzed data collected from 712,442 adults aged 20-69 years in four successive national surveys (2000-2014). We used a handheld dynamometer to measure strength and divided by body weight to calculate the relative HS. Blood pressure was recorded with a sphygmomanometer and hypertension was defined as resting systolic blood pressure at least 140 mmHg or diastolic at least 90 mmHg. The Mann-Kendall trend test examined trends in relative HS over time. We also computed odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) by tertile of relative HS and examined the association between relative HS and hypertension.The relative HS level decreased with the increase of age in both male and females (p trend <0.001). In each of four surveys, one interquartile decrease in relative HS was associated with an increased risk of hypertension by 44% (OR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.40-1.47), 58% (OR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.54-1.62), 48% (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.45-1.52), 43% (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.40-1.47), respectively.In the Chinese adult population, the relative HS level decreased from 2000 to 2014 across all ages in both males and females. A lower relative HS was associated with a higher risk of hypertension. The findings provided evidence for the association between muscle strength and hypertension in large-scaled population."
https://openalex.org/W3209812998,"Patients with adult spinal deformity have various standing postures. Although several studies have reported a relationship between sagittal alignment and exacerbation of hip osteoarthritis, information is limited regarding how spinopelvic sagittal alignment changes affect hip joint loading. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sagittal spinopelvic-lower limb alignment and the hip joint contact force (HCF) using a novel musculoskeletal model. We enrolled 20 women (78.3±6.7 years) from a single institution. Standing lateral radiographs were acquired to measure thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, the pelvic tilt, sacral slope, sagittal vertical axis (SVA), femur obliquity angle, and knee flexion angle. In the model simulation, the Anybody Modeling System was used, which alters muscle pathways using magnetic resonance imaging data. Each patient's alignment was entered into the model; the HCF and hip moment in the standing posture were calculated using inverse dynamics analysis. The relationship between the HCF and each parameter was examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient (r). The patients were divided into low SVA and high SVA groups, with a cutoff value of 50 mm for the SVA. The HCF was 168.2±60.1 N (%BW) and positively correlated with the SVA (r = 0.6343, p<0.01) and femur obliquity angle (r = 0.4670, p = 0.03). The HCF were 122.2 and 214.1 N (75.2% difference) in the low SVA and high SVA groups, respectively (p<0.01). The flexion moment was also increased in the high SVA group compared with that in the low SVA group (p = 0.03). The SVA and femur obliquity angle are factors related to the HCF, suggesting an association between adult spinal deformity and the exacerbation of hip osteoarthritis. Future studies will need to assess the relationship between the hip joint load and sagittal spinopelvic parameters in dynamic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3210356062,"Legumains, also known as asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs), cleave peptide bonds after Asn/Asp (Asx) residues. In plants, certain legumains also have ligase activity that catalyzes biosynthesis of Asx-containing cyclic peptides. An example is the biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II, a squash family-derived cyclic trypsin inhibitor, which involves splicing to remove the N-terminal prodomain and then N-to-C-terminal cyclization of the mature domain. To identify plant legumains responsible for the maturation of these cyclic peptides, we have isolated and characterized a legumain involved in splicing, McPAL1, from Momordica cochinchinensis (Cucurbitaceae) seeds. Functional studies show that recombinantly expressed McPAL1 displays a pH-dependent, trimodal enzymatic profile. At pH 4 to 6, McPAL1 selectively catalyzed Asp-ligation and Asn-cleavage, but at pH 6.5 to 8, Asn-ligation predominated. With peptide substrates containing N-terminal Asn and C-terminal Asp, such as is found in precursors of MCoTI-I/II, McPAL1 mediates proteolysis at the Asn site and then ligation at the Asp site at pH 5 to 6. Also, McPAL1 is an unusually stable legumain that is tolerant of heat and high pH. Together, our results support that McPAL1 is a splicing legumain at acidic pH that can mediate biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II. We purport that the high thermal and pH stability of McPAL1 could have applications for protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3210715963,"Milgram's classical studies famously suggested a widespread willingness to obey authority, even to the point of inflicting harm. Important situational factors supporting obedience, such as proximity with the victim, have been established. Relatively little work has focused on how coercion affects individual cognition, or on identifying the cognitive factors that underlie inter-individual differences in the tendency to yield to coercion. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the neural systems associated with changes in volitional processes associated with sense of agency and sense of responsibility under coercion. Participants either freely chose, or were instructed by the experimenter, to give mildly painful electric shocks to another participant, or to refrain from doing so. We have previously shown that coercion reduces temporal binding, which has been proposed as an implicit proxy measure of sense of agency. We tested how reduced agency under coercion related to differences in neural activity between free choice and coercion. In contrast to previous studies and to participants performing the task outside the MRI scanner, on average there was no effect of coercion on agency for participants in the scanner. However, greater activity in the medial frontal gyrus was reliably associated with greater agency under coercion. A similar association was found using explicit responsibility ratings. Our findings suggest that medial frontal processes, perhaps related to volition during action planning and execution, may help to preserve a sense of accountability under coercion. Further, participants who administered more shocks under free choice showed reduced activity during free choice trials in brain areas associated with social cognition. Possibly, this might reflect participants cognitively distancing themselves from the recipient of the shocks under free choice, whereas this was not observed under coercion."

We estimated the incidence and examined the risk factors and outcomes using univariate and multivariate analysis.SGA and LGA incidence rates were 6.0% and 15.6%, respectively. In-hospital mortality among SGA and LGA infants was 2.5% and 0.3%, respectively, while for NICU admission or death in labor room and operation theatre was 28.9% and 14.9% respectively. Preterm babies were more likely to be born SGA (aRR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.45-3.57) but male infants (aRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.4-0.81), those born to parous (aRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93), or overweight (aRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.97) mothers were less likely to be born SGA. On the other hand, males (aRR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.49-2.19), infants born to parous mothers (aRR 2.16; 95% CI, 1.63-2.82), or to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (aRR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66), or pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (aRR 2.58; 95% CI, 1.8-3.47) were significantly more likely to be LGA. SGA infants were at high risk of in-hospital mortality (aRR, 226.56; 95% CI, 3.47-318.22), neonatal intensive care unit admission or death in labor room or operation theatre (aRR, 2.14 (1.36-3.22).Monitoring should be coordinated to alleviate the risks of inappropriate fetal growth and the associated adverse consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3210752528,"Pharmaceuticals wastes are drugs and medicines that can no longer be used. The improper disposal of unused medicines is a growing problem throughout the world. This study assessed the pharmaceutical wastage rate and pharmaceutical waste management for the year 2015 to 2017 in the public health facility of Dessie, Ethiopia.A cross-section study design was used to review logistic data retrospectively from health commodity management information systems and manual records in 8 health facilities. Health professionals' (135) pharmaceutical waste management practices were assessed using the world health organization waste management checklist. Descriptive and inferential statistics were made using a statistical package for social sciences version 20.Supplies were the leading class of pharmaceuticals with an overall wastage rate of 37.1%. Tablet and injectable constituted the highest class of pharmaceuticals dosage form with the overall wastage rate of 20.78% and 16.49%. The overall pharmaceutical wastage rate was 3.68% amounting to USD 159,762.66 and expiry (92.05%) was the major reason for wastage. The pharmaceutical wastage rate of health centers was nearly twofold higher than hospitals. Pharmaceutical waste management was practiced by 105 (77%; 95% CI; 69.9%, 84.9%) health professionals. Determinants of pharmaceutical waste management were being male (P value = 0.08, AOR = 3.72), receiving training (P value = 0.01, AOR = 4.34), writing label (P value = 0.02, AOR = 5.04), storage of segregated waste in dispensing unit (P value = 0.01, AOR = 0.72) and the presence of disposal plan (P value = 0.002, AOR = 16.93).Supplies and tablets constituted the highest wastage class of pharmaceuticals and dosage form. The pharmaceutical wastage rate was higher than the standard and increasing in successive years. Pharmaceutical waste management was not fully practiced. Appropriate inventory control and waste management are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3208945961,"Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is a pathovar linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), especially Crohn’s disease, and colorectal cancer. AIEC are genetically diverse, and in the absence of a universal molecular signature, are defined by in vitro functional attributes. The relative ability of difference AIEC strains to colonize, persist, and induce inflammation in an IBD-susceptible host is unresolved. To evaluate strain-level variation among tissue-associated E . coli in the intestines, we develop a long-read sequencing approach to identify AIEC by strain that excludes host DNA. We use this approach to distinguish genetically similar strains and assess their fitness in colonizing the intestine. Here we have assembled complete genomes using long-read nanopore sequencing for a model AIEC strain, NC101, and seven strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa of Crohn’s disease and non-Crohn’s tissues. We show these strains can colonize the intestine of IBD susceptible mice and induce inflammatory cytokines from cultured macrophages. We demonstrate that these strains can be quantified and distinguished in the presence of 99.5% mammalian DNA and from within a fecal population. Analysis of global genomic structure and specific sequence variation within the ribosomal RNA operon provides a framework for efficiently tracking strain-level variation of closely-related E . coli and likely other commensal/pathogenic bacteria impacting intestinal inflammation in experimental settings and IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3209039569,"Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial ulcerative disease affecting marine fish and represents a major threat to aquaculture worldwide. Its aetiological agents, bacteria belonging to the genus Tenacibaculum, have been present in Norway since at least the late 1980's and lead to regular ulcerative outbreaks and high mortalities in production of farmed salmonids. Studies have shown the presence of several Tenacibaculum species in Norway and a lack of clonality in outbreak-related strains, thus preventing the development of an effective vaccine. Hence, a thorough examination of the bacterial diversity in farmed fish presenting ulcers and the geographical distribution of the pathogens should provide important insights needed to strengthen preventive actions. In this study, we investigated the diversity of Tenacibaculum strains isolated in 28 outbreaks that occurred in Norwegian fish farms in the period 2017-2020. We found that 95% of the 66 strains isolated and characterized, using an existing MultiLocus Sequence Typing system, have not previously been identified, confirming the high diversity of this genus of bacteria in Norway. Several of these Tenacibaculum species seem to be present within restricted areas (e.g., Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi in western Norway), but phylogenetic analysis reveals that several of the strains responsible of ulcerative outbreaks were isolated from different localities (e.g., ST- 172 isolated from northern to southern parts of Norway) and/or from different hosts. Understanding their reservoirs and transmission pathways could help to address major challenges in connection with prophylactic measures and development of vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3209587293,"Facial skin coloration signals information about an individual and plays an important role in social interactions and mate choice, due its putative association with health, attractiveness, and age. Whether skin coloration as an evolutionary significant cue is universal or specific to a particular culture is unclear and current evidence on the universality of skin color as a cue to health and attractiveness are equivocal. The current study used 80 calibrated, high-resolution, non-manipulated images of real human faces, either of Chinese or western European descent, which were rated in terms of attractiveness, healthiness, and perceived age by 44 observers, 22 western European (13 male; mean age ± SD = 24.27 ± 5.30) and 22 Chinese (7 male; mean age ± SD = 26.05 ± 3.96) observers. To elucidate the associations between skin coloration and these perceptual ratings and whether these associations are modulated by observer or image ethnicity, a linear mixed-effect model was setup with skin lightness (L*; CIELAB), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*), observer and image ethnicity as independent variables and perceived attractiveness, healthiness, and estimated age as dependent variables. We found robust positive associations between facial skin lightness (L*) and attractiveness, healthiness, and youthfulness, but only when Chinese observers judge facial images of their own ethnicity. Observers of European descent, on the other hand, associated an increase in yellowness(b*) with greater attractiveness and healthiness in Chinese facial images. We find no evidence that facial redness is positively associated with these attributes; instead, an increase in redness (a*) is associated with an increase in the estimated age of European facial images. We conclude that observers of both ethnicities make use of skin color and lightness to rate attractiveness, healthiness, and perceived age, but to a lesser degree than previously thought. Furthermore, these coloration cues are not universal and are utilized differently within the Chinese and western European ethnic groups. Our study adds to the growing body of work demonstrating the importance of skin color manipulations within an evolutionary meaningful parameter space, ideally using realistic skin models based on physical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3211310257,"The advent of genome editing tools like CRISPR/Cas has substantially increased the number of genetically engineered mouse models in recent years. In support of refinement and reduction, sperm cryopreservation is advantageous compared to embryo freezing for archiving and distribution of such mouse models. The in vitro fertilization using cryopreserved sperm from the most widely used C57BL/6 strain has become highly efficient in recent years due to several improvements of the procedure. However, purchase of the necessary media for routine application of the current protocol poses a constant burden on budgetary constraints. In-house media preparation, instead, is complex and requires quality control of each batch. Here, we describe a cost-effective and easily adaptable approach for in vitro fertilization using cryopreserved C57BL/6 sperm. This is mainly achieved by modification of an affordable commercial fertilization medium and a step-by-step description of all other necessary reagents. Large-scale comparison of fertilization rates from independent lines of genetically engineered C57BL/6 mice upon cryopreservation and in vitro fertilization with our approach demonstrated equal or significantly superior fertilization rates to current protocols. Our novel SEcuRe (Simple Economical set-up for Rederivation) method provides an affordable, easily adaptable and harmonized protocol for highly efficient rederivation using cryopreserved C57BL/6 sperm for a broad application of colony management in the sense of the 3Rs."
https://openalex.org/W3208979000,"Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful algorithm to determine biased pathways between groups based on expression profiling. However, for fruit fly, a popular animal model, gene matrixes for GSEA are unavailable. This study provides the pathway-targeting gene matrixes based on Reactome and KEGG database for fruit fly. An expression profiling containing neurons or glia of fruit fly was used to validate the feasibility of the generated gene matrixes. We validated the gene matrixes and identified characteristic neuronal and glial pathways, including mRNA splicing and endocytosis. In conclusion, we generated and validated the feasibility of Reactome and KEGG gene matrix files, which may benefit future profiling studies using Drosophila."

In this prospective cohort study, a total of 2,943 VLBW infants from the Korean Neonatal Network between 2013 and 2015 finished follow-up at FU1. Growth failure was defined as a z-score below -1.28. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors for growth failure after dividing the infants into small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) groups. Overall, 18.7% of infants were SGA at birth. Growth failure was present in 60.0% at discharge, 20.3% at FU1, and 35.2% at FU2. Among AGA infants, male sex, growth failure at discharge, periventricular leukomalacia, treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, ventriculoperitoneal shunt status and treatment of rehabilitation after discharge were independent risk factors for growth failure at FU1. Among SGA infants, lower birth weight, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and treatment of rehabilitation after discharge were independent risk factors for growth failure at FU1. Mean weight z-score graphs from birth to 36 month of age revealed significant differences between SGA and non-SGA and between VLBW infants and extremely low birth weight infants. Growth failure remains an issue, and VLBW infants with risk factors should be closely checked for growth and nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3208117965,"Leaf morphology exhibits tremendous diversity between and within species, and is likely related to adaptation to environmental factors. Most poplar species are of great economic and ecological values and their leaf morphology can be a good predictor for wood productivity and environment adaptation. It is important to understand the genetic mechanism behind variation in leaf shape. Although some initial efforts have been made to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for poplar leaf traits, more effort needs to be expended to unravel the polygenic architecture of the complex traits of leaf shape. Here, we performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of poplar leaf shape traits in a randomized complete block design with clones from F1 hybrids of Populus deltoides and Populus simonii. A total of 35 SNPs were identified as significantly associated with the multiple traits of a moderate number of regular polar radii between the leaf centroid and its edge points, which could represent the leaf shape, based on a multivariate linear mixed model. In contrast, the univariate linear mixed model was applied as single leaf traits for GWAS, leading to genomic inflation; thus, no significant SNPs were detected for leaf length, measures of leaf width, leaf area, or the ratio of leaf length to leaf width under genomic control. Investigation of the candidate genes showed that most flanking regions of the significant leaf shape-associated SNPs harbored genes that were related to leaf growth and development and to the regulation of leaf morphology. The combined use of the traditional experimental design and the multivariate linear mixed model could greatly improve the power in GWAS because the multiple trait data from a large number of individuals with replicates of clones were incorporated into the statistical model. The results of this study will enhance the understanding of the genetic mechanism of leaf shape variation in Populus. In addition, a moderate number of regular leaf polar radii can largely represent the leaf shape and can be used for GWAS of such a complicated trait in Populus, instead of the higher-dimensional regular radius data that were previously considered to well represent leaf shape."
https://openalex.org/W3210896845,"The coastal zone provides foraging opportunities for insular populations of terrestrial mammals, allowing for expanded habitat use, increased dietary breadth, and locally higher population densities. We examined the use of sandy beach resources by the threatened island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on the California Channel Islands using scat analysis, surveys of potential prey, beach habitat attributes, and stable isotope analysis. Consumption of beach invertebrates, primarily intertidal talitrid amphipods (Megalorchestia spp.) by island fox varied with abundance of these prey across sites. Distance-based linear modeling revealed that abundance of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack, rather than beach physical attributes, explained the largest amount of variation in talitrid amphipod abundance and biomass across beaches. δ13C and δ15N values of fox whisker (vibrissae) segments suggested individualism in diet, with generally low δ13C and δ15N values of some foxes consistent with specializing on primarily terrestrial foods, contrasting with the higher isotope values of other individuals that suggested a sustained use of sandy beach resources, the importance of which varied over time. Abundant allochthonous marine resources on beaches, including inputs of giant kelp, may expand habitat use and diet breadth of the island fox, increasing population resilience during declines in terrestrial resources associated with climate variability and long-term climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3211316411,"We sought to identify plasma biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB, delivery within 21 days of sampling) in women with preterm labor (PTL) without intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) using label-free quantitative proteomic analysis, as well as to elucidate specific protein pathways involved in these cases.This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 104 singleton pregnant women with PTL (24-32 weeks) who underwent amniocentesis and demonstrated no evidence of IAI. Analysis of pooled plasma samples collected from SPTB cases and term birth (TB) controls (n = 10 for each group) was performed using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry for proteome profiling in a nested case-control study design. Eight candidate proteins of interest were validated by ELISA-based assay and a clot-based assay in the total cohort.Ninety-one proteins were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in plasma samples obtained from SPTB cases, of which 53 (58.2%) were upregulated and 38 (41.8%) were downregulated when compared to TD controls. A validation study confirmed that plasma from women who delivered spontaneously within 21 days of sampling contained significantly higher levels of coagulation factor Ⅴ and lower levels of S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), especially the former which was independent of baseline variables. The top-ranked pathways related to the 91 differentially expressed proteins were liver-X-receptor/retinoid X receptor (RXR) activation, acute phase response signaling, farnesoid X receptor/RXR activation, coagulation system, and complement system.Proteomic analyses in this study identified potential novel biomarkers (i.e., coagulation factor V and S100A9) and potential protein pathways in plasma associated with SPTB in the absence of IAI in women with PTL. The present findings provide novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic targets specific for idiopathic SPTB."
https://openalex.org/W3208283055,"Background Delays in care have been recognized as a significant contributor to maternal mortality in low-resource settings. The non-pneumatic antishock garment is a low-cost first-aid device that can help women with obstetric haemorrhage survive these delays without long-term adverse effects. Extending professionals skills and the establishment of new technologies in basic healthcare facilities could harvest the enhancements in maternal outcomes necessary to meet the sustainable development goals. Thus, this study aims to assess utilization of non-pneumatic anti-shock garment to control complications of post-partum hemorrhage and associated factors among obstetric care providers in public health institutions of Southern Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 obstetric health care providers from March 15 –June 30, 2020. A simple random sampling method was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify determinants for the utilization of non-pneumatic antishock garment. STATA version 16 was used for data analysis. A P-value of &lt; 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results Overall, 48.5% (95%CI: 43.73, 53.48%) of the obstetric care providers had utilized Non pneumatic antishock garment for management of complications from postpartum hemorrhage. Training on Non pneumatic antishock garment (AOR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.74, 4.92), working at hospital (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.16), good knowledge about NASG (AOR = 1.997; 95%CI: 1.16, 3.42) and disagreed and neutral attitude on Non pneumatic antishock garment (AOR = 0.41; 95%CI: 0.24, 0.68), and (AOR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.73), respectively were significantly associated with obstetric care provider’s utilization of Non-pneumatic antishock garment. Conclusions In the current study, roughly half of the providers are using Non-pneumatic antishock garment for preventing complications from postpartum hemorrhage. Strategies and program initiatives should focus on strengthening in-service and continuous professional development training, thereby filling the knowledge and attitude gap among obstetric care providers. Health centers should be targeted in future programs for accessibility and utilization of non-pneumatic antishock garment."
https://openalex.org/W3208812600,"Because of the continuous rise of foodborne illnesses caused by the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, effective post-harvest anti-microbial strategies are necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-microbial efficacy of ozone (O 3 ) against two common causes of fresh produce contamination, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes , and to relate its effects to potential mechanisms of xenobiosis by transcriptional network modeling. The study on non-host tomato environment correlated the dose × time aspects of xenobiosis by examining the correlation between bacterial survival in terms of log-reduction and defense responses at the level of gene expression. In E . coli , low (1 μg O 3 /g of fruit) and moderate (2 μg O 3 /g of fruit) doses caused insignificant reduction in survival, while high dose (3 μg/g of fruit) caused significant reduction in survival in a time-dependent manner. In L . monocytogenes , moderate dose caused significant reduction even with short-duration exposure. Distinct responses to O 3 xenobiosis between E . coli and L . monocytogenes are likely related to differences in membrane and cytoplasmic structure and components. Transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq showed that primary defenses in E . coli were attenuated after exposure to a low dose, while the responses at moderate dose were characterized by massive upregulation of pathogenesis and stress-related genes, which implied the activation of defense responses. More genes were downregulated during the first hour at high dose, with a large number of such genes getting significantly upregulated after 2 hr and 3 hr. This trend suggests that prolonged exposure led to potential adaptation. In contrast, massive downregulation of genes was observed in L . monocytogenes regardless of dose and exposure duration, implying a mechanism of defense distinct from that of E . coli . The nature of bacterial responses revealed by this study should guide the selection of xenobiotic agents for eliminating bacterial contamination on fresh produce without overlooking the potential risks of adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3210912969,"Wilms tumor-1-interacting protein (Wtip) is a LIM-domain-containing adaptor that links cell junctions with actomyosin complexes and modulates actomyosin contractility and ciliogenesis in Xenopus embryos. The Wtip C-terminus with three LIM domains associates with the actin-binding protein Shroom3 and modulates Shroom3-induced apical constriction in ectoderm cells. By contrast, the N-terminal domain localizes to apical junctions in the ectoderm and basal bodies in skin multiciliated cells, but its interacting partners remain largely unknown. Targeted proximity biotinylation (TPB) using anti-GFP antibody fused to the biotin ligase BirA identified SSX2IP as a candidate protein that binds GFP-WtipN. SSX2IP, also known as Msd1 or ADIP, is a component of cell junctions, centriolar satellite protein and a targeting factor for ciliary membrane proteins. WtipN physically associated with SSX2IP and the two proteins readily formed mixed aggregates in overexpressing cells. By contrast, we observed only partial colocalization of full length Wtip and SSX2IP, suggesting that Wtip adopts a 'closed' conformation in the cell. Furthermore, the double depletion of Wtip and SSX2IP in early embryos uncovered the functional interaction of the two proteins during neural tube closure. Our results suggest that the association of SSX2IP and Wtip is essential for cell junction remodeling and morphogenetic processes that accompany neurulation. We propose that TPB can be a general approach that is applicable to other GFP-tagged proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3211190739,"To establish whether pig tail posture is affected by injuries and ill health, a machine vision system using 3D cameras to measure tail angle was used. Camera data from 1692 pigs in 41 production batches of 42.4 (±16.6) days in length over 17 months at seven diverse grower/finisher commercial pig farms, was validated by visiting farms every 14(±10) days to score injury and ill health. Linear modelling of tail posture found considerable farm and batch effects. The percentage of tails held low (0°) or mid (1-45°) decreased over time from 54.9% and 23.8% respectively by -0.16 and -0.05%/day, while tails high (45-90°) increased from 21.5% by 0.20%/day. Although 22% of scored pigs had scratched tails, severe tail biting was rare; only 6% had tail wounds and 5% partial tail loss. Adding tail injury to models showed associations with tail posture: overall tail injury, worsening tail injury, and tail loss were associated with more pigs detected with low tail posture and fewer with high tails. Minor tail injuries and tail swelling were also associated with altered tail posture. Unexpectedly, other health and injury scores had a larger effect on tail posture- more low tails were observed when a greater proportion of pigs in a pen were scored with lameness or lesions caused by social aggression. Ear injuries were linked with reduced high tails. These findings are consistent with the idea that low tail posture could be a general indicator of poor welfare. However, effects of flank biting and ocular discharge on tail posture were not consistent with this. Our results show for the first time that perturbations in the normal time trends of tail posture are associated with tail biting and other signs of adverse health/welfare at diverse commercial farms, forming the basis for a decision support system."
https://openalex.org/W3208189368,"Acute lung injury (ALI) often causes severe trauma that may progress to significant morbidity and mortality. ALI results from a combination of the underlying clinical condition of the patient (e.g., inflammation) with a secondary insult such as viral pneumonia or a blood transfusion. While the secondary insult may be variable, the rapidly progressive disease process leading to pulmonary failure is typically mediated by an overwhelming innate immunological or inflammatory reaction driven by excessive complement and neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses. We recently developed a ‘two-hit’ ALI rat model mediated by lipopolysaccharide followed by transfusion of incompatible human erythrocytes resulting in complement activation, neutrophil-mediated ALI and free DNA in the blood indicative of neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of peptide inhibitor of complement C1 (RLS-0071), a classical complement pathway inhibitor and neutrophil modulator in this animal model. Adolescent male Wistar rats were infused with lipopolysaccharide followed by transfusion of incompatible erythrocytes in the presence or absence of RLS-0071. Blood was collected at various time points to assess complement C5a levels, free DNA and cytokines in isolated plasma. Four hours following erythrocyte transfusion, lung tissue was recovered and assayed for ALI by histology. Compared to animals not receiving RLS-0071, lungs of animals treated with a single dose of RLS-0071 showed significant reduction in ALI as well as reduced levels of C5a, free DNA and inflammatory cytokines in the blood. These results demonstrate that RLS-0071 can modulate neutrophil-mediated ALI in this novel rat model."
https://openalex.org/W3208231546,"Globally, individuals with autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) continue to depend for survival on insulin injections. While pancreas and intrahepatic pancreatic islet transplants can produce insulin-independence and ameliorate serious complications, both therapies depend on potentially toxic anti-rejection drugs. Furthermore, the scarcity of pancreas donors and islet transplant failures limit the general availability of such interventions. Recently, fetal and induced Pluripotent Stem Cells have been successfully differentiated to generate insulin producing β-like cells that generate euglycemia in diabetic mice. However, their clinical use still depends on anti-rejection drugs or immune-isolating encapsulation systems. We reported recently that allogeneic “Neo-Islets” (NI), 3-D organoids of Mesenchymal Stromal and Islet Cells are immune protected and permanently correct autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice by omental engraftment and endocrine cell redifferentiation. This new “endocrine pancreas” delivers islet hormones physiologically into the hepatic portal vein. Furthermore, treatment of insulin-dependent dogs with allogeneic canine NIs (ongoing FDA-approved Pilot Study) consistently improved glycemic control without the need for antirejection drugs. As there remains a critical need for curative therapies of T1DM, we engineered human NIs and tested their ability, after i.p. administration, to reestablish euglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic NOD/SCID mice. This diabetes model reproduces, in part, the clinical situation in which recipients of allogeneic biotherapies must take potent anti-rejection drugs that similarly create a life-long immune-compromised status. The present study demonstrates that human NI therapy (2x10e5/kg bw NIs/mouse) of STZ-diabetic NOD/SCID mice (n = 6), compared to controls (n = 6) significantly improved glycemic control, and most importantly, that a second dose given to the initial group normalized blood glucose levels long-term. Conclusion: Despite the limitations of the utilized diabetic NOD/SCID mouse model, the obtained data show that human NIs are curative, an observation that has high translational relevance and significantly supports the planned conduct of clinical trials with human NIs."
https://openalex.org/W3208476973,"Proprotein convertases subtilisin kexins are serine endoproteases, playing critical roles in the biological functions, including lipid, glucose, and bile acid metabolism, as well as cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Experimental studies have demonstrated the physiological functions of PCSKs and their association with diseases; however, studies on the evolutionary history and diversification of these proteins are missing. In the present research, a bioinformatics study was conducted on the molecular evolution of several PCSKs family members and gene loss events across placental mammalian. In order to detect evolutionary constraints and positive selection, the CodeML program of the PAML package was used. The results showed the positive selection to occur in PCSK1, PCSK3, PCSK5, and PCSK7. A decelerated rate of evolution was observed in PCSK7, PCSK3, and MBTPS1 in Carnivores compared to the rest of phylogeny, and an accelerated evolution of PCSK1, PCSK7, and MBTPS1 in Muridae family of rodents was found. Additionally, our results indicated pcsk9 gene loss in 12 species comprising Carnivores and bats (Chiroptera). Future studies are required to evaluate the functional relevance and selective evolutionary advantages associated with these modifications in PCSK proteins during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3208938202,"Conversion of normal prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to the pathogenic PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformer is central to prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and scrapie; however, the detailed mechanism of this conversion remains obscure. To investigate how the N-terminal polybasic region of PrP (NPR) influences the PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion, we analyzed two PrP mutants: ΔN6 (deletion of all six amino acids in NPR) and Met4-1 (replacement of four positively charged amino acids in NPR with methionine). We found that ΔN6 and Met4-1 differentially impacted the binding of recombinant PrP (recPrP) to the negatively charged phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, a nonprotein cofactor that facilitates PrP conversion. Both mutant recPrPs were able to form recombinant prion (recPrP<sup>Sc</sup>) <i>in vitro</i>, but the convertibility was greatly reduced, with ΔN6 displaying the lowest convertibility. Prion infection assays in mammalian RK13 cells expressing WT or NPR-mutant PrPs confirmed these differences in convertibility, indicating that the NPR affects the conversion of both bacterially expressed recPrP and post-translationally modified PrP in eukaryotic cells. We also found that both WT and mutant recPrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformers caused prion disease in WT mice with a 100% attack rate, but the incubation times and neuropathological changes caused by two recPrP<sup>Sc</sup> mutants were significantly different from each other and from that of WT recPrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Together, our results support that the NPR greatly influences PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion, but it is not essential for the generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Moreover, the significant differences between ΔN6 and Met4-1 suggest that not only charge but also the identity of amino acids in NPR is important to PrP conversion."
https://openalex.org/W3210228310,"The intestinal epithelium requires self-renewal and differentiation in order to function and adapt to pathological diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, short gut syndrome, and ulcers. The rodent Slfn3 protein and the human Slfn12 analog are known to regulate intestinal epithelial differentiation. Previous work utilizing a pan-Slfn3 knockout (KO) mouse model revealed sex-dependent gene expression disturbances in intestinal differentiation markers, metabolic pathways, Slfn family member mRNA expression, adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes, and phenotypically less weight gain and sex-dependent changes in villus length and crypt depth. We have now created a Vil-Cre specific Slfn3KO (VC-Slfn3KO) mouse to further evaluate its role in intestinal differentiation. There were increases in Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn4, and Slfn8 and decreases in Slfn5 and Slfn9 mRNA expression that were intestinal region and sex-specific. Differentiation markers, sucrase isomaltase (SI), villin 1, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and glucose transporters, glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), Glut2, and sodium glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), were increased in expression in VC-Slfn3KO mice based on intestinal region and were also highly female sex-biased, except for SI in the ileum was also increased for male VC-Slfn3KO mice and SGLT1 was decreased for both sexes. Overall, the variations that we observed in these VC-Slfn3KO mice indicate a complex regulation of intestinal gene expression that is sex-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3210276646,"In recent years, a class of chemical compounds (benzoxaboroles) that are active against a range of parasites has been shown to target mRNA polyadenylation by inhibiting the activity of CPSF73, the endonucleolytic core of the eukaryotic polyadenylation complex. One particular compound, termed AN3661, is active against several apicomplexan parasites that cause disease in humans. In this study, we report that AN3661 is active against an apicomplexan that causes disease in horses and marine mammals (Sarcocystis neurona), with an approximate IC50 value of 14.99 nM. Consistent with the reported mode of action of AN3661 against other apicomplexans, S. neurona mutants resistant to AN3661 had an alteration in CPSF73 that was identical to a mutation previously documented in AN3661-resistant Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. AN3661 had a wide-ranging effect on poly(A) site choice in S. neurona, with more than half of all expressed genes showing some alteration in mRNA 3' ends. This was accompanied by changes in the relative expression of more than 25% of S. neurona genes and an overall 5-fold reduction of S. neurona transcripts in infected cells. In contrast, AN3661 had no discernible effect on poly(A) site choice or gene expression in the host cells. These transcriptomic studies indicate that AN3661 is exceedingly specific for the parasite CPSF73 protein, and has the potential to augment other therapies for the control of apicomplexan parasites in domestic animals."
https://openalex.org/W3211023262,"Despite the global importance of science, engineering, and math-related fields, women are consistently underrepresented in these areas. One source of this disparity is likely the prevalence of gender stereotypes that constrain girls' and women's math performance and interest. The current research explores the developmental roots of these effects by examining the impact of stereotypes on young girls' intuitive number sense, a universal skill that predicts later math ability. Across four studies, 762 children ages 3-6 were presented with a task measuring their Approximate Number System accuracy. Instructions given before the task varied by condition. In the two control conditions, the task was described to children either as a game or a test of eyesight ability. In the experimental condition, the task was described as a test of math ability and that researchers were interested in whether boys or girls were better at math and counting. Separately, we measured children's explicit beliefs about math and gender. Results conducted on the combined dataset indicated that while only a small number of girls in the sample had stereotypes associating math with boys, these girls performed significantly worse on a test of Approximate Number System accuracy when it was framed as a math test rather than a game or an eyesight test. These results provide novel evidence that for young girls who do endorse stereotypes about math and gender, contextual activation of these stereotypes may impair their intuitive number sense, potentially affecting their acquisition of formal mathematics concepts and developing interest in math-related fields."
https://openalex.org/W3167097109,"Introduction We read, see and hear news from various media sources every day. A large majority of the news is negative. A previous study from our laboratory showed that reading negative news is associated with both increased stress reactivity (measured via the stress hormone cortisol) and recall of the negative news segments in women. Objectives The present study investigated the effects of positive news on cortisol stress reactivity, memory and affect using a methodology highly similar to the study on negative news that was previously used by our team. Methods Sixty-two healthy participants aged between 18 and 35 years (81% women) were randomly exposed to either positive or neutral news segments, followed by a laboratory stressor. We assessed participants’ affect three times during the procedure and measured cortisol in saliva eight times (at 10-minute intervals). Twenty-four hours later, participants were contacted by phone to assess their recall of the news segments. Results Results showed that exposure to positive news, relative to neutral news, did not modulate participants’ cortisol levels in response to the laboratory stressor. Positive news had no impact on memory recall of the news and did not change participants’ positive or negative affect. Bayes factors suggested that these nonsignificant results are not attributable to low statistical power. Conclusion Contrary to negative news, positive and neutral news do not modulate stress reactivity, memory and affect. These results suggest that people can stay informed without physiological and psychological costs when the news to which they are exposed adopt a positive or neutral approach."
https://openalex.org/W3207992236,"Risk taking is a complex heterogeneous construct that has proven difficult to assess, especially when using behavioral tasks. We present an exploratory investigation of new measure-the Assessment of Physical Risk Taking (APRT). APRT produces a variety of different outcome scores and is designed as a comprehensive assessment of the probability of success and failure, and magnitude of reward and punishment of different types of simulated physically risky behaviors. Effects observed on the simulated behaviors are hypothesized to reflect similar effects on real world physical risks. Participants (N = 224) completed APRT in a laboratory setting, half of whom had a 1.5 s delay interposed between button presses. Exploratory analyses utilizing generalized estimating equations examined the main effects and two-way interactions among five within-subject factors, as well as two-way interactions between the within-subject factors and Delay across four APRT outcome scores. Results indicated that Injury Magnitude and Injury Probability exerted stronger effects than any of the other independent variables. Participants also completed several self-report measures of risk taking and associated constructs (e.g., sensation seeking), which were correlated with APRT scores to assess the preliminary convergent and divergent validity of the new measure. After correcting for multiple comparisons, APRT scores correlated with self-reported risk taking in thrilling, physically dangerous activities specifically, but only for those who did not have a delay between APRT responses. This promising exploratory investigation highlights the need for future studies comparing APRT to other behavioral risk taking tasks, examining the robustness of the observed APRT effects, and investigating how APRT may predict real-world physical risk taking."
https://openalex.org/W3209463401,"In recent years, it is becoming clearer that plant growth and its yield are affected by sound with certain sounds, such as seedling of corn directing itself toward the sound source and its ability to distinguish stuttering of larvae from other sounds. However, methods investigating the effects of sound on plants either take a long time or are destructive. Here, we propose using laser biospeckle, a non-destructive and non-contact technique, to investigate the activities of an arugula plant for sounds of different frequencies, namely, 0 Hz or control, 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, including rock and classical music. Laser biospeckles are generated when scattered light from biological tissues interfere, and the intensities of such speckles change in time, and these changes reflect changes in the scattering structures within the biological tissue. A leaf was illuminated by light from a laser light of wavelength 635 nm, and the biospeckles were recorded as a movie by a CMOS camera for 20 sec at 15 frames per second (fps). The temporal correlation between the frames was characterized by a parameter called biospeckle activity (BA)under the exposure to different sound stimuli of classical and rock music and single-frequency sound stimuli for 1min. There was a clear difference in BA between the control and other frequencies with BA for 100 Hz being closer to control, while at higher frequencies, BA was much lower, indicating a dependence of the activity on the frequency. As BA is related to changes from both the surface as well as from the internal structures of the leaf, LSM (laser scanning microscope) observations conducted to confirm the change in the internal structure revealed more than 5% transient change in stomatal size following exposure to one minute to high frequency sound of 10kHz that reverted within ten minutes. Our results demonstrate the potential of laser biospeckle to speedily monitor in vivo response of plants to sound stimuli and thus could be a possible screening tool for selecting appropriate frequency sounds to enhance or delay the activity of plants.

We show that linking multiple copies of a selected low-affinity peptide to a biocompatible water-soluble N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer carrier (iBody) improved binding of the conjugate by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, using ELISA, enzyme kinetics, confocal microscopy, and other approaches, we demonstrate that the resulting iBody can distinguish between different conformations of the target protein.

The use of antibodies specific to pharmacologically relevant targets remains a gold standard in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Although antibodies tend to be more stable than most biologically active proteins, they are still sensitive to changes in the environment, such as fluctuations in temperature and pH. Furthermore, antibodies can be difficult to chemically modify and have a limited shelf-life. Potential batch-to-batch variability and limited tissue penetration also are among the reasons why researchers are exploring potential alternatives. Multiple protein and nonprotein antibody mimetics have been designed. Alternative scaffolds such as knottins, aptamers, and affibodies, among others, are already well established (1Yu X. Yang Y.P.

Recently, we introduced iBodies (2Šácha P. Knedlík T. Schimer J. Tykvart J. Parolek J. Navrátil V. Dvořáková P. Sedlák F. Ulbrich K. Strohalm J. Majer P. Šubr V.

Initially designed to target active sites of enzymes using known inhibitors (3Dvořáková P. Bušek P. Knedlík T. Schimer J. Etrych T. Kostka L. Šromová L.S. Šubr V. Šácha P. Šedo A. Konvalinka J.

Inhibitor–polymer conjugates as a versatile tool for detection and visualization of cancer-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms.ACS Omega. 2019; 4: 6746-6756Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), iBodies have since been adapted for molecular recognition of targets without known enzymatic activity, such as His tag (6Beranová J.

Tris-(Nitrilotriacetic acid)-decorated polymer conjugates as tools for immobilization and visualization of His-tagged proteins.Catalysts. 2019; 9: 1011Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The most challenging task in developing antibody mimetics is to obtain a molecule capable of targeting the protein of interest without prior knowledge of its ligands. Fortunately, a wide variety of in vitro evolution methods are available. This includes, but is not limited to, mRNA display, yeast display, and phage display (7Mimmi S. Maisano D. Quinto I. Iaccino E. Phage display: An overview in context to drug discovery.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Smith G.P. Petrenko V.A. Phage display.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). A common feature of these methods is the connection of a DNA- or RNA-encoded peptide to the genetic code that determines its sequence. This allows deconvolution of the results of selection by simple sequencing. The success of any display method is determined by the design and quality of the library used. Libraries were originally composed of linear peptides, but a wide range of complex libraries including phage display of antibody fragments (9Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Making antibody fragments using phage display libraries.Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), antibodies (10Paduch M. Koide A. Uysal S. Rizk S.S. Koide S. Kossiakoff A.A. Generating conformation-specific synthetic antibodies to trap proteins in selected functional states.Methods. 2013; 60: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or even complete proteomes have since been developed. Small molecules remain highly desirable for certain uses, including targeting of proteins of interest using fully synthetic antibody mimetics. Therefore, displays of complex peptides cyclized though disulfide bridges or chemically modified using a variety of reagents also have been explored (11Heinis C. Rutherford T. Freund S. Winter G.

We set out to search for new ligands of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a metalloprotease overexpressed in prostate cancer and neovasculature of solid tumors. The significance of PSMA in cancer diagnostics and treatment has been long investigated. The surface expression of PSMA makes it an ideal target for both imaging and possible therapy or even immunotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates, radioligands, bispecific T-cell engagers, and CAR T-cells are being investigated (14Marshall C.H. Antonarakis E.S.

Oncol. 2020; 13: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), some in clinical trials. For the discovery of new ligands, we set out by using a library of bicyclic peptides, with the ultimate goal of using them as target recognition moieties on iBodies. We found that conjugating a weakly binding peptide with unfavorable properties with a copolymer backbone improves the stability, solubility, and affinity. The resulting copolymer can be further decorated with fluorophores, affinity anchors, and other targeting or visualization moieties. Our findings indicate that such fully synthetic polymer conjugates can even recognize different conformations of the target protein, demonstrating their potential to replace antibodies in a variety of applications. To identify new ligands of PSMA, we employed a phage display approach with chemically modified peptides. Introducing chemical modifications to linear peptides to induce a specific peptide conformation can have a significant impact on the peptide-binding properties (17Chen S. Morales-Sanfrutos J. Angelini A. Cutting B. Heinis C. Structurally diverse cyclisation linkers impose different backbone conformations in bicyclic peptides.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used the previously described phage library A (18Rebollo I.R. Angelini A. Heinis C. Phage display libraries of differently sized bicyclic peptides.Med. Chem. Commun. 2013; 4: 145-150Crossref Google Scholar) kindly provided by C. Heinis (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne). This fd phage library contains tetradeca- and pentadecapeptides that include three cysteine residues and a four-amino-acid linker. The cysteine residues were cross-linked by thioether bonds, yielding differently sized bicycles. Phages from library A were produced as previously described (11Heinis C. Rutherford T. Freund S. Winter G. Phage-encoded combinatorial chemical libraries based on bicyclic peptides.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 18Rebollo I.R. Angelini A. Heinis C. Phage display libraries of differently sized bicyclic peptides.Med. Chem. Commun. 2013; 4: 145-150Crossref Google Scholar) and chemically modified with 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene (TBMB). Phage library A modified with TBMB was used for three-round panning against the recombinant extracellular part of PSMA immobilized on magnetic beads. For each round of the selection, 3 μg of biotinylated PSMA was used (see Experimental procedures). The phage pool resulting from each round of selection was used to infect susceptible TG1 bacteria, amplified, and used in subsequent rounds. In the second and third rounds, the chemically modified phage pool selected in the previous round was divided in half; one half was used for panning against PSMA+ beads and the other was used as a control for panning against PSMA− beads. The phage titers rose throughout selection, resulting in a significantly higher titer on PSMA+ beads than on the control PSMA− beads after round three (Fig. S1), indicating selection of PSMA-specific phage clones. Isolated DNA from the second and the third rounds was used as a template for sample preparation for next-generation sequencing. Initial PCR reactions introduced barcodes that allowed sample pooling and subsequent deconvolution of the results. PCR amplicons were sequenced using Illumina next-generation sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The obtained reads were analyzed in Matlab as previously described (19Rentero Rebollo I. Sabisz M. Baeriswyl V. Heinis C. Identification of target-binding peptide motifs by high-throughput sequencing of phage-selected peptides.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: e169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Matochko W.L. Chu K. Jin B. Lee S.W. Whitesides G.M. Derda R. Deep sequencing analysis of phage libraries using Illumina platform.Methods. 2012; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with approximately 300,000 reads per sample after quality control and translation. Analysis of next-generation sequencing of library A revealed several phage clones as candidate binders of PSMA. We observed a shift in the distribution and percentage occupied by specific phage clones between rounds 2 and 3, as expected in a successful selection. After the third round of selection, a single clone, Phage1, represented approximately three-quarters of the resulting pool (Fig. 1A). We repeated the selection process two more times, and sequencing of the resulting pools gave very similar results (see Fig. S2), showing that the selection reproducibly leads to the identification of Phage 1 as well as other peptide motifs. To avoid lengthy preparation of a number of peptides, we first isolated Phage1 and used it for initial verification of the phage display results. We prepared three variants of the leading clone: modified with TBMB; modified with the alternative linker 1,3,5-triacryloyl-1,3,5-triazinane (TATA); and unmodified (Fig. 1B). Phage1 cyclized with TBMB was titrated on ELISA layers with and without PSMA (Fig. 1C). We observed specific binding to PSMA with a substantial signal-to-background ratio (over 60×) confirming that the selected clone indeed binds the target protein. To further assess the specificity of the interaction, we performed a competition experiment with a known specific PSMA inhibitor, 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentane-1,5-dioic acid (2-PMPA). We detected a decrease in the signal showing that 2-PMPA competed out the binding of Phage1 (Fig. 1D). To test whether the phage binds PSMA through the displayed peptide and analyze the role of the cyclization reagent used, Phage ELISA results showed that binding of PSMA by Phage1 is greatly increased by cyclization with TBMB (Fig. 1E). The dependence of Phage1 binding on TBMB cyclization suggested that the specific interaction with PSMA occurs through the displayed peptide. Heinis and coworkers previously established that different cyclization linkers can induce different conformations of the modified peptides (17Chen S. Morales-Sanfrutos J. Angelini A. Cutting B. Heinis C. Structurally diverse cyclisation linkers impose different backbone conformations in bicyclic peptides.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which points to the importance of the peptide binder conformation for binding. Next, we synthesized the bicyclic peptide displayed on Phage1 (Peptide 1) and added a lysine residue after the GGSG spacer to enable simple modification. Peptide 1 was prepared using standard solid-phase synthesis followed by TBMB cyclization and modified in two different ways: by addition of a PEG12 linker and a biotin group (compound 1, Fig. 2A) or by addition of a PEG5 linker ending with an amine group (compound 2). The latter was used for preparation of pHPMA copolymer conjugate iBody 1 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). iBody 1 carries the bicyclic peptide (compound 2, 9.8× per polymer), the ATTO488 fluorophore (3.0× per polymer), and biotin (11.6× per polymer). These components allow easy visualization, detection, and immobilization of the target protein. To compare the binding properties of Peptide 1 and iBody 1, we performed ELISA with immobilized PSMA. While the peptide showed rather nonspecific and weak binding (EC50 higher than 5 μM; Fig. 2C), iBody 1 bound PSMA with greater specificity and potency (EC50 = 2 nM, a three-order-of-magnitude difference; Fig. 2D). To verify that the iBody backbone did not interact with PSMA, we used iBody 3 without specific ligand to PSMA in ELISA and observed no specific binding to immobilized PSMA compared with the control layer without PSMA (Table S1). The improvement of EC50 of iBody 1 compared with Peptide 1, therefore, depended on the combination of Peptide 1 with iBody scaffold. We hypothesized that the improvement was due to the hydrophilic backbone of the iBody as well as an avidity effect. We next aimed to decipher the binding mode of the newly discovered peptide ligand of PSMA. The enzymatic activity of PSMA has been well described, and a number of highly potent inhibitors have been identified. We analyzed competition of iBody 1 with 2-PMPA, JB-395d (compound 1 in Šácha et al. (2Šácha P. Knedlík T. Schimer J. Tykvart J. Parolek J. Navrátil V. Dvořáková P. Sedlák F. Ulbrich K. Strohalm J. Majer P. Šubr V. Konvalinka J. iBodies: Modular synthetic antibody mimetics based on hydrophilic polymers decorated with functional moieties.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), JB-352 (compound 3 in Tykvart et al. (21Tykvart J. Schimer J. Bařinková J. Pachl P. Poštová-Slavětínská L. Majer P. Konvalinka J. Šácha P. Rational design of urea-based glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) inhibitors as versatile tools for specific drug targeting and delivery.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2014; 22: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), and phosphate, which is present in standard phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) commonly used in biochemical assays (Fig. 2E, Fig. S4). Indeed, the binding of the iBody to PSMA on ELISA was outcompeted by all these inhibitors. Although the inhibitors prevented binding of the iBody 1, neither the iBody 1 nor the peptide inhibited PSMA activity (Fig. 2F). This is in contrast to iBody 2, used as a positive control, which is targeted to PSMA by JB-395d instead of the Peptide 1 and which does inhibit PSMA activity. iBody 3, used as a negative control, does not contain targeting ligands and does not inhibit PSMA as expected. Results, therefore, suggest that Peptide 1 likely binds outside the active site to a site that is not available upon inhibitor binding. We verified the hypothesis that iBody 1 binds specifically to the uninhibited conformation of PSMA using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and pull-down assays in the presence of standard PBS, which inhibits PSMA, and Tris-buffered saline (TBS), which does not. We found that the iBody binds PSMA only in the absence of phosphate, as shown by both silver-stained gels and Western blots (Fig. 3A). SPR kinetics measurements revealed that virtually no binding occurred in PBS, while binding in TBS proceeded as expected (Fig. 3B). To verify that this selectivity for the uninhibited form of PSMA is not an artifact of the recombinant protein used in the biochemical assays, we conducted flow cytometry experiments with the U251 clonal cell line transfected with full-length human PSMA under a tet-off promotor (4Šimon P. Knedlík T. Blažková K. Dvořáková P. Březinová A. Kostka L. Šubr V. Konvalinka J. Šácha P. Identification of protein targets of bioactive small molecules using randomly photomodified probes.ACS Chem. Biol. 2018; 13: 3333-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Titration assays revealed that in TBS iBody 1 specifically binds to PSMA+ cells, while no binding is observed in PBS, KH2PO4, 2-PMPA, or on control PSMA− cells (Fig. 4, A and B, Figs. S5 and S6). These findings show that the binding is not dependent on the PSMA expression system, the construct used, or different glycosylation patterns on the protein, but rather on inhibition of PSMA. To determine the distribution of the iBody 1 inside PSMA+ cells, we used confocal microscopy imaging. We observed that the iBody 1 binds to PSMA-expressing cells in TBS but not PBS. When binding occurs in TBS, the iBody 1 internalizes, with almost all bound iBody 1 seen inside the cytoplasm after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4C). In contrast, anti-PSMA antibody 2G7 (22Knedlík T. Navrátil V. Vik V. Pacík D. Šácha P. Konvalinka J. Detection and quantitation of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in human blood.Prostate. 2014; 74: 768-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) binds to PSMA-expressing cells regardless of the buffer used. This indicates that iBody 1 senses the conformational state of PSMA in the cells, while the antibody binding is insensitive to the presence of inhibitors. In both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments, the binding of iBody 1 to PSMA+ cells is highly dependent on the presence of phosphate (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the results of biochemical methods with a truncated version of the target enzyme. Methods for in vitro selection of protein ligands often yield poorly soluble hydrophobic compounds with binding constants in the micromolar range. Synthetic peptides typically lose some specificity and binding sensitivity compared with the corresponding phage ancestor. Here, we present data from a typical phage display selection of a peptide ligand of PSMA. While the selected bicyclic peptide showed promising binding, it was not sufficiently selective or potent as a synthetic small molecule ligand. Published bicyclic peptide binders vary significantly in their binding affinity (23Upadhyaya P. Lahdenranta J. Hurov K. Battula S. Dods R. Haines E. Kleyman M. Kristensson J. Kublin J. Lani R. Ma J. Mudd G. Repash E. Van Rietschoten K. Stephen T. et al.Anticancer immunity induced by a synthetic tumor-targeted CD137 agonist.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2021; 9e001762Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The number of bicyclic peptides discarded from further investigation due to insufficient affinity is not known, however, but probably causes that a number of peptides are not utilized. However, in this instance, combining the peptide with a polymer-based hydrophilic carrier led to significant improvements; the iBody 1 exhibited a nearly three-order-of-magnitude increase in binding over the peptide alone. The presence of several peptides covalently attached to one iBody likely better mimics the situation on the phage P3 protein. Furthermore, attachment to a hydrophilic and easy-to-modify polymer scaffold can greatly improve the solubility of the ligand and enable further modification by addition of affinity molecules, fluorophores, or other ligands. This strategy circumvents a common problem in phage display selection—identification of a promising lead phage clone followed by insufficient affinity and selectivity of the encoded peptide. Combining a small molecule with unfavorable properties with a large hydrophilic copolymer-based scaffold offers a new approach to translate hits from in vitro selection methods to biochemical applications. Importantly, we observed that while the bicyclic peptide itself does not inhibit PSMA, it also does not recognize the inhibited form of the enzyme. Crystal structures of PSMA established that when small-molecule inhibitors such as 2-PMPA (24Mesters J.R. Henning K. Hilgenfeld R. Human glutamate carboxypeptidase II inhibition: Structures of GCPII in complex with two potent inhibitors, quisqualate and 2-PMPA.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or JB-352 bind to the enzyme, the active site adopts a closed conformation. In contrast, inhibitors with a PEG linker attached to the zinc-binding “warhead” of the compound, such as JB-395d, keep the so-called “entrance lid” of the active site in an open position. This suggests that other structural changes occur upon inhibitor binding to the PSMA active site, resulting in unavailability of the binding site for the bicyclic peptide. We conclude that Peptide 1 and the corresponding iBody 1 likely bind outside of the active site to an exosite that is only available on the uninhibited enzyme. This study presents an antibody mimetic able to bind selectively to a specific conformation of the target protein. This proof of principle shows that antibody mimetics can achieve conformation selectivity, similar to some antibodies (10Paduch M. Koide A. Uysal S. Rizk S.S. Koide S. Kossiakoff A.A. Generating conformation-specific synthetic antibodies to trap proteins in selected functional states.Methods. 2013; 60: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and paves the way for development of versatile, stable, simple-to-prepare synthetic antibody mimetics that recognize functionally and structurally defined epitopes. Phage display using bicyclic peptide phage libraries kindly supplied by C. Heinis (EPFL) was performed as previously described (18Rebollo I.R. Angelini A. Heinis C. Phage display libraries of differently sized bicyclic peptides.Med. Chem. Commun. 2013; 4: 145-150Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μg Avi-PSMA previously expressed in our laboratory (labeled Avi-GCPII in Tykvart et al. (25Tykvart J. Sácha P. Bařinka C. Knedlík T. Starková J. Lubkowski J. Konvalinka J.

For the second round of selection, we used 20 μl of NeutrAvidine beads prepared through conjugation of NeutrAvidine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to Dynabeads M-280 Tosylactivated (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phage library A (or in subsequent rounds the phage pool from the previous round of display) was blocked (1% BSA) and incubated with magnetic beads with PSMA (control panning with beads without PSMA was performed in second and third round). Beads were washed six times with buffer with detergent (0.1% Tween-20), transferred to fresh tubes, and washed three times without detergent. Phages were eluted using 50 mM glycine buffer (pH 2.2) for 5 min, neutralized by 1 M Tris (pH 8.0), and infected into susceptible TG1 bacteria. Samples were taken to evaluate the library preparation as well as the resulting phage pools after the display round itself. A 300-μl aliquot from a total of 7.5 ml TG1 bacteria infected with the resulting phage pool after the second and third round of selection was used for plasmid DNA isolation using the Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH). The resulting DNA (100 pg) was amplified in a PCR reaction using Phusion HF polymerase (NEB) in a 50-μl reaction volume. The amplified DNA fragment was separated on a 2% UltraPure agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) gel. The fragment around 150 bp was excised, and DNA was extracted using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). DNA was quantified using Nanodrop and the Qubit dsDNA HS kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Qubit values were used to pool samples equivalently, and the resulting mix was sent for paired-end 125 bp Illumina next-generation sequencing at Eurofins Genomics (then GATC). Previously published Matlab scripts (19Rentero Rebollo I. Sabisz M. Baeriswyl V. Heinis C. Identification of target-binding peptide motifs by high-throughput sequencing of phage-selected peptides.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: e169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were used for analysis of results from next-generation sequencing. After the final round of selection, ten colonies of TG1 bacteria infected with the resulting phage pool were picked. DNA was isolated using the Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH) and Sanger sequenced by Eurofins Genomics. The dominant phage clone was identified in several colonies, and one was grown to create a frozen bacterial stock in 20% glycerol. The phage clone was grown from this stock, isolated, divided into three parts, and chemically modified using the same procedure as for the phage libraries. The nonmodified sample was kept in equivalent conditions without the addition of TBMB or TATA. All phage samples were prepared in ten times dilution series and 20 μl from each step was transferred to 180 μl of TG1 bacteria (previously grown to OD600 0.4). After infection in 37 °C for 90 min, 10 μl from each sample was spotted on chloramphenicol agar plates and grown overnight in 37 °C. Since phages carry resistance to chloramphenicol, the infected bacteria gain this resistance, while the uninfected ones do not. Colonies were counted and the original number of phages in the given sample was calculated based on the dilution step. A black flat-bottom 96-well MaxiSorb plate (Nunc) was coated with 100 μl 2G7 antibody (22Knedlík T. Navrátil V. Vik V. Pacík D. Šácha P. Konvalinka J.

After three washes with 200 μl TBST′, the wells were incubated with the biotinylated recombinant extracellular part of PSMA (25Tykvart J. Sácha P. Bařinka C. Knedlík T. Starková J. Lubkowski J.

The single tracheid structure parameters in the stem and root of Sabina chinensis were obtained by dissociation and slicing, combined with numerical simulation to analyze the tracheid flow resistance characteristics. The results showed that the tracheid lumen resistance was determined by the tracheid width and tracheid length. The pit resistance was determined by the number of pits and single pit resistance. The single pit resistance was composed of four elements: the secondary cell wall, the border, the margo and the torus. The margo contributed a relatively large fraction of flow resistance, while the torus, the border and the secondary cell wall formed a small fraction. The size and position of the pores in the margo had a significant effect on the fluid velocity. The number of pits were proportional to tracheid length. The power curve, S-curve and inverse curve were fitted the scatter plot of total pit resistance, total resistance, total resistivity, which was found that there were the negative correlation between them. The three scatter plot values were larger in the stem than in the root, indicating that the tracheid structure in the root was more conducive to water transport than the stem. The ratio of tracheid lumen resistance to pit resistance mainly was less than 0.6 in the stem and less than 1 in the root, indicating that the pit resistance was dominant in the total resistance of the stem and root."
https://openalex.org/W3210286154,"Governments around the globe use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Making decisions under uncertainty, they all face the same temporal paradox: estimating the impact of NPIs before they have been implemented. Due to the limited variance of empirical cases, researchers could so far not disentangle effects of individual NPIs or their impact on different demographic groups. In this paper, we utilize large-scale agent-based simulations in combination with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models to investigate the spread of COVID-19 for some of the most affected federal states in Germany. In contrast to other studies, we sample agents from a representative survey. Including more realistic demographic attributes that influence agents’ behavior yields accurate predictions of COVID-19 transmissions and allows us to investigate counterfactual what-if scenarios. Results show that quarantining infected people and exploiting industry-specific home office capacities are the most effective NPIs. Disentangling education-related NPIs reveals that each considered institution (kindergarten, school, university) has rather small effects on its own, yet, that combined openings would result in large increases in COVID-19 cases. Representative survey-characteristics of agents also allow us to estimate NPIs’ effects on different age groups. For instance, re-opening schools would cause comparatively few infections among the risk-group of people older than 60 years."

Data for 1291 mother-child pairs were analyzed using STATA version 15. Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test estimated and compared the survivor functions across covariate levels. Cox regression proportional hazards models estimated the hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with time to cessation of exclusive breastfeeding.The prevalence of cessation of exclusive breastfeeding before six months was 68.7%, with a median age of cessation of four months (95% CI: 3, 4). In comparison to women living in Siha district, women living in Moshi Municipal (HR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.24, 2.09), Same (HR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.65) and Mwanga (HR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.20, 1.96) districts, had higher hazards of cessation of exclusive breastfeeding before six months. Women who received breastfeeding counselling at antenatal care had a lower hazard to cease EBF (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.65, 087) compared to those who did not receive breastfeeding counselling.The median age of cessation of EBF is unsatisfactory but at least higher (four months) than the national level estimate of three months. District specific interventions and breastfeeding counselling at antenatal care are essential for improving time to cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Promotion of adequate ANC visits remains one of the critical interventions to improve BF practices and other reproductive health outcomes."

We aimed to quantify whole-body three-dimensional kinematics among healthy individuals by assessing movement patterns in defined phases while eating real food with the dominant hand in a seated position. Our cross-sectional study included 45 healthy, right-hand dominant individuals with a mean age of 27.3 ± 5.1 years. Whole-body kinematics (joint angles of the upper limb, hip, neck, and trunk) were captured using an inertial sensor motion system. The eating motion was divided into four phases for analysis: reaching, spooning, transport, and mouth. The mean joint angles were compared among the phases with Friedman's analysis of variance. The maximum angles through all eating phases were 129.0° of elbow flexion, 32.4° of wrist extension, 50.4° of hip flexion, 6.8° of hip abduction, and 0.2° of hip rotation. The mean shoulder, elbow, and hip joint flexion angles were largest in the mouth phase, with the smallest being the neck flexion angle. By contrast, in the spooning phase, the shoulder, elbow, and hip flexion were the smallest, with the largest being the neck flexion angle. These angles were significantly different between the mouth and spooning phases (p < 0.008, Bonferroni post hoc correction). Our results revealed that characteristic whole-body movements correspond to each phase of realistic eating in healthy individuals. This study provides useful kinematic data regarding normal eating movements, which may inform whole-body positioning and movement, improve the assessment of eating abilities in clinical settings, and provide a basis for future studies."

Patients were subdivided into three groups using optical coherence tomography findings: Group A, patients with RRD outside the vascular arcade; Group B, patients whose condition was present within the vascular arcade, but without foveal detachment; and Group C, patients with foveal detachment.The average metamorphopsia score (°) assessed with M-charts 12 months after surgery was 0.01 ± 0.04 in Group A (24 eyes), 0.08 ± 0.18 in Group B (20 eyes), and 0.49 ± 0.48 in Group C (33 eyes) (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that metamorphopsia at 12 months after surgery significantly correlated with the proximity of the retinal detachment to the fovea (p = 0.007).Metamorphopsia after 27GPPV for RRD correlated with the proximity of the preoperative retinal detachment to the fovea. Attention should be paid to the possibility of postoperative metamorphopsia development when retinal detachment is present within a vascular arcade even if the fovea is not involved."

In this study, mint extract and riboflavin were tested as photosensitisers in combination with light irradiation of different frequencies, employed for various time intervals to improve the photo-degradation of deltamethrin (DM) and lambda cyhalothrin (λ-CHT) in cauliflower. Different source of light was studied, either in ultraviolet range (UV-C, 254 nm or UV-A, 320–380 nm) or sunlight simulator (&gt; 380–800 nm). The degradation of the pesticides varied depending on the type of photosensitiser and light source. Photo-degradation of the DM and λ-CHT was enhanced by applying the mint extracts and riboflavin and a more significant degradation was achieved with UV-C than with either UV-A or sunlight, reaching a maximum decrement of the concentration by 67–76%. The light treatments did not significantly affect the in-vitro antioxidant activity of the natural antioxidants in cauliflower. A calculated dietary risk assessment revealed that obvious dietary health hazards of DM and λ-CHT pesticides when sprayed on cauliflower for pest control. The use of green chemical photosensitisers (mint extract and riboflavin) in combination with UV light irradiation represents a novel, sustainable, and safe approach to pesticide reduction in produce."
https://openalex.org/W3208739576,"We aimed to apply the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to increase effectiveness and sustainability of the World Health Organization’s (WHOs) hand hygiene (HH) guidelines within healthcare systems. Our cross-sectional, mixed-methods study took place at Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC), a tertiary care hospital in Jimma, Ethiopia, between November 2018 and August 2020 and consisted of three phases: baseline assessment, intervention, and follow-up assessment. We conducted questionnaires addressing HH knowledge and attitudes, interviews to identify HH barriers and facilitators within the SEIPS framework, and observations at the WHO’s 5 moments of HH amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) at JUMC. We then implemented HH interventions based on WHO guidelines and results from our baseline assessment. Follow-up HH observations were conducted months later during the Covid-19 pandemic. 250 HCWs completed questionnaires with an average knowledge score of 61.4% and attitude scores indicating agreement that HH promotes patient safety. Interview participants cited multiple barriers to HH including shortages and location of HH materials, inadequate training, minimal Infection Prevention Control team presence, and high workload. We found an overall baseline HH compliance rate of 9.4% and a follow-up compliance rate of 72.1%. Drastically higher follow-up compared to baseline compliance rates were likely impacted by our HH interventions and Covid-19. HCWs showed motivation for patient safety despite low HH knowledge. Utilizing the SEIPS model helped identify institution-specific barriers that informed targeted interventions beyond WHO guidelines aimed at increasing effectiveness and sustainability of HH efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3209240800,"The development of “CC30A CH 4 -CO 2 combined analyzer” with infrared gas sensor as the core detection device can be widely used in online gas component analysis. In data analysis, the maximum value and arithmetic mean of the sensor data for each test period are not effective value. The characteristics of the dynamic data are: (1) Each DAW completes one test for one parameter, there is a unique effective value; (2) In test state, the fluctuation of the sensor value gradually decreases when approaching to the end of the test. An effective value calculation model was designed using the method of dimensionality reduction of dynamic data. The model was based on the distribution characteristics of the process data, and consists of 4 key steps: (1) Identify the Data Analysis Window (DAW) and build DAW dataset; (2) Calculate the value of optimal DAW dataset segmentation and build DAW subdataset; (3) Calculate the arithmetic mean (M c ) and count the amount of data in each subdataset (F c ), and build the optimal segmentation statistical set; (4) Effective value calculation and error evaluation. Calculation result with 50 sets of monitor data conformed that the EVC model for dynamic data of gas online monitoring meets the requirements of experimental accuracy requirements and test error. This method can be independently calculated without relying on the feedback information of the monitoring device, and it has positive significance for using the algorithm to reduce the hardware design complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3209809215,"This study investigated the agreement of intraocular pressure measurements using rebound tonometry and applanation tonometry in response to atmospheric changes in a hyperbaric chamber. Twelve eyes of 12 healthy subjects were included in this prospective, comparative, single-masked study. Intraocular pressure measurements were performed by rebound tonometry followed by applanation tonometry in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber at 1 Bar, followed by 2, 3 and 4 Bar during compression and again at 3 and 2 Bar during decompression. Mean differences between rebound and applanation intraocular pressure measurements were 1.6, 1.7, and 2.1 mmHg at 2, 3, and 4 Bar respectively during compression and 2.6 and 2.2 mmHg at 3 and 2 Bar during decompression. Lower limits of agreement ranged from -3.7 to -5.9 mmHg and upper limits ranged from -0.3 to 1.9 mmHg. Multivariate analysis showed that the differences between rebound and applanation intraocular pressure measurements were independent of atmospheric pressure changes (p = 0.79). Intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry shows a systematic difference compared to intraocular measured by applanation tonometry, but this difference is not influenced by changes of atmospheric pressure up to 4 Bar in a hyperbaric chamber. Agreement in magnitude of change between devices suggests rebound tonometry is viable for assessing intraocular pressure during atmospheric changes. Future studies should be designed in consideration of expected differences in IOP values provided by the two devices."
