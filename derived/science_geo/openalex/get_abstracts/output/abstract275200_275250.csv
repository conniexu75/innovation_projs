https://openalex.org/W2093793501,"The recently discovered homologous series HgBa(2)Can-1 Cun O2n+2+delta possesses remarkable properties. A superconducting transition temperature, T(c), as high as 133 kelvin has been measured in a multiphase Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O sample and found to be attributable to the Hg-1223 compound. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on a (> 95%) pure Hg-1223 phase are reported. These data show that T(c) increases steadily with pressure at a rate of about 1 kelvin per gigapascal up to 15 gigapascals, then more slowly and reaches a T(c) = 150 kelvin, with the onset of the transition at 157 kelvin, for 23.5 gigapascals. This large pressure variation (as compared to the small effects observed in similar compounds with the optimal T(c)) strongly suggests that higher critical temperatures could be obtained at atmospheric pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2009534730,"Much of the interstellar gas resides in photodissociation regions whose chemistry and energy balance is controlled by the flux of far-ultraviolet radiation upon them. These photons can ionize and dissociate molecules and heat the gas through the photoelectric effect working on dust grains. These regions have been extensively modeled theoretically, but detailed observational studies are few. Mapping of the prominent Orion Bar photodissociation region at wavelengths corresponding to the carbon-hydrogen stretching mode of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the 1-0 S(1) line of molecular hydrogen, and the J = 1-0 rotational line of carbon monoxide allows the penetration of the far-ultraviolet radiation into the cloud to be traced. The results strongly support the theoretical models and show conclusively that the incident far-ultraviolet radiation field, not shocks as has sometimes been proposed, is responsible for the emission in the Orion Bar."
https://openalex.org/W2086303915,"Oceanographic observations from the Ice Station Weddell 1 show that the western rim of the Weddell Gyre contributes to Weddell Sea Bottom Water. A thin (< 300 meters), highly oxygenated benthic layer is composed of a low-salinity type of bottom water overlying a high-salinity component. This complex layering disappears near 66 degrees S because of vertical mixing and further inflow from the continental margin. The bottom water flowing out of the western rim is a blend of the two types. Additionally, the data show that a narrow band of warmer Weddell Deep Water hugged the continental margin as it flowed into the western rim, providing the continental margin with the salt required for bottom-water production."

The vortex lattice is triangular for all angles, and for angles less than or equal to 70 degrees its orientation adjusts itself to maximize the pinning energy to densely and highly regularly spaced twin planes. These observations have important implications for the microscopic flux-pinning mechanism, and hence for the critical current achievable in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7). For large angles (about 80 degrees) the vortex lattice consists of independent chains in the orientation predicted by anisotropic London theory."

https://openalex.org/W2008889599,"Phosphatized univalves, recovered from the Lower Cambrian ( approximately 530 million years old) Qiongzhusi Formation in southern China, are recognized as early instars belonging to bradoriid ostracodes whose later instars are bivalved. The univalved form is the primitive larval character for shell-secreting crustaceans, although most post-Cambrian ostracodes bypassed this developmental phase. The univalved-bivalved transition during early on-togeny represents an important evolutionary event in ostracodes, with implications for crustacean classification, and implies that the ostracode ancestor achieved this bivalved capacity before the appearance of mineralized skeletons during the ""Cambrian explosion."""

https://openalex.org/W2093674971,"THE discovery in 1883 by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and myself that the toxic principles of the venoms of serpents are albuminous marked an era in the chemistry, physiology and pathology of proteins, and among other things laid the foundation of our knowledge of bacterial and other toxalbumins. Since that time our information of the properties of albuminous substances, then extremely meager and somewhat chaotic, has greatly advanced, and many investigations have been made to determine the precise nature of these poisons, with the effect of more or less modifying the statements we then set forth. The astonishing fact that these terribly lethal substances were found by the tests of the day to be proteins, and that apart from their toxic properties they were indistinguishable from corresponding bodies that are ingested as food or derived therefrom by the processes of digestion, or found as normal constituents of the living tissues generally, naturally led me to much speculation and ultimately to the pursuit of the very elaborate series of researches that I have been carrying on during the past decade under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, reports of two of which have appeared as Publications Nos. 116 and 173. It would be futile for me to attempt within the necessarily restricted time that can reasonably be allotted to the reading of a communication to present in a satisfactory form even the briefest summary of the very voluminous results and conclusions that are embodied in these works, or even an outline of"
