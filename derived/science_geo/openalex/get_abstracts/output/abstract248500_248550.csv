In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.

This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations. Gene expression involves a succession of probabilistic events: DNA continually undergoes conformational changes, repressors and transcription factors randomly bind and fall off their operators and promoters, and transcription and translation are complex at the levels of initiation, elongation, and termination (Kaern et al., 2005Kaern M. Elston T.C. Blake W.J. Collins J.J. Stochasticity in gene expression: from theories to phenotypes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Even in a hypothetically constant and homogeneous intracellular environment, this complexity would produce random fluctuations in the number of mRNAs and proteins per cell, constituting “noise” that cells must either exploit, learn to live with, or overcome using various noise-suppression mechanisms. The last three decades have seen numerous probabilistic models of gene expression. Most fall into one of two categories. Some focus on how spontaneous small-number Poisson fluctuations in mRNA levels enslave the levels of their encoded proteins, possibly through bursts of translation (Berg, 1978Berg O.G.

Others instead focus on how mRNA fluctuations in turn are enslaved by random changes in gene activity and possible bursts of transcription (Blake et al., 2003Blake W.J. Kaern M. Cantor C.R.

Prasad T. A stochastic-model of gene activation and RNA-synthesis during embryogenesis.Sankhya—the Indian Journal of Statistics Series B. 1987; 49: 51-67Google Scholar). The corresponding experimental interpretations have been similarly divided between these two categories. The first quantitative study, using a single GFP reporter in Bacillus subtilis, interpreted the results in terms of small-number mRNA fluctuations and translation bursts (Ozbudak et al., 2002Ozbudak E.M. Thattai M. Kurtser I. Grossman A.D. van Oudenaarden A. Regulation of noise in the expression of a single gene.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). A second E. coli study used correlations between dual fluorescent reporters and similarly interpreted the inherent randomness of gene expression (termed “intrinsic noise”) in terms of small-number mRNA fluctuations (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Stochastic gene expression in a single cell.Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar, Swain et al., 2002Swain P.S. Elowitz M.B. Siggia E.D. Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to stochasticity in gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12795-12800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, on the other hand, the first single-reporter study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested a substantial contribution from chromatin remodeling, producing quantal transcription bursts (Blake et al., 2003Blake W.J. Kaern M. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Noise in eukaryotic gene expression.Nature. 2003; 422: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). A follow-up dual-reporter study (Raser and O'Shea, 2004Raser J.M. O'Shea E.K. Control of stochasticity in eukaryotic gene expression.Science. 2004; 304: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae greatly elaborated on these results and also suggested a substantial contribution from transcriptional bursting. Because chromatin remodeling is eukaryote specific, this has been suggested as a possible difference between these two domains of life (Blake et al., 2003Blake W.J. Kaern M. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Noise in eukaryotic gene expression.Nature. 2003; 422: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). A difficulty when analyzing the randomness of gene expression is that existing single-cell techniques only allow accurate quantitation of protein levels, while mRNA fluctuations are at best estimated qualitatively (Le et al., 2005Le T.T. Harlepp S. Guet C.C. Dittmar K. Emonet T. Pan T. Cluzel P. Real-time RNA profiling within a single bacterium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Tolker-Nielsen et al., 1998Tolker-Nielsen T. Holmstrom K. Boe L. Molin S. Non-genetic population heterogeneity studied by in situ polymerase chain reaction.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another difficulty is that single molecules of GFP are generally undetectable in vivo due to background fluorescence. With rare exceptions (Rosenfeld et al., 2005Rosenfeld N. Young J.W. Alon U. Swain P.S. Elowitz M.B. Gene regulation at the single-cell level.Science. 2005; 307: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), fluorescence data therefore do not report the actual number of molecules but rather a quantity that is roughly proportional to that number. This makes it harder to test stochastic models critically, where relative fluctuations depend on average numbers. Furthermore, the important molecules to count are the ones that contribute small-number fluctuations. If proteins are present in thousands of copies and protein fluctuations instead come from having low numbers of the corresponding mRNAs, then it is the mRNA that must be counted. Many studies have indeed attributed protein randomness to the low number of transcripts, but these studies were indirect, typically estimating protein distributions, altering experimental parameters, and using models to infer the source of fluctuations from the changes in the variance. This is in principal a valid approach and has produced many important insights, but a serious problem is that the same type of response in the variance tends to be consistent with very different kinetic explanations (Paulsson, 2004Paulsson J. Summing up the noise in gene networks.Nature. 2004; 427: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Here, we address transcriptional bursting in prokaryotes by directly counting the integer-valued number of stabilized mRNA transcripts in living E. coli cells, i.e., without “filtering” transcriptional fluctuations through RNA degradation, translation into proteins, proteolysis, and chromophore maturation. We also measure the physiological parameters of transcription with multiple methods and check all model assumptions quantitatively. The fluctuations in transcription are shown to scale as a Poisson process (variance proportional to average) but with substantially larger fluctuations. The fluctuations appear to come from transcriptional bursting, as suggested for eukaryotes. We also directly observe bursts from time-series data and show that the estimated distributions of both bursts and waiting times between events are perfectly consistent with expectations from the simplest models. Finally, by quantitatively comparing our findings to those of previous prokaryotic studies (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Stochastic gene expression in a single cell.Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar, Ozbudak et al., 2002Ozbudak E.M. Thattai M. Kurtser I. Grossman A.D. van Oudenaarden A. Regulation of noise in the expression of a single gene.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) we show that the raw data sets are perfectly consistent and that the present results extend the conclusions by identifying the source of mRNA fluctuations. In addition to the transcription results, we also study RNA partitioning at cell division and correlations between the levels of mRNAs and their encoded proteins. Partitioning is approximately binomial—as when individual transcripts segregate independently to identical daughters. The average number of proteins in a cell is shown to be proportional to the average number of mRNAs encoding that protein, something that is often assumed but rarely measured directly (for exceptions see Khodursky et al., 2000Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Yanofsky C.

Insights into the relation between mRNA and protein expression patterns: II. experimental observations in Escherichia coli.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In single cells, the correlations between mRNA and proteins were significantly weaker in more recently divided cells, consistent with the randomizing effect of segregation at cell division. The genetic ingredients of our system are illustrated in Figure 1A. An MS2-GFP fusion protein was used to tag transcripts as they were made. The transcript target, produced from a single-copy F plasmid, consists of the coding region for a red fluorescence protein, mRFP1, followed by a tandem array of 96 MS2 binding sites. The two components were under the control of inducible promoters. In a typical experiment, production of the fusion tag was first induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) to a growing culture. In experiments where arabinose was used, it was also preadded to obtain full induction of the ara system (Siegele and Hu, 1997Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Gene expression from plasmids containing the araBAD promoter at subsaturating inducer concentrations represents mixed populations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 8168-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were then induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and samples were taken at different time points and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Images of typical induced cells are shown in Figure 1B. Most cells contained green foci, each consisting of one or more tagged RNA molecules. Cells also expressed mRFP1. Figure 1C shows typical kinetics for the green (foci) and red (whole-cell) fluorescence levels, averaged over the cell population. RNA levels begin rising immediately after IPTG is added and approach a plateau after about 80 min. Protein levels rise more slowly, as expected: a stable protein should lag behind the mRNA, just as the mRNA lagged behind induction. The chromophore must also mature before fluorescence can be measured, adding at least a few minutes to the observed protein response (Campbell et al., 2002Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. A monomeric red fluorescent protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). At very low transcript levels, each mRNA molecule is detectable as a single focus occupied by 50–100 MS2-GFP molecules (Golding and Cox, 2004Golding I. Cox E.C. RNA dynamics in live Escherichia coli cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 11310-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but at higher levels what appears as a single focus may consist of several transcripts. Our way of estimating the number of mRNA molecules in the cell is to count the total number of bound MS2-GFP proteins. We therefore measured the total photon flux of all green foci above the cell background (see Experimental Procedures). This value was then normalized by the intensity of a single tagged RNA molecule—equal to the first peak in the intensity histogram (Figure 1D)—to calculate the number of transcripts per cell. The normalized intensity histogram for the number of transcripts per cell consists of a series of discrete peaks, each corresponding to the integer-valued number of individual mRNA molecules in the cell. This result is central to our approach: when estimating an integer-valued distribution of numbers of molecules using a continuous quantity like fluorescence, such well-separated peaks are an indication of the measurement's fidelity. We have optimized the MS2-GFP induction level to enable robust mRNA detection and measurement. This means that we must have sufficient MS2-GFP to saturate all RNA targets, but not too much MS2-GFP, which would create too high a fluorescent background level in the cell. We have found that there exists a large “dynamic range” of MS2-GFP (obtained by inducing the Tet controlled system for 0.5–2 hr at maximum induction), within which the above conditions are fulfilled. Based on fluorescence measurements (6 different experiments, >2700 cells), each cell contains ∼104 MS2-GFP molecules (approximately ∼10 μM) in this induction range. Of these molecules, typically only 3%–4% are bound to RNA targets, with a maximum fraction of ∼10% at the highest RNA levels (>10 transcripts per cell). These percentages are consistent with the fact that the MS2-GFP gene is located on a ColE1 plasmid, with a copy-number >50 times higher than the plasmid carrying the RNA-coding target, and expressed from a stronger promoter (Lutz and Bujard, 1997Lutz R. Bujard H. Independent and tight regulation of transcriptional units in Escherichia coli via the LacR/O, the TetR/O and AraC/I1–I2 regulatory elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Because the dissociation constant between MS2 coat protein and our version of the binding site is in the ∼nM range (Johansson et al., 1998Johansson H.E. Dertinger D. LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Greef C.H. Uhlenbeck O.C. A thermodynamic analysis of the sequence-specific binding of RNA by bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 9244-9249Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), all of the target RNAs are expected to be saturated by the MS2-GFP pool, i.e., the occupancy of MS2 binding sites is expected to be close to 100%. In agreement with this view, population measurements show that cells with above-median RNA levels exhibit only a slightly lower (5%–10% difference) level of unbound green fluorescence compared to cells with below-median RNA levels. At the single-cell level, the appearance of a new mRNA is usually not accompanied by a detectable decrease in cell background fluorescence. To check that the estimation of mRNA levels is consistent with other methods, we compared single-cell measurements to three other indicators of gene expression: quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), levels of the proteins encoded by the RNA transcripts, and luciferase levels measured from the same promoter as reported in the literature (Lutz and Bujard, 1997Lutz R. Bujard H. Independent and tight regulation of transcriptional units in Escherichia coli via the LacR/O, the TetR/O and AraC/I1–I2 regulatory elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). Fluorescence measurements are in good agreement with the other indicators over most of the induction range. The agreement with QPCR further strengthens our belief that absolute levels of message copy number have been reliably estimated. In addition to the integer-valued peaks in the photon-flux histograms and the comparisons with standard measures of gene activity (QPCR for RNA, fluorescence and luciferase for protein), a series of additional experimental controls (detailed below) points to the fidelity of our measurements: (1) the observed statistics of RNA partitioning is approximately Binomial up to at least n = 15 (see Figure 3D). A similar protein experiment (Rosenfeld et al., 2005Rosenfeld N. Young J.W. Alon U. Swain P.S. Elowitz M.B. Gene regulation at the single-cell level.Science. 2005; 307: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) used such statistics to estimate protein numbers, even without counting the number of molecules. (2) The adjustment to steady state follows a first-order model (Figure 2A). (3) We observe proportionality between RNA and protein levels (Figure 4) over a broad range of induction. These points are discussed in more detail in the following sections. Another possible concern is whether the long array of 96 MS2 binding sites (96 bs) hinders proper transcription and translation. To examine that, we measured expression levels (as indicated by red fluorescence of the individual cells) from two modified constructs, both having the same genetic background (pTRUEBLUE-BAC2 plasmid with Plac/ara promoter) as our mRFP1 + 96 bs construct: (1) a plasmid carrying the mRFP1 gene only, without the MS2 binding sites array. In this case, the protein levels obtained are almost indistinguishable from those of the original construct: [R]/[R + 96 bs] = 0.82 ± 0.28 (two experiments, 310 cells; where [ ] denotes mRFP1 fluorescence level). (2) A plasmid in which the mRFP1 gene is located downstream of the 96bs array, instead of upstream as in the original construct—in this case, there is a slight repression of the expression level (3.0 ± 0.3-fold; 3 experiments, 240 cells). Considering the length of the transcript on the 5′ side of the gene (∼4 kb), this is a small polarity effect (Li and Altman, 2004Li Y. Altman S. Polarity effects in the lactose operon of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with additional data pointing at the normal behavior of the transcript: (1) we measured in two different ways the kinetics of mRNA chain elongation in the GFP-tagged (=MS2 bs array) portion of the transcript. This was done by measuring the increase in fluorescent signal (Figure 3A) and by measuring the physical elongation of the transcript (Golding and Cox, 2004Golding I. Cox E.C. RNA dynamics in live Escherichia coli cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 11310-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Both methods reveal a very similar chain elongation rate, close to the rates estimated from in vivo population studies (Ryals et al., 1982Ryals J. Little R. Bremer H. Temperature dependence of RNA synthesis parameters in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 879-887PubMed Google Scholar) and from in vitro single-molecule studies (Shaevitz et al., 2003Shaevitz J.W. Abbondanzieri E.A. Landick R. Block S.M. Backtracking by single RNA polymerase molecules observed at near-base-pair resolution.Nature. 2003; 426: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This result implies that the 96 bs array behaves as a normal transcript with regards to its transcription kinetics. (2) As described above, we also examined the “dose response” of the two coding regions of our transcript: the mRFP1 gene (as measured by cell red fluorescence) and the 96 bs array (as measured by localized green fluorescence). As shown in Figure 1E, their behavior is very similar, again indicating that the 96-mer does not seriously perturb the dynamics of transcription. Before analyzing statistics in single cells, it is helpful to demonstrate that the average dynamics behave as expected. Figure 2A shows the average number of transcripts per cell 〈n〉 as a function of the time after induction t. Under full induction, 〈n(t)〉 starts at 〈n〉 << 1 at t = 0 and approaches a steady-state value of 〈n〉≈10 after approximately 100 min. This level is then maintained for many cell generations. To interpret the average induction curve, we assumed a constant rate of production k1 and first-order elimination with rate constant k2:ddt〈n〉=k1−k2〈n〉.(1) Solving Equation 1 yields:〈n(t)〉=k1k2(1−e−k2t)⇒〈n(∞)〉−〈n(t)〉〈n(∞)〉−〈n(0)〉=e−k2t.(2) The second formulation in Equation 2 shows that the relative deviation from steady state decreases exponentially and independently of k1, i.e., the dynamic response is set by the elimination rate constant, not by the synthesis rate constant. Parameter k2 can thus be determined independently of k1. Figure 2A compares the experimental response with the theoretical curve defined by Equation 2, showing that indeed the data is well characterized by a single exponential approach to steady state. For most mRNAs, elimination is dominated by degradation (Bernstein et al., 2002Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Global analysis of mRNA decay and abundance in Escherichia coli at single-gene resolution using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), while elimination through cell growth and division has a marginal effect. In our system, however, the binding of MS2-GFP, with a dissociation constant in the ∼nM range and corresponding dissociation times of ∼hours, (Johansson et al., 1998Johansson H.E. Dertinger D. LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Greef C.H. Uhlenbeck O.C. A thermodynamic analysis of the sequence-specific binding of RNA by bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 9244-9249Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), increases the transcript lifetime. When individual growing cells are followed, the mRNAs are “diluted away” when cells divide (see Figure 3A). In addition, when individual foci are followed for many generations, they exhibit a slow decrease in intensity (rate < 1 hr−1), consistent with the message slowly being “chewed up” and GFP molecules dissociating. Thus, cell division dominates the negative term in Equation 1. For consistency, the value of k2 should thus equal ln(2)/τg, where τg is the cell generation time. Indeed, the curve describing the approach to the steady state (Figure 2A, inset) is in good agreement with the value of k2 expected from our independently measured generation time: τg ≈ 50 min, k2 (measured) = 0.014 ± 0.002 min−1. We note that the stability of the transcript is highly advantageous for our purposes and allows us to study the randomness of transcription without convolving the results with the randomness of RNA degradation. Once the value of k2 has been determined, a value of k1 = 0.14 ± 0.02 min−1 follows immediately from the level of the steady state, 〈n(∞)〉 = k1/k2. To check that the same value of k1 accounts for the entire postinduction period and not just the steady state, we independently determined its value from the initial time points where Equations (1), (2) simplify to d〈n〉/dt ≈ k1 and 〈n(t)〉 ≈ k1t, that is, where so few transcripts have accumulated that elimination can be ignored. This produced a consistent value of k1 ≈ 0.10 ± 0.02 min−1. The simplest microscopic mechanism that produces a constant average rate of synthesis is the Poisson process, with constant probability per unit time of making a transcript. The probability for zero events then decreases exponentially with time, with the same rate constant that governs the average synthesis. If transcription truly were Poissonian, the fraction of cells where zero transcription events have occurred at time t after induction, P0(t), should follow:P0(t)=e−k1t.(3) Because we showed above that k1 ≫ k2, the effect of transcript elimination can initially be ignored. At short times t after induction, P0(t) can thus be estimated from the fraction of cells that contain zero transcripts. Figure 2B is the experimental estimate of P0(t) compared to the theoretical prediction, using the value of k1 that was determined from the average dynamics above. This shows that P0(t) indeed decreases exponentially, at least up to t ∼ τg where the test is expected to break down. However, the exponential decay rate is 0.032 ± 0.005 min−1, which is about four times (4.4 ± 1.4) smaller than the estimated value of k1 above. The underlying stochastic process is therefore not Poissonian, despite the fact that the first event occurs after an exponentially distributed lag. By counting the number of molecules per cell, the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in transcript levels can also be tested against the Poisson hypothesis that the variance equals the average (van Kampen, 1992van Kampen N.G. Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry.Rev. and Enlarged Edition. North-Holland, Amsterdam1992Google Scholar), σ2 = 〈n〉. Here, the cells grow and divide, and individual cells are sampled from an asynchronous population. Both complications can easily be built into the model, but to minimize complexity and reduce the number of parameters we instead normalized the measured numbers by the individual cell sizes (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Stochastic gene expression in a single cell.Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). The observed variance was then compared to model predictions assuming that elimination at cell division can be approximated by first-order exponential deaths (Thattai and van Oudenaarden, 2001Thattai M. van Oudenaarden A. Intrinsic noise in gene regulatory networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8614-8619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), producing σ2 ≈ 〈n〉 if the synthesis is truly Poissonian. Figure 2C is a histogram of measured mRNA numbers at various times after induction, and Figure 2D shows the variance at steady-state as a function of the average at different levels of induction. Over a 100-fold range, the variance is almost perfectly proportional to the average, as expected from a Poisson distribution. But the proportionality constant is again four times higher than expected (σ2 /〈n〉 = 4.1 ± 0.5). The linear-average dynamics with constant parameters, the exponentially distributed waiting times, and the proportionality between the variance and the average, are precisely the behaviors expected of Poisson processes and Poisson distributions. But by counting the individual molecules, we see that the actual numbers are"

Abeta aggregation is concentration dependent and brain region specific. Utilizing in vivo microdialysis concurrently with field potential recordings, we demonstrate that Abeta levels in the brain interstitial fluid are dynamically and directly influenced by synaptic activity on a timescale of minutes to hours. Using an acute brain slice model, we show that the rapid effects of synaptic activity on Abeta levels are primarily related to synaptic vesicle exocytosis. These results suggest that synaptic activity may modulate a neurodegenerative disease process, in this case by influencing Abeta metabolism and ultimately region-specific Abeta deposition. The findings also have important implications for treatment development."

Here we describe the identification of two ubiquitin (Ub)–binding domains (UBM and UBZ), which are evolutionarily conserved in all Y-family TLS polymerases (pols). These domains are required for binding of polη and polι to ubiquitin, their accumulation in replication factories, and their interaction with monoubiquitinated PCNA. Moreover, the UBZ domain of polη is essential to efficiently restore a normal response to ultraviolet irradiation in xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) fibroblasts. Our results indicate that Ub-binding domains of Y-family polymerases play crucial regulatory roles in TLS."

We showed that V. cholerae can acquire new genetic material by natural transformation during growth on chitin, a biopolymer that is abundant in aquatic habitats (e.g., from crustacean exoskeletons), where it lives as an autochthonous microbe. Transformation competence was found to require a type IV pilus assembly complex, a putative DNA binding protein, and three convergent regulatory cascades, which are activated by chitin, increasing cell density, and nutrient limitation, a decline in growth rate, or stress."

Yet it is increasingly clear that the tumor microenvironment can significantly influence tumorigenesis. For example, the mesenchyme can support the growth of tumorigenic epithelium. However, whether fibroblasts are subject to genetic/epigenetic changes as a result of selective pressures conferred by oncogenic stress in the epithelium has not been experimentally assessed. Recent analyses of some human carcinomas have shown tumor-suppressor gene mutations within the stroma, suggesting that the interplay among multiple cell types can select for aberrations nonautonomously during tumor progression. We demonstrate that this indeed occurs in a mouse model of prostate cancer where epithelial cell cycle disruption via cell-specific inhibition of pRb function induces a paracrine p53 response that suppresses fibroblast proliferation in associated stroma.

Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are critical in regulating many aspects of vertebrate embryo development, and studies have shown that input from the stroma is necessary not only for the development of many structures including the prostate (Cunha et al., 1996Cunha G.R.

Recently, the uterine stroma has been shown to mediate both developmental and estrogen-mediated changes in the epithelium, a process involving Wnt5a (Mericskay et al., 2004Mericskay M. Kitajewski J. Sassoon D. Wnt5a is required for proper epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the uterus.Development. 2004; 131: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme are believed to be mediated by paracrine signals and ECM components secreted from developing mesenchyme that affect adjacent epithelia (Cunha et al., 1980Cunha G.R. Reese B.A. Sekkingstad M.

In response to tumorigenesis in adjacent epithelial cells, fibroblasts, a major stromal component, also undergo changes that may alter the normal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (Bergers and Coussens, 2000Bergers G. Coussens L.M. Extrinsic regulators of epithelial tumor progression: metalloproteinases.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several experimental systems have further shown that such “cancer-associated” fibroblasts can enhance the tumorigenic properties of the epithelial compartment (Barcellos-Hoff and Ravani, 2000Barcellos-Hoff M.H.

However, whether the tumor mesenchyme undergoes selective genetic or epigenetic changes in specific loci in response to epithelial tumorigenesis and thus can coevolve has not been experimentally examined. Recently, several labs have reported the mutation of the tumor-suppressor genes, including p53, in the stromal compartment of human carcinomas. p53 is mutated in the most advanced forms of human cancers, comprising most tumor types (Levine et al., 1991Levine A.J.

In response to several stress signals, including oncogene activation, DNA damage, and physiological stress, p53 levels increase leading either to growth arrest or apoptosis (reviewed in Harris and Levine, 2005Harris S.L.

Live or let die: the cell's response to p53.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Because of its checkpoint roles, p53 inactivation can also contribute to tumorigenesis by propagation of genomic instability. The stimulation of angiogenesis has also been associated with p53 loss (Dameron et al., 1994Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N.

Although oncogenic stress (the induction of tumorigeneic properties) has previously been shown to cell-autonomously induce p53 responses (Vousden, 2002Vousden K.H. Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), leading to selective pressure for p53 inactivation and tumor progression, whether cell nonautonomous induction of p53 may play a role in tumor evolution has not been explored. Here, we uncover such a mechanism in the study of a genetically engineered spontaneous prostate cancer model. TgAPT121 mice develop extensive prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) as a result of inactivating pRb and related proteins p107 and p130 specifically in prostate epithelium by probasin-driven expression of T121 (a 121 aa N-terminal fragment of SV40 large T antigen). T121 fully inactivates pRb function by eliminating the redundancy/compensation provided by p107 and/or p130 commonly observed in the mouse (Dannenberg et al., 2000Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A.

We previously showed that T121-induced mPIN results from extensive aberrant epithelial proliferation accompanied by Pten-dependent apoptosis. By 4 months, mPIN lesions progress to microinvasive adenocarcinoma in all animals, a process that is accelerated in a Pten+/− background (Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the role, if any, for p53 in prostate cancer suppression, we examined the development of prostate lesions in TgAPT121 mice with alterations in the p53 genotype. Surprisingly, while epithelial apoptosis and proliferation is unaffected by p53 deficiency (Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a significant role for p53 in the mesenchyme was induced by the T121-initiated epithelium. Here, we examine the impact of this paracrine-selective pressure on tumor evolution. We assessed the role of p53 in prostate tumor suppression by examining the progression of tumors in TgAPT121 mice that were wild-type, heterozygous, or null for p53. Prostates of wild-type mice consist of normal glandular architecture with a single luminal epithelial cell layer (Figure 1A, arrow) and an underlying basal cell layer separated from surrounding stroma (Figure 1A, arrowhead) by a basement membrane (Shappell et al., 2004Shappell S.B. Thomas G.V. Roberts R.L. Herbert R. Ittmann M.M. Rubin M.A. Humphrey P.A. Sundberg J.P. Rozengurt N. Barrios R. et al.Prostate pathology of genetically engineered mice: definitions and classification. The consensus report from the Bar Harbor meeting of the Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium Prostate Pathology Committee.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2270-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). As previously reported (Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), TgAPT121;p53+/+ prostates, in which T121 is induced in the epithelium upon androgen induction at puberty, are extensively dysplastic by 2 months of age, with the epithelium characterized by nuclear atypia and loss of single-layer architecture (Figure 1B). In these mice, disease progression is reproducible and 100% penetrant, with widespread dysplasia becoming murine prostatic intraductal neoplasia (mPIN) and producing minimally invasive adenocarcinoma over time (Figure 1J; Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At early times (<3 months), TgAPT121;p53+/− prostates were indistinguishable from those of TgAPT121;p53+/+ littermates (Figures 1C and 1K), while the TgAPT121;p53−/− prostate epithelium was morphologically distinguishable in that nuclear atypia, including multinucleation, was more extensive with earlier onset (Figures 1D and 1L). Notably, subsequent to T121 expression in the epithelial compartment, p53-deficient TgAPT121 prostates contained an extensive hypercellular mesenchyme (Figure 1E, star), consistent with a strong stromal response upon p53 inactivation in one or more compartments. Importantly, p53−/− prostates are morphologically normal (not shown). Thus, these effects, including the mesenchymal response, are dependent on expression of the T121 exclusively in the epithelium (Figure 1I; Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a stromal p53 effect came from the analysis of tumor progression. In TgAPT121;p53+/− mice, distinct tumors emerged focally from the anterior prostate at 5 months of age (Figure 1F, arrows, and Figure 1K) and grew rapidly, becoming massive by about 7 months (Figure 1K). In addition to the adenocarcinoma histopathology observed in TgAPT121;p53+/+ prostates (Figure 1J; Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these tumors had developed an extensive abnormal mesenchyme (Figure 1G, star), which expressed fibroblast markers smooth muscle α actin (SMA; Figure 2D) and fibroblast-specific protein marker S100A4 (FSP; Strutz et al., 1995Strutz F. Okada H. Lo C.W. Danoff T. Carone R.L. Tomaszewski J.E. Neilson E.G. Identification and characterization of a fibroblast marker: FSP1.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar; Figure 2E). Cytokeratin (CK) 8 expression remained confined to the luminal epithelial cells (Figure 2C), indicating a true effect in the stroma and not an active epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT; Figure 2; n = 9). For comparison, TgAPT121;p53+/+ prostates at 12 weeks of age also show clear compartmental separation as verified by epithelial CK8 and mesenchymal SMA expression (Figures 2A and 2B, respectively). Morphologically, the prominent TgAPT121;p53+/− tumors could be classified as “phylloides-like” because of their resemblance to human breast and prostate phylloides tumors (Shappell et al., 2004Shappell S.B. Thomas G.V. Roberts R.L. Herbert R. Ittmann M.M. Rubin M.A. Humphrey P.A. Sundberg J.P. Rozengurt N. Barrios R. et al.Prostate pathology of genetically engineered mice: definitions and classification. The consensus report from the Bar Harbor meeting of the Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium Prostate Pathology Committee.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2270-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, unlike the usually benign human tumors, these tumors reached massive size, growing very rapidly (from 0.5 cm3 to > 2 cm3 over 4 weeks), engulfing many of the organs of the urogenital system and filling the abdominal cavity. Given this difference, these tumors are herein referred to as “stromal tumors,” although the epithelium also comprises a significant abnormal component. Importantly, similar stromal tumors were also observed in 44% of male TgAPT121;p53+/+ mice, but only after 11 months of age (Figure 1J). Thus, development of such tumors was facilitated by p53 heterozygosity but clearly required the APT121 transgene, since transgene negative p53 heterozygous prostates were fully normal (not shown). Furthermore, all TgAPT121;p53−/− mice developed similar stromal tumors even more rapidly by 11 weeks of age (Figures 1H and 1L). Since the stroma was significantly expanded in TgAPT121;p53−/− prostates early in life with early onset of stromal tumors and similar tumor development increased in frequency and was accelerated in a p53+/− relative to p53+/+ background, we hypothesized that initiating tumorigenesis in the epithelium by inactivation of pRb function had non-cell-autonomously elicited a p53-mediated response in the stromal fibroblasts resulting in the suppression of their proliferation. Thus, reduction or loss of p53 in one or both compartments facilitated fibroblast proliferation and tumor development. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the levels of cell proliferation and p53 expression in epithelial and stromal compartments prior to and after stromal tumor development in each background. Using Ki67 immunofluoresence (IF) to detect S phase cells, we confirmed that epithelial cells in all cases showed similar high levels of proliferation as previously determined (Figure 3; Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At 2 months of age, soon after transgene induction in prostate epithelium, TgAPT121;p53+/+ and TgAPT121;p53+/− prostatic mesenchyme rarely contained Ki67-positive cells (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3E). However, proliferating cells were readily detected by this age within TgAPT121;p53−/− mesenchyme (Figures 3C and 3E). In all TgAPT121 backgrounds, once stromal tumor masses were detectable, fibroblast proliferation was widespread (Figure 3D), with Ki67-positive cells comprising about 50% of that population (Figure 3E). To further define the relationship between p53 and the emergence of abnormal mesenchyme, we examined p53 expression by IF in prostates of all genotypes, early and after progression. In nontransgenic prostates, p53 was undetectable in both epithelium and stroma (Figure 4A). However, in the transgenic mice, where T121 was expressed specifically in the epithelium, the epithelial cells and a subset of mesenchymal cells expressed p53 (n = 10; Figure 4B), consistent with an induced p53 response in both compartments. It is currently unclear what the relevant p53 response(s) is (are) in epithelium, since neither apoptosis nor proliferation is affected by p53 deficiency (Hill et al., 2005Hill R. Song Y. Carrdiff R.D. Van Dyke T. Heterogeneous tumor evolution initiated by loss of pRb function in a preclinical prostate cancer model.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10243-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in the mesenchyme, p53 induction appears to suppress fibroblast proliferation, since these fibroblasts proliferate in a p53-deficient background (compare Figure 3, Figure 4). This mechanism was confirmed by the analysis of emerging stromal tumors in TgAPT121;p53+/− prostates, where loss of p53 expression occurred specifically in the abundant stromal layers harboring proliferating fibroblasts while being retained in the epithelium (n = 18; Figures 4C and 4D). Loss of fibroblast p53 expression was not restricted to the p53 heterozygous background, as mesenchyme from histologically identical tumors arising in TgAPT121;p53+/+ prostates had also undergone loss of p53 expression (n = 8; Figure 4E). To determine whether loss of p53 expression could have resulted from the selection of fibroblasts that inactivated p53 by genetic mutation, stromal regions of TgAPT121;p53+/− tumors were isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and assayed by PCR for the presence of p53 wild-type and null alleles (Figures 4F–4H). Strikingly, in four of six tumors analyzed, proliferating stroma had selectively lost the wild-type p53 allele (p < 0.0001 by Binomial exact test; Figure 4H), while nonproliferative stromal regions associated with mPIN retained the wild-type p53 allele (Figure 4H, control stroma). Moreover, when similar tumors arising in TgAPT121;p53+/+ prostates were analyzed for the number of p53 gene copies present in the proliferative mesenchyme by quantitative PCR analyses, most had undergone allele reduction (Table 1). Of 11 LCM-stromal samples from 11 independent tumors, seven carried only a single p53 copy while two had lost both copies. Two samples retained both p53 copies. Statistical analysis showed loss of a single or both copies of p53 to be highly significant (p < 0.0001) by the Binomial exact test. These data support the hypothesis that epithelial tumor initiation by cell cycle disruption places a strong selective pressure on the mesenchyme for loss of p53 function.Table 1Loss of Wild-Type p53 Alleles in Stromal Tumors of TgAPT121 MiceTissueGenotype2−ΔΔCtNumber of Wild-Type p53 AllelesMusclep53+/+1.4732Musclep53+/+0.6792Musclep53+/−0.5241Musclep53+/−0.5931Musclep53−/−0.1120Stromal tumor 1APT121;p53+/+0.3171Stromal tumor 2APT121;p53+/+0.5671Stromal tumor 3APT121;p53+/+0.3771Stromal tumor 4APT121;p53+/+0.5791Stromal tumor 5APT121;p53+/+0.6702Stromal tumor 6APT121;p53+/+0.3981Stromal tumor 7APT121;p53+/+1.0512Stromal tumor 8APT121;p53+/+0.0350Stromal tumor 9APT121;p53+/+0.2851Stromal tumor 10APT121;p53+/+0.0460Stromal tumor 11APT121;p53+/+0.5341Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on DNA extracted from LCM samples to determine the status of wild-type p53 alleles in stromal tumors or tissues of TgAPT121 mice.

Loss of a single and both copies of wild-type p53 was statistically significant by Binomial exact test (p < 0.0001) assuming a random probability of 1%. Open table in a new tab Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on DNA extracted from LCM samples to determine the status of wild-type p53 alleles in stromal tumors or tissues of TgAPT121 mice. LCM muscle samples were used as controls. Among 11 stromal tumor samples from 11 distinct animals, seven showed loss of one wild-type allele of p53, two showed loss of both alleles of p53, while two retained both wild-type alleles. ΔΔCt = (sample Ct[p53] − sample Ct[β-actin]) − (p53+/+ control Ct[p53] − p53+/+ control Ct[β-actin]). Ct = the number of cycles required to reach a threshold value which is set within the exponential phase of the logarithmic scale amplification plot. Analysis of standard samples indicate that copy numbers of 2, 1, and 0 are indicated by 2−ΔΔCt values of >0.6, between 0.15 to 0.6, and <0.15, respectively. Loss of a single and both copies of wild-type p53 was statistically significant by Binomial exact test (p < 0.0001) assuming a random probability of 1%. Notably, subsequent to p53 loss in the mesenchyme, some epithelial regions also lost p53 expression (Figures 5A–5C), further supporting an as-yet-unknown p53 tumor suppressor function in this compartment as well. Indeed, these tumors are heterogeneous, and many distinct neoplastic cell populations often coexist in the same gland. Epithelial cells that had lost p53 expression were morphologically similar to those of TgAPT121;p53−/− prostate epithelium (Figure 1D) and produced lesions that were disorganized and pleiotropic compared to adjacent p53-positive epithelium (Figure 5A). Our knowledge of genetic and epigenetic changes affecting cancer progression derives largely from analyses of events within the “cancer cell” itself. Indeed, animal-model studies show that cancer initiation and progression can be modeled by engineering specific lesions targeted to the presumed cell of origin (reviewed in Van Dyke and Jacks, 2002Van Dyke T. Jacks T. Cancer modeling in the modern era: Progress and challenges.Cell. 2002; 108: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, sporadic human cancers evolve to harbor selective changes as a result of pressures imposed within a complex microenvironment. Each aberrant change can impact both the biology of the tumor cell and its surroundings (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20695) Google Scholar), creating new selective pressures that likely affect the natural course of cancer evolution. Thus, full understanding requires experimental assessment of these evolutionary dynamics that ultimately produce a tumor with all the properties of a “neoplastic organ.” Recent reports have suggested the presence of tumor-suppressor mutations in the stroma of some human epithelial cancers (carcinomas), indicating that the selection of aberrant cells within the microenvironment occurs, likely i"

https://openalex.org/W2005893109,"In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells trigger the p53-dependent transcriptional induction of factors that regulate DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, or cell survival. Through differential proteomics, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) as being rapidly induced by DNA damage in a manner that requires the DNA-damage signaling kinases ATM or ATR. Induction of hnRNP K ensues through the inhibition of its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase HDM2/MDM2. Strikingly, hnRNP K depletion abrogates transcriptional induction of p53 target genes and causes defects in DNA-damage-induced cell-cycle-checkpoint arrests. Furthermore, in response to DNA damage, p53 and hnRNP K are recruited to the promoters of p53-responsive genes in a mutually dependent manner. These findings establish hnRNP K as a new HDM2 target and show that, by serving as a cofactor for p53, hnRNP K plays key roles in coordinating transcriptional responses to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2007279797,"Activation of NF-κB following genotoxic stress allows time for DNA-damage repair and ensures cell survival accounting for acquired chemoresistance, an impediment to effective cancer therapy. Despite this clinical relevance, little is known about pathways that enable genotoxic-stress-induced NF-κB induction. Previously, we reported a role for the p53-inducible death-domain-containing protein, PIDD, in caspase-2 activation and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We now demonstrate that PIDD plays a critical role in DNA-damage-induced NF-κB activation. Upon genotoxic stress, a complex between PIDD, the kinase RIP1, and a component of the NF-κB-activating kinase complex, NEMO, is formed. PIDD expression enhances genotoxic-stress-induced NF-κB activation through augmented sumoylation and ubiquitination of NEMO. Depletion of PIDD and RIP1, but not caspase-2, abrogates DNA-damage-induced NEMO modification and NF-κB activation. We propose that PIDD acts as a molecular switch, controlling the balance between life and death upon DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2049427149,"We have investigated the role of pairing centers (PCs), cis-acting sites required for accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in C. elegans. We find that these sites play two distinct roles that contribute to proper segregation. Chromosomes lacking PCs usually fail to synapse and also lack a synapsis-independent stabilization activity. The presence of a PC on just one copy of a chromosome pair promotes synapsis but does not support synapsis-independent pairing stabilization, indicating that these functions are separable. Once initiated, synapsis is highly processive, even between nonhomologous chromosomes of disparate lengths, elucidating how translocations suppress meiotic recombination in C. elegans. These findings suggest a multistep pathway for chromosome synapsis in which PCs impart selectivity and efficiency through a ""kinetic proofreading"" mechanism. We speculate that concentration of these activities at one region per chromosome may have coevolved with the loss of a point centromere to safeguard karyotype stability."

To examine the dosage effect of telomerase, we generated a line of mTR+/− mice on the CAST/EiJ background, which has short telomeres. Interbreeding of heterozygotes resulted in progressive telomere shortening, indicating that limiting telomerase compromises telomere maintenance. In later-generation heterozygotes, we observed a decrease in tissue renewal capacity in the bone marrow, intestines, and testes that resembled defects seen in dyskeratosis congenita patients. The progressive worsening of disease with decreasing telomere length suggests that short telomeres, not telomerase level, cause stem cell failure. Further, wild-type mice derived from the late-generation heterozygous parents, termed wt∗, also had short telomeres and displayed a germ cell defect, indicating that telomere length determines these phenotypes.

Autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita is a disease of stem cell failure due to telomere shortening. Affected individuals exhibit symptoms that appear to be due to limited cellular reserves in tissues of high turnover. The primary cause of death is due to complications of aplastic anemia or loss of bone marrow stem cells (Dokal, 2000Dokal I. Dyskeratosis congenita in all its forms.Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Additionally, patients develop abnormal skin pigmentation, premature graying, enteropathy, hypogonadism, and an increased cancer predisposition. Families with autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita have mutations in telomerase components (Vulliamy et al., 2001Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Goldman F. Dearlove A. Bessler M. Mason P.J. Dokal I.

Dyskeratosis congenita in all its forms.Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, Vulliamy et al., 2004Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in families with dyskeratosis congenita due to mutations in TERC.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Telomere length is normally maintained by the enzyme telomerase. In the absence of telomerase, telomeres shorten progressively due to the end replication problem and telomere end processing (Greider, 1996Greider C.W. Telomere length regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, Lingner and Cech, 1998Lingner J. Cech T.R. Telomerase and chromosome end maintenance.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Telomerase adds a simple tandem repeated sequence onto chromosome ends to balance this shortening (Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts.Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). The telomerase core enzyme consists of two essential components: telomerase RNA, TR, which contains the template for repeat addition, and the catalytic component telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT (Lingner et al., 1997Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Reverse transcriptase motifs in the catalytic subunit of telomerase.Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). In addition to families with dyskeratosis congenita, mutations in both hTR and hTERT have been described in familial and apparently sporadic cases of aplastic anemia where only hematologic phenotypes have been described (Vulliamy et al., 2002Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Dokal I. Mason P.J.

Med. 2005; 352: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Since these phenotypes likely represent a milder spectrum of dyskeratosis congenita, we will refer to individuals with these phenotypes as having dyskeratosis congenita. The loss of stem cells in these individuals with mutations in telomerase components has implicated telomere length as a determinant of stem cell maintenance (Dokal, 2000Dokal I. Dyskeratosis congenita in all its forms.Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In the absence of telomerase, mice show progressive telomere shortening with increased generations of interbreeding (Blasco et al., 1997Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P.M. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Telomere shortening and tumor formation by mouse cells lacking telomerase RNA.Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In the first generation of telomerase deficiency, mTR−/− G1 mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background show no overt phenotypes. However with further interbreeding, a series of phenotypes appear and worsen as telomere shortening continues. This increased severity of disease resembles the anticipation seen in autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita (Vulliamy et al., 2004Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in families with dyskeratosis congenita due to mutations in TERC.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Short telomeres in mice that lack telomerase cause apoptosis. This apoptosis is due to short dysfunctional telomeres triggering a DNA-damage checkpoint response (Hemann et al., 2001aHemann M.T. Rudolph L. Strong M. DePinho R.A. Chin L. Greider C.W.

In mice, the apoptosis leads to loss of germ cells and consequently decreased fertility with each generation (Lee et al., 1998Lee H.-W. Blasco M.A. Gottlieb G.J. Horner J.W. Greider C.W. DePinho R.A.

The shortest telomere, not average telomere length, is critical for cell viability and chromosome stability.Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Evidence from both human and mouse suggests that haploinsufficiency for the telomerase RNA may cause telomere shortening. A telomerase RNA truncation in an autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita family results in half of the level of hTR and causes telomere shortening (Vulliamy et al., 2001Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Goldman F. Dearlove A. Bessler M. Mason P.J. Dokal I. The RNA component of telomerase is mutated in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita.Nature. 2001; 413: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Families with autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita show progressive telomere shortening with each generation and a more severe and earlier onset of disease (Vulliamy et al., 2004Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in families with dyskeratosis congenita due to mutations in TERC.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Further, point mutations in hTR found in dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia patients show reduced telomerase activity in vitro (Marrone et al., 2004Marrone A. Stevens D. Vulliamy T. Dokal I. Mason P.J.

Functional characterization of telomerase RNA variants found in patients with hematologic disorders.Blood. 2005; 105: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, haploinsufficiency is also observed when the protein component of telomerase, hTERT, is deficient (Armanios et al., 2005Armanios M. Chen J.-L. Chang Y.P. Brodsky R.A. Hawkins A. Griffen C.A. Eshleman J.R. Cohen A.R. Chakravarti A. Hamosh A. Greider C.W.

Mutations in TERT, the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase, in aplastic anemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In mice that are heterozygous for mTR there is reduced ability to elongate short telomeres in interspecies crosses between strains with short telomeres and those with long telomeres (Hathcock et al., 2002Hathcock K.S. Hemann M.T. Opperman K.K. Strong M.A. Greider C.W. Hodes R.J. Haploinsufficiency of mTR results in defects in telomere elongation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally the mTERT knockout mouse shows progressive telomere shortening and an increased severity of phenotypes as seen in the mTR−/− mice (Erdmann et al., 2004Erdmann N. Liu Y. Harrington L. Distinct dosage requirements for the maintenance of long and short telomeres in mTert heterozygous mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6080-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data argue that the level of telomerase activity, altered by either perturbation in TR or TERT, affects the maintenance of telomere length in vivo. Telomere lengths show a wide variation in the human population (Harley et al., 1990Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W.

Med. 2005; 352: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Individual variation in telomerase activity may account for part of this variability. Such variability, even in cells that express telomerase, may limit tissue renewal in normal individuals. For example, although mature B and T cells, as well as CD34+ cells, express telomerase (Morrison et al., 1996Morrison S.J. Prowse K.R. Ho P. Weissman I.L. Telomerase activity in hematopoietic cells is associated with self-renewal potential.Immunity. 1996; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), telomere shortening occurs in white blood cells with increasing age (Wynn et al., 1998Wynn R.F. Cross M.A. Hatton C. Will A.M. Lashford L.S. Dexter T.M. Testa N.G.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This suggests that the level of telomerase expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells is not sufficient to maintain telomere length. Recent evidence also suggests an association between telomere shortening and the risk of death due to age-related diseases such as heart disease and infection (Cawthon et al., 2003Cawthon R.M. Smith K.R. O'Brien E. Sivatchenko A. Kerber R.A.

To examine directly whether telomerase dosage affects telomere length and disease phenotypes, we created mice heterozygous for a null allele of telomerase RNA in a strain that already has short telomeres. The telomere length distribution in this CAST/EiJ strain is short and more homogeneous similar to human telomere lengths (Hemann and Greider, 2000Hemann M.T. Greider C.W. Wild-derived inbred mouse strains have short telomeres.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Successive breeding of CAST/EiJ mTR+/− heterozygous mice resulted in progressive telomere shortening that was seen as organ failure in tissues of high turnover similar to dyskeratosis congenita patients. Further, we find that the wild-type littermates, wt∗, derived from later-generation heterozygotes that inherit short telomeres also displayed phenotypes associated with telomere dysfunction. We consider this phenomenon a form of occult genetic disease. We refer to these mice as wt∗ since the genotype at the responsible locus, mTR, is wild-type in the affected individuals who inherited short telomeres from mTR+/− heterozygous parents. The presence of disease in wt∗ animals indicates that loss of telomere function can occur in the presence of normal levels of telomerase. To critically examine whether haploinsufficiency for telomerase causes telomere dysfunction, we crossed the mTR null allele onto the CAST/EiJ genetic background that has a short homogeneous telomere length distribution (see Experimental Procedures). After establishing a line of CAST/EiJ mTR+/− mice, these heterozygotes were intercrossed to obtain mTR+/+, mTR+/−, and mTR−/− animals. The heterozygous mice from this initial CAST/EiJ cross, designated mTR+/− HG1, were then intercrossed to generate mTR+/− HG2 animals, which were further intercrossed to generate mTR+/− HG3, HG4, HG5, and HG6 mice (Figure 1A). We have previously shown that mTR+/− mice express half of the steady-state level of telomerase RNA (Hathcock et al., 2002Hathcock K.S. Hemann M.T. Opperman K.K. Strong M.A. Greider C.W. Hodes R.J. Haploinsufficiency of mTR results in defects in telomere elongation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate whether haploinsufficiency for telomerase RNA leads to telomere shortening, we examined telomere length by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). CAST/EiJ mTR−/− mice had significantly shorter telomeres than wild-type. Furthermore, successive generations of CAST/EiJ mTR+/− heterozygous mice showed progressive telomere shortening (Figure 1B). The fact that the telomeres in the heterozygotes were intermediate between wild-type and mTR−/− mice indicates that telomerase is present and elongates some telomeres but the level is not sufficient to maintain telomeres at wild-type lengths. The decrease in the mean telomere length was associated with an increase in signal free ends (SFE) (Figure 1C). These signal free ends represent dysfunctional telomeres and correlate with cell death and chromosome rearrangements (Hemann et al., 2001bHemann M.T. Strong M. Hao L.-Y. Greider C.W. The shortest telomere, not average telomere length, is critical for cell viability and chromosome stability.Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The progressive telomere shortening with later generations of mTR+/− mice is similar to the phenomenon of genetic anticipation that is seen in autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita (Vulliamy et al., 2004Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in families with dyskeratosis congenita due to mutations in TERC.Nat.

USA. 2005; 102: 15960-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This telomere shortening and the increase in signal free ends further confirms that the CAST/EiJ mTR+/− mice are haploinsufficient for telomere-length maintenance. The CAST/EiJ mTR−/− mice showed a dramatic decrease in survival compared to wild-type animals (Figure 2A). Such a reduction in survival was not seen in C57BL/6J mTR−/− mice (Rudolph et al., 1999Rudolph K.L. Chang S. Lee H.W. Blasco M. Gottlieb G.J. Greider C. DePinho R.A.

Pathology examination revealed intestinal lesions, which included severe depletion of the intestinal epithelial crypts and villus atrophy/loss in the small intestine. Histological sections of the large and small intestines in mTR−/− G1 and G2 animals showed multifocal to coalescing areas of crypt depletion. Villus atrophy was present in the small intestine in 7 of 7 mTR−/− mice (Figure 2C). The atrophy occupied 19% of the small intestine (range 9%–27%). In 4 of 7 mTR−/− mice (57%), we also saw villus atrophy in the colon occupying 6% (range 5%–12%) (Figure 2F). Microadenomas were present concurrently with the atrophic lesion in all the mice examined (7 of 7). Villous atrophy and microadenomas were not seen in wild-type mice (n = 9). This degree of crypt depletion and small intestinal villus atrophy was significantly greater than seen in C57BL/6J mTR−/− G5 mice (Herrera et al., 1999Herrera E. Samper E. Martin-Caballero J.

Longevity, stress response, and cancer in aging telomerase-deficient mice.Cell. 1999; 96: 701-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The microadenomas of the intestinal epithelium are reminiscent of the premalignant lesions of the oral epithelium, known as leukoplakia, that occur in dyskeratosis congenita patients and may represent crypt dropout and compensatory proliferative lesions initiated by short telomeres. Finally, The CAST/EiJ mTR−/− mice also showed hypocellular seminiferous tubules and a consequent decrease in testes weight due to germ cell apoptosis as seen in C57BL/6J mTR−/− mice (Hemann et al., 2001aHemann M.T. Rudolph L. Strong M. DePinho R.A. Chin L. Greider C.W. Telomere dysfunction triggers developmentally regulated germ cell apoptosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reduced viability together with the reduction in testes weight and increased aberrant seminiferous tubules resulted in small litter sizes and the inability to generate mTR−/− G3 mice. The telomere shortening was substantial in late-generation CAST/EiJ mTR+/− heterozygous mice, and there were a large number of signal free ends. To examine whether the short telomeres in the heterozygotes were dysfunctional, we examined testes sections from these mice. We found germ cell hypoplasia/degeneration with empty seminiferous tubules in the HG3 and HG4 mice (Figure 2D). Further significant crypt depletion and hyperplasia accompanied by villus atrophy/loss were also seen in an HG5 mouse that showed similar signs of illness to the mTR−/− mice (Figure 2E) and had significant telomere shortening (data not shown), suggesting that the short telomeres also cause disease in these animals. These phenotypic manifestations of telomere dysfunction in heterozygotes provide genetic evidence for haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, the correlation of phenotypes with short telomeres indicates that it is telomere length, not a reduction in telomerase activity, that causes disease. Autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita shows genetic anticipation, presumably due to the inheritance of short telomeres that get shorter with each generation (Vulliamy et al., 2004Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Disease anticipation is associated with progressive telomere shortening in families with dyskeratosis congenita due to mutations in TERC.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This anticipation implies that CAST/EiJ mTR−/− null animals that are derived from late-generation heterozygotes may have more severe phenotypes than those from early generations. To examine this, we looked at the survival of CAST/EiJ mTR−/− mice that came from crosses of either HG1 or HG3 parents (Figure 2B). We found a significant reduction in the life span of mTR−/− animals whose parents were HG3 compared to the mTR−/− animals whose parents were HG1. Thus, the inheritance of short telomeres from heterozygous parents contributes to the worsening of phenotypes in the offspring, which leads to premature death. This is the hallmark of genetic anticipation. Autosomal-dominant dyskeratosis congenita patients have impaired hematopoietic function that often leads to death due to bone marrow failure. Histological examination of the bone marrow in the mTR−/− G1 and G2 mice showed normal cellularity and morphology but with a skewed myeloid to erythroid ratio of 5:1 (normal 2.5:1; Sanderson and Phillips, 1981Sanderson J.H. Phillips C.E. An Atlas of Laboratory Animal Haematology. Oxford University Press, New York1981Google Scholar). There was also extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, and kidney (data not shown) in the mTR−/− animals, indicating that the mice had ineffective bone marrow hematopoiesis. To further evaluate bone marrow function in mTR−/− and mTR+/− mice, we examined peripheral blood through complete blood counts (CBC). There was a reduction in peripheral white blood cell, platelet, and red blood cell numbers in each successive generation of heterozygous mice, and these counts were significantly below the lower normal limits in mTR+/− HG4 (Figure 3B). Telomere-length heterogeneity leads to significant mouse-to-mouse variation in mean telomere length (Herrera et al., 1999Herrera E. Samper E. Martin-Caballero J. Flores J.M. Lee H.W. Blasco M.A. Disease states associated with telomerase deficiency appear earlier in mice with short telomeres.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Hemann et al., 2001bHemann M.T.

The shortest telomere, not average telomere length, is critical for cell viability and chromosome stability.Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). To more directly examine the role of telomere shortening in the reduced blood counts, we examined telomere length by Q-FISH in individual mice that were used for the peripheral blood counts described above. Short telomeres were tightly correlated with reduced white cell, platelet, and red cell counts (Figure 3A). In fact, the correlation of reduced CBC with telomere length was better than the correlation with increasing heterozygous generation (Figure 3A). Thus it is the short telomeres, not the absence, or lower levels of telomerase that cause the reduction in hematopoietic function. A decrease in marrow reserves can manifest as an increased sensitivity to cytotoxic agents. We thus examined the response to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is cytotoxic to cells in S phase, and efficient recovery from treatment reflects the number and function of progenitor cells in the affected tissues. Total white blood cell counts were measured in wild-type, mTR+/− HG5, and, mTR−/− G1 mice before injection with 5-FU. White blood cell counts were then monitored on day 6 and day 13 after injection (see Experimental Procedures). All mice showed a significant reduction in white counts 6 days after injection, as expected. However, mTR+/− HG5 mice had lower white counts on day 13 than the wild-type mice (Figure 3B). mTR−/− animals had the lowest white counts on day 6 and day 13 as compared to heterozygous and wild-type animals. This indicates that the capacity to sustain and recover from the stress of 5-FU treatment is compromised by limited bone marrow reserves. This general decrease in progenitor reserves due to short telomeres may reflect the sensitivity seen in dyskeratosis congenita patients to chemotherapy and to bone marrow transplant preparative regimens (Yabe et al., 1997Yabe M. Yabe H. Hattori K. Morimoto T. Hinohara T. Takakura I. Shimizu T. Shimamura K. Tang X. Kato S.

https://openalex.org/W2001758397,"The him-8 gene is essential for proper meiotic segregation of the X chromosomes in C. elegans. Here we show that loss of him-8 function causes profound X chromosome-specific defects in homolog pairing and synapsis. him-8 encodes a C2H2 zinc-finger protein that is expressed during meiosis and concentrates at a site on the X chromosome known as the meiotic pairing center (PC). A role for HIM-8 in PC function is supported by genetic interactions between PC lesions and him-8 mutations. HIM-8 bound chromosome sites associate with the nuclear envelope (NE) throughout meiotic prophase. Surprisingly, a point mutation in him-8 that retains both chromosome binding and NE localization fails to stabilize pairing or promote synapsis. These observations indicate that stabilization of homolog pairing is an active process in which the tethering of chromosome sites to the NE may be necessary but is not sufficient."

Neurology. 2003; 61: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), immunotherapy, especially passive immunization, remains a compelling potential treatment for AD. Interestingly, passive immunization of mouse models of AD-like Aβ plaques has been shown to rapidly reverse learning and memory deficits without affecting Aβ plaque pathology, indicating that neutralization of toxic Aβ species can quickly restore neuronal function in vivo (9.Dodart J.C. Bales K.R. Gannon K.S. Greene S.J. DeMattos R.B. Mathis C. DeLong C.A. Wu S. Wu X. Holtzman D.M. Paul S.M. Nat.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6331-6335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of learning and memory deficits in young APP transgenic mice indicates that monomeric Aβ is not responsible for behavioral impairments in vivo (11.Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar, 12.Westerman M.A. Cooper-Blacketer D. Mariash A. Kotilinek L. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Carlson G.A. Younkin S.G. Ashe K.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of soluble monomeric Aβ do not increase with age or with the onset of cognitive defects in transgenic mice (13.Cirrito J.R. May P.C. O'Dell M.A. Taylor J.W. Parsadanian M. Cramer J.W. Audia J.E. Nissen J.S. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8844-8853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if Aβ is responsible for learning and memory deficits in vivo, then Aβ must gain one or more of its toxic properties as a function of time. One potential mechanism for this toxic gain of function is a change in the conformation of Aβ such that it exerts its pathologic effects as an oligomeric or fibrillar macromolecule. To specifically target toxic forms of Aβ, we developed a monoclonal antibody named NAB61 that recognizes a pathologic conformation present in Aβ dimers, soluble oligomers, and higher order species of Aβ. Using this antibody, we found that neutralization of pathologic Aβ by passive immunization of transgenic mice resulted in rapid improvement in spatial learning and memory. These results suggest that pathologic Aβ conformers produced in vivo are capable of disrupting neuronal function, and our data have substantiated the therapeutic potential of targeting Aβ oligomers for the treatment of AD. Generation of NAB61—Synthetic Aβ1–40 (from D. Teplow, Boston, MA or from W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT) was treated with peroxynitrite, UV light, or 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as described (14.Norris E.H. Giasson B.I.

BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 μg of these Aβ species emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant followed by three additional injections of 25 μg of Aβ emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Isolated lymphocytes were used to generate hybridomas by fusion with Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma cells with polyethylene glycol 1500. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Synthetic Aβ preparations (0.5 μg) were electrophoresed on 16% Tris-Tricine gels and immunoblotted with NAB228 or NAB61 or immunoprecipitated using NAB61 or NAB228 with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) prior to immunoblotting with NAB228. For radiolabeled APP and C-terminal APP fragments, CHO Pro5 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing the cDNA for either green fluorescent protein or APP harboring the Swedish Mutation (APPswe) were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h in the presence of 200 μm MG132 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) to enhance the accumulation of C-terminal APP fragments. RIPA buffer cell lysates (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, leupeptin, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize Aβ1–11 (NAB14, NAB61, NAB89, NAB228, Ban50), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of APP (antibody number 2493), or a goat polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal ectodomain of APP (Karen). NAB antibodies were generated using the oligomeric Aβ preparations as antigens but do not exhibit oligomer specificity. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 10/16.5% step gradient Tris-Tricine gels, fixed with methanol, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for visualization. APP and APP fragments from mouse cortical extracts were detected as described (17.Lee E.B. Zhang B. Liu K. Greenbaum E.A. Doms R.W. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), using the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of APP (antibody number 5685); goat anti-N-terminal APP antibody (Karen); rabbit anti-sAPPβswe (antibody number 54); and NAB228. An anti-tubulin antibody (TUB2.1, Sigma) was used to detect tubulin. To detect peripheral Aβ, 200 μl of plasma was diluted with RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with 4G8 (anti-Aβ17–24), which was covalently conjugated to protein A/G beads with dimethyl pimelimidate to prevent competition with endogenous IgG. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on a 10/16.5% Tris-Tricine gel and immunoblotted with 4G8. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Neuro2A, CHO Pro5, and NT2N neurons were transduced with a Simliki Forest Virus encoding APPswe (SFV-APPswe). After 16 h, cells were fixed with cold 95% ethanol, 5% acetic acid for 10 min followed by further permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were stained with a goat polyclonal N-terminal APP antibody (Karen) and NAB61 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. For immunoelectron microscopy, fibrillar synthetic Aβ40 was absorbed to 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids, washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Aβ fibrils were stained with NAB61 followed by anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 5-nm colloidal gold particles. Grids were then stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dried, and visualized with a Joel (Peabody, MA) 1010 transmission electron microscope. Immunohistochemistry—Tissue blocks from human subjects or mice were immersion-fixed in 70% ethanol with 150 mm NaCl or 10% buffered formalin. Samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions to xylene and infiltrated with paraffin as described (18.Trojanowski J.Q. Schuck T. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sections (6 μm) were stained using standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase methods using 3-3′diaminobenzidine. Ban50 (mouse anti-Aβ1–10), NAB228 (mouse anti-Aβ1–11), and NAB61 (mouse anti-oligomer Aβ1–11) were used as primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector, Burlingame, MD). Quantification of Aβ plaque burden in the Tg2576 mice overexpressing human APP harboring the Swedish mutation (11.Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar) was conducted as described (17.Lee E.B. Zhang B. Liu K. Greenbaum E.A. Doms R.W. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, sections were stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Aβ42 antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) and with NAB61 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. ELISA Analysis—For solid-phase experiments, ELISA plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with Aβ at 1 μg/ml in PBS and blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Antibodies diluted in 5% fetal bovine serum/PBS were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). For blocking experiments, ELISA plates were coated with Aβ at 0.1 μg/ml, and antibodies were preincubated with the indicated blocking peptides at 10 μg/ml. For capturing experiments, ELISA plates were coated either NAB61 or Ban50 at 10 μg/ml in PBS and blocked with 1% casein in PBS. Aβ peptides diluted in blocking buffer at 10 μg/ml were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and bound Aβ was detected with HRP-conjugated BA27 (mouse anti-Aβ40). For Aβ quantification, detergent-soluble fractions of cortical and hippocampal regions were obtained by sonicating samples in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors for every 150 mg of tissue. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the resulting pellet was solubilized by sonication in 70% formic acid followed by another round of centrifugation to obtain detergent-insoluble Aβ. Supernatants were assayed by sandwich ELISA as described previously (19.Lee E.B. Skovronsky D.M. Abtahian F. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with either JRF/c40 or JRF/c42 to capture Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively. After application of diluted samples and a standard curve consisting of serially diluted synthetic Aβ (Bachem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA), the concentration of Aβ was determined by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated m266 (anti-Aβ13–28) as a reporting antibody. These antibodies do not recognize the N terminus of Aβ and therefore do not compete with NAB61 for Aβ. Immunization and Behavioral Analysis—Tg2576 mice were maintained on a C57B6/SJL F2 background by successive backcrossing to wild-type C57B6/SJL F1 females. All mice were generated and handled according to University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. To determine whether immunization improves learning and memory, 17–19-month-old Tg littermates were administered an initial dose of 400 μg of NAB61 or nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma) intraperitoneally followed by maintenance doses of 200 μg as described in Fig. 5A. Wild-type littermates were administered either IgG or NAB61, and these two wild-type groups were analyzed as one group after treatment was determined to have no effect in non-Tg mice as described under “Results.” The visible and hidden versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) were performed as described by Westerman et al. (12.Westerman M.A. Cooper-Blacketer D. Mariash A. Kotilinek L. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Carlson G.A. Younkin S.G. Ashe K.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are described in detail in the Supplemental Methods. Briefly, mice were subjected to the visible platform MWM in which latency to reach a visibly marked platform was measured over six consecutive training blocks (four trials/block, two blocks/day). Mice were then subject to the hidden platform MWM in which the latency to reach a submerged platform was measured over 9 days (four trials/block, one block/day). Three probe trials were interspersed throughout the hidden platform MWM to test for acquisition of visual reference memory by removing the hidden platform and recording swimming behavior for 60 s. Data were recorded using a video tracking system (HVS Image, San Diego, CA). Mice were tested in a blinded manner, with groups balanced for genotype and treatment. Mice were sacrificed 3 days after the termination of the MWM for biochemical and histological assessment. Experiments were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA, with Fischer's test for post-hoc analysis. To determine whether passive immunization removed Aβ plaques, long term passive immunization was performed on a cohort of 8-month-old Tg2576 mice, which were administered weekly doses of intraperitoneal NAB61 or nonspecific IgG (500 μg) for 6 months and sacrificed at 14 months of age. Changes in Aβ deposits by immunohistochemistry and Aβ levels by ELISA were conducted as described above. Generation of an Oligomer-selective Monoclonal Antibody—The role of Aβ oligomers is difficult to assess in vivo due to the dearth of conformation-specific molecular tools. Toward this end, we generated a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes oligomeric Aβ by using a stable oligomeric Aβ preparation as antigen. Treating synthetic Aβ1–40 with peroxynitrite, a reactive species generated by the reaction between superoxide and nitric oxide, resulted in the formation of SDS-stable Aβ oligomers, as shown by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with NAB228, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a linear N-terminal Aβ epitope (Fig. 1A). Additional stable Aβ oligomers were also generated by treating Aβ1–40 with UV light and with the lipid-derived reactive aldehyde, 4-HNE (gifts from D. Teplow and T. Montine). Over 5,500 hybridoma supernatants were tested for the presence of Aβ antibodies, and one hybridoma was generated from a mouse immunized with nitrated Aβ that produced an IgG1, named NAB61, with selectivity toward oligomeric Aβ species. As shown by both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, NAB61 showed selectivity toward SDS-stable Aβ oligomers relative to monomeric Aβ (Fig. 1, A and B, left panels), in contrast with other Aβ antibodies such as NAB228 (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels). To further characterize this novel monoclonal antibody, we tested NAB61 in a variety of additional immunologic assays. When tested in a solid-phase ELISA format in which Aβ1–40 was coated onto plastic, NAB61 titers were very low relative to NAB228 (Fig. 1C). Despite this low immunoreactivity, peptides corresponding to Aβ1–11 and Aβ1–40 were able to block the signal generated by NAB61, whereas Aβ11–40 did not, indicating that NAB61 recognizes an N-terminal Aβ epitope (Fig. 1D). When used as a capturing antibody in a sandwich ELISA format, NAB61 had greater affinity for oligomeric Aβ relative to non-oligomeric Aβ, in contrast with other anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies such as Ban50 (Fig. 1E). These in vitro studies indicated that NAB61 recognizes a complex conformational epitope found in the N terminus of oligomeric forms of Aβ. Although the primary sequence of Aβ is present in full-length APP and C-terminal APP fragments, an antibody that recognizes a pathologic Aβ conformation should be specific for the Aβ peptide. Therefore, we hypothesized that NAB61 does not recognize full-length APP or C99, akin to human anti-Aβ antibodies generated upon active immunization (20.Hock C. Konietzko U. Papassotiropoulos A. Wollmer A. Streffer J. von Rotz R.C. Davey G. Moritz E. Nitsch R.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations from radiolabeled CHO cells overexpressing either green fluorescent protein or APP were performed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize the N terminus of Aβ (designated NAB antibodies), a polyclonal N-terminal APP antibody, and a polyclonal C-terminal APP antibody. All of the NAB antibodies recognized both full-length APP and C99 with the notable exception of NAB61 (Fig. 2A). The lack of cross-reactivity with APP was confirmed by double immunofluorescence staining of Neuro2a, NT2N, and CHO cells overexpressing APPswe, which showed that NAB61 staining did not co-localize with staining of total APP by a polyclonal N-terminal APP antibody (Fig. 2B). Therefore, NAB61 recognizes a conformational epitope specific to oligomeric Aβ, which is not present in the Aβ sequence when found in the context of APP or C99. NAB61 Immunoreactivity against Fibrillar Aβ Amyloid—To ensure that NAB61 recognized bona fide Aβ amyloid, immunohistochemistry was performed on a variety of tissues containing Aβ amyloid plaques. Individuals with pathologic aging (no history of cognitive impairment despite the presence of Aβ amyloid deposits), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as demonstrated by psychometric testing, Down syndrome, and AD all contained Aβ plaques and other Aβ deposits that were NAB61-immunoreactive (Fig. 3). Interestingly, diffuse amyloid plaques were poorly stained by NAB61, despite robust staining of amyloid angiopathy (see Fig. 3, insets, for pathologic aging). Compact amyloid plaques from Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing APPswe were also recognized by NAB61 (Fig. 3). The initial stages of AD pathology are generally characterized by Aβ amyloid pathology in association cortices such as the mid-frontal cortex. With disease progression, Aβ amyloid in neocortical regions becomes more advanced, co-incident with the development of relatively milder Aβ deposits in limbic regions such as the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus (21.Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar). NAB61 immunoreactivity generally exhibited regional selectivity, which reflected the regional progression and severity of Aβ amyloid pathology. For example, many diffuse amyloid deposits in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of AD brains were poorly stained by NAB61 (Fig. 4A, left and middle panels) despite strong staining of mature senile plaques and amyloid angiopathy (Fig. 4A, arrowheads, and 4B), whereas many Aβ amyloid plaques in the mid-frontal cortex showed more robust NAB61 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A, right panels). The regional selectivity of NAB61 immunoreactivity suggested that NAB61 recognizes a conformation that is found in advanced, pathologic Aβ deposits, namely mature senile plaques and amyloid angiopathy. These inclusions are distinct from diffuse Aβ deposits, which are not associated with neuritic alterations, tau pathologies, or neuronal loss. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that many amorphous Aβ deposits, which were recognized by a conventional anti-Aβ42 antibody, were not recognized by NAB61 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, mature senile plaques were labeled by both antibodies (Fig. 4B). Given that Aβ fibrils are the ultrastructural building blocks of senile plaques, NAB61 staining of synthetic Aβ fibrils by immunoelectron microscopy further corroborated the ability of NAB61 to recognize pathologic forms of Aβ (Fig. 4B). Therefore, NAB61 appears to recognize a pathologic conformation present in dimeric and oligomeric Aβ, which is maintained during fibrillization and coalescence into senile plaques. NAB61 did not recognize other inclusions consisting of amyloidogenic proteins such as neurofibrillary tangles or Lewy bodies (data not shown), indicating that NAB61 is specific for Aβ and does not recognize a pathologic conformation common to other amyloidogenic proteins. NAB61 Improves Spatial Learning and Memory—Learning and memory impairments have been shown to normalize rapidly upon neutralization of Aβ following passive immunization of murine models of Aβ amyloidosis (9.Dodart J.C. Bales K.R. Gannon K.S. Greene S.J. DeMattos R.B. Mathis C. DeLong C.A. Wu S. Wu X. Holtzman D.M. Paul S.M. Nat.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6331-6335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To probe the role of Aβ oligomers on cognitive dysfunction, 17–19-month-old Tg2576 mice were immunized with NAB61 (n = 14) or nonspecific IgG (n = 16) and tested in the MWM for spatial learning and memory, using the schedule shown in Fig. 5A. Non-transgenic mice were also treated with either IgG (n = 7) or NAB61 (n = 7). However, for statistical analysis, data from IgG- and NAB61-treated non-transgenic control mice were pooled after performing a two-way ANOVA, which revealed no effect of treatment on performance in the hidden water maze for non-Tg mice (treatment, p = 0.8974; block, p = 0.0251; interaction, p = 0.8942). To test for potentially confounding sensorimotor or motivational defects, latencies to reach a visible platform were measured over successive training blocks (four trials/block). Non-transgenic, NAB61-treated Tg2576, and IgG-treated Tg2576 mice showed no deficits in the visible water maze (Fig. 5B). Although latencies for both NAB61-treated and IgG-treated Tg2576 mice on the second and third training blocks of the visible water maze tended to be higher than latencies for non-transgenic mice, differences in overall performance were insignificant (repeated measures ANOVA p = 0.0814). Furthermore, the latency to reach the visible platform and swim speeds on both the first trial and the first block were not statistically different between the three groups (data not shown), arguing against the presence of confounding sensorimotor or motivational deficits. Spatial learning and memory were then tested using the hidden water maze in which the primary measure of learning and memory was latency to reach the hidden platform (Fig. 5C). IgG-treated Tg2576 mice showed no significant improvement in latencies over the testing period (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.4402), whereas NAB61-treated Tg2576 mice and non-transgenic mice both showed a significant decrease in latency with training (one-way ANOVA: NAB61, p = 0.0004; non-transgenic, p = 0.0184). Furthermore, comparisons between the three groups of mice demonstrated that both non-transgenic and NAB61-treated Tg2576 mice performed significantly better than IgG-treated Tg2576 mice (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0.0002; non-transgenic versus IgG, p = 0.0014; NAB61 versus IgG p = 0.0006). Therefore, passive immunization with NAB61 ameliorates behavioral deficits in the hidden water maze. To confirm that the improved behavior on the hidden water maze was due to the acquisition of spatial reference memory, three probe trials were interpolated throughout the training process (Fig. 5A) in which the platform was removed, and the percentage of time spent searching in the target quadrant (where the platform is usually located) was determined. During the first probe trial, the three groups of mice exhibited spatially oriented swimming behavior, indicating that all three groups have acquired some degree of a spatial reference for the general location of the hidden platform (Fig. 5D). However, the time spent in the target quadrant relative to adjacent quadrants was only significantly different for NAB61-treated Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice. After further training, this behavioral measure became saturated and thus was unable to discern any differences between the three groups of mice in the final two probe trails (Fig. 5, E and F). Since the time spent in the target quadrant appeared to plateau by the second of the three probe trials, we used a third measure of spatial learning to confirm the improved acquisition of spatial reference memory upon NAB61 immunization. A platform crossing index was calculated that measures the number of crossings over the exact location of the platform subtracted by the average number of crossings over the platform locations in non-target quadrants (Fig. 5G). Using this measure, both NAB61-treated Tg2576 mice and non-transgenic mice performed significantly better than IgG-treated Tg2576 mice (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0.0301; NAB61 versus IgG, p = 0.0332; non-transgenic versus IgG, p = 0.0426). Again, this effect was not due to the presence of motor deficits as all three groups of mice exhibited similar swim speeds regardless of the probe trial (Fig. 5H, two-way ANOVA: group, p = 0.4033; probe trial, p = 0.8911; interaction, p = 0.9804). Therefore, three statistical measures (latency, percentage of time in target quadrant, and platform crossing index) all indicated that short term immunization with NAB61 improved spatial learning and memory in aged Tg2576 mice. NAB61 Immunization Does Not Affect APP Processing or Aβ Accumulation—To show that the NAB61-mediated neutralization of Aβ oligomers was independent of effects on APP processing or the extent of Aβ amyloid pathology, we examined levels of APP and APP fragments in mice after NAB61 treatment. Steady-state levels of full-length APP, sAPPβ, and C99 were not different among IgG-treated and NAB61-treated Tg2576 mice, arguing that NAB61 did not affect proteolytic processing of APP (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, no differences in amyloid plaque morphology, distribution, or density were noted upon NAB228 or NAB61 immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6B). Additionally, quantification of detergent-solu"

However, the mechanisms underlying polymerization of this targeting signal on a substrate are unknown. Here we dissect this process using the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 and its ubiquitination by the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase SCFCdc4 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. We show that Sic1 ubiquitination can be separated into two steps: attachment of the first ubiquitin, which is rate limiting, followed by rapid elongation of a K48-linked ubiquitin chain. Mutation of an acidic loop conserved among Cdc34 orthologs has no effect on attachment of the first ubiquitin onto Sic1 but compromises the processivity and linkage specificity of ubiquitin-chain synthesis. We propose that the acidic loop favorably positions K48 of a substrate-linked ubiquitin to attack SCF bound Cdc34∼ubiquitin thioester and thereby enables processive synthesis of K48-linked ubiquitin chains by SCF-Cdc34.

Regulation of protein stability through the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a key mechanism that underlies many cellular and organismal processes. While the general paradigm of an enzymatic cascade involving a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) to catalyze the synthesis of ubiquitin chains onto a targeted protein has been well established, only in the past several years have specific pathways with well-defined protein players been elucidated (reviewed in Pickart, 2004Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Two major types of E3s exist in eukaryotes, defined by the presence of either a HECT-domain or RING fold. The RING superfamily includes proteins with a similar fold that either bind zinc (RING-H2, RING-HC, RING-v, RING-D, RING-G, RING-S/T, RING-C2, PHD) or do not (U box). In contrast with HECT-domain enzymes, RING E3s do not form a covalent intermediate with ubiquitin but may instead activate the E2 to directly discharge ubiquitin thioesterified to its active-site cysteine onto the lysine of a substrate (Seol et al., 1999Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. et al.Cdc53/cullin and the essential Hrt1 RING-H2 subunit of SCF define a ubiquitin ligase module that activates the E2 enzyme Cdc34.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Our poor understanding of how RING ligases work is cast in sharp relief by the sheer predominance of this class of ligase enzymes. RING proteins are encoded in all eukaryotic genomes analyzed to date, and the mouse genome alone encodes approximately 385 proteins with this fold (Semple, 2003Semple C.A. The comparative proteomics of ubiquitination in mouse.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although some of these proteins may not be ubiquitin ligases, most RING proteins studied so far appear to have ubiquitin-ligase activity in vitro. The most intensively studied subclass of RING E3s are those of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) superfamily (reviewed in Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). The highly conserved enzymatic core of CRLs comprises the C-terminal region of a cullin protein and one of two closely related RING proteins (Kamura et al., 1999Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N.

Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The RING protein bound to the C-terminal domain of a cullin recruits the E2, whereas the N-terminal regions of cullins recruit receptors that in turn interact with specific substrates. To date, six different types of CRLs have been identified, each of which employs a distinct family of substrate receptors. Cul1 and Cul7 CRLs assemble with substrate receptors that contain an F box, whereas Cul2 and Cul5 recruit BC box proteins and Cul3 recruits BTB domain proteins. The human genome encodes ∼80 F box, ∼200 BTB domain, and ∼40 SOCS/BC box proteins, suggesting that there may be 300 to 350 CRLs in addition to the ∼400 potential ubiquitin ligases based on other RING-fold proteins—which would make this the largest class of enzymes in all of eukaryotic biology. However, the mechanism by which any CRL or RING protein promotes substrate ubiquitination remains unknown. SCF, the prototypical CRL, consists of Skp1, Cul1 (known also as Cdc53 in budding yeast), an F box protein, and the RING protein. The minimal enzymatic core of SCF contains the C-terminal cullin homology domain of Cul1 and the RING protein, which serves as an E2 docking site. Skp1 binding to the N-terminal region of Cul1 connects this enzymatic core to the variable F box protein that recognizes substrates. For the vast majority of known cases, substrates are recruited to SCF by a posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. To analyze SCF-mediated protein ubiquitination, we have employed an in vitro system that faithfully recapitulates ubiquitination of the budding-yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Sic1 by SCFCdc4 and the E2 Cdc34 (Ubc3). At the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle, multisite phosphorylation of Sic1 by G1 CDK results in its recognition by the F box protein Cdc4 (Nash et al., 2001Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M.

Through the activity of Cdc34, SCFCdc4 bound Sic1 is ubiquitinated. Next, it is rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome, resulting in release of active S phase CDK and entry into S phase (Verma et al., 1997Verma R. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Carr S.A. Reynard G.

These steps can all be recapitulated in vitro with highly purified components, allowing for detailed analyses of this pathway. Despite the progress that has been made in biochemical reconstitution and structural analysis of SCF-E2 complexes, relatively little is known about how they actually work. Early reconstitution studies indicated that the Cul1-RING “catalytic core” of SCF activates ubiquitin discharge from Cdc34, but the underlying mechanism was not determined (Seol et al., 1999Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J.

Activated Cdc34∼ubiquitin thioesters may dissociate from SCF and diffuse across the gap toward the bound substrate (Deffenbaugh et al., 2003Deffenbaugh A.E. Scaglione K.M. Zhang L. Moore J.M. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Skowyra D. Release of ubiquitin-charged Cdc34-S - Ub from the RING domain is essential for ubiquitination of the SCF(Cdc4)-bound substrate Sic1.Cell. 2003; 114: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but this proposed “hit-and-run” mechanism is controversial (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). In this work, we set out to address a key unresolved question that lies at the heart of SCF action: what features of the SCF-Cdc34 ubiquitin-ligase complex enable the processive synthesis of a ubiquitin chain that is competent to target the substrate to the UPS for degradation? A chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules linked through isopeptide bonds that join lysine 48 (K48) of one ubiquitin to the C terminus of the next underlies the recognition and degradation of proteins by the 26S proteasome (Thrower et al., 2000Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Although K48-linked ubiquitin chains are fundamental to the operation of the ubiquitin proteasome system, the mechanisms that underlie the synthesis of such chains remain unknown. Assembly of a K48-linked ubiquitin chain on a substrate comprises multiple subreactions. To gain insight into this process, we sought to strip it down to the simplest possible reaction—the discharge of a ubiquitin thioester (∼Ub) from the active site of Cdc34 that accompanies formation of a ubiquitin conjugate. We devised an assay that allowed us to monitor a single round of discharge of ubiquitin from Cdc34 to eliminate confounding effects of the ubiquitin activating and charging steps. By first charging Cdc34 with ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and ATP and then treating the reactions with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and EDTA, subsequent Cdc34 recharging was blocked (data not shown). Cdc34∼Ub was then incubated under different reaction conditions, and we evaluated the loss of Cdc34∼Ub by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis of Cdc34 under nonreducing conditions. We refer to these assays as “single discharge” because only one ubiquitin is turned over per Cdc34. We first examined the effect of SCF (Figure 1A). Cdc34∼Ub thioesters decayed rapidly in the presence of SCF (majority lost after <30 s) but were at least 5-fold more stable in the absence of SCF (comparable loss at >2.5 min). The activity of SCF in this assay was similar regardless of whether the Cdc53 subunit was conjugated with Nedd8 or not (see Figures S1B and S1C in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Rapid SCF-dependent discharge required the lysines of ubiquitin because thioesters generated with a lysine-less mutant (K0 Ub) were slowly discharged even in the presence of SCF (right panel). This was a key result as it suggested that the major event monitored by our assay system was the attack of a Cdc34∼Ub thioester by a lysine on a second ubiquitin molecule. The stability of Cdc34∼K0 Ub, even in the presence of SCF, allowed us to systematically test the ability of different molecules to attack the thioester. As our reactions in Figure 1A did not contain an SCF substrate, we first sought to determine the effect of adding Sic1. Phosphorylated Sic1 (phospho-Sic1) facilitated the rapid discharge of Cdc34∼K0 Ub thioesters in an SCF-dependent manner (Figure 1B, top panel). We had previously developed a mutant Sic1 (Sic1 K0) that cannot be ubiquitinated by SCF because it lacks lysines (Petroski and Deshaies, 2003Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Context of multiubiquitin chain attachment influences the rate of Sic1 degradation.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). SCF loaded with phospho-Sic1 K0 did not potently accelerate ubiquitin discharge from Cdc34 (Figure 1B, bottom panel, lanes 7–12; compare with lanes 19–24). Since ubiquitin's lysines were required for rapid SCF-dependent turnover of Cdc34∼Ub in the absence of added Sic1 substrate, we sought to address whether our assay recapitulates the known specificity of SCF-Cdc34 for synthesizing ubiquitin chains linked through degradation-competent K48 linkages (Feldman et al., 1997Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. A complex of Cdc4p, Skp1p, and Cdc53p/cullin catalyzes ubiquitination of the phosphorylated CDK inhibitor Sic1p.Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Cdc34∼K0 Ub was evaluated in single-discharge reactions supplemented with “empty” SCF (i.e., without bound substrate) plus either ubiquitin containing only lysine 48 (K48 Ub) or ubiquitin containing lysine 48 mutated to arginine (K48R Ub). Whereas K48 Ub promoted rapid discharge of K0 Ub from Cdc34, K48R Ub did not (Figure 1C), even though it retains six lysines. Taken together, these results suggested that SCF activates the discharge of ubiquitin from Cdc34∼Ub to either lysines of a bound substrate (Sic1) or the K48 residue of a free ubiquitin molecule. SCF could promote the turnover of Cdc34∼Ub thioesters by increasing the affinity of Cdc34∼Ub for the attacking nucleophile or by increasing the rate at which a bound nucleophile attacks the thioester to form an isopeptide bond. Although our immunoblotting assay provided important insights into the factors that promote discharge of ubiquitin from Cdc34∼Ub, we now sought a more readily quantifiable assay to address the mechanism of SCFCdc4 action. Accordingly, we performed single-discharge experiments in which Cdc34 charged with radiolabeled K48R Ub was incubated with excess unlabeled wild-type “acceptor” ubiquitin ± SCF. As shown in Figure 1D and quantified in Figure 1E, SCF promoted the loss of labeled Cdc34∼K48R Ub and concomitant appearance of diubiquitin. As expected, radiolabeled Cdc34∼K48R Ub was sensitive to reducing agent (bottom panel), whereas radiolabeled diubiquitin was not. We employed this assay to measure the initial rate of diubiquitin formation at different concentrations of cold ubiquitin acceptor. Plots of initial rate versus acceptor ubiquitin concentration (Figure 1F) revealed three important points. First, the estimated KM for acceptor ubiquitin was extremely high, ∼600 μM. This has important implications, which will be considered in the Discussion. Second, the estimated KM for ubiquitin was similar in the presence (600 μM) or absence (625 μM) of SCF, whereas the Vmax was at least 40-fold greater in the presence of 100 nM SCF (2.6 versus 0.06 pmol/s). Because SCF primarily affects Vmax, we infer that a constitutive binding site for acceptor ubiquitin resides on Cdc34∼K48R Ub, and SCF catalyzes attack of thioesterified ubiquitin by noncovalently bound ubiquitin, yielding an isopeptide bond between the two molecules. Third, given the Vmax (2.6 pmol diubiquitin/s) and the relative amounts of Cdc34 (16 pmol) and SCF (2 pmol), it follows that the entire reaction cycle of Cdc34∼Ub binding to SCF, isopeptide-bond formation, and dissociation of discharged Cdc34 from SCF occur with a t1/2 of ∼0.5 s. To build on the insights that emerged from kinetic analysis of the single-discharge assay, we sought to define residues in Cdc34 and ubiquitin that contribute to the formation of a ubiquitin chain. Because our chase assay monitors discharge of ubiquitin from Cdc34∼Ub, we reasoned that we could identify residues of ubiquitin that are important for diubiquitin synthesis, regardless of whether they influence the rate of charging by E1 or E2. Sixteen surface residues of ubiquitin are essential for vegetative growth of yeast (Sloper-Mould et al., 2001Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. Distinct functional surface regions on ubiquitin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We generated and assayed a series of ubiquitin derivatives mutated for these essential residues (Figure S2A). Whereas most of the mutant ubiquitin readily attacked Cdc34∼K48R Ub thioesters in the presence of SCF to form diubiquitin, several mutants were unable to efficiently support this process (Figure 2A). Besides K48, the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin and two residues in the hydrophobic patch adjacent to K48—I44 and G47—had an important role in diubiquitin synthesis. By contrast, of the essential residues implicated in endocytosis (T12, F4, and Q2), only T12 contributed significantly to diubiquitin synthesis. Finally, Nedd8, which has K48 and is 80% homologous to ubiquitin, failed to accept ubiquitin from Cdc34∼K48R Ub (Figures S2B and S2C). To further address the mechanism and specificity of ubiquitin-chain synthesis by SCF-Cdc34, we next sought to identify features of Cdc34 that are required for diubiquitin production. Evaluation of various Cdc34 mutants focused our attention on an acidic loop (amino acids 103 to 114) that, among S. cerevisiae E2s, is unique to Cdc34 and Ubc7 and is located near the catalytic cysteine. A mutant in which the acidic residues are converted to alanine does not complement S. cerevisiae cdc34Δ unless it is vastly overexpressed from the GAL1 promoter (Liu et al., 1995Liu Y. Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. Intragenic suppression among CDC34 (UBC3) mutations defines a class of ubiquitin-conjugating catalytic domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5635-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Pitluk et al., 1995Pitluk Z.W. McDonough M. Sangan P. Gonda D.K. Novel CDC34 (UBC3) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutants obtained by charge-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the acidic loop in Cdc34 function is unknown. We generated mutants of Cdc34 containing deletions of the entire loop (Cdc34 Δ103–114) or a portion of it (Cdc34 Δ108–114) as well as mutants with acidic residues changed to alanine (Cdc34 1D 2E: E109A, D111A, E113A and Cdc34 3D 2E: D104A, D108A, E109A, D111A, E113A). These mutant proteins were charged with K48R Ub and tested in our thioester chase assay in the presence of SCF and ubiquitin to determine if they could sustain the formation of diubiquitin. As shown in Figure 2B and quantified in Figure 2C, all of the Cdc34 proteins containing alterations within this loop region were severely impaired in the synthesis of diubiquitin, even though they were equivalently charged with [32P]ubiquitin (wt initial rate of 0.8 pmol diubiquitin/s; mutants were all less than 0.08 pmol/s, with 1 mM ubiquitin in the chase mix). As shown below, we provide strong evidence that the defect of these mutants was very specific and not due to a general loss of function. Our analysis of diubiquitin synthesis suggested that specific, acidic-loop-dependent catalysis of isopeptide-bond formation might underlie the SCF-dependent synthesis of a ubiquitin chain upon substrate. However, to establish that the acidic loop has a physiological role in ubiquitin-chain synthesis, it was essential to evaluate ubiquitination of an authentic SCF substrate. To better define the reaction under study, we employed in addition to wild-type Sic1 a mutant of Sic1 that contains only the six N-terminal lysines that are the physiological targets of ubiquitination in vivo (K0C) or a Sic1 mutant that contains a single ubiquitin-accepting lysine residue (K32 only) that is sufficient to sustain turnover in vivo (Petroski and Deshaies, 2003Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Context of multiubiquitin chain attachment influences the rate of Sic1 degradation.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The significance of the K32 Sic1 substrate is that it immediately distinguishes between the synthesis of a ubiquitin chain versus monoubiquitination of multiple lysine residues of the substrate. This is a relevant issue because, in some reconstitution systems, multiple monoubiquitination events predominate over chain synthesis (Carroll and Morgan, 2002Carroll C.W. Morgan D.O. The Doc1 subunit is a processivity factor for the anaphase-promoting complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3, both K0C and K32 Sic1 were converted to ubiquitinated forms with similar kinetics (0.17 to 0.2 pmol/s), regardless of whether the reaction was carried out with wild-type Ub (Figures 3A and 3B) or K0 Ub (Figures 3C and 3D). Similar rates of ubiquitination were obtained for other “single-lysine” Sic1 substrates (data not shown). As expected, K32 Sic1 was modified by only a single K0 Ub attachment, whereas K0C Sic1 was modified with up to six K0 Ub molecules (Figure 3C). Importantly, at every single time point, the pattern of conjugates on K0C Sic1 obtained with ubiquitin (Figure 3A) differed greatly from that observed with K0 Ub (Figure 3C). This suggests that the primary reaction products were Sic1 molecules bearing a ubiquitin chain, as opposed to Sic1 ubiquitinated on multiple lysine residues. This result implies that SCF-Cdc34 preferred to polymerize a ubiquitin chain rather than to conjugate single ubiquitin molecules onto multiple lysine residues in Sic1. To test directly the implication that the first ubiquitin attachment to Sic1 is rate limiting, we generated Sic1 containing a single ubiquitin molecule conjugated to lysine 36 (Sic1-Ub1; see Experimental Procedures and Figure S3) and compared its rate of ubiquitination to unmodified Sic1 generated under identical conditions (Figure 4A). At 800 nM Cdc34, Sic1-Ub1 was ubiquitinated 4-fold faster than unmodified Sic1 (Figure 4B; Sic1-Ub1 conversion is 0.4 units/min, while Sic1 is 0.1 units/min). This rate difference was enhanced at low (80 nM) E2 concentrations (0.25 units/min for Sic1-Ub1, 0.03 units/min for Sic1). These results provide direct evidence that the first attachment of ubiquitin onto Sic1 is slower than the rate of subsequent ubiquitin-ubiquitin attachments. Why does attachment of a single ubiquitin to Sic1 accelerate the rate of subsequent ubiquitin attachments? Attachment of ubiquitin to Sic1 may simply increase the relative proximity of acceptor sites for Cdc34∼Ub because ubiquitin may partially span the proposed ∼50 Å gap between the SCF bound substrate and Cdc34's catalytic cysteine (Zheng et al., 2002Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. et al.Structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Cdc34 may have an intrinsic (but not absolute) preference for lysine 48 of ubiquitin (as demonstrated in Figure 1, Figure 2). To test the latter possibility, we prepared Sic1-Ub1 lacking a free amino group at amino acid 48 of ubiquitin and compared its rate of ubiquitination to Sic1. Strikingly, the rate enhancement obtained by conjugating a single ubiquitin onto Sic1 (Figure 4A) was vitiated by selective modification of lysine 48 (Figure 4C; 0.09 units/min for both Sic1 and Sic1-Ub1). Whereas this result by itself does not address the potential contribution of increased proximity, it does establish that there is something special about lysine 48. Taken together, the results presented so far suggest that the transfer of ubiquitin from Cdc34∼Ub to SCFCdc4 bound Sic1 is the rate-limiting step in substrate ubiquitination. Once ubiquitin is attached to Sic1, transfer of subsequent ubiquitin to form a K48-linked chain occurs at a more rapid rate because SCF-Cdc34∼Ub prefers to transfer its Ub to lysine 48 of a substrate-conjugated ubiquitin. The diubiquitin synthesis assays suggested that the acidic loop of Cdc34 might be required for rapid polymerization of a ubiquitin chain upon substrate. We now sought to test this possibility directly. Paradoxically, whereas the loop mutants were defective in the thioester chase assay (Figure 2B), they supported rapid ubiquitination of K32 Sic1 by K0 Ub (Figure 5A). In fact, loop mutants were consistently more active than wt Cdc34 in attaching ubiquitin onto Sic1. This is a key result because it indicates that the diubiquitin synthesis defect of the loop mutants (shown in Figures 2B and 2C) was very specific. We next evaluated the pattern of conjugate formation on Sic1 using wt (Figure 5B) or K48-only ubiquitin (Figure 5C). Whereas the overall rate of conversion of unmodified Sic1 to an ubiquitinated form was essentially identical when wt Cdc34 and various loop mutants were compared, the pattern of ubiquitin conjugation was strikingly different. The product profile seen with each loop mutant was suggestive of a more distributive reaction mechanism regardless of whether wt (Figure 5B) or K48-only (Figure 5C) ubiquitin was used, which is expected if attachment of the first ubiquitin occurred normally but failed to accelerate the rate of subsequent ubiquitin transfers. To quantify this difference, the average ubiquitin-chain length on Sic1 was measured for Cdc34 and the various mutants at the initial phase of the reaction (0.25 min). Whereas Cdc34 transferred on average ∼3.6 ubiquitins per modified Sic1, the loop mutants transferred fewer, ranging from 2.1 to 2.4 ubiquitins per Sic1 (Figure 5E). Finally, we examined the linkage specificity of Cdc34 3D 2E by evaluating the products formed in reactions that contained K32 Sic1 and K48R Ub. Cdc34 efficiently promoted the attachment of a single K48R ubiquitin to K32 Sic1 and only poorly sustained the formation of non-K48 linkages to yield diubiquitinated Sic1 (Figure 5D). By contrast, Cdc34 3D 2E catalyzed the formation of K32 Sic1 species with di-, tri-, and even tetraubiquitin chains. To address the mechanism by which the 3D 2E mutation exerts its effects, we performed a kinetic analysis of diubiquitin synthesis in the presence of SCF, similar to in Figure 1F. The extrapolated kinetic parameters for synthesis of diubiquitin from free ubiquitin and wt Cdc34∼K48R Ub thioesters were a KM of 533 μM (for free ubiquitin) and Vmax of 2.8 pmol diubiquitin synthesized/s (Figure 5F). By contrast, with 3D 2E Cdc34∼Ub thioesters, the KM for ubiquitin was estimated to be 880 μM, and the Vmax was estimated as 0.38 pmol diubiquitin/s. Thus, like SCF, the acidic loop promotes diubiquitin synthesis primarily by enhancing a chemical step in the formation of an isopeptide bond between two ubiquitin molecules. Our analysis of Sic1 ubiquitination leads us to propose a model for how SCF CRLs work with Cdc34 to catalyze processive synthesis of a degradation-competent K48-linked ubiquitin chain on a substrate (Figure 6). Assembly of an ubiquitin chain on Sic1 can be thought of as two separate reactions that have distinct properties. Sic1 that binds to SCF is first modified with ubi"

Their natural physiological role is not known but in fermentations of alcoholic beverages and other food products they play a key role as flavor compounds. Information about the metabolic pathways and enzymology of fatty acid ethyl ester biosynthesis, however, is very limited. In this work, we have investigated the role of a three-member S. cerevisiae gene family with moderately divergent sequences (YBR177c/EHT1, YPL095c/EEB1, and YMR210w). We demonstrate that two family members encode an acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters. Deletion of either one or both of these genes resulted in severely reduced medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester production. Purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged Eht1 and Eeb1 proteins both exhibited acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferase activity in vitro, as well as esterase activity. Overexpression of Eht1 and Eeb1 did not enhance medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester content, which is probably due to the bifunctional synthesis and hydrolysis activity. Molecular modeling of Eht1 and Eeb1 revealed the presence of a α/β-hydrolase fold, which is generally present in the substrate-binding site of esterase enzymes. Hence, our results identify Eht1 and Eeb1 as novel acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferases/esterases, whereas the third family member, Ymr210w, does not seem to play an important role in medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester formation.

The synthesis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) 3The abbreviations used are: FAEE, fatty acid ethyl ester; AEATase, acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferase; MCFA, medium-chain fatty acid; GC-FID, headspace gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector; GC-MS, purge-and-trap gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase.3The abbreviations used are: FAEE, fatty acid ethyl ester; AEATase, acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferase; MCFA, medium-chain fatty acid; GC-FID, headspace gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector; GC-MS, purge-and-trap gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is widely distributed in microorganisms, higher plants, and mammals. In mammals, FAEEs are the result of the nonoxidative pathway for the metabolism of ethanol, after ethanol intake (1.Soderberg B.L. Salem R.O. Best C.A. Cluette-Brown J.E. Laposata M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 119: 94-99PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Criddle D.N. Raraty M.G.T. Neoptolemos J.P. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Sutton R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10738-10743Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In higher plants and microorganisms, FAEEs are formed as secondary metabolites. Because of their strong fruit flavor, ethyl esters of short- and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) constitute a large group of flavor compounds particularly important in the food, beverage, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. The biosynthesis of FAEEs proceeds by two different enzymatic mechanisms, esterification or alcoholysis (3.Liu S.-Q. Holland R. Crow V.L. Int. Dairy J. 2004; 14: 923-945Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Esterification is the formation of esters from alcohols and carboxylic acids and is catalyzed by FAEE synthases/carboxylesterases. Alcoholysis is the production of esters from alcohols and acylglycerols or from alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs derived from metabolism of fatty acids. Alcoholysis is essentially a transferase reaction in which fatty acyl groups from acylglycerols or acyl-CoA derivatives are directly transferred to alcohols. The formation of FAEEs by alcoholysis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferases (AEATases) (4.Laposata M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ester biosynthesis is very common in microorganisms, especially in bacteria and yeasts that are used in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages and food products. Information about the metabolic pathways and enzymology of ester biosynthesis in these microorganisms, however, is still very limited (3.Liu S.-Q. Holland R. Crow V.L. Int. Dairy J. 2004; 14: 923-945Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, significant progress has recently been made. S. cerevisiae cells produce a broad range of esters during fermentation, which greatly affect the complex flavor of food and fermented alcoholic beverages (5.Mason A.B. Dufour J.-P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae produces not only ethyl esters of short- to medium-chain fatty acids but also acetate esters of different alcohols (6.Verstrepen K.J. Derdelinckx G. Dufour J.-P. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Pretorius I.S. Delvaux F.R. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2003; 96: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The enzymes responsible for acetate ester formation are already well defined, in contrast to enzymes involved in the formation of ethyl esters of short- and medium-chain fatty acids. Acetate esters are formed intracellular, in an enzyme-catalyzed condensation reaction between acetyl-CoA and ethanol or a higher alcohol. The reaction is catalyzed by alcohol O-acetyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.84). At present, three different alcohol O-acetyltransferases have been identified in yeast: Atf1, its closely related homologue Lg-Atf1, and Atf2 (for a review, see Ref. 6.Verstrepen K.J. Derdelinckx G. Dufour J.-P. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Pretorius I.S. Delvaux F.R. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2003; 96: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Atf1 and Atf2 are present in both S. cerevisiae var. cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae var. pastorianus, whereas Lg-Atf1 is found only in S. cerevisiae var. pastorianus. Homology-based searches of the S. cerevisiae genome have not revealed any other gene encoding a putative ester-synthesizing enzyme with sequence similarity to Atf1 and/or Atf2. Of all known ester synthases, Atf1 is the most important for the production of acetate esters. Deletion analysis has shown that Atf1 is responsible for 80% of isoamyl acetate formation, 75% of phenyl ethyl acetate production, and about 40% of ethyl acetate synthesis. In addition, overexpression of the ATF1 gene results in a more than 100-fold increase in isoamyl acetate production, as well as a 10–200-fold increase in the production of other esters, such as ethyl acetate, phenyl ethyl acetate, and C3-C8 acetate esters (7.Verstrepen K.J. Van Laere S.D.M. Vanderhaegen B.M.P. Derdelinckx G. Dufour J.-P. Pretorius I.S. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Delvaux F.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 5228-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The deletion and overexpression analysis also showed that Atf1 is only involved in acetate ester synthesis and not in FAEE synthesis. Recently, a possible alcohol acyltransferase, designated Eht1 (ethanol hexanoyl transferase I) has been suggested as a candidate ethyl ester synthase (5.Mason A.B. Dufour J.-P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, this putative alcohol acyltransferase has not been studied in any detail, and there are no experimental data to confirm the role of this protein in fatty acid ethyl ester synthesis. Here, we show that EHT1 belongs to a three-member gene family, also containing YPL095c and YMR210w, and we demonstrate an enzymatic role for Eht1 and Ypl095c in the synthesis and hydrolysis of MCFA ethyl esters in yeast. Because Ypl095c seems to be the most important enzyme for the synthesis of MCFA ethyl esters, we propose to call the YPL095c gene, EEB1, for ethyl ester biosynthesis gene 1. On the other hand, our results do not reveal an important role for Ymr210w in the synthesis of MCFA ethyl esters. Its precise function therefore remains currently unclear.

Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Expand high fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) were used for enzymatic DNA manipulations as recommended by the supplier. Yeast transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method (10.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Construction of the Deletion Strains—Original deletions of EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w were constructed by integrative transformation of strain BY4741, using KANMX from pUG6 (see Table 1) as selection cassette (11.Güldener U.

Double deletants were constructed by crossing single deletants in all three pair wise combinations (Table 1), followed by sporulation. Haploid double deletants were isolated from non-parental ditypes (two G148R spores/two G418S spores) or from tetratypes (three G418R spores/one G418Sspore). The triple deletant was constructed by crossing the two haploid double deletants BY4741 (eht1Δ eeb1Δ) and BY4741 (eht1Δ ymr210wΔ) and sporulation of the diploid. All deletant strains used in this work were verified by PCR and sequencing to confirm the replacement of the genomic EHT1, EEB1, or YMR210w gene with the kanamycine gene. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain-method with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California) model 3100 Avant sequencer according to the supplier's instructions. All sequencing reactions were performed at least twice. Sequences were analyzed with ABI Prisma and vector NTI Advance (Informax/Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) software. Construction of the Overexpression Strains—The plasmids pEHT1s, pEEB1s, and pYMR210ws were constructed by insertion of the respective ORFs into the XhoI restriction site in the PGK1 overexpression cassette of the ps vector (see Table 1) (the EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w PCR products were cut with XhoI). The following primers were used for the amplification of DNA fragments by PCR: for the EHT1 ORF, XhoI-EHT1-ORF-F (TTGCCTCGAGATGTCAGAAGTTTCCAAAGCC, the XhoI restriction site is underlined) and XhoI-EHT1-ORF-R (TTGCCTCGAGTCATACA TATTCATCA AAC); for the EEB1 ORF, Xho-I-EEB1-ORF-F (TTGCCTCGAGATGTTTCGCCGTACTATC) and XhoI-EEB1-ORF-R (TTGCCTCGAGTTATAAAACTAACTCATCAAAG) and for the YMR210w ORF, XhoI-YMR210w-ORF-F (TTGCCTCGAGATGCGTTAAGAATTGTTAC) and XhoI-YMR210w-ORF-R (TTGCCTCGAGCTAATTCGCGCGAAAGGTGTG). Before transformation, the vectors were linearized in the inserted gene: pEEB1s was linearized with Bstz17I, and pEHT1s and pYMR210ws were linearized with SmaI. The empty vector was linearized in the SMR1–410 marker gene, which is a single base mutant of the ILV2 gene, with BlpI. The overexpression strains were verified using PCR and sequencing to confirm the correct genomic integration of the respective PGK1 overexpression constructs. Construction of the pSSE1 and pSSE2 Plasmids—The plasmids pSSE1 and pSSE2 were constructed by insertion of the respective ORFs into the SalI/NotI restriction site of pGEX-4T-1 (Table 1) (the EHT1 and EEB1 PCR products were cut with SalI and NotI). The following primers were used for the amplification of DNA fragments by PCR: for the EEB1 ORF, EEB1-GST-F (AGTTGCCGTCGACTTCGCTCGGGTTACTATCCAAC; the SalI restriction site is underlined) and EEB1-GST-R (ATCAACGGGCGGCCGCATAAAACTAACTCATCAAA; the NotI restriction site is underlined); for the EHT1 ORF, EHT1-GST-F (AGTTGCCGTCGACCAGAAGTTCCAAATGGCCAGC) and EHT1-GST-R (ATCAACGGGCGGCCGCCATACGACTAATTCATCAAA). Plasmids were constructed in E. coli strain DH5α and transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for the purification of Eht1 and Eeb1. Fermentation Experiments—Yeast precultures were shaken overnight at 28 °C in test tubes containing 5 ml of YPD medium. After 16 h of growth, 1 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of YPD medium in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, and this second preculture was shaken at 28 °C until stationary growth phase (A600 = 2) was reached. Cells were washed with sterile, distilled water and used to inoculate 350 ml of fresh, prewarmed (28 °C) YPD medium containing 8% glucose to an A600 of 0.4. Static fermentation was carried out at 20 °C in flasks with water locks placed on top, to create semi-anaerobic conditions to maximize ester production. Samples for chromatographic analysis were taken after 96 h of fermentation and immediately cooled on ice in an airtight container. Headspace Gas Chromatography Coupled with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID) Analysis—Headspace gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was used for the measurement of ethyl hexanoate in the fermentation products of the deletion and overexpression strains. Samples of 5 ml were collected in 15-ml precooled glass tubes, which were immediately closed and cooled on ice. The GC-FID was also calibrated for ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl octanoate for the enzyme tests. In this case, 200-μl samples were used. Samples were then analyzed with a calibrated Autosystem XL gas chromatograph with a headspace sampler (HS40; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and equipped with a CP-Wax 52 CB column (length, 50 m; internal diameter, 0.32 mm; layer thickness, 1.2 μm; Chrompack, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Samples were heated for 16 min at 60 °C in the headspace autosampler. The injection block and flame ionization detector temperatures were kept constant at 180 and 250 °C, respectively; helium was used as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was 75 °C held for 6 min and then increased to 110 °C at 25 °C min-1 and held at 100 °C for 3.5 min. Results were analyzed with PerkinElmer Life Sciences Turbochrom Navigator software. Purge-and-Trap GC-MS Analysis—Purge-and-trap gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the measurement of ethyl butanoate, ethyl octanoate, and ethyl decanoate in the fermentation products of the deletion and overexpression strains. Samples (25 ml) were collected in airtight tubes and centrifuged (5 min; 5000 × g; 2 °C). The supernatant was poured into precooled 25 ml airtight tubes, and 100 μl of a 10% antifoam reagent (Sigma) was added to the sample. In addition, 100 μl of a 250 mg liter-1 solution of 2-ethyl hexanal (Sigma) in distilled water was added as an internal standard. Five milliliters of this sample was transferred into a Tekmar Dohrman 3000 (Emerson, Mason, OH) purge-and-trap sampler unit with following characteristics: helium carrier gas; 10 min purge at 120 °C; 15 min dry purge; cold trap temperature, -100 °C; 6-min desorption at 250 °C. A Fisons GC 8000 + MFA 815 cold-trap/control unit (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA) contained a Chrompack CP-Wax 52 CB column (length, 50 m; internal diameter, 0.32 mm; layer thickness, 1.2 μm; Varian). The oven program was as follows: 1 min at 50 °C, 4 °C min-1 to 120 °C, 2.5 °C min-1 to 165 °C, 15 °C min-1 to 240 °C, and 5 min at 240 °C. Total ion mass chromatograms were obtained in a Fisons MD 800 apparatus and analyzed with the masslab software program. Protein Purification—400-ml cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the appropriate GST fusion were grown to an A600 nm = 1, induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.6 mm final) for 3 h at 30 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed once in lysis buffer A (125 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). Washed cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer A containing protease-inhibitor mix (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then lysis was completed by two 15 s pulses of sonication (model 450 sonifier, Branson). Lysates were clarified at 4 °C by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The resulting supernatant fraction was mixed with 200 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer A and incubated for 1 h at 4°Con a rollerdrum. Beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 500 × g, washed five times with 1 ml of wash buffer (125 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), and GST fusion proteins were eluted with 200 μl of elution buffer (125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X-100, 20 mm glutathione, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). 16 μl of the GST fusion proteins were boiled with 4 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and by immunoblotting with an appropriate antibody. In Vitro AEATase Enzyme Assay—Ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl octanoate synthase activity was measured by headspace gas chromatography. The method described here is a modified version of the method described by Malcorps and Dufour (12.Malcorps P. Dufour J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate synthase assays were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in a medium (200 μl) containing 200 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8, 0.513 m ethanol, and 100 μm butyryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA, respectively. Butyryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. The specific activity is expressed as nmol of ester formed s-1 mg-1 protein. Total amount of protein in the samples was determined using a standard method (13.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Under all conditions, the enzyme activities were proportional to the amount of protein added and to the incubation time. Esterase Assay—Esterase activity with p-nitrophenyl esters as substrates was determined by measuring the amount of p-nitrophenol released by esterase catalyzed hydrolysis (14.Gilham D. Lehner R. Methods. 2005; 36: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity against p-nitrophenyl (p-NP) esters was determined using p-nitrophenyl esters with a chain length between C2 (p-nitrophenyl acetate) and C18 (p-nitrophenyl stearate). Stock solutions of 100 mm p-nitrophenyl ester were made in CH2Cl2. All p-nitrophenyl esters were purchased from Sigma. Immediately prior to initiation of the assay, 10 μl of the stock solution was diluted into 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton-X-100. Protein samples of up to 20 μl were incubated with 0.2 ml of substrate solution in 96-well clear microtiter plates. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C,the liberation of p-nitrophenol was measured as the increase in absorbance at 410 nm in an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer against a blank without enzyme. The specific activity is expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol released per s-1 μg-1 protein. The total amount of protein in the samples was determined using a standard method (13.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Under all conditions, the enzyme activities were proportional to the amount of protein added and to the incubation time. S. cerevisiae Contains a Family of Putative Ethyl Ester Biosynthesis Genes—The genes EHT1, YPL095c, and YMR210w constitute a three-gene family of moderately divergent sequences. We have named YPL095c EEB1 for “ethyl ester biosynthesis” gene 1 (see further). Pair wise comparisons of EHT1 with EEB1 showed 58 and 63% identity at the amino acid and DNA levels, respectively, and comparison with YMR210w showed 32 and 58% identity at the amino acid and DNA levels, respectively. The comparison of EEB1 and YMR210w gives 31 and 55% identity at the amino acid and DNA levels, respectively. Fig. 1A shows an alignment of Eht1, Eeb1, and Ymr210w. Sequence comparisons of EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w with annotated data bases revealed sequence similarity with orthologues of various fungi (Fig. 1B). Eht1 and Eeb1 share common orthologues, while Ymr210w clearly shows similarity with a different set of orthologues. The sequence similarity of Eht1 and Eeb1 with common orthologues suggests that one of these two genes is a duplicated gene copy possibly arising from the ancient genome duplication of S. cerevisiae. According to Manolis et al. (15.Manolis K. Birren B.W. Lander E.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), EHT1 and EEB1 are located on duplicated regions of the S. cerevisiae genome, which could mean that they share a similar function. It is interesting to note that all the orthologues of Eht1 and Eeb1 and also Ymr210w have an as yet unknown function. This means that Eht1, Eeb1 and Ymr210w belong to yet uncharacterized gene families. With the functional investigation of these three enzymes, we will have a first clue of the possible functional role of the members of these two gene families. Deletion Analysis of EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w and Medium-chain Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester Synthesis—To determine the possible function of EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w in MCFA ethyl ester synthesis, we first constructed all the single, double, and triple deletion mutants for those three genes (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). All single and multiple deletion strains are haploid viable. They were tested for possible growth defects by growing them in complete medium with glucose at 30 °C. The strain eht1Δ eeb1Δ showed a little delayed lag phase but reached the same A600 nm as the other strains in stationary phase (data not shown). To determine the effect of the deletion of EHT1, EEB1, and YMR210w on the synthesis of MCFA ethyl esters, the strains eht1Δ, eeb1Δ, ymr210wΔ, eht1Δ eeb1Δ, eht1Δ ymr210wΔ, eeb1Δ ymr210wΔ, and eht1Δ eeb1Δ ymr210wΔ were tested in batch culture fermentations for MCFA ethyl ester production. After 5 days of fermentation, samples for volatile compound determination were taken. They were analyzed by headspace GC-FID and purge-and-trap GC-MS. Fermentations and chromatographic analysis were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of the GC-FID and GC-MS analyses are given in Fig. 2. Each fermentation experiment and the subsequent analysis were repeated three times for each strain. Fig. 2 shows that the levels of ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and ethyl decanoate produced during fermentation with the eeb1Δ strain were reduced in comparison with those produced by the wild type strain by, respectively, 36, 88, 45, and 40%. Compared with the eeb1Δ strain, deletion of EHT1 did not affect the production of ethyl butanoate and ethyl decanoate and resulted in only minor decreases in ethyl hexanoate formation (36%) and ethyl octanoate formation (20%). Deletion of YMR210w did not affect the production of MCFA ethyl esters, suggesting that Ymr210w has no role in the production of MCFA ethyl esters or that its role is redundant with that of other gene products. The double deletion strain eht1Δ eeb1Δ produced similar levels of ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl decanoate as the eeb1Δ single deletion strain and a lower level of ethyl octanoate (82% reduction in comparison to the wild type), indicating that Eht1 plays only a minor role in MCFA ethyl ester synthesis, while Eeb1 is the most important enzyme for MCFA ethyl ester synthesis. The double deletion of EEB1 and YMR210w produced similar levels of ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate in comparison to the eeb1Δ strain but lower levels for ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate. The double deletion strain eht1Δ ymr210wΔ showed no significant difference in the production of MCFA ethyl esters in comparison with the wild type strain. The eht1Δ eeb1Δ ymr210wΔ strain produced similar levels of ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate as the eht1Δ eeb1Δ strain but showed a further 65% decrease in the production of ethyl octanoate and a further 88% decrease in the production of ethyl decanoate in comparison with the eht1Δ eeb1Δ strain. This confirms that Ymr210w plays no significant role in ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate production but indicates that it does contri"

However, to establish these links it is imperative to characterize the cortical activity patterns that are elicited by stimulation locally around the electrode and in other functionally connected areas. We have developed a technique to record brain activity using the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal while applying electrical microstimulation to the primate brain. We find that the spread of activity around the electrode tip in macaque area V1 was larger than expected from calculations based on passive spread of current and therefore may reflect functional spread by way of horizontal connections. Consistent with this functional transynaptic spread we also obtained activation in expected projection sites in extrastriate visual areas, demonstrating the utility of our technique in uncovering in vivo functional connectivity maps.

Electrical stimulation has been used extensively to study the functional organization of the brain by establishing relationships between specific regions of the brain and behavior. This method has been central in the discovery of topographic maps involved in the generation of ocular and skeletomotor behaviors (e.g., Fritsch and Hitzig, 1870Fritsch G. Hitzig E.

Despite this, we still know very little about the local and distal brain circuits recruited during the delivery of currents to brain tissue. Most methods available for studying functional connectivity are largely inferential and depend on a reliable stimulation-elicited behavioral response (e.g., Yeomans and Tehovnik, 1988Yeomans J.S.

Selective gating of visual signals by microstimulation of frontal cortex.Nature. 2003; 421: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Here we have developed a technique of simultaneous electrical microstimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of the macaque monkey to characterize the activity patterns that are generated locally at the site of stimulation and distally at regions innervated by the site of stimulation. To establish that the microstimulation was indeed activating neurons and not the smooth muscle of the vasculature, we determined the excitability (i.e., chronaxie) of the stimulated tissue by using the BOLD signal. We also measured the functional spread of activity around the electrode tip for a range of current amplitudes. Finally, the functional connectivity between V1 and extrastriate cortex, i.e., areas V2, V3, V3A, V4, and middle temporal cortex (area MT/V5), was examined by stimulating V1 while simultaneously imaging extrastriate cortex. The microstimulation experiments were conducted with the use of six rhesus monkeys while they were under an anesthesia protocol specifically developed for functional imaging (Logothetis et al., 1999Logothetis N.K. Guggenberger H. Peled S. Pauls J. Functional imaging of the monkey brain.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J. Augath M. Trinath T. Oeltermann A. Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal.Nature. 2001; 412: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (4412) Google Scholar). A 4.7 Tesla scanner was used with protocols described in detail elsewhere (Figure 1A; Logothetis et al., 1999Logothetis N.K. Guggenberger H. Peled S. Pauls J. Functional imaging of the monkey brain.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J. Augath M. Trinath T. Oeltermann A. Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal.Nature. 2001; 412: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (4412) Google Scholar). During an experimental session, a single microelectrode was advanced into the gray matter of the operculum of V1. A fiber optic system was used to present different visual stimuli that were moved manually to map out the multiunit response field. The receptive-field centers of the units at the electrode tip were between 1 to 6 degrees of eccentricity, usually situated within the lower contralateral visual field (i.e., contralateral with respect to the cortical hemisphere under study). The location of the microelectrode within V1 was confirmed with the use of an anatomical MRI sequence (see Experimental Procedures). Typically, a microelectrode was positioned within the granular or infragranular layers of V1, not extending more than 1.8 mm below the cortical surface, which is the approximate thickness of striate cortex in macaque monkeys (Peters and Sethares, 1991Peters A. Sethares C. Organization of pyramidal neurons in area 17 of monkey visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 306: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Brain activity in V1 and extrastriate visual areas was measured with BOLD during microstimulation of V1. Four-second-long trains of pulses were delivered through the microelectrode in V1, with each train followed by a 12 s period of no stimulation (Figure 1B) before the occurrence of the next train. Stimulation typically was comprised of 200 μs duration pulses delivered at 100 Hz. Each pulse was biphasic and balanced with the cathodal pulse leading the anodal pulse. In all experiments, the current amplitude of the stimulation pulses was manipulated. In the series of experiments done to measure chronaxie, the pulse duration was also varied. Figure 2 shows BOLD activity evoked by stimulation of one site using pulses with amplitude of 1400 μA and 200 μs duration pulses delivered at 100 Hz. Here, the electrode tip, which caused a small susceptibility artifact around it, was placed well within the gray matter of the operculum of V1 (third horizontal slice from the bottom in Figure 2A, electrode location is shown by arrow labeled “E” in Figure 2B). Significant activation was seen around the electrode tip in V1 and within extrastriate regions of V2/V3 and MT/V5 (Figures 2C and 2D). In this experiment, the electrode was placed on the operculum away from the posterior genu of the lunate sulcus, and therefore the underlying neurons' receptive fields were away from the vertical meridian. Consistent with the visual topography of V2 in the macaque (Gattass et al., 1981Gattass R. Gross C.G. Sandell J.H. Visual topography of V2 in the macaque.J. Comp. Neurol. 1981; 201: 519-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, Brewer et al., 2002Brewer A.A. Press W.A. Logothetis N.K. Wandell B.A. Visual areas in the macaque cortex measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10416-10426PubMed Google Scholar), the activation in V2 was found within the posterior bank of the lunate away from the posterior genu of the lunate sulcus and closer to the fundus of the lunate sulcus (Figure 2D). Figure 3A shows BOLD activity evoked by stimulation during the same experimental session as before (Figure 2) but using pulses with amplitude of 800 μA and 400 μs duration pulses delivered at 100 Hz. Using these parameters, the time course of the microstimulation elicited BOLD activity in V1, within the lunate sulcus (LS), and MT/V5 is shown in Figures 3B–3D. The onset of the activity following stimulation was comparable for the three regions (all with a latency of under 2 s). Although in this study we primarily used a train duration of 4 s (e.g., Figure 4A, left panel), we also found significant activation with the use of a series of shorter train durations of 200 ms interleaved with pauses of no stimulation of 200 ms, 400 ms, and 600 ms (Figure 4A, right three panels from left to right, respectively). In all these cases, the amplitude of the pulses was 750 μA and their duration was 200 μs delivered at 100 Hz. The time course of the activity in V1 is shown in the corresponding panels below each activity map (Figures 4B and 4C). The excitability of the stimulated tissue in V1 eliciting the BOLD signal was assessed by determining its chronaxie. To deduce these values, the current threshold to activate 40% of the maximum volume of gray matter activated on the operculum (data from five V1 sites using five monkeys) was ascertained for pulse durations ranging from 50 to 600 μs to yield a strength-duration curve (Figure 5A). Two measures were obtained from the strength-duration curve, the rheobase current and the chronaxie. The rheobase current corresponds to the horizontal asymptote in the strength-duration curve. The chronaxie is classically defined as the duration of the threshold current pulse having an intensity of twice that of the rheobase current. To determine the chronaxie given the limited range of pulse durations tested, the threshold current was plotted against the inverse of the pulse duration by using the method of Weiss, 1901Weiss G. Sur la possibilité de render comparables centre eux les appareils servant à l'excitation électrique.Arch. Ital. Biol. 1901; 35: 413-446Google Scholar (Figure 5B). These data were fitted by the equation of I = Io + (IoC)/t, where I is the threshold current, Io is the rheobase current (in μA), C is the chronaxie (in μs), and t is the pulse duration (in μs). The values of Io and IoC are given by the linear regression yielding a rheobase current of 349 μA and a chronaxie of 178 μs with a 95% confidence interval between 145 and 508 μs (Figure 5B, shaded area) for the stimulated elements generating the BOLD response in V1. Electrical microstimulation of the operculum of V1 evoked a BOLD response with a maximum spread of 5.8 mm in radius when using 4 s long trains of stimulation comprised of current pulses ranging from 10 to 1800 μA (equivalent to a charge from 2nC to 360nC because we used a fixed pulse duration of 200 μs, Figure 6A). This range of values has been extensively used previously in the microstimulation literature (Tehovnik, 1996Tehovnik E.J. Electrical stimulation of neural tissue to evoke behavioral responses.J. Neurosci. Meth. 1996; 65: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Our results are based on the stimulation of 16 V1 sites using six monkeys. The relationship between the radius of tissue activated due to passive current spread as function of current amplitude as described by Ranck, 1975Ranck Jr., J.B. Which elements are excited in electrical stimulation of mammalian central nervous system: a review.Brain Res. 1975; 98: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar is shown with the diagonal line in Figure 6A. From the data in Figure 6A, we calculated that as measured with BOLD a larger amount of gray matter, equivalent to an increase in 2.65 mm in radius (SEM 0.2 mm), is activated over what one would have expected from direct activation of pyramidal neurons according to Stoney et al., 1968Stoney S.D. Thompson W.D. Asanuma H. Excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical stimulation: effective extent of stimulating current.J. Neurophysiol. 1968; 31: 659-669PubMed Google Scholar. These calculations for direct activation are based on the formula r = (I/K)1/2, where r is the distance of effective current spread from the electrode tip in mm, I is the current used in μA, and K is the current-distance constant with an average of 1292 μA/mm2 for cortical pyramidal cells when using 200 μs duration pulses (Stoney et al., 1968Stoney S.D. Thompson W.D. Asanuma H. Excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical stimulation: effective extent of stimulating current.J. Neurophysiol. 1968; 31: 659-669PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 6B shows the radius of tissue activated in V1 as a function of current amplitude as measured with the BOLD response. This relationship was small yet statistically significant (R2 = 0.06, F = 4.5, p < 0.05, linear regression). As illustrated previously, electrical microstimulation of V1 induced a BOLD response in areas V2, V3, V4, and MT/V5 (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Figures 7A–7D show examples from three monkeys that microstimulation of V1 readily activated area MT/V5. Because area MT/V5 is far anterior to the region stimulated in V1 and because there is no activation between V2/V3 and MT/V5, this suggests that MT/V5 activation is due to transynaptic effects rather than activation resulting from passive current spread (Figures 7A–7D). As the current level was increased, the amount of tissue activated in MT/V5 increased significantly (Figure 7E; R2 = 0.37, F = 12.9, p < 0.01, linear regression). There was also a significant increase in the probability of activating this area with increase in current amplitude. For currents less than 600 μA (pulse duration fixed at 200 μs and stimulation frequency at 100 Hz) only 1 of 52, or 1.9%, of current conditions elicited a significant BOLD response in MT/V5, whereas for currents between 1200 and 1800 μA (pulse duration fixed at 200 μs and stimulation frequency at 100 Hz) 10 of 25, or 40%, of current conditions elicited a significant BOLD response. These proportions are statistically different (p < 0.001, χ2 test). In earlier studies, Schlosser et al., 1999Schlosser M.J. Luby M. Spencer D.D. Awad I.A. McCarthy G. Comparative localization of auditory comprehension using functional magnetic resonance imaging and cortical stimulation.Neurosurg.

Med. 2003; 49: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar stimulated the motor cortex of anesthetized rats while using fMRI to record the effects of direct and indirect stimulation. Unlike these studies that delivered electrical stimulation to the surface of cortex, all of our stimulations were performed with the use of microelectodes that were inserted into the gray matter of cortex by using MRI for guidance. Microelectrodes inserted into gray matter enables the use of currents in the microampere range and to more precisely perturb local circuits. All of our stimulations were monopolar to assure that only one site was directly activated at one time. In the experiments of Schlosser et al. and Austin et al., stimulation was delivered between two surface electrodes: as a result, two cortical regions were being simultaneously directly activated. This double stimulation method increases the amount of tissue activated. Also, our study differed from that of Schlosser et al. in that an anesthetized preparation was used to reduce head-movement artifact, which could have greatly compromised our measures of excitability and extent of tissue activated. The anesthetized preparation also offered us the possibility to run long single experimental sessions (around 12 hr)—something not possible with the awake, behaving macaque preparation. Future studies combining microstimulation and fMRI during behavior will be crucial in order to decipher the relationships between activation patterns and behavioral function. Comparison between the results from the anesthetized and awake experiments will also provide valuable information regarding the effects of anesthesia on the activity patterns generated by microstimulation. A chronaxie is a measure of neuronal excitability. Axons have shorter chronaxies than cell bodies (Ranck, 1975Ranck Jr., J.B. Which elements are excited in electrical stimulation of mammalian central nervous system: a review.Brain Res. 1975; 98: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, Nowak and Bullier, 1998Nowak L.G.

Wolstencroft J.H. Strength-duration characteristics of myelinated and non-myelinated bulbospinal axons in the cat spinal cord.J. Physiol. 1983; 337: 37-50PubMed Google Scholar). By using our procedures, we found that the excitability of the stimulated elements yielding the fMRI signal was similar to that of neuronal elements, i.e., chronaxies falling between 145 and 508 μs (Ranck, 1975Ranck Jr., J.B. Which elements are excited in electrical stimulation of mammalian central nervous system: a review.Brain Res. 1975; 98: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), and not to that of other tissues, such as smooth muscle, which exhibit chronaxies ranging between 6000 and 13000 μs (Sibley, 1984Sibley G.N.A. A comparision of spontaneous and nerve-mediated activity in bladder muscle from man, pig, and rabbit.J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 431-443PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, our chronaxie values overlap with those of cortical pyramidal neurons (Stoney et al., 1968Stoney S.D. Thompson W.D. Asanuma H. Excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical stimulation: effective extent of stimulating current.J. Neurophysiol. 1968; 31: 659-669PubMed Google Scholar, Asanuma et al., 1976Asanuma H. Arnold A. Zarzecki P. Further study on the excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical microstimulation.Exp. Brain Res. 1976; 26: 443-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both simple and complex cells in V1 exhibit a pyramidal morphology (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N. Morphology and intracortical projections of functionally characterized neurons in the cat visual cortex.Nature. 1979; 280: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), and these cells are activated by electrical stimulation (Ronner et al., 1981Ronner S.F. Foote W.E. Pollen D.A. Intracortical microstimulation of neurons in the visual cortex of the cat.Electroenchephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1981; 52: 375-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The chronaxies of V1 elements generating the fMRI response also overlap with those mediating behavioral responses evoked electrically from V1 of monkeys and humans. In monkeys, the chronaxies of stimulated V1 elements generating saccadic eye movements and conditioning responses range from 100 to 500 μs (Bartlett et al., 2005Bartlett J.R. De Yoe E.A. Doty R.W. Lee B.B. Levine J.D. Negrão N. Overmann Jr., W.H. Psychophysics of electrical stimulation of striate cortex in macaques.J.

Phosphene induction and the generation of saccadic eye movements by striate cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In humans, the chronaxies of stimulated V1 elements producing phosphenes range from 100 to 400 μs (Brindley and Lewin, 1968Brindley G.S. Lewin W.S. The sensation produced by electrical stimulation of visual cortex.J. Physiol. 1968; 196: 479-493PubMed Google Scholar, Dobelle and Mladejovsky, 1974Dobelle W.H. Mladejovsky M.G.

Frontiers in Visual Science. Springer-Verlag, New York1978: 574-594Crossref Google Scholar). Whether the same pyramidal elements in V1 mediate the above behavioral responses and the fMRI responses reported in our study is unclear. Methods will need to be developed to selectively and transiently inactivate particular groups of neurons in V1 to ascertain whether the same neurons mediate the behavioral and fMRI responses evoked electrically from V1. Based on our fMRI results, a 4 s stimulation train of pulses delivered at 100 Hz and with a pulse duration of 200 μs activated 2.65 mm larger in radius tissue than expected from directly activated pyramidal neurons according to Stoney et al., 1968Stoney S.D. Thompson W.D. Asanuma H. Excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical stimulation: effective extent of stimulating current.J. Neurophysiol. 1968; 31: 659-669PubMed Google Scholar. A number of reasons can account for the difference between our results and those of Stoney et al. The spread measured with BOLD could reflect a hemodynamic spread or synaptic activity that may not necessarily lead to spiking activity. Nevertheless, it is likely that the measured spread of BOLD activation reflects in addition spiking activity that arises as a result of transynaptic spread. Another major difference between our study and Stoney et al. is the number of pulses delivered. In our study we used long trains of pulses (4 s), whereas in Stoney et al. single pulses were delivered. However, it has been previously shown that a single electrical pulse delivered to neural tissue also activates fibers transynaptically within the cortex (Stoney et al., 1968Stoney S.D. Thompson W.D. Asanuma H. Excitation of pyramidal tract cells by intracortical stimulation: effective extent of stimulating current.J.

Spatiotemporal effects of microstimulation in rat neocortex: a parametric study using multielectrode recordings.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 3024-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For example, a 5 μA (at 0.2 ms pulse duration) current pulse delivered to motor cortex can activate neurons laterally and transynaptically out to 1.5 mm from the electrode tip (Asanuma and Rosén, 1973Asanuma H. Rosén I. Spread of mono- and polysynaptic connections within cat's motor cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 1973; 16: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Delivering a train of four 5 μA pulses (at 400 Hz) to the superior colliculus can activate tissue up to 2–3 mm from the electrode tip (McIlwain, 1982McIlwain J.T. Lateral spread of neural excitation during microstimulation in intermediate gray layers of cat's superior colliculus.J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 47: 167-178PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it should not be surprising that focal electrical stimulation of V1 in monkeys produces lateral spread of neural activity because V1 is comprised of columns that are interconnected by horizontal projections (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1989Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N. Columnar specificity of intrinsic horizontal and corticocortical connections in cat visual cortex.J. Neur"

We discovered that quadruple knockdown of ADMP and BMP2/4/7 in Xenopus embryos eliminates self-regulation, causing ubiquitous neural induction throughout the ectoderm. ADMP transcription in the Spemann organizer is activated at low BMP levels. When ventral BMP2/4/7 signals are depleted, Admp expression increases, allowing for self-regulation. ADMP has BMP-like activity and signals via the ALK-2 receptor. It is unable to signal dorsally because of inhibition by Chordin. The ventral BMP antagonists Sizzled and Bambi further refine the pattern. By transplanting dorsal or ventral wild-type grafts into ADMP/BMP2/4/7-depleted hosts, we demonstrate that both poles serve as signaling centers that can induce histotypic differentiation over considerable distances. We conclude that dorsal and ventral BMP signals and their extracellular antagonists expressed under opposing transcriptional regulation provide a molecular mechanism for embryonic self-regulation.

How do embryos reliably generate a perfect tissue and body pattern time after time? Experimental embryology has shown that embryonic regions with equivalent developmental potential, or morphogenetic fields, have the remarkable property of “regulating” to re-form a normal structure after experimental perturbations (Harrison, 1918Harrison R.G. Experiments on the development of the fore-limb of Amblystoma, a self-differentiating equipotential system.J. Exp. Zool. 1918; 25: 413-461Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Huxley and de Beer, 1934Huxley J.S. de Beer G.R. The Elements of Experimental Embryology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1934Google Scholar, Spemann, 1938Spemann H. Embryonic Development and Induction. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1938Crossref Google Scholar). One striking example of this self-regulation is the ligature experiment of Hans Spemann, in which he used a baby-hair loop to divide a cleaving amphibian embryo into two halves (Spemann, 1903Spemann H. Entwicklungsphysiologische Studien am Tritonei III.Arch. f. Entw. Mech. 1903; 16: 551-631Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The half lacking the dorsal blastopore lip developed into a “bauchstück,” or belly-piece, consisting of only ventral tissues with no axial structures, whereas the dorsal half developed into a perfectly well-proportioned half-sized embryo containing both dorsal and ventral tissues. Another example of self-regulation is provided by the chick embryo: subdividing the blastoderm into fragments can result in multiple axes when cultured in isolation (Spratt and Hass, 1960Spratt N.T.

Strikingly, one mammal, the armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), can naturally regulate to generate four genetically identical embryos from a single blastocyst during normal reproduction (Enders, 2002Enders A.C. Implantation in the nine-banded armadillo: how does a single blastocyst form four embryos?.Placenta. 2002; 23: 71-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In humans, it is thought that the most frequent type of identical twins arises from single blastocysts in which the inner cell mass is split in two (Sadler, 2004Sadler T.W. Langman's Medical Embryology.Ninth Edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2004Google Scholar). Despite long-standing interest, the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity of any morphogenetic field to self-regulate remain one of the unsolved mysteries of developmental biology. A new framework for understanding how the embryo self-regulates is provided by the recent proposal that the gastrula Xenopus embryo contains a dorsal and a ventral signaling center. The dorsal center, or Spemann organizer, is a source of secreted BMP antagonists (such as Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin, and Cerberus) and Wnt antagonists (such as Dkk, Frzb, sFRP2, and Crescent). At the opposite pole, a ventral center develops in which yet another subset of extracellular regulators—such as the BMP pathway components Xolloid-related (Xlr), Twisted Gastrulation (Tsg), Crossveinless-2 (CV-2), Sizzled, and Bambi—are expressed at gastrula (reviewed in De Robertis and Kuroda, 2004De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Dorsal-ventral patterning and neural induction in Xenopus embryos.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Expression of ventral-center genes parallels that of the Bmp4 gene (Niehrs and Pollet, 1999Niehrs C. Pollet N. Synexpression groups in eukaryotes.Nature. 1999; 402: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and is prominently marked by the expression of Sizzled/ogon (Collavin and Kirschner, 2003Collavin L. Kirschner M.W. The secreted Frizzled-related protein Sizzled functions as a negative feedback regulator of extreme ventral mesoderm.Development. 2003; 130: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Bambi (Onichtchouk et al., 1999Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Silencing of TGF-beta signalling by the pseudoreceptor BAMBI.Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Genetic and molecular studies in zebrafish and Xenopus have shown that BMPs and their secreted antagonists are important regulators of embryonic dorsoventral (DV) patterning (De Robertis and Kuroda, 2004De Robertis E.M.

In particular, much evidence suggests that BMP inhibition is required for central nervous system (CNS) formation in Xenopus (Harland, 2000Harland R. Neural induction.Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 2005; 8: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a recent loss-of-function study of the three main ventral BMPs in Xenopus revealed that even triple BMP2/4/7 knockdowns still retained substantial DV polarity (Reversade et al., 2005Reversade B. Kuroda H. Lee H. Mays A. De Robertis E.M. Depletion of Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7 and Spemann organizer signals induces massive brain formation in Xenopus embryos.Development. 2005; 132: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we bisected Xenopus embryos into dorsal and ventral halves at the blastula stage and found that inhibition of BMP4/7 signaling was able to induce neural tissue in ventral half-embryos but was without effect in dorsal halves. An appealing candidate to ensure ventral development in the dorsal halves was the anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (ADMP), a member of the BMP family known to have ventralizing activity despite being expressed in the dorsal gastrula organizing center of Xenopus, zebrafish, and chick embryos (Moos et al., 1995Moos Jr., M.

Using morpholino oligomer (MO) knockdown, we now demonstrate that transcriptional upregulation of Admp plays a key role in compensating for the depletion of ventrally expressed Bmp2/4/7 since Admp expression is activated by low BMP levels. In the embryo, ADMP activity is blocked on the dorsal side by the secreted BMP antagonist Chordin, which prevents ADMP from binding to its cognate receptor ALK-2. This inhibition is reversed when Chordin is cleaved by the Xolloid-related (Xlr) metalloproteinase (Piccolo et al., 1997Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M.

Strikingly, when ventral and dorsal BMP signals were simultaneously inactivated in embryos by the quadruple depletion of BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, and ADMP, self-regulation was lost, causing the entire ectoderm to become neural tissue. Transplantation of ventral and dorsal centers into BMP2/4/7/ADMP-depleted hosts demonstrated that both centers can act as a source of BMP signals, restoring epidermal patterning over considerable distances. We conclude that the DV embryonic morphogenetic field of the Xenopus embryo is established in part by BMP signals and extracellular BMP antagonists—such as Chordin, Sizzled, and Bambi—expressed at the dorsal and ventral poles of the embryo, which are under opposite transcriptional regulation. An embryological assay that separates the dorsal and ventral centers was developed. When embryos with strong DV polarity (Klein, 1987Klein S.L. The first cleavage furrow demarcates the dorsal-ventral axis in Xenopus embryos.Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were bisected at blastula, the ventral half, which is more pigmented, developed into rounded belly-pieces consisting of only ventral tissues, while the dorsal half gave rise to a well-proportioned half-sized embryo (Figures 1A–1D). We first tested the effects of depletion of BMP4/7 because, in most embryonic assays, triple depletion of BMP2/4/7 gave similar phenotypes to those of double BMP4/7 signals (Reversade et al., 2005Reversade B. Kuroda H. Lee H. Mays A. De Robertis E.M. Depletion of Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7 and Spemann organizer signals induces massive brain formation in Xenopus embryos.Development. 2005; 132: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Depletion of BMP4/7 signals reproducibly caused striking phenotypes in ventral halves (Figures 1D and 1F–1H). Neural tissue is normally lacking in ventral halves, but after BMP4/7 depletion, strong elongation and CNS differentiation, marked by Sox2 expression, were observed (Figure 1F). We were surprised to find, however, that, in dorsal half-embryos, knockdown of BMP4/7 was virtually without effect (compare Figures 1C and 1E). This suggested that an additional ventralizing signal present in the dorsal side might compensate for the lack of BMP4/7. The BMP-like growth factor ADMP (Moos et al., 1995Moos Jr., M. Wang S. Krinks M. Anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein is a novel TGF-beta homolog expressed in the Spemann organizer.Development. 1995; 121: 4293-4301PubMed Google Scholar, Dosch and Niehrs, 2000Dosch R. Niehrs C. Requirement for anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein in organizer patterning.Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) provided an excellent candidate for this signal (Figure 2A). This prompted us to re-examine its expression and function during Xenopus development. At blastula and gastrula stages, Admp was expressed dorsally in cells closely associated with the region of Chordin expression, and injection of Xenopus Admp mRNA activated expression of known BMP target genes (Figure 2B; see also Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). To study the function of ADMP in vivo, we designed an antisense MO targeting both Xenopus laevis Admp pseudoalleles found in the EST databases (Figures 2E and 2F). Microinjection of Admp MO into each blastomere at the four-cell stage resulted in embryos showing signs of decreased BMP signaling, such as impaired Sizzled expression in the ventral side and increased Six3 expression in the forebrain and eyes (Figures 2G and 2H). Importantly, all defects associated with loss of endogenous ADMP activity could be rescued by microinjection of synthetic mRNA encoding zebrafish Admp, which lacks the sequences targeted by Admp MO (Figures 2H–2J; Willot et al., 2002Willot V. Mathieu J. Lu Y. Schmid B. Sidi S. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J.H. Mullins M. Rosa F. Peyrieras N. Cooperative action of ADMP- and BMP-mediated pathways in regulating cell fates in the zebrafish gastrula.Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We next asked whether ADMP was required for the self-regulation observed in dorsal half-embryos (Figure 3). Knockdown of ADMP was without effect on the development of ventral halves (Figures 3D and 3F). Instead, dorsal halves depleted of ADMP had greatly expanded neural tissue marked by Sox2 expression (compare Figures 3C and 3E). We conclude that self-regulation in dorsal half-embryos requires ADMP signals originating from Spemann's organizer. ADMP and BMP4 share similar sequence and ventralizing activity yet have diametrically opposed expression patterns. This poses a conundrum as to why embryos have two distinct sources of BMP signals at opposite poles, when in principle one should suffice. Microinjection of Chordin protein or knockdown of BMP4/7 activity increased Admp expression (Figure 2C and data not shown), indicating that expression of Admp might be negatively regulated by BMP signaling. As shown in Figure 3G, we tested this directly by analyzing transcript levels of ventral and dorsal marker genes in embryos in conditions of either high or low BMP signaling, using injections of recombinant BMP4 or Chordin protein into the blastocoele cavity (Figure 3G). RT-PCR analyses of whole embryos at midgastrula (stage 11) showed that transcription of dorsal genes such as Chordin and Admp was inhibited by high BMP levels (Figure 3G, lanes 3 and 5). When BMP signaling levels were decreased by injecting increasing amounts of Chordin protein, Admp expression was upregulated (Figure 3G, lane 1). Conversely, expression of Bmp4 was positively regulated by BMP signaling (Figure 3G). High levels of BMP4 activated transcription of the ventral-center genes Sizzled and Bambi (Figure 3G, lane 5). In situ hybridizations confirmed an expansion of the ventral center marked by Bambi or Sizzled at the expense of the Spemann organizer marked by Admp or Chordin (Figure S3). Bambi encodes a natural dominant-negative BMP receptor (Onichtchouk et al., 1999Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Silencing of TGF-beta signalling by the pseudoreceptor BAMBI.Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and Sizzled/Ogon is a negative-feedback inhibitor of BMP signaling (Yabe et al., 2003Yabe T. Shimizu T. Muraoka O. Bae Y.K. Hirata T. Nojima H. Kawakami A. Hirano T. Hibi M. Ogon/Secreted Frizzled functions as a negative feedback regulator of Bmp signaling.Development. 2003; 130: 2705-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To show that, at high BMP levels, Bambi and Sizzled function as BMP antagonists in the ventral center, we knocked down these genes. Both Bambi (this study) and Sizzled (Collavin and Kirschner, 2003Collavin L. Kirschner M.W. The secreted Frizzled-related protein Sizzled functions as a negative feedback regulator of extreme ventral mesoderm.Development. 2003; 130: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) MO caused ventralization on their own (data not shown). Bambi and Sizzled MO synergized when coinjected, expanding the ventral center and greatly reducing neural tissue (Figures 3H and 3I). Knockdown of these ventral-center genes sensitized the embryo to a single injection of Admp mRNA on the dorsal side, causing the complete loss of CNS (Figures 3J and 3K). This experiment shows that Bambi and Sizzled function as bona fide BMP antagonists in the ventral center. We conclude that a key difference between ventral BMPs (e.g., BMP4) and ADMP, which have similar ventralizing activity, resides in their opposite transcriptional regulation by the BMP signaling pathway itself. In this “seesaw-like” type of self-regulation, Admp expression is turned on by low BMP signaling levels (Figure 3L and Figure S7). The opposite is true for Bmp4, which is positively regulated by BMP signals. High BMP levels increase expression of the BMP antagonists Bambi and Sizzled, which serve as feedback inhibitors of BMP signaling in the ventral side. When Admp/Chordin expression goes down, ventral Bmp4/Sizzled/Bambi expression goes up, and vice versa. This provides the embryo with an elegant yet simple way of adjusting and maintaining BMP signaling levels in a developing morphogenetic field (Figure 3L). Xenopus ADMP promotes ventral development, and this is achieved, as is the case for other BMPs, through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Smad1 (Figure 2F) without affecting the Smad2, Erk, or β-catenin pathways (Figure S4). Chordin protein injection blocked ADMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation in embryos (Figure 2F, lane 4), suggesting that Chordin might repress ADMP in vivo. To test for a direct biochemical interaction between Chordin, ADMP, and cofactors of the Chordin pathway, crosslinking experiments were performed with supernatants of transfected 293T cell cocultures (Figures 4A–4C). The results showed that Myc-tagged ADMP protein (Willot et al., 2002Willot V. Mathieu J. Lu Y. Schmid B. Sidi S. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J.H. Mullins M. Rosa F. Peyrieras N. Cooperative action of ADMP- and BMP-mediated pathways in regulating cell fates in the zebrafish gastrula.Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) could be detected in a high-molecular weight complex when chemically crosslinked (by disuccinimidyl suberate) in solution to Chordin alone or to Chordin and Tsg together (Figure 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, formation of these complexes was inhibited by the metalloproteinase Xlr (Figures 4A and 4B, lanes 8 and 9), which cleaves Chordin. The binding of ADMP, Chordin, and Tsg was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in the absence of crosslinker (Figure S5). We next investigated whether Chordin and Tsg block the binding of ADMP to its cognate receptor. Previous work of Dosch and Niehrs, 2000Dosch R. Niehrs C. Requirement for anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein in organizer patterning.Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar had shown that ADMP signaling could not be inhibited by tBR, a truncated ALK-3 BMP receptor. Immunoprecipitation studies using chimeric human BMP receptors (BMPR) fused to the Fc fragment of IgG confirmed that ADMP does not bind to BMPR-Ia (ALK-3), BMPR-Ib (ALK-6), or BMPR-II (Figure 4D). Instead, we found specific binding to ALK-2 (Figure 4D, lane 4), a different type I BMPR (Macias-Silva et al., 1998Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. Specific activation of Smad1 signaling pathways by the BMP7 type I receptor, ALK2.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Using this ALK-2-Fc fusion protein, we were able to show that Chordin decreased ADMP binding to its receptor, while the combination of Chordin and Tsg blocked it (Figure 4E). Importantly, addition of Xlr metalloproteinase cleaved Chordin and restored ADMP binding to ALK-2 (Figure 4E, lanes 4 and 5). These biochemical results show that ADMP is subjected to extracellular regulation by Chordin, Tsg, and Xlr, which regulate ADMP binding to its dedicated ALK-2 cell-surface receptor. We next asked whether ADMP is regulated by Chordin in vivo (Figure 5). Admp MO-injected embryos were dorsalized, with expanded Otx2 and decreased Sizzled expression (Figure 5B), indicating reduced BMP signaling. Conversely, Chd MO-injected embryos were ventralized (Figure 5C), with an expanded Sizzled expression domain and reduced head structures (Oelgeschläger et al., 2003aOelgeschläger M. Kuroda H. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Chordin is required for the Spemann organizer transplantation phenomenon in Xenopus embryos.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When ADMP and Chordin activity were depleted simultaneously, Chordin/Admp morphants were virtually indistinguishable from wild-type embryos (Figure 5D), demonstrating that an inhibitory interaction between ADMP and Chordin does take place in the embryo. To further test this interaction in a gain-of-function situation, embryos were injected with doses of Xenopus Admp mRNA sufficient to eliminate CNS formation, which could be restored by a single dorsal injection of Chordin mRNA (Figures 5E and 5F). In addition, ventral injection of Chordin mRNA, which induced partial secondary axes, was potentiated in ADMP-depleted embryos, causing complete secondary axes with two eyes marked by Six3 (Figures 5G and 5H). Moreover, depletion of ADMP rendered the embryo hypersensitive to forebrain expansion induced by a low dose of Chordin (Figure S6). Finally, classical Spemann organizer grafts performed at stage 10¾ (midgastrula), which induce trunks with no eyes or cyclopic eyes, were able to induce complete head structures containing two eyes when the donor organizer had been depleted of ADMP (Figures 5I and 5J). Taken together, these loss- and gain-of-function experiments strongly suggest that Chordin inhibits ADMP in vivo. To determine whether a self-regulating field is indeed established by the opposite regulation of ventral BMPs and dorsal ADMP, we inhibited both BMP sources simultaneously by coinjecting Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7, and Admp MOs (Figure 6). This experiment produced a remarkable result. Knockdown of ADMP or of BMP2/4/7 caused CNS expansion, but embryos still retained DV patterning (Figures 6A–6C). Strikingly, quadruple ADMP/BMP2/4/7 knockdown resulted in radially dorsalized embryos in which the entire ectoderm was converted into CNS, as demonstrated by the panneural marker Sox2 (Figure 6D). This ubiquitous induction of neural fate in the ectoderm (Figure 6D, inset) was accompanied by the reciprocal loss of epidermal fate, as shown by the absence of Cytokeratin expression (Figures 6E and 6F). If any of the four MOs was omitted, neuralization was incomplete and some epidermal differentiation remained. With the exception of an extruding extension that contained the blastopore at its tip (corresponding to the spinal-cord region), the CNS induced by quadruple knockdowns consisted mostly of radial brain tissues, as evidenced by the circumferential expression of the fore- and midbrain marker Otx2, the telencephalic marker Rx2a, and the hindbrain marker Krox20 (Figures 6G and 6H). We conclude that ventral (BMP2/4/7) and dorsal (ADMP) BMPs are simultaneously required for regulative DV patterning. Quadruple inhibition of ADMP/BMP2/4/7 signaling is sufficient for the entire ectoderm to acquire neural fate at the expense of the epidermal lineage. This strongly supports the view that inhibition of BMP signaling is sufficient for neural induction in vivo and that BMP signaling establishes a self-regulating morphogenetic field. The BMP antagonists Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin, and Cerberus are needed for dorsal development in Xenopus (Oelgeschläger et al., 2003aOelgeschläger M. Kuroda H. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M.

Cell. 2005; 8: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To show that the ubiquitous neural induction seen in quadruple ADMP/BMP2/4/7 knockdowns was due to the loss of ligands rather than to an increase in their antagonists, we performed epistatic experiments in which eight antagonists and ligands were knocked down concomitantly. Knockdown of Chordin/Noggin/Follistatin/Cerberus greatly decreased anterior CNS tissue (compare Figures 6I and 6K). In a recent study, a more complete loss of neural plate was found in Xenopus tropicalis triple Follistatin/Chordin/Noggin-depleted embryos (Khokha et al., 2005Khokha M.K. Yeh J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Depletion of three BMP antagonists from Spemann's organizer leads to a catastrophic loss of dorsal structures.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); the difference with our results may arise from incomplete targeting of some cDNA isoforms in Xenopus laevis. When Admp/Bmp2/4/7 morpholinos were coinjected into Chordin/Noggin/Follistatin/Cerberus-depleted embryos, it was found that the BMP ligands were epistatic to the secreted antagonists, so that ubiquitous neural induction was still observed (Figure 6M). Thus, the complete neuralization is caused by a lack of BMP ligands and not by an increase of BMP antagonists. In a gain-of-function situation, Chordin (1 μM) or Noggin-Fc (0.5 μM) protein injections (40 nl) into the blastocoele cavity were able to completely block endogenous BMP ligands, causing ubiquitous neural induction throughout the ectoderm as well (Figure 6N). A particularly informative experiment was carried out taking advantage of triple BMP2/4/7 knockdowns, in which epidermal differentiation should be mediated solely by ADMP. These embryos had an expanded CNS but retained considerable amounts of epidermis on the ventral side, at a great distance from the dorsal source of ADMP secretio"

Our findings explain the requirement of RbC for high-affinity E2F binding and growth suppression and establish a mechanism for the regulation of Rb-E2F association by phosphorylation. The transition from the G1 to the S phases of the cell cycle marks an irreversible commitment to DNA synthesis and proliferation and is strictly regulated by positive and negative growth-regulatory signals. The G1-S transition is controlled by the Rb-E2F pathway, which links growth-regulatory pathways to a transcription program required for DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell division (Dyson, 1998Dyson N. The regulation of E2F by pRB-family proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). This transcription program is activated by the E2F transcription factors and repressed by E2F-Rb complexes. E2F overexpression or Rb inactivation is sufficient to induce S phase entry, whereas Rb overexpression can arrest cycling cells in G1, demonstrating that the Rb-E2F pathway is central to the control of the G1-S transition (Dyson, 1998Dyson N. The regulation of E2F by pRB-family proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells or cells in early G1, the Rb protein binds to the E2F transcription factors and blocks their transactivation domain. Rb also recruits transcriptional co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) and chromatin-remodeling complexes, resulting in the repression of E2F-responsive promoters (Dyson, 1998Dyson N. The regulation of E2F by pRB-family proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Mitogenic growth factors lead to the sequential activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-Cyclin complexes Cdk4/6-CyclinD and Cdk2-CyclinE, which hyperphosphorylate Rb and thereby cause the release of active E2F (Dyson, 1998Dyson N. The regulation of E2F by pRB-family proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). The Rb pathway thus ensures that S phase entry strictly depends on growth-factor signals. The importance of Rb in the control of cell proliferation is underscored by the deregulation of this pathway in a majority of cancer cases, which occurs either by mutation or deletion of Rb, or by alterations in the upstream Cdk, Cyclin, and Cdk-inhibitory proteins (Sherr, 1996Sherr C.J. Cancer cell cycles.Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar, Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). Rb is also inactivated by DNA tumor viruses such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), adenovirus, and the simian virus 40 (SV40), all of which express proteins that induce S phase by binding to Rb and releasing active E2Fs (Nevins, 1994Nevins J.R. Cell cycle targets of the DNA tumor viruses.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In humans, there are at least six closely related E2F proteins (E2F1 through E2F6) and two Rb homologs (p107 and p130), which are commonly referred to as pocket proteins. The E2F proteins have similar core DNA-sequence specificity, but they differ in their ability to drive quiescent cells into the cell cycle and in their relative promoter distribution in G1 and S (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Sibling rivalry in the E2F family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). E2F1 through E2F3 are typically associated with active promoters in S phase, while E2F4 through E2F6 with repressed promoters in G0 or early G1. These differences are correlated with the preferences of E2Fs for different Rb family members (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Sibling rivalry in the E2F family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 are found associated with Rb, and E2F5 with p130. E2F4, which is the most abundant family member, is found associated primarily with p107 and to a lesser extent with Rb and p130. E2F proteins form heterodimers with one of two DP proteins, which are distantly related to the E2F proteins. Heterodimerization has been shown to enhance the Rb binding, DNA binding, and transactivation activities of E2Fs (Bandara et al., 1994Bandara L.R. Lam E.W.-F. Sorensen T.S. Zamanian M. Girling R.

The six E2F and two DP family members all contain a DNA binding domain (DBD), predicted coiled-coil (CC) domain, and marked-box (MB) domain (Figure 1A). The transactivation domain (TD) is present only in E2F1 through E2F5. Rb contains a 379 residue N-terminal domain of unknown function, a 406 residue middle domain commonly referred to as the pocket, and a 143 residue C-terminal domain (RbC; Figure 1A). The pocket domain, which is best conserved among Rb paralogs, directly binds to and blocks the E2F transactivation domain (Flemington et al., 1993Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin W.G.J.

The pocket of Rb is necessary but not sufficient for growth suppression, which additionally requires RbC (Qin et al., 1992Qin X. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G.J.

Identification of a growth suppression domain within the retinoblastoma gene product.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The importance of the RbC domain is recapitulated in the Rb paralogs p107 and p130, which have conserved sequences C-terminal to their pocket domains that are required for growth suppression, high-affinity binding to their preferred E2F-DP complexes, and maximal repression of E2F-responsive promoters (Zhu et al., 1995Zhu L.

These observations suggest a role for the C-terminal domains of Rb and its paralogs in E2F-DP binding. A general RbC-E2F-DP interaction has also been suggested by studies of the HPV E7, adenovirus E1A, and SV40 large tumor antigen proteins that cause the release of E2F. These proteins share a common LxCxE sequence motif that binds to the Rb pocket domain with high affinity but does not cause the release of E2F (Patrick et al., 1994Patrick D.R. Oliff A.

E2F release requires additional viral-protein domains, which in the case of HPV E7 has been shown to bind RbC (Patrick et al., 1994Patrick D.R. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. Identification of a novel retinoblastoma gene product binding site on the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein.J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 269: 6842-6850Google Scholar). In addition, the adenovirus E4-6/7 protein, which blocks the association of E2F with Rb, has been shown to bind to the E2F MB domain (Jost et al., 1996Jost C. Ginsberg D. Kaelin W.G.J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 6848-6862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raised the possibility that RbC binds to the E2F MB domain and that interference with this association contributes to the release of E2F by viral proteins. A recent study showed that an Rb C-terminal fragment can bind to a truncated E2F1 protein that lacks the transactivation domain (Dick and Dyson, 2003Dick F.A. Dyson N. pRB contains an E2F1-specific binding domain that allows E2F1-induced apoptosis to be regulated separately from other E2F activities.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this interaction was shown to be E2F1 specific and was implicated in an apoptotic function unique to E2F1. The mechanism through which E2F is dissociated by Rb hyperphosphorylation has not been well understood, but most studies point to a hierarchical series of Rb phosphorylation events cumulatively affecting the stability of the Rb-E2F complex (Brown et al., 1999Brown V.D.

Six of the sixteen consensus Cdk phosphorylation sites of Rb map to the RbC, raising the possibility that if a general RbC-E2F interaction does exist, it may be involved in the phosphorylation-induced release of E2F. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between RbC and the CC-MB domains of E2F-DP heterodimers and present the crystal structure of an RbC-E2F1-DP1 complex. The structure in conjunction with biochemical and biophysical data indicate that the RbC-E2F-DP interaction (1) is shared by all E2F and Rb family members, (2) contributes to the preference of p107/p130 for the E2F4 subfamily, and (3) is negatively regulated by RbC hyperphosphorylation. To investigate the possibility of a general interaction between the C-terminal domains of the pocket proteins and the MB domains of their respective E2F-DP partners, we first used limited proteolysis to better define the structural organization of the E2F-DP heterodimer. Extending previous work showing that the E2F-DP DNA binding domains are connected to the CC-domains through an ∼five residue flexible linker (Zheng et al., 1999Zheng N. Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Pavletich N.P. Structural basis of DNA recognition by the heterodimeric cell cycle transcription factor E2F-DP.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we found that the E2F2-DP1 heterodimer has a protease-resistant structural domain consisting of residues 209–304 of E2F2 and 199–350 of DP1 (data not shown). These fragments include the CC and MB domains, shown to be required for E2F-DP heterodimerization (Helin et al., 1993bHelin K. Wu C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Heterodimerization of the transcription factors E2F-1 and DP-1 leads to cooperative trans-activation.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and notably lack the E2F transactivation domain (Figure 1A). We assessed whether this E2F2-DP1 heterodimer (hereafter E2F2CM-DP1CM) or the corresponding E2F1CM-DP1CM, E2F4CM-DP2 CM, and E2F5CM-DP1CM heterodimers bind RbC using a Ni2+-His6 affinity-precipitation assay. For this experiment, we used an Rb fragment (residues 771–928; hereafter RbC771–928) that contains RbC and the preceding 15 residue region from the end of the pocket domain. We incubated 10 μM purified His6RbC771–928 with 10 μM of each purified E2FCM-DPCM heterodimer, precipitated it using Ni2+-NTA resin, eluted it with imidazole, and analyzed His6RbC771–928 bound proteins with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Figure 1B shows that RbC771–928 bound all four E2FCM-DPCM heterodimers but did not bind the E2F1 transactivation domain used as a negative control. We next measured the affinity of the RbC-E2FCM-DPCM interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; see data in the Supplemental Data, Section 1, available with this article online). We found that RbC771–928 binds to the E2F1CM-DP1CM complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 110 ± 50 nM (standard deviation from four independent measurements) and to the E2F4CM-DP1CM complex with a Kd of 190 ± 130 nM (SD from two experiments; Figure 1C). These Kd values are comparable to the Rb pocket domain-E2F1 transactivation domain Kd, which has been reported to be 340 nM and 400 nM in two independent ITC studies (Lee et al., 1998Lee J.-O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P.

USA. 2003; 100: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our ITC data thus indicate that the RbC-E2FCM-DPCM interaction could be as important as the pocket-transactivation domain interaction for the formation of the Rb-E2F-DP complex. We suggest this observation provides an adequate explanation for the significant body of literature showing that RbC is required for high-affinity E2F-DP binding, for full repression of E2F-responsive promoters, and ultimately for growth suppression (Hiebert, 1993Hiebert S.W.

Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G.J. Identification of a growth suppression domain within the retinoblastoma gene product.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, the dissociation constants for the binding of RbC to the E2F1CM-DP1CM and the E2F4CM-DP1CM complexes are comparable within experimental error. Taken together with the Ni2+ precipitation data, these findings indicate that the ability to bind RbC is shared by the E2F1 and E2F4 subfamilies and both DP1 and DP2. We next investigated whether p107 has a similar E2FCM-DPCM binding activity. The C-terminal domain of p107 and its close homolog p130 share only limited sequence homology with RbC, but like RbC, the p107 C terminus is required for growth suppression and high-affinity E2F binding (Zhu et al., 1995Zhu L. Enders G. Lees J.A. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Harlow E. The pRb-related protein p107 contains two growth suppression domains: independent interactions with E2F and cyclin/cdk complexes.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using ITC, we tested the binding of a p107 fragment encompassing the entire sequence following the pocket domain (residues 949–1068; hereafter p107C) to E2F-DP complexes. Figure 1C shows that p107C binds to the E2F4CM-DP1CM complex tightly with a Kd of 0.8 ± 0.1 μM and to the E2F1CM-DP1CM complex weakly with a Kd of 5.0 ± 0.8 μM. Taken together, our data indicate that E2FCM-DPCM binding is an activity common to the C-terminal domains of both Rb and p107 and that this activity contributes to the preference of p107 for E2F4 (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Sibling rivalry in the E2F family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of an Rb protein containing the pocket and RbC domains suggested that RbC does not contain stable structural domains (data not shown), and NMR data indicate that the isolated RbC is unstructured in solution (Supplemental Data, Section 2). We thus made successive N- and C-terminal truncations guided by sequence conservation to map the RbC region(s) involved in E2FCM-DPCM binding. The affinities of these Rb fragments for E2F1CM-DP1CM were determined using ITC, and the results are listed in Figure 1D. Deletion of the C-terminal 54 residues (875–928), shown to contain docking sites for the Cdk2-CyclinA/E and Cdk4/6-CyclinD binding complexes (Adams et al., 1999Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R.

Deletion of the N-terminal 15 residues (771–785) that are part of the Rb pocket crystal structure (Lee et al., 1998Lee J.-O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor pocket domain bound to a peptide from HPV E7.Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) also had no effect on the affinity (RbC786–874 Kd = 0.13 ± 0.02 μM). Deletion of the next 15 N-terminal residues of RbC (786-800) decreased the affinity by a factor of ∼36 (RbC801–874 Kd = 4 ± 1 μM), indicating that residues 786–800 are involved in E2F1CM-DP1CM binding. Further N-terminal deletions until residue 829 had no additional effect on the affinity (RbC814–874 Kd = 4.8 ± 0.9 μM and RbC829–874 Kd = 4.9 ± 3 μM). In light of the crystal structure described below, we made one additional C-terminal deletion of residues 865–874 and found that they are uninvolved in binding (RbC814–864 Kd = 5.2 ± 0.8 μM). Taken together, these data indicated that RbC contains two discontinuous regions that interact with E2F1CM-DP1CM. A core region between residues 829–864 (hereafter RbCcore) binds with a Kd of ∼5 μM, while a secondary region within residues 786–800 (hereafter RbCnter) contributes a 36-fold increase in affinity. This bipartite mode of RbC-E2F1-DP1 binding is mirrored in the binding of RbC to E2F4-DP1/2. As shown in Figure 1D, deletion of RbCnter reduces the affinity of RbC for E2F4CM-DP2CM 25-fold (RbC814–874 Kd = 5.0 ± 0.8 μM compared to 0.19 μM for RbC771–874). Building on these findings, we obtained crystals of a ternary complex consisting of RbC829–874, which contains RbCcore but lacks RbCnter, bound to the E2F1CM-DP1CM heterodimer. The structure was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method using data from a selenomethionine-substituted complex and was refined at 2.55 Å resolution (Table 1). The refined model contains residues 829–872 of Rb, residues 201–301 of E2F1, and residues 199–346 of DP1.Table 1Statistics from the Crystallographic AnalysisData SetNativeSe λ1Se λ2Se λ3BeamlineID24 (APS)X4A (NSLS)X4A (NSLS)X4A (NSLS)Wavelength (Å)0.949800.979160.972410.97929Resolution (Å)2.552.72.72.7Observations71,304188,703191,178138,084Unique reflections19,35035,32635,58436,140Data coverage (%)97.899.399.598.5Rsym (%) (last shell: 2.55–2.64, 2.70–2.79)5.3 (42.5)6.1 (27.4)6.1 (32.6)5.6 (40.2)MAD AnalysisResolution20–3.020–3.020–3.0Phasing power1.091.62—Rcullis0.830.69—Anomalous Rcullis0.520.570.64Mean FOM0.68Refinement StatisticsResolution range (Å)15.0–2.55Reflections (|F|>0σ)17,600Total atoms2459Number of water molecules131R factor (%) (last shell: 2.55–2.62)22.1 (27.3)Rfree (%) (last shell: 2.55–2.62)26.2 (28.4)Rmsd Bonds (Å)0.009 Angles (°)1.157 B factor (Å2)Main chain bond1.47Side chain bond2.58Rsym = ΣhΣi |Ih,I − Ih|/ΣhΣi Ih,i for the intensity (I) of i observations of reflection h.

The E2F1CM-DP1CM heterodimer has an intertwined structure consisting of an intermolecular coiled coil, an intermolecular β sandwich, and several additional structural elements (Figure 2A). The coiled coil is formed by a 35 residue helix (eH1) from the E2F1 CC domain and a 48 residue helix (dH1) from the DP1 CC domain. The N-terminal half of the coiled coil has a canonical arrangement of helices (Lupas, 1996Lupas A. Coiled coils: new structures and new functions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), but the remainder has larger helix-helix distances associated with contacts to other parts of the complex. The intermolecular β sandwich structure is similar to the immunoglobulin fold (Bork et al., 1994Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold: structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of two four-stranded β sheets that pack across a mixed hydrophobic core involving both E2F1 and DP1 side chains (Figure 2A). Each sheet has a pair of strands from E2F1 and a pair of strands from DP1 (eS2, eS5, dS2, dS5 on one sheet and eS3, eS4, dS3, dS4 on the other; Figures 2A and 2B). In addition to the intermolecular coiled coil and β sandwich, E2F1CM-DP1CM contains five additional α helices (eH2, eH3, and dH2 to dH4) and a short two-stranded β sheet (eS1 and dS1; Figures 2A and 3A). These occur at nonanalogous positions in the E2F1 and DP1 primary sequences and in the tertiary structure (Figures 2A and 2B). Although both the coiled coil and β sandwich have 2-fold pseudosymmetry, the structure of the overall complex is asymmetric due to the location of the coiled coil at one end of the β sandwich and the nonanalogous E2F1 and DP1 helices. The RbC fragment adopts a 32 residue strand-loop-helix structure followed by a 20 residue tail segment that lacks regular secondary structure (Figures 2A and 2B). The strand-loop-helix motif (rS1 and rH1) binds to one side of the β sandwich and interacts with both E2F1 and DP1. The rS1 strand extends one of the E2F1-DP1 β sheets by forming a fifth β strand alongside of eS3, while the rH1 helix packs against the partially exposed hydrophobic core of the β sandwich. Following the rH1 helix, the RbC tail loops around one end of the β sandwich, making additional contacts with E2F1 and DP1. The E2F1-DP1 heterodimer interface buries ∼6300 Å2 of surface area compared to the hypothetical isolated monomers of the same structure. Intermolecular interactions are distributed throughout the E2F1 and DP1 polypeptides and involve the coiled coil, the β sandwich, and essentially all of the additional secondary-structure elements (Figures 2A and 2B).

In this study we have explored how 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity is initiated. We have also investigated downstream signaling pathways activated in response to 6-hydroxydopamine, using a neuronal-like, catecholaminergic cell line (PC12 cells) as an in vitro model system. We have shown that 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity is initiated via extracellular auto-oxidation and the induction of oxidative stress from the oxidative products generated. Neurotoxicity is completely attenuated by preincubation with catalase, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide, at least in part, evokes neuronal cell death in this model. 6-Hydroxydopamine does not initiate toxicity by dopamine transporter-mediated uptake into PC12 cells, because both GBR-12909 and nisoxetine (inhibitors of dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, respectively) failed to reduce toxicity. 6-Hydroxydopamine has previously been shown to induce both apoptotic and necrotic cell-death mechanisms. In this study oxidative stress initiated by 6-hydroxydopamine caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of caspases 3/7, nuclear fragmentation, and apoptosis. We have shown that, in this model, proteolytic activation of the proapoptotic protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) is a key mediator of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell death. 6-Hydroxydopamine induces caspase 3-dependent cleavage of full-length PKCδ (79 kDa) to yield a catalytic fragment (41 kDa). Inhibition of PKCδ (with rottlerin or via RNA interference-mediated gene suppression) ameliorates the neurotoxicity evoked by 6-hydroxydopamine, implicating this kinase in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity and Parkinsonian neurodegeneration. 6-Hydroxydopamine is a neurotoxin commonly used to lesion dopaminergic pathways and generate experimental models for Parkinson disease, however, the cellular mechanism of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurodegeneration is not well defined.

Although the neuropathological hallmarks of this disease are well described, the etiology is largely undefined. However, a number of biochemical processes and molecular mechanisms have been identified as mediators of neuronal cell death in PD. These include oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dopamine-rich areas of the brain are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, because metabolism of dopamine itself (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals (1Lotharius J. Brundin P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular pathways of neuronal death and to develop neuroprotective strategies, a number of in vitro and in vivo models have been characterized. Many of these utilize experimental neurotoxins, including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which are thought to induce toxicity that mimics the neuropathological and biochemical characteristics of PD. 6-OHDA has been shown to induce toxicity in a wide range of neuronal in vitro models, including human neuroblastoma cell lines (2Elkon H.

However, the exact mechanism of ROS production and induction of toxicity is less clearly defined. It is traditionally thought that 6-OHDA enters neurons via dopamine transporters (DAT) (9Ljungdahl A.

Experientia. 1971; 27: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and initiates the activation of cell death pathways by generation of intracellular free radicals and mitochondrial inhibition (10Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, a number of recent studies have shown that 6-OHDA may not induce toxicity in this manner but, rather, via an extracellular mechanism (11Blum D. Torch S. Nissou M.F. Benabid A.L. Verna J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Soto-Otero R. Mendez-Alvarez E. Hermida-Ameijeiras A. Munoz-Patino A.M. Labandeira-Garcia J.L. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This process has been explored in detail in this study, in which 6-OHDA is applied to the catecholaminergic rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12. Both necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms of cell death occur in response to 6-OHDA (6Ochu E.E. Rothwell N.J. Waters C.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2637-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Walkinshaw G. Waters C.M. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Woodgate A. MacGibbon G. Walton M. Dragunow M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In an attempt to dissect which apoptotic pathways are activated, several studies have pinpointed a role for the mitochondrial-caspase cascade in 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis, which initiates the activation of the main effector caspases 3 and 7 (5Chen G. Bower K.A. Ma C. Fang S. Thiele C.J. Luo J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Ochu E.E. Rothwell N.J. Waters C.M. J.

Res. 2004; 77: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the crucial downstream targets of caspase 3 activation have not been clearly defined. PKCδ is classified as a member of the novel PKC subfamily, because it is not activated in response to calcium but is activated by diacylglycerol (21Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The most commonly studied mechanism of PKCδ activation is membrane translocation in response to lipid signaling, however, numerous studies over recent years have also identified a caspase 3-dependent proteolytic activation (22Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The site of caspase 3 cleavage lies between the regulatory and catalytic domains, and proteolysis induces permanent dissociation of the two domains and constitutive activation of the catalytic domain (22Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 23Ghayur T. Hugunin M.

This mechanism of activation has been shown to occur in response to a range of apoptotic stimuli, both in neuronal and non-neuronal cell models (22Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H.

In addition, PKCδ has been shown to be activated in response to a number of dopaminergic neurotoxins, including 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (30Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Yang Y. Kaul S. Zhang D. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the dopaminergic rat N27 cell line and dieldrin in PC12 cells (31Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 945-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This may suggest that PKCδ plays a role in neuronal apoptosis in PD. The main purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which 6-OHDA initiates oxidative stress and subsequent neurotoxicity in the rat neuronal-like, catecholaminergic cell line, PC12. The downstream effectors of mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation were investigated, and the possible role of caspase 3-dependent PKCδ activation in 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis was explored. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), culture media supplements, poly-d-lysine, 6-OHDA, ascorbic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), rottlerin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, sodium orthovanadate, and mouse anti-α-tubulin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GBR-12909 and nisoxetine were obtained from Tocris Cookson, Inc. (Avonmouth, Bristol, UK). The CytoTox-ONE™ Homogeneous Membrane Integrity assay and Apo-ONE™ Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 assay were bought from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The Detergent Compatible Protein Assay was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd. (Hemel Hempstead, Herts, UK) and benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-FMK) and Ac-DEVD-CHO from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). The mammalian expression plasmids, pKD-PKCδ-v3 and pKD-NegCon-v1 were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY), and the Lipofectamine™ 2000 was from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal PKCδ antibody was bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal mouse anti-lamin B was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Hoechst 33258 was obtained from Molecular Probes. The enhanced chemiluminescence plus detection kit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and [3H]dopamine (39 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from standard commercial sources. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% donor horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 190 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, in 75-cm2 culture flasks. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 96-, 24-, or 6-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/cm2, 48 h before 6-OHDA treatment. 6-OHDA preparation and administration were carried out as previously described (4Ding Y.M. Jaumotte J.D. Signore A.P. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 776-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, vehicle solution containing 0.15% ascorbic acid and 10 mm DETAPAC was flushed with nitrogen gas for 30 min before addition of 6-OHDA. A solution of 6-OHDA at a concentration 10 times that of the desired final concentration (e.g. 1.5 mm 6-OHDA to give a final concentration of 150 μm) was applied to cells in the dark. Following 6-OHDA treatment for 15 min, cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 0–24 h. Unless otherwise stated, inhibitors or antioxidants were preincubated with the cells 30 min before 6-OHDA treatment and were present for the duration of the experiment. Neurotoxicity Assays—Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured using the CytoTox-ONE™ Homogeneous Membrane Integrity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 0–24 h post 6-OHDA treatment, culture medium was removed from the cells and equilibrated to 22 °C and an equal volume of Cyto-Tox-ONE™ reagent added for 10 min. Fluorescence (excitation, 560 nm; emission, 590 nm) was measured using a fluorescent plate reader. Data are expressed as a percentage of maximum LDH release (determined by incubation of cells with 9% Triton X-100) after subtraction of background fluorescence (determined by fluorescence from DMEM alone). Mitochondrial function was determined by MTT reduction assay. Cells were incubated with MTT (2.5 mg/ml in DMEM) for 90 min at 37 °C. Excess MTT was removed, and remaining formazan crystals were dissolved in isopropanol and quantified by determining optical density (570 nm) using a colorimetric 96-well plate reader. Spectrophotometric Assay of 6-OHDA Auto-oxidation—The autooxidation of 6-OHDA was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of p-quinone at 490 nm (12Soto-Otero R. Mendez-Alvarez E. Hermida-Ameijeiras A. Munoz-Patino A.M. Labandeira-Garcia J.L. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in a cell-free system under conditions corresponding to cellular 6-OHDA treatments. DMEM alone, or DMEM containing NAC (5 mm) or catalase (300 units/ml), was thermostatically maintained at 37 °C during the experiment. 6-OHDA was prepared in vehicle solution, and the experiment was initiated by addition of 6-OHDA to give a final concentration of 150 μm. Absorbance at 490 nm was monitored at 10-s intervals for 10 min. [3H]Dopamine Uptake—PC12 cells were grown in 24-well plates for 48 h. To assess the presence of DAT, cells were incubated with 20 nm [3H]dopamine for 15 min at 37 °C. Uptake was determined in buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 16 mm NaH2PO4 and 16 mm Na2HPO4, 1.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm ascorbic acid, and 50 μm pargyline (pH 7.3) (34Fonck C. Baudry M. Brain Res. 2001; 905: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of GBR-12909 (2 μm). Uptake was terminated by lysis of cells with 1% Triton X-100, and radioactivity was measured in a TRICARB liquid scintillation spectrometer. Hoechst Staining—The fluorescent DNA and chromatin stain Hoechst 33258 was used to assess DNA fragmentation as a marker for apoptosis. PC12 cells were grown in 24-well plates on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were treated with 6-OHDA or vehicle alone (as described above) or staurosporine (1 μm) for 2 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 120 mm NaCl, 19 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.4, for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed again. Coverslips were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (60 ng/ml) for 10 min, washed in PBS, and mounted with Vectashield on glass slides prior to viewing under ultraviolet light. Apoptotic cells were distinguished by the presence of bright, fragmented nuclei. The percentage of apoptotic cells in relation to the total number of cells was determined from 10 random fields per slide, from 3 independent experiments. Caspase 3/7 Fluorometric Assay—Activity of caspases 3/7 were assayed using the Apo-ONE™ Homogeneous Caspase 3/7 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, equal volumes of DMEM and Apo-ONE™ caspase reagent (1:100 profluorescent substrate and lysis buffer) were added to cells, and the mixture was incubated for 5 h. Fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 512 nm) was measured using a fluorescence plate reader. Background fluorescence was determined by fluorescence from DMEM alone and subtracted from all experimental values. RNA Interference-mediated Gene Suppression of PKCδ—To reduce the expression of PKCδ, a commercially available mammalian expression plasmid that directs the transcription of an siRNA transcript for the PKCδ sequence (584-605, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) was used. The expression plasmid (designated pKD-PKCδ-v3) contains a sequence that when expressed forms a short-hairpin RNA, which is processed into a PKCδ siRNA. The expression of the short-hairpin RNA is under the control of the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter. The short-hairpin RNA showed no homology to other gene sequences when using BLAST. The same expression plasmid containing a negative control sequence (designated pKD-NegCon-v1), which is processed into a negative control siRNA, was used in parallel. Cells were transfected with pKD-PKCδ-v3 or pKD-NegCon-v1 using Lipofectamine™ 2000. Characterization work carried out by Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions reported that transfection of pKD-PKCδ-v3 induced nearly 80% knockdown of PKCδ mRNA levels when compared with cells transfected with the pKD-NegCon-v1. To confirm PKCδ gene suppression in the PC12 cells used in this study, cells were transfected with pKD-PKCδ-v3 or pKD-NegCon-v1, and cell lysates were prepared 48, 72, and 96 h post-transfection as described below (whole cell lysis). Western blotting using rabbit anti-PKCδ was carried out as described below and equal loading confirmed using mouse anti-α-tubulin. Whole Cell Lysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting by removal of cells from 6-well culture dishes using cell scrapers. Pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with ice-cold whole cell lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 33 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was recovered. Cytosolic and Nuclear Fractionation—Cells were removed from 6-well culture dishes as described above, and pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). Cellular fractionation was carried out using a protocol adapted from a previous study (28Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were washed with ice-cold fractionation lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.9) and lysed by incubation with fractionation lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, for 10 min on ice. Cell suspensions were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The supernatant fraction corresponded to the cytosolic fraction, whereas the pellet corresponded to the nuclear fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 80 units/ml DNase I, pH 7.9), and incubated for 10–15 min at 4 °C. Following extraction, the suspension was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was recovered as the purified nuclear fraction. The cytosolic fraction was further lysed by addition of whole cell lysis buffer and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic suspension was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was recovered as the purified cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration of lysates was determined by DC protein assay. Samples were diluted in appropriate lysis buffer and an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer (60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates (containing 4 μg of protein) were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was run at 100 V. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight in 4% nonfat milk powder in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with 0.2 μg/ml rabbit anti-PKCδ, 1.5 μg/ml mouse anti-α-tubulin, or 1 μg/ml mouse anti-lamin B in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% nonfat milk powder (blotto). After washing the membranes for 3 × 5 min with blotto, they were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG; 1 μg/ml in blotto. Membranes were washed for 3 × 5 min in PBS, and immunoreactive protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. The intensity of bands was quantified by densitometry using Scion Image software. 6-OHDA Induces Concentration- and Time-dependent Cell Death and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in PC12 Cells—In PC12 cells, preliminary experiments (data not shown) using a chronic 6-OHDA treatment regime (24 h) resulted in variable levels of toxicity. Therefore an acute mode of treatment (6-OHDA for 15 min) was used, with precautions taken to prevent auto-oxidation of 6-OHDA before application onto the cells (see “Methods”) (4Ding Y.M. Jaumotte J.D. Signore A.P. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 776-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following acute treatment of PC12 cells with 6-OHDA, cells were incubated for up to 24 h, and toxicity was assessed as an index of mitochondrial function (MTT reduction) and membrane integrity (release of LDH) (Fig. 1). 6-OHDA concentration dependently evoked loss of both mitochondrial function and membrane integrity with LD50 values of 186 μm and 158 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). Consequently, 6-OHDA was applied at 150 μm in all further experiments. The time course of 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in PC12 cells (Fig. 1, B and D) indicated that changes in mitochondrial function preceded membrane damage. Mitochondrial function was immediately and dramatically reduced following 6-OHDA application to 51.3 ± 5.8% of control. However, this initial loss in mitochondrial function was reversed, with almost 30% recovery of function within 1 h. Sustained loss of mitochondrial function was not detected until 6 h post-treatment and remained constant between 6 and 24 h. In contrast, loss of membrane integrity reflecting ultimate cell death was not detected up to 10 h post 6-OHDA treatment. Between 10 and 18 h post treatment there was a gradual increase in cell death. 6-OHDA Induces Toxicity in PC12 Cells via Extracellular Auto-oxidation of 6-OHDA and Consequent Oxidative Stress—In vitro studies suggest that oxidative stress and disruption of mitochondrial function are the main mediators of 6-OHDA mediated cell death (10Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). To determine if 6-OHDA initiates oxidative stress in the PC12 cell model, experiments were conducted in the presence of the anti-oxidants NAC (Fig. 2, A and B) or catalase (Fig. 2, C and D). NAC (5 mm) and catalase (30 units/ml) provided complete protection against 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (Fig. 2, A and C) and membrane damage (Fig. 2, B and D), and protection was concentration-dependent. Both NAC and catalase were ineffective when added immediately after the 15-min exposure to 6-OHDA, even when catalase was used at 10-fold higher concentration (data not shown). To assess the direct action of these anti-oxidants on 6-OHDA auto-oxidation, a cell-free system measuring the production of the 6-OHDA auto-oxidation product (p-quinone) was used (Fig. 2E). 6-OHDA (150 μm) was completely auto-oxidized within 5 min, and this was prevented by the thiol antioxidant NAC, suggesting a mechanism for the neuroprotection by this anti-oxidant in PC12 cells. Catalase (300 units/ml) had no effect on 6-OHDA auto-oxidation, suggesting that its neuroprotective effect is downstream of this initial event. Because the anti-oxidant properties of catalase are attributed to its ability to hydrolyze hydrogen peroxide, the neuroprotective effect of catalase therefore suggests that 6-OHDA is auto-ox"

MLIV is typified by accumulation of lipids and membranous materials in intracellular organelles, which was hypothesized to be caused by the altered membrane fusion and fission events. How mutations in TRP-ML1 lead to aberrant lipolysis is not known. Here we present evidence that MLIV is a metabolic disorder that is not associated with aberrant membrane fusion/fission events. Thus, measurement of lysosomal pH revealed that the lysosomes in TRP-ML1-/- cells obtained from the patients with MLIV are over-acidified. TRP-ML1 can function as a H+ channel, and the increased lysosomal acidification in TRP-ML1-/- cells is likely caused by the loss of TRP-ML1-mediated H+ leak. Measurement of lipase activity using several substrates revealed a marked reduction in lipid hydrolysis in TRP-ML1-/- cells, which was rescued by the expression of TRP-ML1. Cell fractionation indicated specific loss of acidic lipase activity in TRP-ML1-/- cells. Furthermore, dissipation of the acidic lysosomal pH of TRP-ML1-/- cells by nigericin or chloroquine reversed the lysosomal storage disease phenotype. These findings provide a new mechanism to account for the pathogenesis of MLIV. Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is caused by mutations in the ion channel mucolipin 1 (TRP-ML1).

Earlier attempts to explain the accumulation of lipids in MLIV focused on hyperactive endocytosis (3Fares H. Greenwald I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 64-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, endocytosis was found to be normal in skin fibroblasts (SF) from patients with MLIV (4Bach G. Desnick R.J. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Bargal R.

In addition, preliminary experiments as part of the present work showed normal net uptake of the fluid phase marker 10 kDa Texas Red dextran by TRP-ML1-/- cells. MLIV results from mutations in the ion channel TRP-ML1. Several studies (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), have shown that TRP-ML1 resides in the lysosomes. TRP-ML1 is a non-selective cation channel with limited Ca2+ permeability (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11LaPlante J.M. Falardeau J. Sun M. Kanazirska M. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The same group reported impaired Ca2+ signaling in SF from an MLIV patient with the ΔF405 mutation in TRP-ML1 (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it is suggested that TRP-ML1 is a lysosomal Ca2+ (CaL) release channel that regulates endosomal-lysosomal fusion. The impaired fusion limits access of lipids to lysosomal lipases with the ensuing accumulation of unprocessed lipids (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Bach G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 451: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the fusion model is not compatible with the finding that TRP-ML1 is a strong outward rectifying channel (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Raychowdhury M.K. Gonzalez-Perrett S. Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A. Chasan B. Goldmann W.H. Stahl S. Cooney A. Goldin E. Cantiello H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The outward rectification indicates that the primary direction of cation flow by this channel is into the lysosome rather than out of the lysosome. As shown below, TRP-ML1 does not affect cellular Ca2+ signaling or Ca2+ content in the lysosomes. An alternative mechanism for the cellular phenotype of MLIV was suggested by the effects of deletion of CUP-5, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of TRP-ML1 that resulted in the accumulation of lysosomal markers in late endosomes (9Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because mature lysosomes are formed from late endosomes (14Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Luzio J.P. Poupon V. Lindsay M.R.

Symp. 2005; 72: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that TRP-ML1 regulates maturation of lysosomes from late endosomes (9Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 471-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At least two observations are inconsistent with either model. Both models predict a dramatic change in the number of lysosomes in MLIV-affected cells. The fusion model predicts fewer lysosomal-endosomal fusion events and thus increased number of lysosomes. The recycling model implies dramatic reduction in the number of lysosomes. In the present work, we did not detect any difference in LysoTracker or LAMP1 staining between control and TRP-ML1-/- SF (see below). No apparent changes in lysosomal numbers can be seen in other published images (6Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both models predict an accumulation of lipids in pre-lysosomal compartments. However, lipids accumulate in the lysosomes of MLIV (4Bach G. Desnick R.J. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Bargal R. Bach G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 9). Previously we have identified TRP-ML1 as a processed lysosomal, monovalent-permeable ion channel (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here we show that TRP-ML1 controls lysosomal pH (pHL) and consequently lipid hydrolysis and metabolism, which may account for the cellular phenotype of MLIV. TRP-ML1-/- Cells—SF from patients with MLIV (WG0909) and MLIII (WG0109) were from the Repository for Mutant Human Cell Strains and the Coriell Cell Repositories (GM02525, GM02527, GM02048). The genetic defects in WG0909, GM02525, and GM02527 patients have been described previously (18Bassi M.T. Manzoni M. Monti E. Pizzo M.T. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1110-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). SF (GM09404) from a patient with ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 (CLN2) and a patient with Tay-Sachs (TS) disease (GM11853) were from the Coriell Institute. SF from heterozygous relatives (WG0987 and WG0140) and WT fibroblasts were used as controls. SF were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and non-essential amino acids. The TRP-ML1 expression constructs have been described previously (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—Control and TRP-ML1-/- cells were washed twice with PBS and once with homogenization buffer (20 mm tricine, pH 7.6, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) and scraped and Dounce-homogenized 20 times followed by passing five times through a 23-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g, and 1 mg of each post-nuclear supernatant was layered over a discontinuous gradient consisting of a 1.2-ml cushion of 2.5 m sucrose and 8.5 ml of an 18% Percoll in homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 60 min at 67,000 × gmax in a Sorvall T1270 rotor. The sucrose cushion and ten 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and the Percoll was removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TL 100.3 rotor. The samples were adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100, passed five times through a 25-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Fractions were assayed for palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis and immunoblots for TRP-ML1. Assays of Lipase Activity—Total lipase activity was quantitated using the substrates palmitoyl-CoA and p-nitrophenyl-palmitate. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis was measured as the release of [3H]palmitate after an extraction with Dole's reagent. p-Nitrophenyl-palmitate hydrolysis was measured as the release of p-nitrophenyl, which was monitored by absorbance at 400 nm. The reaction mixture contained 100 μm substrate, 100 mm Hepes, and cell lysate in a final volume of 100 μl. The pH was adjusted between 4 and 9 by using sodium acetate and Hepes or Tris/Cl buffers as required. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized from [3H]palmitic acid as described previously (19Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Acid lipase activity was measured as hydrolysis of [3H]triolein and cholesterololeate hydrolysis using cholesteryl-[14C]oleate (20Burton B.K. Emery D. Mueller H.W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 101: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Berge R.K. Farstad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 96: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C and A2 activities were assayed in the particulate fractions using [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Thin-layer Chromatography—Cells were labeled for 24 h with [3H]palmitic acid, washed with PBS, and extracted into 6 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The organic phase was washed once with PBS, and the same amount of lipid (based on the same number of counts) was analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography using the following solvents. Phospholipids were separated by developing the plates with chloroform/methanol/ammonia (60:40:9, v/v/v), general and neutral glycolipids by developing with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v), and long chain fatty acids by hexane/ethyl acetate/acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v/v). Electrophysiology—All procedures were the same as described in Ref. 10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, except that the pH of the bath solution was between 4 and 8. Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown on coverslips were loaded with fluorescent indicators and placed in a perfusion chamber for experiments with live cells. Images were acquired with a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. The images were analyzed offline using the ImageJ software. The procedure described in Ref. 10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar was used for experiments with fixed cells. Analysis of Acridine Orange (AO) and Oregon Green Fluorescence— Cells on coverslips were loaded with AO by incubation with 1 μm AO for 10 min at 37 °C in standard bath solution (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and analyzed using confocal microscopy. Acquisition parameters (iris, gain, offset, and laser intensity) were the same in all the experiments and were adjusted to nullify background fluorescence. Fluorescence was read with ImageJ software using two protocols: (a) a region of interest was drawn around the cell, and the fluorescence intensity was averaged; (b) fluorescence of individual organelles was estimated by placing the cursor over the image of the organelle and reading the corresponding intensity values. Both protocols yielded similar results, but the first protocol had been primarily used because it was more efficient. Statistical analysis of the intensity was performed in 5-10 separate experiments with 5 images in each experiment and 3-5 cells in each image. Estimation of the numbers of fluorescent particles in AO-loaded control and TRP-ML1-/- cells was performed using the automated particle counting function of ImageJ. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—For standard fluorescent recording, cells grown on coverslips were loaded with the Fura2 in standard bath solution by incubation with 5 μm Fura2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were placed in the perfusion chamber, and Fura2 fluorescence was recorded and calibrated as described in Ref. 22Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H.

Electron Microscopy—Cells grown on plastic dishes were fixed by a 30-min incubation with a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, post-fixed with a solution containing 1% OsO4, washed with PBS, and stained en bloc for 30 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Following the dehydration by immersion in 30-100% ethanol, the samples were embedded in resin by immersion in 30-100% resin:propylene oxide mixtures. Fixed samples were mounted on grids and analyzed with a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope. TRP-ML1 Does Not Regulate Cellular Ca2+ Signaling—Based on the comparison of agonist-mediated Ca2+ signaling in control fibroblasts and fibroblasts obtained from a patient carrying the ΔF408 mutation, it was concluded that TRP-ML1 controlled Ca2+ content in the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes/endosomes, and it was essential for agonist-mediated Ca2+ signaling (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This required significant permeability of TRP-ML1 to Ca2+. The Ca2+ permeability of TRP-ML1 was evaluated by measuring the whole-cell current in HEK293 cells expressing TRP-ML1. Previously we have shown that overexpressing TRP-ML1 in HEK293 cells result in significant fraction of TRP-ML1 in the plasma membrane (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) permitting analysis of its channel properties. Fig. 1A shows that when added to the external medium, corresponding to the lumen of the lysosome, both Ca2+ and Mg2+ decreased the inward TRP-ML1 current. The inhibition by Ca2+ and Mg2+ was largely eliminated by 10 mm BAPTA (Fig. 1B) suggesting that either the inhibition was mediated by divalent ions in a plasma membrane microdomain or BAPTA was more efficient than EGTA in removing the inhibition by divalent ions. To further test the role of TRP-ML1 in Ca2+ signaling, we measured [Ca2+]i in control and in TRP-ML1-/- SF. Fig. 1C shows that bradykinin (Bk) similarly increased [Ca2+]i in control, TRP-ML1-/-, and control cells expressing the F465L mutant. In Fig. 1D, Ca2+ content in the stores was evaluated by its complete discharge with ionomycin. Ca2+ contents in the stores of control and TRP-ML1-/- SF were indistinguishable. Another suggestion is that TRP-ML1 is a CaL channel that regulates CaL content and release (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This predicts a significant difference in CaL between the WT and TRP-ML1-/- cells. CaL was evaluated by incubating cells with 100 μm glycyl-l-phenylalanine β-naphthylamide, which bursts the lysosomes and releases their contents to the cytosol (23Srinivas S.P. Ong A. Goon L. Bonanno J.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2341-2350PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haller T. Dietl P. Deetjen P. Volkl H. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 1E shows that there was no detectable difference in CaL between control and TRP-ML1-/- cells. Furthermore, overexpression of TRP-ML1 in SF or HeLa cells had no effect on CaL (Fig. 1F). The results in Fig. 1 indicate that TRP-ML1 does not affect cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and is at variance with previous conclusion derived from experiments with cells carrying the ΔF408 mutation (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is likely that the results obtained with cells carrying the ΔF408 mutation reflect clonal behavior rather than an effect of TRP-ML1 on Gq-mediated Ca2+ signaling. TRP-ML1 Affects Lysosomal pHL—pHL controls most lysosomal hydrolytic activities (25Pillay C.S. Elliott E. Dennison C. Biochem.

Genet. 2004; 13: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that TRP-ML1 may regulate pHL. pHL is established by the V-type H+ pump and a Cl- channel and can be as low as 5. The steep cytosolic-to-pHL gradient can be visualized using AO, a fluorescent weak base that accumulates in acidic spaces (27Lake J.R. Van Dyke R.W. Scharschmidt B.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 1251-1261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the larger the lysosomal to cytosolic pH gradient, the more AO will accumulate in the lysosomes resulting in a brighter AO fluorescence in over-acidified lysosomes. An increase in lysosome numbers is expected to also increase the numbers of fluorescent particles. In preliminary experiments, we found no intrinsic autofluorescence in control or fibroblasts of patients at the microscope setting used to detect AO fluorescence. The role of TRP-ML1 in regulating pHL was evaluated by measuring AO accumulation in WT and TRP-ML1-/- fibroblasts. Fig. 2A shows that TRP-ML1-/- accumulated about 40% more AO than control SF. AO accumulation is because low pHL was ascertained by its complete dissipation by 5 μm nigericin, the H+/K+ exchange ionophore (not shown). In addition, Fig. 2B shows that AO accumulation in TRP-ML1-/- cells was inhibited by the selective H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin. Fig. 2C shows that the increased lysosomal acidity in TRP-ML1-/- SF was reversed by the expression of TRP-ML1. Estimation of the numbers of AO-positive organelles using an automated particle counting function showed no statistically significant differences in lysosomal numbers in control and TRP-ML1-/- cells. These findings indicate that the lysosomes of TRP-ML1--/- cells are more acidic than those of WT cells and that TRP-ML1 regulates pHL. The results in Fig. 2 (A and C) are different from those reported previously (28Bach G. Chen C.S. Pagano R.E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 280: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a second, independent and more specific, assay to measure pHL. The cells were loaded with Oregon Green 10-kDa dextran (OGD) for 16 h, followed by a 24-h chase. In preliminary experiments we found that with this loading procedure, OGD was mostly in lysosomes and co-localized with LAMP1 (not shown). To ascribe the change in pHL to TRP-ML1, TRP-ML1-/- cells were transfected with WT TRP-ML1 or with the F465L mutant, and pHL was measured with OGD. Fig. 2D shows that transfection of TRP-ML1-/- cells with TRP-ML1, but not with the F465L mutant, increased OGD fluorescence (indicative of reduced acidity). Thus, in TRP-ML1-expressing cells, OGD fluorescence was 136 ± 9.11% of that in non-transfected cells in the same recording field, whereas in F465L-expressing cells the OGD fluorescence was 97 ± 5.81% of control cells. A higher OGD fluorescence in TRP-ML1-transfected lysosomes was dissipated by nigericin (not shown). In additional controls, no increase in OGD fluorescence was detected in TRP-ML1-expressing cells after 7 or 12 h of loading with OGD (99 ± 8% and 97 ± 8% of non-transfected cells, respectively). The latter findings also suggest that TRP-ML1 does not regulate the pH of late endosomes. TRP-ML1 Is Permeable to H+—As an ion channel, TRP-ML1 can reduce lysosomal acidification if it conducts H+. The H+ conductance of TRP-ML1 was measured by substituting all metal ions in the bath solution with NMDG to eliminate monovalent cation current and measuring the inward current at pHo between 8 and 4. Increasing external H+ concentration by reducing the pH from 8 to 5 modestly increased the inward current (Fig. 3A) and resulted in a marked shift in the reversal potential (Er) from -70 to -10 mV in TRP-ML1 but not in control cells (inset in Fig. 3A and legend for Fig. 3B). Reducing external pH to 4 further shifted the Er, but the shift deviated from linearity probably because of partial inhibition of the current at this pH. Additional control is shown in Fig. 3C, where reducing pH to 5 and 4 inhibited the current by TRPC3 without shifting the Er. The marked shift in the Er indicates that TRP-ML1 is permeable to H+. A linear fit of the change in the Er between pH 8 and 5 yielded an average shift of 15 mV/pH unit. Similar Nernstian slope values were reported for the highly selective voltage-activated H+ channels (29Decoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 30Morgan D. DeCoursey T.E. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 1266-1279Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sub-Nernstian value of the slope can be explained by limited permeability of TRP-ML1 to other ions and/or by depletion of H+ from near-plasma membrane domains (31DeCoursey T.E. Biophys.

The outward component of TRP-ML1 current in Fig. 3A shows that TRP-ML1 is permeable to Cs+. At pH 4, the constant field equation yields a pH+:pCs+ ratio of ∼106. At pH 7, where H+ depletion is expected to be most noticeable, the equation yields pH+:pCs of ∼104. Similar range of permeability ratios was reported for the voltage-activated H+ channels (reviewed in Ref. 33DeCoursey T.E. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 477-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small amplitude of the H+ current is because of the outwardly rectifying nature of TRP-ML1 and the low absolute concentration of H+ at pH 5. The TRP-ML1 permeability for H+ and its inward rectification suggest a possible role of TRP-ML1 as a pHL“safety valve,” i.e. TRP-ML1 can slowly dissipate high H+ concentration without compromising lysosomal H+ homeostasis. This proposed role of TRP-ML1 is depicted in the model in Fig. 3D. Role of TRP-ML1 in Lipid Trafficking—MLIV is characterized by abnormal accumulation of membranous lipid material in the cells of patients (4Bach G. Desnick R.J. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Bach G. Zeigler M. Schaap T. Kohn G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To study the role of TRP-ML1 in lipid trafficking, we followed the time course of BODIPY-C5-lactosylceramide (LacCer) uptake during a 15- or 30-min load and 5-60-min chase in WT and TRP-ML1-/- SF. To visualize the lysosomes, the cells were also labeled with 1 μm LysoTracker Red. Endocytosis of the lipid measured after 15-min load appeared normal in all cell types. Fig. 4A shows that LacCer begins to accumulate in the Golgi of control cells after 30-min chase, whereas the majority of the lipids was in the lysosomes of TRP-ML1-/- cells even after a 60-min chase. Analysis of the overlap between LacCer and LysoTracker shows that after a 60-min chase about 50% of LacCer was in the lysosomes of TRP-ML1-/- cells (Fig. 4C). Stimulation of the cells with Bk did not accelerate LacCer traffic (Fig.4 B and C) further questioning a deficient CaL release as the primary cause of MLIV. Further evidence for lipid accumulation in the lysosomes of TRP-ML1-/- cells was obtained by staining the cells with the antibiotic filipin, which stains unesterified cholesterol. Fig. 4D shows intense and widespread filipin staining of TRP-ML1-/- cells, indicating accumulation of cholesterol in the lysosomes of these cells. TRP-ML1 Regulates Lipid Hydrolysis and Metabolism—To address directly the role of TRP-ML1 in lipid hydrolysis, total soluble lipases were extracted, and lipid hydrolysis was analyzed in two WT and four independent TRP-ML1-/- SF lines obtained from unrelated patients with MLIV. SF from patients with late infantile neuronal CLN2 and TS diseases were used as additional controls. Fig. 5A shows normal expression of TRP-ML1 in WT, CLN, and TS cells and absence of the channel in all TRP-ML1-/- clones. Vigorous disruption of the cells released better than 90% of the lipid hydrolytic activity to the soluble fraction. The remaining 10% is associated with the particulate fraction and was unaltered in all cells (not shown). Because TRP-ML1 is found only in the particulate fraction, this indicates that TRP-ML1 has no or negligible lipase activity. Remarkably, the soluble palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis of all four TRP-ML1-/- lines was only 40% of that measured in WT cells. This was not because of impaired lysosomal storage since hydrolysis was normal or only modestly reduced in CLN and TS extracts. This indicates chronic inactivation of lipid hydrolysis in MLIV cells. In Fig. 5B, the role of TRP-ML1 in lipid hydrolysis was further verified by expressing the channel in TRP-ML1-/- cells, which increased the palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis by 31 ± 1%. Normalization for transfection efficiency of 23 ± 5% indicates that TRP-ML1 completely restores palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis to TRP-ML1-/- cells. To further analyze lipid hydrolysis, we used four additional substrates: p-nitrophenyl-palmitate for total lipase activity, triolein to assay acidic lipases, cholesteryl-oleate to assay cholesterol esterase, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine to assay the particulate phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 activities. Similar reduction in hydrolytic activity was observed with all the substrates for the soluble lipases of TRP-ML1-/- cells (Fig. 5C). Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine activity was found only in the particulate fraction and was the same in WT and TRP-ML1-/- cells (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest a global reduction in the lysosomal lipase activity in TRP-ML1-/- cells. Hence, the acidic pHL in TRP-ML1-/- cells resulted in the inactivation of lipase activity and not merely shifting pHL away from the optimum for lysosomal lipases. Because cleavage of TRP-ML1 inhibited channel function (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we tested how the inhibition of cleavage affects the lipase activity. Significantly, Fig. 6A shows that progressive inhibition of cleavage by incubating WT fibroblasts for 24, 48, and 72 h with E64d results in an increased full-length TRP-ML1 and a corresponding inhibition of lipase activity. As a control, Fig. 6B shows that treatment of TRP-ML1-/- fibroblasts with E64d for 48 h has no effect on lipase activity. Expression of TRP-ML1 in TRP-ML1-/- cells restored palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis, and inhibition of the cleavage of the expressed TRP-ML1 inhibited restoration of lipase activity (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the lysosomal lipases were predominantly affected in MLIV, microsomes were prepared from WT and TRP-ML1-/- cells and were fractionated on an 18% Percoll gradient. Organelles expressing TRP-ML1 (lysosomes) were recovered mostly in the heaviest fraction 1 (Fig. 7A), whereas palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis was found in fractions 1 and 2 of WT cells but only in fraction 2 of TRP-ML1-/- cells (Fig. 7B). The pH profile of the lipase activity revealed that fraction 1 contained most of the lipases active at acidic pH (Fig. 7C), whereas fraction 2 contained lipases with pH optimum between 6 and 7 (Fig. 7D). Notably, only the acidic lipases in the lysosomal fraction were inactive in TRP-ML1-/- cells. Next we asked whether the reduced lipase activity is accompanied by aberrant lipid processing. The lipids of WT and TRP-ML1-/- cells were labeled by an overnight incubation with [3H]palmitate to a pre-steady state level so that the difference in lipid synthesis could be resolved better. Chromatography with solvents that separated phospholipids, general and neutral glycolipids, and long chain fatty acids revealed multiple differences in lipids synthesized during the labeling period (Fig. 8). Dissipation of Acidic pHL in TRP-ML1-/- Cells Reverses the MLIV Phenotype—An important implication of the observation that chronic acidic pHL is a primary cause of MLIV may be the possibility of treating the disease with compounds that decrease the lysosomal acidity. The feasibility of such an approach is demonstrated in Fig. 9. Because long incubation with bafilomycin proved to be toxic to the cells (Fig. 9A), SF from normal and MLIV patients were incubated with the H+/K+ ionophore nigericin (0.2 μm) for 4 days, and their morphology was analyzed by electron microscopy. Untreated SF from patients with MLIV contained large numbers of dark inclusions filled with enfolded membranes. The number of the inclusions dramatically decreased in cells treated with nigericin. The specificity of the effect of dissipating pHL to the MLIV phenotype was tested by measuring the effect of nigericin on SF obtained from a patient with MLIII (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy). Although the morphological phenotype of MLIV and MLIII are very similar, nigericin did not reverse the MLIII phenotype. Chloroquine is a weak base that accumulates in acid spaces and dissipates pHL. High concentrations of chloroquine are toxic resulting in cell death. Indeed, cells from patients with MLIV are highly sensitive to chloroquine (37Goldin E. Cooney A. Kaneski C.R. Brady R.O. Schiffmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8562-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), consistent with more acidic pHL in these cells. However, with the aim of testing the potential use of chloroquine for treatment of MLIV, we tested whether chloroquine can also reverse the MLIV phenotype. Testing several concentrations revealed that it was safe and sufficient to treat the cells with as little as 10 nm chloroquine for 4 days, and such a treatment partially reversed the MLIV phenotype (Fig. 9B). To provide a statistical estimate of the number of MLIV-specific membrane inclusions before and after the chloroquine treatment, images representing approximately half of a cell were threshholded using ImageJ software to render clearly distinguishable binary pictures of the inclusions (Fig. 9C). This was followed by counting the particles using the particle counting function of ImageJ. To avoid a background bias, the minimal size of the particle was set at 100 pixels (∼0.1 μm) in diameter. The column in Fig. 9C shows that treatment with chloroquine reduced the inclusions by about 65%. Although the cells were treated with only 10 nm chloroquine, Fig. 9D shows that this treatment was sufficient to reduce AO accumulation, indicating partial dissipation of the acidic pHL by chloroquine. The findings in Fig. 9 reinforce the conclusion that MLIV is caused by chronically acidic pHL and offer a potential strategy for the development of modalities to treat MLIV based on inhibitors of lysosomal acidifiers. Chloroquine and derivatives and the novel V-type H+pump inhibitors described recently might be considered for such a treatment (38Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19775-19780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Conclusions—The present findings together with characterization of TRP-ML1 (10Kiselyov K. Chen J. Rbaibi Y. Oberdick D. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Shcheynikov N. Muallem S. Soyombo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43218-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) provide a novel mechanism to explain the MLIV pathogenesis and suggest a new approach for developing treatment for the disease. The phenotype of MLIV led to the prevailing mechanism for the role of TRP-ML1 in MLIV, in which TRP-ML1 controls membrane utilization by regulating membrane fusion/fission events (7LaPlante J.M. Ye C.P. Quinn S.J. Goldin E. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Treusch S. Knuth S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 471-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our findings do not support such mechanisms but show marked inactivation of lipases in TRP-ML1-/- cells, indicating that MLIV is a metabolic rather than a trafficking disease. At least two mechanisms can account for the inactivation of lipases by over-acidification of the lysosomes. Chronic over-acidification may denature and inactivate the lysosomal lipases. Alternatively, because assembly of lysosomal proteins into functional complexes has been shown to depend on lysosomal acidity (39Ostrowska H. Krukowska K. Kalinowska J. Orlowska M. Lengiewicz I. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2003; 8: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pshezhetsky A.V. Ashmarina M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), over-acidification may disrupt formation of the complexes. The present work suggests a novel role for TRP-ML1 in regulating lysosomal function. When intact in the lysosomes, TRP-ML1 provides a H+leak pathway to prevent over-acidification of the lumen. When further acidification is needed to activate lipases, proteases or other lysosomal functions, TRP-ML1 is cleaved by a CatB-dependent pathway that may be activated by very acidic pHL. Continued insertion and cleavage of TRP-ML1 results in cycles of decrease and increase in pHL that is needed for the normal functioning of lysosomal lipases. MLIV-associated mutations in TRP-ML1 disrupt regulation of pHL and lead to aberrant activity of lysosomal lipases and the MLIV phenotype. We thank Dr. Ora Weisz for discussion."

Although some signaling events involved in bacterial entry have been documented, the bacterial and host proteins mediating entry were not known. We report the identification of the Ku70 subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a receptor involved in R. conorii internalization. Ku70 is recruited to R. conorii entry sites, and inhibition of Ku70 expression impairs R. conorii internalization. Bacterial invasion is dependent on the presence of cholesterol-enriched microdomains containing Ku70. R. conorii infection stimulates the ubiquitination of Ku70. In addition, the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl is recruited to R. conorii entry foci, and downregulation of endogenous c-Cbl blocks bacterial invasion and Ku70 ubiquitination. An affinity chromatography approach identified the rickettsial protein rOmpB as a ligand for Ku70. This is the first report of a receptor-ligand interaction involved in the internalization of any rickettsial species."

Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). These junctional structures are typically aligned from the apical to basal sides. TJs are likely to serve as barriers that prevent solutes and water from passing through the paracellular pathway and as fences between the apical and basolateral plasma membranes in epithelial cells. AJs are composed of closely apposed plasma membrane domains reinforced by a dense cytoplasmic plaque with actin filament (F-actin) bundles underneath. The formation and disruption of these junctional complexes are dynamically regulated by many extracellular and intracellular signals, and AJs play key roles in the formation and maintenance of TJs (2Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic organization of these junctional complexes are not fully understood. At TJs, claudin is a key Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion molecule (CAM), which comprises a family consisting of more than 27 members (3Tsukita S. Furuse M.

Claudin and occludin are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through peripheral membrane proteins, such as ZO-1, -2, and -3. Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), which belongs to the Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin (Ig)-like CAM family, also localizes at TJs and interacts with ZO proteins (5Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

E-Cadherin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through peripheral membrane proteins, including α-catenin, β-catenin, vinculin, and α-actinin, and this association strengthens the cell-cell adhesion of AJs. p120ctn also binds to the juxtamembrane region of E-cadherin and stabilizes it on the cell surface plasma membrane by inhibiting the endocytosis of E-cadherin (15Davis M.A. Ireton R.C.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Nectin constitutes a family consisting of four members, designated nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. All nectins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through the F-actin-binding protein afadin. Each nectin first forms homo-cis dimers and then homo- or hetero-trans dimers through the extracellular regions in a Ca2+-independent manner, resulting in cell-cell adhesion. Nectin then assembles cadherin at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites to form AJs. In addition, each nectin induces the activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins. Nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion, recruits c-Src to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, and activates it. Activated c-Src then tyrosine-phosphorylates FRG, a Cdc42-GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF). In addition, c-Src induces the activation of C3G (a Rap1-GEF)-catalyzed Rap1 small G protein through Crk, and Rap1 then induces local activation of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, eventually causing the activation of Cdc42. Moreover, c-Src tyrosine phosphorylates Vav2, a Rac-GEF. Cdc42 then activates tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2 locally at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, eventually causing the activation of Rac. Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia and increases the number of cell-cell contact sites. Rac induces the formation of lamellipodia, which efficiently zip the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia, acting like a “zipper.” In these ways, the small G proteins enhance the formation of AJs. In addition, during or after the formation of AJs, nectin recruits first JAM and then claudin and occludin to the apical side of AJs in cooperation with cadherin, resulting in the formation of TJs (21Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). JAM binds a cell-polarity protein complex, consisting of Par-3, atypical PKC, and Par-6, by directly binding Par-3 and recruits this complex to TJs (21Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 22Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Roh M.H. Margolis B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This complex is essential for the formation of TJs. However, it remains unknown how nectin recruits the TJ components to the apical side of AJs, although it should be noted that nectin-1 and -3, but not nectin-2, directly bind Par-3 (24Takekuni K.

Cdc42 activated by the action of trans-interacting nectin is likely to bind to Par-6 and activate the polarity protein complex (20Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W.

Afadin is an F-actin-binding protein that connects each nectin to the actin cytoskeleton (25Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T.

It consists of multiple domains, namely two Ras-binding domains, a forkhead-associated domain, a dilute domain (DIL), a PDZ domain, three proline-rich domains, and an F-actin-binding domain found in that order from the NH2 terminus (21Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain binds to the COOH-terminal four amino acids of each nectin, and the F-actin-binding domain binds to F-actin (25Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M.

The DIL domain binds afadin DIL domain-interacting protein (ADIP), which interacts with α-actinin (31Asada M. Irie K. Morimoto K. Yamada A. Ikeda W. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4103-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). α-Actinin binds to both F-actin and α-catenin (32Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J.

Thus, afadin binds many proteins through its multiple domains, although the physiological roles of these interactions remain to be established. Furthermore, afadin has been shown to bind to α-catenin, but this binding is weak, and the region of afadin responsible for the binding remains unknown (36Pokutta S. Drees F. Takai Y. Nelson W.J.

Several lines of evidence for the roles of afadin in the formation of AJs and TJs have been reported as follows. 1) Nectin assembles the E-cadherin-catenin complex at nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites in a manner that depends on its COOH-terminal PDZ binding-motif for afadin (37Tachibana K.

Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1117-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); 4) afadin interacts with p120ctn in a Rap1-dependent manner, and this interaction inhibits the endocytosis of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin, thereby causing its accumulation at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites for the formation of AJs (41Hoshino T. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Yamada T. Kimura T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, definitive evidence for these roles of afadin has not yet been obtained. Furthermore, the modes of action of afadin in these roles have not yet been elucidated either. In this study we knocked down afadin in cultured MDCK cells using an RNA interference (RNAi) method to investigate the roles and modes of action of afadin in the formation of AJs and TJs. Cell Culture and Transfection—MDCK cells were supplied by Dr. W. Birchmeier (Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany).

A mammalian expression vector pCMV-HA was designed to express NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins (46Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector expressing an NH2-terminal truncated form of p120ctn (amino acids 347-912) was constructed using pCMV-HA (HA-p120ctn ΔN). An expression vector for pEGFP-afadin (GFP-afadin) was constructed as described (41Hoshino T. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Yamada T. Kimura T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To obtain RNAi-resistant afadin, pEGFP-afadin was generated by mutagenesis of 5′-GACAATCCTGCTGTCTACC-3′ to create 5′-AACAATACTACTGTCAACT-3′ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Knockdown Experiment—For knockdown using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) method, a double-stranded 19-nucleotide RNA duplex to afadin (5′-GACAATCCTGCTGTCTACC-3′) and a similar duplex to luciferase (5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) with no significant homology to any known mammalian gene sequences as a control were purchased from Greiner Bio-One. The duplexes were transfected using an Amaxa Nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For knockdown of afadin, Rac, and IQGAP1 by a short hairpin RNA method, pBS-H1 containing the H1 promoter was used for expression of the short hairpin RNA. To generate vectors for knockdown of afadin (pBS-H1-afadin), Rac (pBS-H1-Rac), and IQGAP1 (pBS-H1-IQGAP1), a specific insert for afadin, Rac, or IQGAP1 was subcloned into pBS-H1 as described (47Yamada A. Irie K. Hirota T. Ooshio T. Fukuhara A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6016-6027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inserts for afadin, Rac, and IQGAP1 were 5′-GACAATCCTGCTGTCTACC-3′, 5′-GAGGAAGAGAAAATGCCTG-3′, and 5′-CGTGATTCAGTGGTTGAAT-3′, respectively. The cells were co-transfected with pBS-H1 and pEGFP or pDsRed (Clontech) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The GFP- or DsRed-positive cells were monitored as a marker of the co-transfection. Ca2+ Switch Assay—Ca2+ switch assay using nectin-1-MDCK, wild-type MDCK, or GFP-E-cadherin-MDCK cells was carried out as described (48Kartenbeck J. Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (1 × 105) were plated on 18-mm glass coverslips in 12-well culture dishes. At 72 h after the plating, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in DMEM without serum for 1 h. Next, the cells were pre-cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ in DMEM with 5 mm EGTA for 3 h and then re-cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ for 4 h. When the cells were treated with a mixture of gD and Nef-3, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in DMEM without serum for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were pre-cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ in DMEM with 5 mm EGTA for 3 h and then re-cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in the presence or absence of 60 μg/ml gD and 60 μg/ml Nef-3 for 4 h. When the cells were treated with latrunculin A (WAKO), PP2, or PP3 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), the cells were washed with PBS and cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in DMEM without serum for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were pre-cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ in DMEM with 5 mm EGTA for 3 h and then re-cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in the presence or absence of 0.2 μm latrunculin A, 10 μm PP2, or 10 μm PP3 for 4 h. Cell Surface Biotinylation—After the Ca2+ switch assay, the cells were grown on filters and then incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyldithioproprionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce), which was applied to both the apical and basal sides of the filter. Next, the filters were washed with PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl to quench free sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin followed by several further washes in PBS. The cells were then scraped off the filters and suspended in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with streptavidin beads (Sigma) to collect bound biotinylated proteins. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-E-cadherin mAb. Immunoprecipitation Assay—After the Ca2+ switch assay, the cells were extracted with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell extracts obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min were incubated with the anti-E-cadherin mAb (5 μg) at 4 °C for 18 h. Next, the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing of the beads with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-E-cadherin mAb, anti-p120ctn mAb, or anti-β-catenin mAb. Bead-Cell Contact Assay—Nectin-1-MDCK cells (5 × 104) were plated on 14-mm glass coverslips in 24-well culture dishes. 16 h after plating, the cells were co-transfected with pBS-H1-afadin and pEGFP or pDsRed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 72 h after the transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in DMEM without serum for 1 h. Next, the cells were pre-cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ in DMEM with 5 mm EGTA containing latex-sulfate microbeads coated with Nef-3 or ConA for 3 h and then re-cultured at 2 mm Ca2+ in DMEM for 1 h. The cells were fixed and immunostained as described (49Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell Dissociation Assay—Cell dissociation assay was carried out as described (50Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 105) were transfected using an Amaxa Nucleofector kit. After the Ca2+ switch assay, the cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; pH 7.4) treated with 0.1% trypsin supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ in HBS (TC treatment) or 0.1% trypsin supplemented with 1 mm EDTA in HBS (TE treatment) at 37 °C for 1 h, and dissociated through pipetting 10 times. The extent of the cell dissociation was represented by the index NTC/NTE, where NTC and NTE were the total particle numbers after the TC and TE treatments, respectively. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol at -20 °C for 1 min or in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde for 15 min followed by PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After being blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm Ca2+ for 1 h, the cells were incubated in the same buffer containing various combinations of Abs for 1 h. The samples were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1 mm Ca2+ for 5 min and incubated for 30 min in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm Ca2+ with the secondary pAbs. The samples were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm Ca2+ for 5 min and mounted in GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda). The samples were analyzed using a Radiance 2100 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) and an LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The intensities of the immunofluorescence signals for the components of AJs and TJs at cell-cell adhesion sites or bead-cell contact sites were measured using the NIH Image software. The recruitment index was defined as positive when the intensity was above 150/256 of the gradation of the total pixels on the cell-cell adhesion sites or bead-cell contact site"

However, it is not clear whether nicotine affects cell motility to facilitate tumor metastasis. Here we discovered that nicotine potently induces phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains via activation of protein kinase Cι (PKCι), which is associated with accelerated migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. Purified PKCι directly phosphorylates μ- and m-calpains in vitro. Overexpression of PKCι results in increased phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains in vivo. Nicotine also induces activation of c-Src, which is a known PKCι upstream kinase. Treatment of cells with the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor α-bungarotoxin can block nicotine-induced calpain phosphorylation with suppression of calpain activity, wound healing, cell migration, and invasion, indicating that nicotine-induced calpain phosphorylation occurs, at least in part, through a signaling pathway involving the upstream α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Intriguingly, depletion of PKCι by RNA interference suppresses nicotine-induced calpain phosphorylation, calpain activity, cell migration, and invasion, indicating that PKCι is a necessary component in nicotine-mediated cell motility signaling. Importantly, nicotine potently induces secretion of μ- and m-calpains from lung cancer cells into culture medium, which may have potential to cleave substrates in the extracellular matrix. These findings reveal a novel role for PKCι as a nicotine-activated, physiological calpain kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates calpains, leading to enhanced migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells.

Cigarette smoking, either active or passive, is the most important risk factor in the development of lung cancer. About 90% of male and 75–80% of female lung cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking (1.Hecht S.S. J. Natl.

Lung cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), are highly metastatic tumors with poor prognosis (5.Albert R.K. Clinical Respiratory Medicine. 2nd Ed. Mosby, Philadelphia2004: 519-521Google Scholar). Cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to promote tumor metastasis, but the mechanism(s) remains enigmatic (6.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U.

The movement of cancer cells into tissue surrounding the tumor and the vasculature is the first step in the spread of metastatic cancers (8.Sahai E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Metastatic tumor cells have been observed to display more active motility, including migration and invasion, which appear to be a result of complex interplay between the numerous protein families participating in this process (9.Heino J. Kahari V.M. Cell Invasion. Medical Intelligence Unit 33. Landes Bioscience, Eurekah, Austin, TX2002: 1-117Google Scholar). Cell migration has been considered a required process during tumor cell invasion and metastasis (8.Sahai E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 10.Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Tumor invasion involves cellular migration and interaction with the microenvironment at an ectopic site (11.Mamoune A. Luo J.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar). Because enhanced PKC activity is frequently found in cancer cells that show highly invasive and/or metastatic potential (12.Dumont J.A. Bitonti A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cigarette smoke constituents (i.e. nicotine) may stimulate lung tumor metastasis by regulating PKC activity. PKC is a multigene family consisting of at least 11 distinct lipid-regulated protein-serine/threonine kinases that play pivotal roles in cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, malignant transformation, and metastasis (13.Gomez D.E. Skilton G. Alonso D.F. Kazanietz M. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 1363-1370PubMed Google Scholar). This family can be divided into three subtypes: the classic isoforms (PKCα, βI, βII, and γ), which are Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG) dependent; the novel isoforms (PKC-δ, ϵ, η, θ, and μ), which are DAG dependent but Ca2+ independent; and the atypical isoforms (PKC-ζ and λ/ι), which possess only one zinc finger and lack the characteristic C2 domain and hence are insensitive to both Ca2+ and DAG (14.Newton A.C.

PKC isoenzymes exhibit distinct tissue distribution and play a distinct role in various cellular events, including cell survival, proliferation, tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis (6.Gopalakrishna R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCι may play a critical role in regulating lung cancer development, including metastasis. The mammalian calpains comprise 14 family members, of which μ-calpain (calpain 1) and m-calpain (calpain 2) are the best characterized calpain isoforms that are extensively expressed in both SCLC and NSCLC cells and are involved in the limited proteolysis of various focal adhesion structures and signaling enzymes to promote cell migration and invasion (18.Xu L.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both μ- and m-calpains function as heterodimeric enzymes composed of a unique, large catalytic subunit associated with a common, small regulatory subunit (calpain 4). Intriguingly, m-calpain can localize to integrin-associated adhesive structures, suggesting a potential mechanism by which m-calpain regulates cell migration (20.Beckerle M. Burridge K. DeMartino G. Croall D. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing pharmacological inhibitors and calpain knock-out cells indicate that calpain plays an important role in mediating the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions required for cell motility (21.Huttenlocher A.

In addition to Ca2+ binding, our recent findings and those of others reveal that phosphorylation of calpain is another essential mechanism for its activation (18.Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol.

Here we discovered that nicotine, a major component in cigarette smoke, can induce phosphorylation and activation of both μ- and m-calpains through a novel signaling pathway involving α7nAChR/c-Src/PKCι that contributes to accelerated wound healing, migration, and invasion of human lung cancer cells. Materials—Anti-μ-calpain, m-calpain, PKCι, c-Src, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nicotine and enolase were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic calpain substrate t-butoxy carbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylaminocoumarin (t-Boc-LM-CMAC) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The QCM™ chemotaxis 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay kit and cell invasion assay kit were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Purified PKCι was obtained from Pan-Vera (Madison, WI). PP2, α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX), and c-Src enzyme were purchased from Calbiochem. The PKCι/pAXneoRX construct was a kind gift from Dr. Alan P. Fields (27.Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All reagents used were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium overnight. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 90 min. After treatment with nicotine or inhibitor, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer. μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated using a μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C for the time indicated. Phosphorylation of μ-or m-calpain was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis using a μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively, and developed by using an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (18.Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed to isolate heavy membrane (HM), light membrane, cytosol, and nuclear membrane as previously described (28.Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Protein from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using μ-calpain, m-calpain, and PKCι antibodies. The purity of fractions was confirmed by assessing localization of fraction-specific proteins, including prohibitin (HM; Ref. 29.Ikonen E. Fielder K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), caspase 3 (cytosolic; Ref. 30.Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C.

PKCι Phosphorylates μ- or m-Calpain in Vitro—μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated from lysates of H1299 cells using an agarose-conjugated μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The immunoprecipitated μ- or m-calpain was resuspended in a kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5,10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Purified, activated PKCι enzyme (0.1 μg) was added and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of μ- or m-calpain was determined by autoradiography. Measurement of Intracellular c-Src Activity—Cells were stimulated with nicotine, harvested, and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The c-Src was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using a c-Src antibody. The complexes were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with c-Src kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100). The immune complex beads were suspended in 45 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 1 μg of acid-treated enolase as described (32.Wooten M.W. Vandenplas M.L. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 2μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C for 24 h. The activity of c-Src was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis using a c-Src antibody. Purified c-Src Phosphorylates PKCι in Vitro—PKCι was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of H1299 cells and incubated with purified c-Src enzyme (Calbiochem) in the c-Src kinase assay buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min as described above. Phosphorylation of PKCι was determined by autoradiography. Measurement of Intracellular PKCι Activity—Cells were treated with nicotine for various times as indicated. PKCι was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an agarose-conjugated PKCι antibody. Immunoprecipitated PKCι was washed and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5,10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μg of histone-1, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activity of PKCι was determined by autoradiography. Vector-based Gene Silencing of PKCι by RNA Interference (RNAi)—The PKCι DNA target sequence for siRNA design is AACTTCCTGAAGAACATGCCA. This was determined by an Ambion siRNA Target Finder according to the human PKCι cDNA sequence. The PKCι-specific hairpin siRNA insert (sense-loop-antisense) was determined using a computerized insert design tool based on a target sequence following instructions from the Ambion website. Then, the oligonucleotide encoding the PKCι-specific hairpin siRNA insert was synthesized and ligated into pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro vector from Ambion (Austin, TX). The pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro plasmids containing the PKCι hairpin siRNA were transfected into H1299 cells using Lipofectamine™-2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stable clones persistently producing PKCι siRNA were selected using hygromycin (0.8 mg/ml). The levels of PKCι expression were analyzed by Western blot using a PKCι antibody. Detection of Calpain Activity in Living Cells—H1299 or H460 cells were plated at 50–80% confluence in a glass chamber and incubated with 0.5% FBS medium for 24 h. The cells were then treated with nicotine or inhibitor in the presence of t-Boc-LM-CMAC (30 μm) for 30–60 min. Samples were observed under a fluorescent microscope (excitation 329 nm, emission 409 nm) as described (24.Glading A. Uberall F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25.Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cell Migration and Invasion Assay—Cells were treated with nicotine or inhibitor as indicated. Cell migration was assessed using a QCM™ 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay kit (Chemicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. This new technique does not require cell labeling, scraping, washing, or counting. Cells that migrated through the polycarbonate membrane were incubated with “Cell Stain Solution” and then subsequently extracted and detected on a standard microplate at 560 nm. Cell invasion was assessed using the Chemicon cell invasion assay kit. This assay was performed in an invasion chamber, which is a 24-well tissue plate with 12 cell culture inserts. The inserts contain an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane over which a thin layer of ECMatrix™ is dried. The extracellular matrix (ECM) layer occludes the membrane pores, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through. Invasion cells migrate through the ECM layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. The insert membrane with invaded cells on the bottom was placed in the wells with cell stain/dissociation solution after incubation and reincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at 560 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Monolayer Wound Healing Assay—Cells were seeded into a six-well tissue culture dish and allowed to grow to 90% confluency in complete medium. Cell monolayers were wounded by a plastic tip (1 mm) that touched the plate as described (33.Jeong H. Nam J. Kim I. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar). Wounded monolayers were then washed four times with medium to remove cell debris and incubated in 0.5% FBS medium in the absence or presence of nicotine (0.2 μm) or inhibitor for various times up to 24 h. Cells were monitored under a microscope equipped with a camera (Deiss). Quantitative μ- or m-Calpain ELISA Assay—The μ-calpain production in culture medium was measured using a μ-Calpain ELISA assay kit from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). This kit is designed to detect μ-calpain in tissue extracts, plasma, and serum. It uses a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human μ-calpain large subunit immobilized on a microtiter plate to bind human μ-calpain. A highly purified, native human μ-calpain was used as a standard. The level of m-calpain in culture medium was also analyzed by ELISA using an m-calpain antibody from ARB Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and treated with nicotine or inhibitor as indicated. After centrifugation (1200 rpm), the resulting supernatant (culture medium) was collected. The level of μ-calpain or m-calpain in the medium was assessed by ELISA assay. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a microplate (ELISA) reader. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Nicotine Induces Phosphorylation and Activation of μ- and m-Calpains in Association with Accelerated Wound Healing, Migration, and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cells—μ- and m-Calpains are two major calpain family members that are widely expressed in both SCLC and NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A). Recently, reports indicate that epidermal growth factor-induced calpain phosphorylation enhances calpain activity in association with increased cell migration (24.Glading A. Uberall F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34.Shiraha H. Glading A. Chou J. Jia Z. Wells A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2716-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test whether nicotine can mimic a growth factor to regulate calpain, human lung cancer H1299 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine (0.2 μm) for various times. Phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results reveal that nicotine potently stimulates phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains in human lung cancer cells within 60–120 min (Fig. 1B). To test whether nicotine-induced calpain phosphorylation enhances its proteolytic activity, calpain activity in living cells was performed using t-butoxy carbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethyl-aminocoumarin (t-Boc-LM-CMAC, a synthetic calpain substrate) as described (18.Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25.Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cleavage of t-Boc-LM-CMAC by active calpains can induce retention of the chloromethylaminocoumarin portion of the molecule in the cells and can result in increased fluorescence (25.Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). H1299 cells were treated with nicotine (0.2 μm) in the presence of t-Boc-LM-CMAC for 60 min. Calpain activity was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Results indicate that exposure of cells to nicotine enhances calpain activity (Fig. 1C). Recent reports have demonstrated that phosphorylation of calpain is able to increase its activity (18.Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25.Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, nicotine-induced calpain activation may occur by a mechanism involving its phosphorylation. Other human lung cancer cell lines (i.e. H69, H82, H157, and H460 cells) that express various levels of endogenous μ- and m-calpains were also tested, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Because calpains are involved in regulating cell migration and invasion (21.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 26.Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), nicotine-induced phosphorylation and activation of calpains may promote migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. To test this possibility, a wound-healing assay was employed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Compared with control cells, wound repair is significantly accelerated following treatment with nicotine (Fig. 1D). Cell migration or invasion analysis using a QCM™ chemotaxis 24-well colorimetric cell migration or invasion assay kit reveals that nicotine significantly enhances both migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these findings suggest that nicotine-stimulated migration and invasion of lung cancer cells may occur, at least in part, through phosphorylation and activation of calpains. PKCι Co-localizes and Interacts with μ- and m-Calpains in Cytoplasm—PKCι is extensively co-expressed with μ- and m-calpains in both SCLC and NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A). To assess a potential direct role for PKCι as a physiological calpain kinase, subcellular distribution of PKCι and calpains was examined by subcellular fractionation assay. Results demonstrate that PKCι is co-localized with μ- or m-calpain in heavy membrane, light membrane, and cytosol in human lung cancer H1299 cells (Fig. 2A). To verify the purity of the subcellular fractions obtained, fraction-specific proteins were assessed by probing the same filters. Prohibitin, an exclusively mitochondrial protein (29.Ikonen E. Fielder K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), was detected only in the HM fraction. CPP32 (caspase 3), which is a cytosolic protease in growing cells (30.Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar), was detected exclusively in the cytosol, whereas proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is a nuclear marker (31.Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), was detected exclusively in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2A). These data reveal that each fraction obtained is highly pure without cross-contamination. To test whether nicotine stimulates an association between PKCι and calpain, H1299 cells were treated with nicotine (0.2 μm) for various times. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out using an agarose-conjugated μ- or m-calpain antibody. Calpain-associated PKCι (i.e. bound PKCι), μ-, or m-calpain were analyzed by Western blotting using PKCι, μ-, or m-calpain antibody, respectively. Results reveal that treatment of cells with nicotine promotes PKCι to associate with either μ- or m-calpain in a time-dependent manner with maximal association between 30–120 min (Fig. 2B). Thus, PKCι may potentially function as a physiological kinase for both μ- and m-calpains to regulate their activities in human lung cancer cells. Interestingly, the maximal association of PKCι with μ- or m-calpain happens earlier than their phosphorylation (30 versus 60 min, Figs. 1B and 2B). It is possible that PKCι may first interact with calpains and then phosphorylate them as physiological substrates. Nicotine Induces Activation of PKCι, and PKCι Phosphorylates μ- and m-Calpains in Vitro and in Vivo—PKCι mRNA has been reported to predominantly express in brain and lung (17.Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCι may function as a major player in the development of human lung cancer. To test whether nicotine affects PKCι activity, H1299 cells were treated with nicotine (0.2 μm) for various times up to 180 min. PKCι was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated PKCι antibody. Activity of PKCι was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using purified histone-1 as a substrate as described (35.Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The same filter was then probed by Western blot using a PKCι antibody to quantify PKCι pr"

https://openalex.org/W2018547695,"Cell migration is a complex biological process playing a key role in physiological and pathological conditions. During central nervous system development, positioning and function of cortical neurons is tightly regulated by cell migration. Recently, signaling events involving the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, which is a key regulator for the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have been implicated in modulating cortical neuron migration. However, the intracellular pathways controlling neuronal migration triggered by the HGF receptor Met have not been elucidated. By combining pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show here that the Ras/ERK pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are both required for cortical neuron migration. By dissecting the downstream signals necessary for this event, we found that Rac1/p38 and Akt are required, whereas the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mTOR/p70s6k pathways are dispensable. This study demonstrates that concomitant activation of the Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Rac1/p38 pathways is required to achieve full capacity of cortical neurons to migrate upon HGF stimulation.

This study demonstrates that concomitant activation of the Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Rac1/p38 pathways is required to achieve full capacity of cortical neurons to migrate upon HGF stimulation. Cell motility plays a key role during embryonic development, adult physiology, and pathological events. During central nervous system development, neuronal migration is essential to ensure proper positioning of neurons in the mature brain (1Marin O. Rubenstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, defects in cell migration can result in brain abnormalities and pathologies (2Rice D.S. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2758-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Ross M.E. Walsh C.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1041-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4Bielas S.

While a wide range of growth factors are well known to control motility of different cell types, those involved in neuronal migration have not yet been fully characterized. Genetic studies have contributed to identify growth factor signals as modulators of cell migration in developing brains. For example, fibroblast growth factor-2 as well as members of the neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4, are mediators of cortical neuron migration in vivo (5Brunstrom J.E.

In particular, mice lacking the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR), which is a key component of HGF activation, exhibit deficient scatter activity of neurons in the forebrain and reduced number of interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex, possibly due to aberrant interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence (8Powell E.M. Mars W.M. Levitt P. Neuron. 2001; 30: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 9Powell E.M. Campbell D.B. Stanwood G.D. Davis C. Noebels J.L. Levitt P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 622-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase Met is expressed in cortical neurons and the ability of HGF to induce their migration has been investigated in vitro using the Boyden chamber assay (10Sun W. Funakoshi H. Nakamura T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to the motogenic activity, several reports have enlightened the pleiotropic functions triggered by the HGF/Met couple in several types of neurons. For example, HGF is an axonal chemoattractant and neurotrophic factor for motor neurons (11Maina F. Casagranda F. Audero E. Simeone A. Comoglio P.M. Klein R. Ponzetto C.

Moreover, HGF controls survival and axonal growth of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons (15Maina F. Hilton M.C. Ponzetto C. Davies A.M. Klein R.

The large range of HGF activities and its observed synergy with other neurotrophic factors shows that HGF signaling acts predominantly to potentiate the response of different neurons to specific signals (19Maina F. Klein R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, which signaling pathways are required for these biological responses triggered by Met in neurons still remains elusive. Upon HGF stimulation, Met activates multiple downstream signals through its multifunctional docking site located at its carboxyl-terminal tail (20Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z.

For example, activation of PI3K signaling by Met triggers motogenic responses in fibroblasts and epithelial and muscle cells (29Delehedde M. Sergeant N. Lyon M. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Eur. J.

Among the PI3K effectors, Akt and Rac1 have been proposed to modulate HGF-dependent cell motility (23Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell.

The contribution of the Ras/ERK pathway for cell migration triggered by Met appears to be dependent on the cellular context, since ERK activation is required for migration of MDCK cells (25Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), while it is dispensable for striatal progenitor cells (35Cacci E. Salani M. Anastasi S. Perroteau I. Poiana G. Biagioni S. Augusti-Tocco G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function studies have demonstrated the motogenic activity of the HGF/Met system in vivo. In particular, during mouse embryogenesis Met signaling is required for myoblast migration (11Maina F. Casagranda F. Audero E. Simeone A. Comoglio P.M. Klein R. Ponzetto C. Cell. 1996; 87: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S.

Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of met specificity-switch mutant mice has been instrumental for studying signaling requirement for myoblast migration in vivo. In these mice, the multifunctional docking sites of Met have been replaced by specific binding motifs for PI3K (Met2P) or Src (Met2S) (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Myoblast migration is strongly reduced in both met2P/2P and met2S/2S mutants, thus showing that myoblast migration requires a more complex signaling network triggered by Met (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the early embryonic lethality of met mutants has prevented to further study the motogenic activity of other cell types like neurons in vivo. We are studying signaling mechanisms involved in cortical neuron migration induced by Met. To identify the signaling requirement, we compared the HGF-induced migration of wild-type cells to that of met specificity-switch mutant cells. In addition, the use of pharmacological inhibitors allowed us to specifically interfere with downstream signals activated by Met. Here we demonstrate that Ras/ERK and PI3K pathways are both required for the motogenic activity of cortical neurons triggered by Met, as inhibition of either one of these pathways prevents their migration. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active form of PI3K in cortical neurons with deficient Met-triggered PI3K signaling and cell motility completely rescues migration defects. We further investigated the downstream signals necessary for this event and found that while both Rac1/p38 and Akt are required for cortical neuron migration, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/Jun and mTOR/p70s6k pathways are not. Together, these data demonstrate that concomitant activation of the Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Rac1/p38 signals is required to achieve full capacity of cortical neurons to migrate in response to HGF. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant HGF (R&D Systems) was used at a concentration of 50 ng/ml unless specified. The pharmacological inhibitors LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) and U0126 (MEK inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem. SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and d-JNKI-1 (JNK inhibitor) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. The concentrations of each inhibitor are indicated in the figures. No toxic effects were observed at the concentrations used. The antibodies used were anti-pAkt(Ser473), anti-pp70s6k (Thr389), anti-pp38 (Thr180/Tyr182), and anti-pERK (Thr202/Tyr204, clone E10) (Cell Signaling), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, anti-pY), anti-pJun (Ser73) (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-mouse-Met (sc-162), anti-human-Met (sc-10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Plasmids—The pCAAGS-GFP expression vector (GFP) has been described previously (39Dubrulle J. McGrew M.J. Pourquie O. Cell. 2001; 106: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding a dominant negative (dnAkt) form of Akt (K179M) was kindly provided by Dr. David Kaplan (40Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for the mutant forms of Rac1 were gifts from Dr. Xosé R Bustelo (41Coso O.A.

The control pEF-BOS vector and the plasmid encoding the constitutively active form of PI3K (caPI3K) were provided by Dr. Doreen Cantrell. Mice—Generation and genotyping of met2P/2P and met2S/2S knock-in signaling mutants were previously described (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To partially rescue placental development, heterozygous males on a mixed C57Bl/6 × 129/sv background were intercrossed with heterozygous females on outbreed strain CD1 (38Maina F. Pante G.

Mice were kept at the Institute for Developmental Biology of Marseille animal facilities, and all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Cortical Neuron Culture—Neocortices were dissected from 15-day-old wild-type or met specificity-switch mutant embryos and digested with trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Cortical neurons were washed twice with DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (DMEM/HS). For biochemical studies, dissociated cells were seeded on poly-dl-ornithine (poly-O, Sigma)-coated 6-cm diameter dishes at a density of 6 × 106/dish in DMEM/HS. Four hours later, the medium was replaced by neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 nutrient (NB/B27: 50/1; Invitrogen). Cells were cultured for 3 days (3DIV) unless specified. Treatment with specific inhibitors was performed 2 h before HGF stimulation. For electroporation experiments, cortical neurons (2 × 105) were electroporated in the presence of 4 μg of expression plasmid using the Electro square porator™ BTX-ECM830 (Genetronics Inc.). Electroporation conditions were 5 pulses at 270 V of 3 ms separated by a 1-s interval. Cells were then placed for 10 min on ice and submitted to migration assay. Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed using 24-well poly-O-coated-Boyden chambers (5 μm pore, Costar), which allows testing chemotactic response of HGF rather than a simple motile response. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded in NB/B27 medium on the upper side of the chamber. The lower compartment contained NB/B27 medium supplemented or not with HGF (50 ng/ml) and chemical inhibitors, as specified. The assays were performed for either 24 or 48 h with non-electroporated or electroporated cells, respectively. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Boyden chamber filters were mounted onto glass coverslips in presence of vectashield ®/Dapi (Vector). The number of migrating cells (on the lower side of the filter) was directly analyzed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope and determined in at least five fields of each filter. All cell migration assays were performed in triplicate. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired Student’s t test. PI3K Assay and Western Immunoblotting—PI3K assays were performed as described previously (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical neuron lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-pY antibodies, and PI3K activity was assayed using phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated lipids were then extracted and separated by liquid chromatography on a silica plate. Signals were detected by autoradiography. Procedures of cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting have been described previously (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical neuron cultures were lysed in either ice-cold EBM lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm glycerophospate) or boiling total protein extraction buffer (TPEB: 5% SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (300 μg) were incubated 2 h at 4 °C with anti-Met antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose in EBM lysis buffer. Immunocomplexes or total cell lysates (30–50 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and membranes were saturated in PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween) supplemented with either 5% milk or 3% bovine serum albumin. After overnight incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies. Signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Rac1 Activity Assay—Rac assay was performed as described previously (42del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Briefly, after HGF stimulation, cells were chilled on ice, then lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates (600 μg) were incubated 45 min at 4 °C with recombinant GST-PBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody. ERK Signaling Is Required for Cortical Neuron Migration Induced by HGF—Although several reports have shown that the Ras/ERK pathway contributes to Met-triggered cell migration in epithelial cells (25Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. J. Cell.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3721-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), this signal is dispensable for HGF-induced migration of striatal progenitor cells (35Cacci E. Salani M. Anastasi S. Perroteau I. Poiana G. Biagioni S. Augusti-Tocco G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, after verifying Met expression (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B) and activation upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 1A), we first analyzed the kinetic of ERK phosphorylation triggered by Met in cortical neurons. HGF treatment induced a transient phosphorylation of ERK in wild-type cortical neurons (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, we found that in contrast to primary embryonic hepatocytes (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), both Met2P and Met2S efficiently induced ERK phosphorylation similar to wild-type Met (Fig. 1B). The intact level of ERK phosphorylation downstream Met2P and Met2S allowed us to investigate its requirement for cortical neuron migration, using Boyden chamber assay. As shown previously (10Sun W. Funakoshi H. Nakamura T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), HGF treatment induced wild-type cortical neuron migration (Fig. 1C) in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1D). This event requires intact Ras/ERK activation, since cell migration was abolished in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2A) or PD98059 (data not shown). HGF-induced migration was then assayed in met2P/2P and met2S/2S neurons. met2P/2P cortical neurons migrate in response to HGF, although to a lesser extent compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1C; p < 0.001). Migration was abolished in the presence of U0126, showing that intact Ras/ERK activation is also required for met2P/2P cortical neuron migration. In contrast, met2S/2S mutant cells failed to migrate in response to HGF, showing that intact ERK signaling was not sufficient (Fig. 1C). Together, these results show that although the Ras/ERK pathway is required for Met-triggered migration of cortical neurons, additional intracellular signals are required for their motility. Intact PI3K Signaling Is Necessary for Met-triggered Cortical Neuron Migration—The above results argue that in addition to Ras/ERK, at least another pathway is required for Met-triggered cortical neuron migration. Fig. 1C shows that met2P/2P cortical neurons migrate in response to HGF. The retained ability of Met to signal through PI3K in these cells (38Maina F. Pante G. Helmbacher F. Andres R. Porthin A. Davies A.M. Ponzetto C. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1293-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) allowed us to test whether this pathway is an essential modulator of neuronal migration. We first assessed the ability of wild-type and mutant Met to trigger PI3K activation in cortical neurons. Fig. 2A shows that HGF stimulation induced sustained PI3K activation in wild-type and met2P/2P cortical neurons but not in met2S/2S mutant cells. The inability of met2S/2S neurons, with deficient PI3K activity, to migrate in response to HGF suggests that PI3K can be a crucial signaling molecule for HGF-dependent motility. We therefore assayed cell migration in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (supplemental Fig. 2B). Both wild-type and met2P/2P mutant cells failed to migrate in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2B), demonstrating the essential role of the PI3K pathway for this event. We asked whether adding back a constitutively active form of PI3K in met2S/2S mutant neurons was sufficient to restore motility induced by HGF. Cell migration was assayed in neurons electroporated with a constitutively active form of PI3K (caPI3K) (44Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of HGF, expression of caPI3K partially increased the basal level of migration in wild-type and mutant cells (p < 0.001) but did not significantly change the HGF-dependent migration of wild-type neurons (p = 0.363) (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the partially reduced motility of HGF-treated met2P/2P neurons was completely restored by caPI3K (p = 0.01) (Fig. 2C), suggesting that in the Met2P context, the level of PI3K activation could be determinant for the migration capacity. Remarkably, caPI3K fully restored migration of met2S/2S mutant neurons treated with HGF (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). These results show that the missing signal in met2S/2S cortical neurons is the PI3K pathway. Interestingly, neuronal migration of met2S/2S mutant cells electroporated with caPI3K was abolished in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D). Together, these results genetically demonstrate that intact PI3K signaling is essential for cortical neuron migration triggered by Met. Moreover, they also show that concomitant activation of both Ras/ERK and PI3K pathways is required. Activated Akt, but Not mTOR/p70s6k Pathway, Contributes to HGF-mediated Cortical Neuron Migration—We next aimed at identifying which effectors of PI3K are required for Met-triggered neuronal migration. It has been recently reported that the PI3K downstream effector Akt (44Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to control cell survival (45Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2017214363,"Mammalian diaphanous-related (mDia) formins act as Rho GTPase effectors during cytoskeletal remodeling. Rho binding to mDia amino-terminal GTPase-binding domains (GBDs) causes the adjacent Dia-inhibitory domain (DID) to release the carboxyl-terminal Dia-autoregulatory (DAD) domain that flanks the formin homology-2 (FH2) domain. The release of DAD allows the FH2 domain to then nucleate and elongate nonbranched actin filaments. DAD, initially discovered as a region of homology shared between a phylogenetically divergent set of formin proteins, is comprised of a core motif, MDXLLXL, and an adjacent region is comprised of numerous basic residues, typically RRKR in the mDia family. Here, we show that these specific amino acids within the basic region of DAD contribute to the binding of DID and therefore the maintenance of the mDia autoregulatory mechanism. In addition, expression of full-length versions of mDia2 containing amino acid substitutions in either the DAD core or basic regions causes profound changes in the F-actin architecture, including the formation of filopodia-like structures that rapidly elongate from the cell edge. These studies further refine our understanding of the molecular contribution of DAD to mDia control and the role of mDia2 in the assembly of membrane protrusions.

Here, we show that these specific amino acids within the basic region of DAD contribute to the binding of DID and therefore the maintenance of the mDia autoregulatory mechanism. In addition, expression of full-length versions of mDia2 containing amino acid substitutions in either the DAD core or basic regions causes profound changes in the F-actin architecture, including the formation of filopodia-like structures that rapidly elongate from the cell edge. These studies further refine our understanding of the molecular contribution of DAD to mDia control and the role of mDia2 in the assembly of membrane protrusions. Formins participate in the assembly of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in multiple contexts, including cell division, migration, and development (1.Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S.

Rho GTPase binding to the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) 3The abbreviations used are: GBD, GTPase-binding domain; DID, diaphanous-inhibitory domain; FH, formin homology; DAD, diaphanous autoregulatory domain; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. is thought to activate mDia proteins by disrupting an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism (19.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) mediated by an amino-terminal diaphanous-inhibitory domain (DID) (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) in the carboxyl terminus (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition was recently shown to be mediated by DID, which is sufficient to weakly bind and inhibit nucleation by the isolated FH2 domain (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Structure determinations have shown that DID is primarily a helical region with Armadillo repeats (21.Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22.Otomo T. Otomo C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). High-affinity DID binding and inhibition is bolstered by the presence of DAD (FH2-DAD), which increases the potency of inhibition by ∼20,000-fold. This suggests that the role of DAD is to act as a high-affinity anchor for the DID region, thereby allowing the DID-DAD interaction to keep the mDia protein inactive until signaled by a small GTPase. DAD was originally described by the consensus sequence shared between a subset of diaphanous-related formins that included a “core” motif (GA)(VA)MDXLLEXL(KRQ)X(GA)(SGA)(AP) (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). An additional “basic region,” RRKR in the mDia family, was also identified. As the formin family has expanded, additional comparisons suggest that the “DAD core,” MDXLLEL, is highly conserved (14.Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the initial study, alanine-scanning replacements of conserved or similar residues within the core (Fig. 1A) demonstrated that residues such as methionine 1041 in mDia2 were critical for in vitro binding to the GBD/DID region in the amino terminus (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These amino acid substitutions also interfered with the ability of an expressed EGFP-DAD fusion to trigger various cellular events such as: 1) the formation of thin actin filaments and 2) gene expression controlled by the serum response transcription factor (3.Alberts A.S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The effects of DAD expression are similar to the effects of deregulated (activated) versions of mDia proteins lacking all or part of the autoinhibitory GBD/DID regions (19.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 25.Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Whereas DAD does not appear to have any inherent ability to affect actin nucleation (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the effects of DAD expression were shown to be dependent upon the cellular mDia protein (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In support of this model, a DAD peptide has been shown to activate autoinhibited mDia1 in vitro (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DAD has been shown to trigger formin-dependent actin remodeling in budding yeast (27.Dong Y. Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whereas specific amino acid residues in the core region of DAD have been studied for their role in the autoregulation of full-length mDia, the adjacent basic region has yet to be examined in detail. In this study, we have investigated the molecular requirements of DAD for binding to DID and show that, in addition to the core region, specific basic residues in DAD are also necessary for binding to DID. Synthesis of DAD Peptides and Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Constructs—All of the fluorescent peptides containing the DAD region were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. All peptides were modified with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein at the NH2 terminus and amidated on the COOH terminus. Each peptide consisted of residues 1036–1061 (wild type, DETGVMDSLLEALQSGAAFRDRRKRT). The mutant DAD peptides were created separately with the inclusion of the appropriate substituted amino acid(s). For expression of GST fusion proteins, Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) containing pGex-KT fusion constructs were grown in LB (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37 °C, induced at an A600 of 0.6–0.8 with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubated overnight at 16 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then resuspended and sonicated in lysis buffer: TNM buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing HALT protease inhibitors (Pierce), 20 units of DNase I, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose column (Pierce) equilibrated with TNM buffer. The column was washed three times with TNM buffer, followed by elution of the GST fusion protein by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm reduced glutathione, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). To remove the vast majority of the dithiothreitol and reduced glutathione from the protein sample, as well as restore the pH to 7.0, the concentrated protein sample was re-diluted with TNM buffer followed by concentration on the sample; this process was repeated three times. Protein concentrations were determined by two methods: by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (using bovine serum albumin as the standard). Fluorescence Anisotropy and Data Analysis (DAD-DID Binding)—All fluorescent measurements were taken at 25 °C on a Photon Technologies Inc. model QM-7/2003 SE fluorometer with polarization filters. For the anisotropy experiments, the λex = 495 nm and λem = 521 nm with all slit widths at 1.0 mm (∼4 nm wavelength range). All anisotropy experiments consisted of an initial solution of 10 nm DAD (wild-type or mutant) peptide in TNM buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). The purified GST-DID protein (mDia1 or mDia2) was then sequentially added with subsequent anisotropy measurements. The fraction of DAD peptide bound was determined by designating the maximum anisotropy change to be 100% bound, followed by normalization of all remaining anisotropy data to yield the fraction bound. The concentration of free GST-DID was calculated by the following equation. [Free GST-DID]={[total GST-DID]-([total GST-DID]·fraction bound)} Fraction bound data were plotted versus the concentration of free GST-DID and fitted in GraphPad Prism 4 with a hyperbolic one-site binding model in the following equation. Fraction bound=[free GST-DID][free GST-DID]·[KD] Cell Culture, Microinjection, and Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells (28.Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and plated on glass coverslips. Cell microinjection and immunofluorescence was as previously described (25.Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); 50 μg/ml of plasmid DNA was microinjected unless indicated otherwise. 24 h prior to microinjection, cells were changed to medium containing 0.1% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Four hours after microinjection, cells were fixed and stained with TRITC-phalloidin to visualize F-actin as previously described (28.Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were captured in TIF format with a digital camera (SPOT R100; Diagnostics) mounted on a Nikon E400 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a ×100 (1.4NA) objective using fixed acquisition times. F-actin levels were quantified by determining the mean fluorescent intensity of TRITC-phalloidin staining using image quantification software as previously described elsewhere (29.Alberts A.S. Qin H. Carr H.S. Frost J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12152-12161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); fluorescein isothiocyanate or EGFP fluorescent images were used to differentiate microinjected/expressing cells from uninjected cells. Time-lapse image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss 100 inverted microscope equipped with an enviromental chamber. Cells were microinjected with expression plasmid and image acquisition began 4 h later. Frames were acquired at 3-s intervals and the Quicktime movie was assembled using the Improvision Openlab software. Plasmids and GenBank® Accession Numbers—mDia2 and various domain expression constructs were made in either pEFhm (His6 tag/myc tag) or pEFm (myc tag), pEFm-EGFP, using standard methods; details are available upon request. pEYFP-mDia2-M1041A was generated using pEYFP-mDia2 (30.Peng J.

The accession number for mDia2 is AF094519. The Basic Region of DAD Is Required for DID Binding—DAD is located in the extreme carboxyl termini of the mDia proteins adjacent to the FH2 domain (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14.Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The methionine residue at position 1041 (Met1041) in mDia2 has previously been shown by yeast two-hybrid and GST “pull down” assay to be critical for in vitro binding to the GBD/DID region in the amino terminus (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved Met1041, most diaphanous-related formins contain a stretch of basic residues on the COOH-terminal side of the core DAD domain (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess the importance of the basic region of DAD, we first tested the ability of a DAD construct lacking this region to induce actin remodeling in cells. EGFP-DAD expression in NIH 3T3 cells causes the accumulation of numerous thin, parallel actin filaments that traverse the cell, stabilize microtubules, and activates the serum response transcription factor (17.Palazzo A. Cook T.A. Alberts A.S. Gundersen G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, C–H, EGFP-DAD (or its variants) was expressed for 4 h after microinjection of the expression plasmid in NIH 3T3 cells previously maintained overnight in low serum (0.1% fetal calf serum). After fixation, cells were stained with TRITC-phalloidin to visualize F-actin assembly, as shown in the right-hand panels; EGFP-DAD fusion proteins are shown in the left-hand panels. EGFP-DAD expression (Fig. 1, C and D) caused the formation of stress fiber-like actin filaments that traverse the cell. Similar to previous work, EGFP-DAD M1041A (Fig. 1, E and F) did not affect the actin architecture relative to non-expressing cells or cells expressing EGFP alone (data not shown). In addition, a version of EGFP-DAD ending at Phe1054 (lacking any basic region) also had no effect on the actin architecture. EGFP-DAD (but not the M1041A or R1055Stop variants) increased the overall levels of F-actin in cells as shown by quantitating the fluorescence intensity of TRITC-phalloidin staining in expressing cells (Fig. 1I) using previously described methods (29.Alberts A.S. Qin H. Carr H.S. Frost J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12152-12161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To further investigate the specific amino acid residues in the basic region that may be important to the ability of DAD to affect cellular actin remodeling, a series of double mutants were tested in microinjection experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, A–H, the DAD changes in the basic region that failed to stimulate actin remodeling were the double glutamate versions, EGFP-DAD R1057/R1058E (Fig. 2, C and D) and K1059/R1060E (Fig. 2, E and F). Glutamates substituted at the nonconserved basic residues Lys1063 and Lys1065 had no effect on DAD-induced actin filament architecture (Fig. 2, G and H), and still caused an overall increase in F-actin levels (Fig. 2I). R1055A/D1056A also showed no significant effect in cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These cell-based experiments demonstrated that the conserved “RRKR” residues in the basic region are most likely critical for DAD function. The mechanism proposed to account for the ability of DAD to induce actin filaments in cells involves binding of the DAD protein to cellular mDia proteins, whereby EGFP-DAD displaces intermolecular or intramolecular DID-DAD interactions (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, then DAD variants that are inactive in the cell-based assays are because of their failure to bind DID. This appears to be true for certain conserved residue variants found in the leucine-rich core of DAD (20.Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To examine the potential contribution to DID binding by these specific DAD residues, it was necessary to be able to quantify the affinity of the DID-DAD interaction. Similar to recent work (12.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), fluorescence anisotropy was successfully used to monitor the binding of DID to a fluorescein-labeled peptide (residues 1036–1061 of mDia2). To confirm that the peptide could function like the full-length DAD in cells, microinjection of the DAD peptide into mouse fibroblasts proved to elicit the same activation of actin fiber formation (data not shown). Therefore, the fluorescently labeled DAD peptide provided a valid approach to correlating the function of DAD in cells with its ability to bind to DID. The addition of purified GST-DID (mDia1, residues 129–369) or GST-DID (mDia2, residues 140–396) increased the anisotropy of the DAD peptide in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 3A and described under “Materials and Methods,” the anisotropy data were fitted with a one-step binding model yielding a KD = 0.28 μm for the interaction of the DAD peptide to GST-DID (mDia1) and KD = 0.29 μm for GST-DID (mDia2). Once the DID/wild-type DAD interaction was quantified, it was possible to probe the contribution of specific amino acid residues in DAD. Whereas the wild-type DAD peptide displayed significant interaction with GST-DID from both mDia1 and mDia2, the M1041A and R1057E/R1058E DAD peptides failed to bind to the GST-DID (mDia1) (data not shown) or GST-DID (mDia2) (Fig. 3B). For the M1041A and R1057E/R1058E DAD peptides, the affinity for GST-DID was so low that it was impossible to properly calculate a valid KD for the interaction (see Table 1 for list of KD values). Taken together, these data demonstrated that in addition to the previously characterized core region of DAD, the basic region contributes significantly to interactions with DID. The binding assays also provided a valid correlation between DID-DAD binding and the ability of DAD to induce actin filaments in cells.TABLE 1Dissociation constants for the binding of GST-DID (mDia2-(140–396)) to DAD peptide-(1036–1061), as determined by fluorescence anisotropyDAD mutationKDμmWild type0.29M1041A>20aThe M1041A and R1057E/R1058E DAD mutants exhibited little to no binding to GST-DID, making it impossible to determine a reliable KD for these binding interactionsR1057A0.78R1057E2.78R1058E3.50K1059E1.50R1060E1.26R1057E/R1058E>20aThe M1041A and R1057E/R1058E DAD mutants exhibited little to no binding to GST-DID, making it impossible to determine a reliable KD for these binding interactionsa The M1041A and R1057E/R1058E DAD mutants exhibited little to no binding to GST-DID, making it impossible to determine a reliable KD for these binding interactions Open table in a new tab The Positive Charges of the Basic Residues RRKR Are Important to DID Binding—Whereas it was observed that the double glutamate mutants of DAD, R1057E/R1058E and K1059E/R1060E, lacked the ability to bind to DID and affect the cellular actin architecture, it was prudent to further investigate the importance of each amino acid residue in the DAD basic region. In addition, if these RRKR residues are involved in DID-DAD binding, are the positive charges associated with these residues important to the interaction? To address this question, single alanine and single glutamate mutations were made on all four 1057RRKR1060 residues. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the binding affinity of DAD peptides corresponding to R1057A and all glutamate single substitutions were tested for in vitro binding to GST-DID (mDia2-(140–396)). All of the single mutant DAD peptides could be fitted with a single site binding model. Whereas the R1057A DAD peptide had a slightly decreased affinity, all of the single glutamate variants had even lower DID binding affinities, with the R1057E and R1058E DAD peptides exhibiting a 10- and 12-fold decrease in affinity, respectively (see Table 1 for a list of the KD values). Because the glutamate substitutions exhibited lower binding affinity to DID, the correlation to the ability of these DAD variants to affect the cellular actin architecture was studied. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5, A–F. Whereas the R1057A DAD did show a small decrease in DID binding affinity, it still caused the accumulation of F-actin as shown in Fig. 5, C and D. As predicted by the binding studies, a single glutamate substitution blocked the ability of EGFP-DAD to effect F-actin (Fig. 5, E and F). Likewise, all of the single glutamate mutant EGFP-DAD constructs failed to induce actin accumulation as summarized in Fig. 5G. The glutamate mutations appeared to decrease the DID binding affinity to a critical threshold that resulted in the inability of DAD to induce changes in the cellular actin architecture. Whereas the single alanine mutations did not reduce the DID-DAD affinity enough to lose the cellular effects, it would appear that the change in charge from a Arg (or Lys)/Glu produced a more significant disruption in its interactions to DID. To address if the removal of another positive charge in the basic region of DAD, generated without an associated change in charge, could cause a disruption in its cellular function, a double alanine mutant (R1057A/R1058A) was tested. In cells, this double alanine mutant showed no ability to induce cellular actin filaments (data not shown). This result indicates that whereas the change in charge (glutamate mutants) disrupts DID-DAD binding, the presence of a significant positively charged patch in the basic region is required for efficient interactions with DID. Expression of Full-length Versions of mDia2 with DAD Mutations That Block Binding to DID Triggers the Assembly of Filopodia-like Structures—To examine the effects of disrupting the ability of DAD to interact with DID in the context of full-length protein, the R1057A, R1057E/R1058E, and M1041A substitutions were introduced into mDia2 expression plasmids. Protein expression and F-actin architecture in cells 4 h after microinjection of the respective vectors into NIH 3T3 cells maintained in 0.1% fetal calf serum are shown Fig. 6, B and C. As expected, expression of mDia2-R1057A (Fig. 6B) had no effect on F-actin assembly in comparison to neighboring uninjected cells or cells expressing mDia2 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, cells expressing either mDia2-R1057E/R1058E or mDia2-M1041A caused the disruption of pre-existing stress fibers and the assembly of extensive filopodial-like structures at the cell periphery. To ensure that the structures were not because of retraction of the lamella, time lapse microscopy (Fig. 6, E and F; supplemental Movie S1) of cells expressing a version of YFP-mDia2-M1041A showed that the deregulated formin localizes to the tips of structures that elongate away from the cell edge. These results are consistent with the idea that mDia2 is autoregulated via DAD interactions with DID. Moreover, the observed induction of filopodia assembly in the absence of other extracellular stimuli further supports the observation that mDia2 has an important role in the formation of microspikes and filopodia (30.Peng J.

Compartmental localization of nitric-oxide synthases is important for nitric oxide signaling. We therefore examined liver neuronal nitric-oxide synthase-α (nNOS) subcellular distribution as a putative mechanism for thyroid effects on rat metabolic rate. At low 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine levels, nNOS mRNA increased by 3-fold, protein expression by one-fold, and nNOS was selectively translocated to mitochondria without changes in other isoforms. In contrast, under thyroid hormone administration, mRNA level did not change and nNOS remained predominantly localized in cytosol. In hypothyroidism, nNOS translocation resulted in enhanced mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase activity with low O2 uptake. In this context, NO utilization increased active O2 species and peroxynitrite yields and tyrosine nitration of complex I proteins that reduced complex activity. Hypothyroidism was also associated to high phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclin D1 levels. Similarly to thyroid hormones, but without changing thyroid status, nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester increased basal metabolic rate, prevented mitochondrial nitration and complex I derangement, and turned mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclin D1 expression back to control pattern.

[ONOO–] production rate was calculated as shown in Equation 4.d[ONOO-]/-dt=k4[NO][O2·¯]Eq. 4 Statistical Analysis—Data are mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was utilized with post hoc Dunnett test, and regression analysis and significance were accepted at p <0.05. At low T3, Transcriptional Increase of nNOS Enhances mtNOS Content—Thyroid status was discriminated by thyrotropin and BMR measurements (Table 1). In this context, nNOS mRNA, protein expression, and activity were clearly modulated by T3 levels (Fig. 1, A–E). Likewise, nNOS mRNA expression quantified by RT real-time PCR was >3-fold increased in hypothyroid liver compared with controls (Fig. 1B), whereas eNOS or iNOS mRNA did not change (data not shown). In addition, nNOS became distinctively enhanced in mitochondria (mtNOS), indicating a subsequent import of the overexpressed enzyme to the organelles; these findings were reverted by hormone replacement (Fig. 1C). To corroborate subcellular distribution in the groups, liver fractions were compared. Western blotting confirmed the increase of total nNOS expression represented by liver homogenates and the enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction in the hypothyroid group. Differentially, at high T3, nNOS expression had results similar to controls, but this condition retained the protein predominantly localized in cytosol (Fig. 1C). This effect was parallel to the increased expression of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), one of the most important chaperones associated to nNOS (Fig. 1F). Alternatively, modulation of mtNOS content in the studied groups was validated as well by immunoelectron microscopy with monoclonal nNOS antibodies (Fig. 1D). In agreement, Ca2+-dependent NOS activity was significantly increased in hypothyroid mitochondria but was normal to slightly reduced after T3 administration, with an opposite cytosolic pattern (Fig. 1E); Ca2+-independent NOS activity was not detected.TABLE 1Oxygen uptake rates depend on thyroid status and nitric oxide utilizationControlHypothyroidHypothyroid + T3HyperthyroidTSH (ng/ml)12 ± 2>80*11 ± 25 ± 1*Basal metabolic rate (ml of O2/min·kg0.75)17 ± 112 ± 1*18 ± 123 ± 1*Mitochondrial O2 uptake (ngat/min·mg of protein)State 4 uptakeBasal14.2 ± 1.311.5 ± 1.715.8 ± 1.716.9 ± 0.3+ 0.3 mm l-Arg13.8 ± 0.79.0 ± 0.5 †14.0 ± 1.714.8 ± 0.6+ 3 mm l-NMMA15.6 ± 0.812.4 ± 2.014.6 ± 1.816.2 ± 2State 3 uptakeBasal79 ± 649 ± 3*†89 ± 5102 ± 10+ 0.3 mm l-Arg72 ± 746 ± 2†*85 ± 5106 ± 10*+ 3 mm l-NMMA86 ± 862 ± 4*92 ± 5105 ± 8Calculated matrix (NO) (nm)23 ± 994 ± 754 ± 156 ± 3Enzyme activitiesComplex I (nmole/min·mg of protein)108 ± 1641 ± 15*85 ± 998 ± 9Complex II/III (nmole/min·mg of protein)66 ± 1962 ± 2063 ± 1669 ± 1Complex IV (k′/min·mg of protein)13.7 ± 0.312.3 ± 0.2*13.5 ± 0.414.6 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Subcellular nNOS Localization Modulates Mitochondrial Respiration—According to BMR, organelles from hypo- and hyperthyroid groups had the lowest and highest O2 uptake rates, respectively (Table 1). To discern the effects of mtNOS, mitochondria were supplemented with l-Arg alone or plus NOS inhibitor l-NMMA. The sum of the opposite effects of NOS substrate and inhibitor on basal O2 utilization determines mtNOS functional activity on respiration (28Valdez L.B. Zaobornyj T. Boveris A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Likewise, mtNOS-dependent inhibition of state 3 O2 uptake was increased ∼39% in hypothyroid samples, 18% in controls, and negligible in T3-treated mitochondria. In agreement, matrix NO estimated from l-Arg inhibition of O2 uptake (18Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobo N. Schopfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) was augmented by 4-fold in hypothyroidism and decreased by a half in hyperthyroidism (Table 1). These results demonstrate that (a) translocated nNOS is functionally active and mitochondria retain ex vivo the cofactors for catalytic activity and (b) NOS confinement to the small mitochondrial compartment amplifies NO effects on O2 uptake and BMR. We next examined the contribution of segmental activities to mitochondrial O2 uptake. Electron transfer rate at complex I was markedly decreased at hypothyroid status solely (∼ 60%), whereas cytochrome oxidase was less inhibited (∼ 11%), and complex II-III activity was not modified (Table 1). No significant thyroid effects on antioxidant Mn-SOD, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase activities were detected. Thyroid Status Defines Quality and Intensity of Mitochondrial Oxidant Production—In connection with O2 uptake rate, previous observations proposed a decreased mitochondrial H2O2 yield in rat hypothyroidism and an increased yield in hyperthyroidism (29Venditti P.

https://openalex.org/W2104740195,"Long QT syndrome type 2 is caused by mutations in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). We previously reported that the N470D mutation is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but can be rescued to the plasma membrane by hERG channel blocker E-4031. The mechanisms of ER retention and how E-4031 rescues the N470D mutant are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the interaction of hERG channels with the ER chaperone protein calnexin. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we showed that the immature forms of both wild type hERG and N470D associated with calnexin. The association required N-linked glycosylation of hERG channels. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that N470D had a prolonged association with calnexin compared with wild type hERG and E-4031 shortened the time course of calnexin association with N470D. To test whether the prolonged association of N470D with calnexin is due to defective folding of mutant channels, we studied hERG channel folding using the trypsin digestion method. We found that N470D and the immature form of wild type hERG were more sensitive to trypsin digestion than the mature form of wild type hERG. In the presence of E-4031, N470D became more resistant to trypsin even when its ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked by brefeldin A. These results suggest that defective folding of N470D contributes to its prolonged association with calnexin and ER retention and that E-4031 may restore proper folding of the N470D channel leading to its cell surface expression.

These LQT2 mutations are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the core-glycosylated immature form and are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (9.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16.Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Molinari M. Zhou Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19419-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the maturation of newly synthesized hERG protein in the ER is under stringent surveillance by the quality control system (16.Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Molinari M. Zhou Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19419-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ER quality control system ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins are exported from the ER to the Golgi. Misfolded, incompletely folded, and unassembled proteins are retained in the ER by the quality control system (17.Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 18.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). The ER quality control system involves molecular chaperones that transiently associate with newly synthesized proteins and promote their proper folding and assembly. However, proteins that are unable to fold and assemble correctly often exhibit prolonged association with these chaperones, which may contribute to their retention in the ER (17.Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 18.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Although LQT2 mutant channels have been shown to display prolonged association with cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, the interaction of hERG channels with ER molecular chaperones has not been reported (19.Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calnexin is an ER resident integral membrane chaperone protein that plays an important role in the biogenesis and quality control of glycolproteins (17.Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 18.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Calnexin specifically interacts with glycan moieties of the glycoproteins and associates transiently with newly synthesized glycoproteins until they fold properly. If the proteins never fold correctly, the interaction between calnexin and the misfolded proteins is prolonged, leading to their retention in the ER. Because hERG undergoes N-linked glycosylation (20.Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we want to know whether calnexin interacts with hERG channels and whether calnexin plays a role in the ER retention of LQT2 mutant channels. We previously showed that the LQT2 mutation N470D exhibits temperature-sensitive protein-trafficking defects (21.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The N470D mutant is retained in the ER when expressed at 37 °C, whereas at 27 °C its trafficking to the plasma membrane is markedly improved. We also showed that the N470D mutant channel can be rescued by hERG channel-blocking drugs, including E-4031, astemizole, and cisapride (21.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 22.Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H652-H658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of pharmacological rescue of trafficking-defective hERG mutant channels are poorly understood. It has been proposed that hERG channel-blocking agents may act as pharmacological chaperones to promote proper protein folding in a conformation that permits trafficking to the plasma membrane (10.January C.T. Gong Q. Zhou Z. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11.Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Rajamani S. January C.T. Circ.

However, the folding of LQT2 mutant proteins and effects of pharmacological chaperones on the folding have not been studied. In the present work, we studied the role of calnexin in the quality control of mutant hERG channels. In addition, we analyzed protein folding of hERG channels using trypsin digestion and detergent extraction methods. We showed that both wild type and N470D mutant proteins associated with calnexin. However, the N470D mutant exhibited a prolonged association with calnexin. The prolonged association of N470D with calnexin may be due to defective folding of the mutant protein as evidenced by its increased sensitivity to trypsin digestion compared with wild type hERG. E-4031 improves the folding of the N470D mutant protein and shortens the time course of its association with calnexin, leading to the cell surface expression of the mutant channel. Reagents and Cell Transfection—Anti-calnexin and anti-calreticulin antibodies were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada). EXPRE35S protein labeling mix was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-hERG antibody was raised against the hERG C-terminal region as previously described (9.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L.

Stable transfection of HEK293 cells with wild type hERG, N470D, and N598Q has been previously described (5.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

Western Blot Analysis—Membrane protein preparation and Western blot were performed as previously described (5.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

The membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-hERG or anti-calnexin antibodies and visualized with the ECL detection kit. Coimmunoprecipitation of Calnexin and hERG—HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type hERG, N470D, and N598Q were lysed in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose beads. The calnexin-hERG complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubating with 2 μg of antibody against calnexin at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-antibody complexes were isolated with protein A-agarose beads and washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer. The bound antigens were eluted from the protein A-agarose beads by Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hERG antibody. Pulse-Chase and Sequential Immunoprecipitation of Calnexin and hERG—HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type hERG or N470D mutant were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 30 min and chased with 2 mm unlabeled methionine/cysteine for time intervals up to 8 h. At the end of the chase period, cells were lysed in 500 μlofthe immunoprecipitation buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibody. For the second round of precipitation, the immune complexes from the first precipitation were treated with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% SDS, and the supernatants were then diluted with 10 volumes of the immunoprecipitation buffer. hERG antiserum (1:100 dilution) was added, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-antibody complexes were isolated with protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer. The bound antigen were eluted from the protein A-agarose beads by Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized with autoradiography. Trypsin Digestion—Membrane proteins from HEK293 cells transfected with wild type hERG or the N470D mutant were prepared as previously described (5.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and resuspended in Tris buffer saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl). 10 μg of membrane protein (1 mg/ml) was treated for 5 min at room temperature with various amounts of trypsin (13,000 benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg protein; Sigma). The final concentrations of trypsin were 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μg/ml. The reactions were stopped by addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The samples were then solubilized by addition of 6× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hERG antibody. Detergent Extraction—HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type hERG or the N470D mutant were harvested in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and different concentrations of Triton X-100) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture. Equal fractions from supernatant (detergent soluble) and pellet (detergent insoluble) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hERG antibody. Interaction of Calnexin with Wild Type hERG and the N470D Mutant—To study the mechanism of defective trafficking of the N470D mutant, we examined the interaction of calnexin with wild type hERG and the N470D mutant. In these experiments, the physical association of hERG channels with calnexin was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin antibody followed by Western blot with anti-hERG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, hERG channels were coimmunoprecipitated with calnexin in wild type hERG and N470D-transfected cells. For both wild type hERG and the N470D mutant, calnexin associated with the core-glycosylated immature form of channel proteins but not with the fully glycosylated mature form. This is consistent with the function of calnexin as an ER chaperone. It is noted that the proportion of calnexin association with the hERG channel protein was greater for the N470D mutant than for wild type hERG, indicating that the mutant may have a prolonged association with calnexin. Similar analysis with anti-calreticulin antibody failed to detect any association of calreticulin with hERG channels (data not shown). Interaction of Calnexin with hERG Requires N-linked Glycosylation —Calnexin is a lectin chaperone protein that interacts with glycan moieties of the glycoproteins. To study the role of N-linked glycosylation in the interaction of hERG channels and calnexin, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in cells expressing the N598Q mutant. We have previously shown that the N598Q mutant disrupts N-linked glycosylation of hERG channels (20.Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the N598Q mutant was readily detected in Western blot analysis with anti-hERG antibody, it was not coimmunoprecipitated with calnexin (Fig. 1). This result suggests that N-linked glycosylation at Asn-598 is required for the interaction of calnexin with hERG channels. Prolonged Association of the N470D Mutant with Calnexin—The ER retention of many mutant proteins has been linked to a prolonged association with calnexin (23.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petaja-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Nabi I.R. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6766-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N470D mutant has a prolonged association with calnexin, we performed pulse-chase and sequential immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 2). In these experiments, HEK293 cells expressing either wild type hERG or the N470D mutant were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased with unlabeled methionine/cysteine for various intervals up to 8 h. Following the chase, cell lysates were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin antibody followed by anti-hERG antibody. Calnexin only transiently associated with the immature form of wild type hERG. By 8 h post labeling, none of the wild type hERG was associated with calnexin. By contrast, the N470D mutant had a prolonged association with calnexin with >40% of the labeled protein remaining associated with calnexin at 8 h post labeling. Fig. 2D shows the time course of association of calnexin with wild type hERG and N470D. The estimated half-life of the calnexin interaction with wild type hERG was ∼1 h, whereas the half-life of the calnexin interaction with N470D was ∼6 h. Taken together, these data suggest that the N470D mutant protein was unable to undergo the forward folding reaction in the ER, which results in its prolonged association with calnexin. The prolonged association of the mutant channel with calnexin may contribute to its defective trafficking and ER retention. E-4031 Shortens the Time Course of Association of the N470D Mutant with Calnexin—To study the effects of hERG channel blockers on chaperone interaction of hERG mutant channels, we carried out pulse-chase experiments in the presence of 5 μm E-4031 and performed sequential immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-calnexin antibody followed by anti-hERG antibody as described above. In the presence of E-4031, the time course of the association of calnexin with the N470D mutant was shortened (Fig. 2C) and the half-life of the calnexin interaction with N470D was reduced to ∼1.5 h (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that E-4031 allows the mutant channel to escape the prolonged association with calnexin. Study of hERG Channel Folding by Trypsin Digestion and Detergent Extraction—To determine possible folding defects in hERG mutant channels, we performed trypsin digestion experiments. This method has been used to study protein folding of a variety of membrane proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, aquaporin-2, and P-glycoprotein (26.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34825-34831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The rationale is that if there were differences in folding between wild type hERG and LQT2 mutants, exposure of trypsin-sensitive sites would be different, leading to variation in trypsin sensitivity. Crude membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type hERG or the N470D mutant were treated with various concentrations of trypsin from 0.01 to 1000 μg/ml. The hERG channel proteins were then analyzed by Western blot using anti-hERG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, wild type hERG expressed two protein bands: a lower band of 135 kDa and an upper band of 155 kDa, whereas the N470D mutant expressed primarily the 135-kDa band (5.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 9.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The 135-kDa band represents the core-glycosylated immature form of the channel protein located in the ER, and the 155-kDa band represents the complex-glycosylated mature form of the channel protein located in the plasma membrane (9.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20.Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mature form of wild type hERG was quite resistant to trypsin, requiring >1000 μg/ml for complete digestion. In contrast, the immature forms of wild type hERG and the N470D mutant were much more sensitive to trypsin digestion. They were almost completely digested after treatment with 1–10 μg/ml of trypsin. These results suggest that the core-glycosylated immature forms of both wild type hERG and the N470D mutant are more loosely folded than the complex-glycosylated mature form of wild type hERG. To rule out the possibility that the difference in protease sensitivity is due to differences in the subcellular localization or glycosylation status of two forms of hERG proteins, we performed trypsin digestion experiments in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA). BFA is a fungal metabolite that causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport. As shown in Fig. 4A, 5 μm BFA completely inhibited the trafficking of wild type hERG to the Golgi and the plasma membrane as evidenced by the disappearance of the 155-kDa form at 24 and 30 h after BFA treatment. We therefore treated wild type hERG and the N470D mutant cells with 5 μm BFA for 24 h, and membrane proteins were then isolated and treated with trypsin. Fig. 4B shows that in the presence of BFA, a fraction of the 135-kDa form of wild type hERG exhibited trypsin sensitivity similar to the 155-kDa plasma membrane form. The N470D mutant, however, was still more sensitive to trypsin than wild type hERG, indicating that the increased protease sensitivity in the N470D mutant is not due to subcellular localization or glycosylation status. The second method we used to study folding of the hERG channel protein was detergent extractability. The rationale is that misfolded proteins may aggregate and become resistant to detergent extraction (28.Tamarappoo B.K. Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34825-34831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29.Manganas L.N. Akhtar S. Antonucci D.E. Campomanes C.R. Dolly J.O. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49427-49434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these experiments, cells stably expressing wild type hERG or N470D were tested for solubility in various concentrations of Triton X-100. Supernatant (soluble) and pellet (insoluble) fractions were prepared by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 5, both wild type hERG and the N470D mutant were completely soluble in Triton X-100 at concentrations as low as 0.1%. Similar results were obtained when Nonidet P-40 was used to extract hERG channel protein (data not shown). These data suggest that the N470D mutant does not cause significant aggregation of the hERG channel protein. Effect of E-4031 on the Folding of the N470D Mutant—To study whether hERG channel blocker E-4031 can promote proper folding of the N470D mutant, we treated the cells with 5 μm E-4031 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6, E-4031 treatment rescued the N470D mutant as evidenced by the appearance of the 155-kDa complex-glycosylated mature form. We showed previously that the mature form of N470D is expressed on the cell surface and forms functional hERG channels (21.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Similar to wild type hERG, the mature form of N470D was quite resistant to trypsin, requiring 1000 μg/ml trypsin for complete digestion. The effect of E-4031 on trypsin sensitivity of N470D was independent of subcellular localization, because in the presence of BFA, the core-glycosylated form of N470D had similar trypsin sensitivity to the complex-glycosylated mature form. These results indicate that E-4031 improves folding of N470D even when its trafficking from the ER to the Golgi was blocked by BFA. The present experiments demonstrate that both wild type hERG and the N470D mutant associated with calnexin. The association of hERG channels with calnexin requires N-linked glycosylation. Recently, it has been reported that more than one glycan is needed for efficient trimming of glucose by glucosidase II and, as a consequence, many glycoproteins with a single glycan fail to associate with calnexin (30.Deprez P. Gautschi M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that although hERG contains two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-598 and Asn-629, only Asn-598 is used for glycosylation (20.Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fact that newly synthesized hERG proteins associate with calnexin suggests that a single glycan is sufficient to mediate the interaction with calnexin. Several other glycoproteins with a single glycan, especially membrane proteins such as erythrocyte anion exchanger AE1, V2 vasopressin receptor, and Kv1.2 potassium channel, have been reported to associate with calnexin (25.Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petaja-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Nabi I.R. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6766-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31.Andersson H.

Commun. 2004; 322: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One possibility is that many of these membrane proteins are known to form dimers or tetramers and activation of glucosidase II may occur during oligomerization (14.Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Robinson J.C. Zhou Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25.Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petaja-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M.

The observation that the immature, but not the mature, form of hERG associates with calnexin is consistent with the function of calnexin as an ER chaperone. Calnexin is a lectin chaperone protein that interacts with glycan moieties of the glycoproteins. Calnexin plays an important role in the quality control of glycoproteins in a process termed calnexin cycle. In this process, calnexin associates with glycoproteins that are monoglucosylated intermediates of the N-linked core glycan. The association of calnexin with monoglucosylated glycoproteins is regulated by a cycle of deglucosylation, by glucosidase II, and reglucosylation, by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Because UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase preferentially acts on unfolded proteins, only the incompletely folded proteins reenter the cycle, whereas the properly folded proteins leave the ER and move farther along the secretory pathway. Thus, our results suggest that the wild type hERG channel transiently associates with calnexin during the early stages of biogenesis and dissociates from calnexin when it folds properly. In contrast, the N470D mutant has a prolonged association with calnexin, suggesting that N470D fails to fold properly, is recognized by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, and reenters the calnexin cycle. The interaction of calnexin with voltage-gated potassium channels has been reported in Shaker and Kv1.2 channels (33.Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35.Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). For Shaker channels, calnexin is not involved in the quality control and ER retention of mutant Shaker channels (35.Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). However, transient calnexin interaction confers long-term stability of folded Shaker channel proteins in the ER and promotes surface expression of correctly assembled Shaker channels (36.Khanna R. Lee E.J. Papazian D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2897-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37.Higgins M.K. Demir M. Tate C.G. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2003; 1610: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, calnexin facilitates cell surface expression of Kv1.2 potassium channels (33.Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To study the folding of hERG channels, we performed trypsin digestion experiments. The results show that the immature and mature forms of wild type hERG were different in their sensitivity to digestion by trypsin. The core-glycosylated hERG was ∼100-fold more sensitive to trypsin digestion than the complex-glycosylated mature form. This suggests that the trypsin-sensitive sites are more readily accessible in the core-glycosylated immature form but are probably hidden in the mature form as a result of proper folding. Our results also show that in the presence of BFA, a fraction of the 135-kDa form of wild type hERG is in a folding conformation that is comparable with the 155-kDa mature form even though its trafficking to the Golgi is blocked by BFA. This fraction may represent the properly folded hERG protein that would have trafficked to the cell surface in the absence of BFA. This result suggests that the conformation change from the loosely folded form to the proper folded form occurs in the ER. Defective protein trafficking has been recognized as an important mechanism for an increasing number of inherited human diseases (38.Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 836-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In many cases, trafficking-defective mutant proteins are functional if they can be rescued to their final destinations. Recently, the use of specific ligands as pharmacological chaperones has emerged as a strategy for rescue of trafficking-defective proteins (39.Schulein R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 45-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40.Bernier V. Lagace M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that binding of specific ligands to the unfolded or misfolded proteins promotes correct folding. We and other investigators found that the trafficking-defective LQT2 mutations K28E, T65P, N470D, and G601S can be rescued by hERG channel blockers (21.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 41.Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Collen D. Heidbuchel H. Carmeliet P. Circulation. 2005; 111: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been shown that pharmacological rescue requires binding of the drugs to the inner vestibule of the pore region of the hERG channel (41.Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4989-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our present results show that in the presence of E-4031, the N470D mutant is able to escape the calnexin cycle and exit the ER. Therefore, E-4031 binding may improve proper folding of the mutant channel so that it is no longer a substrate for UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. The protease sensitivity experiments show that the complex-glycosylated mature form of the N470D mutant protein rescued by E-4031 becomes more resistant to trypsin digestion, suggesting that it has a compact conformation that is similar to the mature form of wild type hERG. In addition, the results demonstrate that pharmacological rescue of the N470D mutant by E-4031 is associated with its increased resistance to trypsin even when its trafficking from the ER to the Golgi is blocked by BFA. This indicates that the E-4031-induced conformational changes take place in the ER. LQT2 mutations that can be rescued by hERG channel-blocking agents appear to express small amplitude currents under control conditions (21.Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 41.Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

This observation is consistent with our trypsin-sensitivity findings that the conformation of N470D is similar to wild type folding intermediates in the ER, as both show a similar sensitivity to trypsin. In addition, the fact that both wild type hERG and N470D were completely soluble in 0.1% Triton X-100 in the detergent extraction experiments suggests that the N470D mutant does not cause significant aggregation of the hERG channel protein. Our previous pulse-chase experiments showed that the immature form of wild type hERG can be efficiently converted to the mature form, whereas the immature form of N470D cannot (9.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16.Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Molinari M. Zhou Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This observation indicated that the immature form of wild type hERG is in an incompletely folded intermediate state, which can become the properly folded mature form and traffic to the plasma membrane. However, the presence of the mutation in N470D may result in the formation of a hemodynamic hurdle that inhibits maturation of the mutant channel and consequently causes its ER retention. Taken together, the results from the protease digestion and detergent extraction studies and previous pulse-chase experiments suggest that the N470D mutant is not grossly misfolded but is trapped as partially folded intermediates that are structurally similar to the immature form of wild type protein. Similar findings have been reported for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ΔF508 and mutant P-glycoproteins (26.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the LQT2 mutations that can be rescued by hERG channel blockers may represent a mild phenotype with subtle folding defects and a low efficiency of maturation, and hERG channel-blocking agents may act as pharmacological chaperones to increase the maturation efficiency of these mutant channels by promoting correct folding of channel proteins. The use of pharmacological chaperones to rescue trafficking-defective mutant proteins has been shown in a variety of human diseases (39.Schulein R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 45-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40.Bernier V. Lagace M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, the mechanisms of pharmacological rescue are not fully understood. Our present findings provide evidence that hERG channel blocker E-4031 restores proper folding of trafficking-defective mutant channels and promotes their cell surface expression. Although pharmacological rescue of trafficking-defective mutant channels has potential implications as a therapeutic approach for LQT2 patients, the hERG channel-blocking agents such as E-4031 are not suitable for this purpose. However, elucidating the mechanisms by which E-4031 rescues hERG mutant channels will facilitate the search for new pharmacological chaperones that can restore trafficking of mutant channels without channel-blocking properties."
https://openalex.org/W1981331973,"AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a ubiquitous metabolic sensor that inhibits the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). To determine whether CFTR reciprocally regulates AMPK function in airway epithelia and whether such regulation is involved in lung inflammation, AMPK localization, expression, and activity and cellular metabolic profiles were compared as a function of CFTR status in CF and non-CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. As compared with non-CF HBE cells, CF cells had greater and more diffuse AMPK staining and had greater AMPK activity than their morphologically matched non-CF counterparts. The cellular [AMP]/[ATP] ratio was higher in undifferentiated than in differentiated non-CF cells, which correlated with AMPK activity under these conditions. However, this nucleotide ratio did not predict AMPK activity in differentiating CF cells. Inhibiting channel activity in non-CF cells did not affect AMPK activity or metabolic status, but expressing functional CFTR in CF cells reduced AMPK activity without affecting cellular [AMP]/[ATP]. Therefore, lack of functional CFTR expression and not loss of channel activity in CF cells appears to up-regulate AMPK activity in CF HBE cells, presumably through non-metabolic effects on upstream regulatory pathways. Compared with wild-type CFTR-expressing immortalized CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells, ΔF508-CFTR-expressing CFBE cells had greater AMPK activity and greater secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and the interleukins IL-6 and IL-8. Further pharmacologic AMPK activation inhibited inflammatory mediator secretion in both wild type- and ΔF508-expressing cells, suggesting that AMPK activation in CF airway cells is an adaptive response that reduces inflammation. We propose that therapies to activate AMPK in the CF airway may be beneficial in reducing excessive airway inflammation, a major cause of CF morbidity.

However, many manifestations of CF that cause substantial morbidity and mortality cannot be easily explained by a simple loss of CFTR Cl- channel function, including abnormal regulation of other transport proteins, abnormal lipid metabolism, and excessive inflammation in the CF lung and pancreas (2.Kunzelmann K.

This diversity of CF-associated disorders suggests that CFTR may modulate other cellular pathways through as yet uncharacterized mechanisms. A clearer understanding of the cellular consequences of mislocalized or nonfunctional CFTR is, thus, critically important to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CF. Defective CFTR function in the airway epithelium is responsible for CF lung disease, the most life-threatening complication of CF. The CF airway is characterized by colonization by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and chronic excessive inflammation, causing bronchiectasis and other chronic extensive damage to lung architecture and eventual respiratory failure (3.Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 215-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Whether there is an intrinsic hyperinflammatory state resulting directly from a lack of functional CFTR has been the subject of considerable debate in recent years (7.Koehler D.R. Downey G.P. Sweezey N.B. Tanswell A.K. Hu J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8.Chmiel J.F. Davis P.B. Respir. Res. 2003; 4: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9.Berger M. Allergy Asthma Proc. 2002; 23: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar). There is growing evidence for at least an exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory response to bacterial and other insults (10.Becker M.N. Sauer M.S. Muhlebach M.S. Hirsh A.J. Wu Q. Verghese M.W. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 169: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ribeiro C.M. Paradiso A.M. Schwab U. Perez-Vilar J. Jones L. O'Neal W. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17798-17806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and chain of events causing excessive inflammation are not well understood. Particular inflammatory mediators that have received considerable attention in recent years include pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which are up-regulated in the CF airway and anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, which are down-regulated in the CF airway (9.Berger M. Allergy Asthma Proc. 2002; 23: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Venkatakrishnan A. Stecenko A.A. King G. Blackwell T.R. Brigham K.L. Christman J.W. Blackwell T.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

We recently identified and characterized a novel functional interaction between CFTR and the metabolic sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) through yeast two-hybrid and biochemical approaches (18.Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The catalytic α subunit of AMPK binds to the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal tail of CFTR, shares an overlapping predominantly apical distribution with CFTR in a variety of epithelial tissues, and phosphorylates and inhibits CFTR channel activity predominantly through effects on CFTR gating (19.Hallows K.R. Kobinger G.P. Wilson J.M. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20.Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This AMPK-dependent inhibition of CFTR may provide a mechanism for cellular metabolic status to modulate CFTR function. Because AMPK regulates CFTR function, it is of interest to determine whether CFTR reciprocally modulates AMPK function in epithelia and, if so, whether wild-type and mutant CFTR behave similarly. AMPK is a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase that exists as a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (21.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The activity of AMPK increases during conditions of metabolic stress, in response to elevated intracellular [AMP]/[ATP] ratios. A parallel AMPK activation pathway involves phosphorylation of the α subunit at Thr-172 in its “activation loop” by upstream AMPK kinases (22.Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), which include the LKB1 complex (23.Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G.

Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Other as yet unidentified upstream kinases likely exist (28.Altarejos J.Y. Taniguchi M. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 183-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and further upstream signaling mediators and pathways may be important for nucleotide-independent regulation of AMPK, although the specific mechanisms involved remain obscure (21.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). As a cellular metabolic sensor, AMPK acts on a wide variety of substrates and cellular pathways, including the regulation of metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, cellular glucose uptake, and cholesterol synthesis), signaling pathways involved with inflammation, apoptosis, and the cell cycle, nitric oxide production, transcriptional regulation, and membrane transport (21.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 29.Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 30.Hallows K.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, a disruption in its normal functioning could have broad effects on overall cellular functioning. Specifically, it is plausible that changes in AMPK function associated with CFTR mutations could affect some of the pleiotropic manifestations of CF. Accordingly, we have undertaken studies to examine the role of CFTR in affecting AMPK function using model CF and non-CF human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. We find that the presence or absence of functional CFTR expression in polarized airway epithelial cells significantly modulates AMPK cellular localization, expression, activity, and function. We further demonstrate that AMPK activation may play a beneficial role in reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to excessive CF airway inflammation. Reagents and Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Acros Organics (Fisher) unless otherwise stated. NH2-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged full-length CFTR and GFP alone adenoviral vectors were synthesized, amplified, and purified by the Vector Program of the Gene Therapy Program at the University of Pennsylvania. Mouse monoclonal CFTR antibodies (M3A7 and L12B4) were obtained from Upstate Biotech (Lake Placid, NY). AMPK-α1 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated as described previously (31.Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Cy5-conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibodies against AMPK-α and AMPK-α-Thr(P)-172 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal antibodies against β-actin were obtained from Sigma. The SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) used for in vitro kinase assays was synthesized by the University of Pittsburgh Peptide Synthesis Facility. CFTR-Inh172 was obtained from Calbiochem. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-riboside (AICAR) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada). Cell Growth, Culture, Generation of Stable Cell Lines, and Adenoviral Transduction—HBE cells were isolated from fresh lung transplant specimens as approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, propagated in flasks, and then transferred to 0.33-cm2 Costar Transwell filters and grown at an air-liquid interface, as described previously (32.Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six of the 10 CF HBE cell lines were from patients who were homozygous for the ΔF508 CF mutation, and the remaining lines were from compound heterozygotes who had one ΔF508 allele along with a Class I or III mutation in the other allele, including G542X, W1282X, and G551D (one each); one mutation was unknown. At least three independent tissue samples were used for all analyses with primary airway cells. Cells were used for study while undifferentiated (within 2 weeks of seeding at air-liquid interface) or when fully differentiated. Differentiation status was assessed by phase microscopy to assure reproducible differentiation states. Undifferentiated cells were morphologically squamous and had no discernible cilia by phase microscopy or tubulin staining. Cells were considered differentiated only when the cells were uniformly columnar in shape and >25% of the cells had appreciable cilia by phase microscopy. Only morphologically matched non-CF and CF cells were used for comparative analyses between wild-type and mutant CFTR-expressing cells. A previous study of cells grown and studied under these conditions demonstrated insignificant differences in transepithelial resistance between non-CF and CF cells (32.Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parental CFBE41o- cells (33.Bruscia E. Sangiuolo F. Sinibaldi P. Goncz K.K. Novelli G. Gruenert D.C. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (34.Lei D.C. Kunzelmann K. Koslowsky T. Yezzi M.J. Escobar L.C. Xu Z. Ellison A.R. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.C. Tykocinski M. Gruenert D.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 427-436PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR cDNA was stably introduced into CFBE41o- cells, as recently described (35.Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Wakefield J. Parker W. Li Y. Varga K. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 601-615Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The biochemical, morphological, and electrophysiological properties of these cell lines have been well characterized (35.Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Wakefield J. Parker W. Li Y. Varga K. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 601-615Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For transduction of polarized CF HBE cells with adenoviral vectors expressing either GFP-CFTR or GFP alone, well differentiated cells grown for at least 4 weeks on filters were first washed apically in warm PBS and then exposed to PBS containing 15 mm sodium caprate for 5-10 min to temporarily disrupt tight junctions, as described previously (36.Coyne C.B. Kelly M.M. Boucher R.C. Johnson L.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 500 diluted in PBS was then added to the apical side and incubated for 2 h in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator. The recombinant adenovirus was removed, and fresh growth medium was added to the basolateral chamber. Filters were observed by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression and used for experimentation 4-5 days after infection. Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Polarized CF and non-CF HBE cells grown on 0.33-cm2 filters were immunofluorescently stained as follows with all steps and solutions at room temperature. Cell monolayers were washed once in PBS and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. They were washed again in PBS and then permeabilized by addition of PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After an additional wash with PBS, primary antibodies diluted in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin (M3A7 and L12B4 each at 1:1000 (cf. Ref. 37.Picciano J.A. Ameen N. Grant B.D. Bradbury N.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) mixed with AMPK-α antiserum at 1:100) were added for 2 h. After another wash with PBS, secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG each at 1:500) along with Cy5-conjugated phalloidin (at 1:250) mixed in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin were added and incubated in the dark. After a final wash in PBS, the filters were cut from the support and mounted on a slide with a thin coverslip. Slides were stored at 4 °C in the dark before confocal microscopy. Confocal imaging was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal laser scanning microscope with the following settings: 60× oil immersion objective lens, 3 channels at excitation/emission settings optimized for fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, and Cy5, 1024 × 1024 pixels per image, 124-μm pinhole diameter, and 0.45-μm z-step intervals. Identical photomultiplier voltage and gain settings were used for all images shown of both cell types. MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA) was employed for xz reconstruction of xy-plane images. TIFF xy-plane images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 to quantitate and compare subcellular AMPK-α1 localization in CF and non-CF cells. Specifically, the outlines of individual cells were defined as regions of interest within each slice, and the slices encompassing the full thickness of each analyzed cell were determined. The total integrated signal for each cell slice, determined from the product of the mean red pixel intensity and the number of pixels within the cell slice, was summed up for all slices, yielding a total integrated signal for the cell. Cell slices were then sorted into four equal quartiles in the z-dimension from the apical to basolateral side of the cell, and the fraction of total cellular staining found in each quartile was calculated. This analysis was performed on 20 cells total from three separate cell lines derived from ΔF508 homozygous CF and non-CF patients, and the relative staining by quartile was compared across the two conditions. Real-time PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was employed using Taqman technology for analysis of relative AMPK-α1 or -α2 gene expression levels. Total RNA was purified from CF and non-CF HBE cell lysates (two 0.33-cm2 Transwell filters per condition) using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA (RT reaction) was synthesized from 500 ng of RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. A negative control was also performed without enzyme (NRT reaction). RT and NRT reactions were also performed on 500 ng of commercially prepared liver RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) to serve as the calibrator for the Taqman reactions. Triplicate aliquots of the RT reaction and duplicate aliquots of the NRT reaction served as templates for the AMPK-α1 and -α2 subunit genes (PRKAA1 and PRKAA2) and the β-glucuronidase control gene (GUSB). Reaction components, including the ROC internal control, were obtained from Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI). The probes and primers for PRKAA1, PRKAA2, and GUSB were also obtained from Applied Biosystems (Assays on Demand numbers Hs00178893_m1, Hs00178903_m1, and Hs99999908_m1, respectively). The real-time PCR reactions were run on an ABI7000 sequence detection system with the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 12 min, then (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min) × 40 cycles. Differential gene expression was calculated by the ΔΔCT calculation (38.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (129209) Google Scholar). Unlike calculations based on standard curves, the ΔΔCT method controls for potential differences in efficiency of the RT reactions as well as the PCR. Immunoblotting and Quantitation of AMPK Expression—Cells grown on at least two 0.33-cm2 filters per condition were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed as described previously for AMPK in vitro kinase assays (20.Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After pooling lysates from duplicate filters, pelleting the lysates, and measuring protein concentrations of the supernatants, equal amounts of cellular protein per lane were loaded on a 4-12% gradient gel (NuPage, Invitrogen) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk or 1% bovine serum albumin, and immunoblotting was performed using AMPK-α (1:1000), AMPK-α-Thr(P)-172 (1:750), or β-actin (1:1000) primary antibodies. Secondary donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at 1:5000. Intensities of all relevant bands corrected for local background intensity on the blot were quantitated using a VersaDoc Imager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). In Vitro AMPK Activity Measurements—Polarized HBE cells grown on 0.33-cm2 filters were lysed in AMPK lysis buffer (20.Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the lysates from 5-7 identical filters were pooled for each kinase assay. After immunoprecipitation of AMPK-α from cell lysates, AMPK activity in the cellular lysate samples was measured using the SAMS peptide in vitro kinase assay, as described previously (20.Hallows K.R.

Kung J.T. Dalal S.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cellular Nucleotide Analysis—Samples for analysis were obtained from HBE cells grown on 5-7 0.33-cm2 Transwell filters per condition. Before lysis, the medium was aspirated, and the cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Extraction was performed by scraping the cells in each filter with 5 μl of ice-cold acetonitrile followed by 15 μl of cold water (39.Au J.L. Su M.H. Wientjes M.G. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The soluble and precipitated fractions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at -20 °C. The supernatant fraction was stored at -80 °C. The pellet was solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and the protein content was analyzed using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The HPLC column used was a 4-μm Nova-Pack C18 cartridge (100 mm × 8 mm inner diameter) equipped with a radial compression chamber (Waters, Millford, MA). The buffer consisted of 20% acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium phosphate and 2 mm PIC-A ion pairing reagent (Waters) and was run isocratically at 2 ml/min (40.Dagher P.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Grune T. Siems W. Gerber G. Tikhonov Y.V. Pimenov A.M. Toguzov R.T. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 563: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Samples were gassed for 10 min with N2 to evaporate acetonitrile and then diluted with 10-15 μl of ice-cold water depending on the retrieved volume from each dish. The injection volume varied between 75 and 90 μl, again depending on the retrieved volume. An HP LC-MS and Chemstation model 1100 were used (Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) with the UV detector set at 254 nm. HPLC grade nucleotide standards were used to calibrate the signals and identify peaks, which were integrated by the software. Standards were run daily because the retention of the column varied with time. Internal standards were occasionally added to the samples to test recovery. It exceeded 90% for all nucleotides. Short Circuit Current Measurements—Short circuit current measurements were performed as described previously (20.Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Modified Ussing chambers designed to accept 0.33-cm2 Transwells were used (42.Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ringer's solution was used in both the apical and basolateral chambers and contained 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm d-glucose. As measured by periodic ±5 mV pulses away from the continuous clamp at 0 mV, polarized HBE cell monolayers had base-line transepithelial resistance values ranging from 800 to 2000 ohm-cm2. Inflammatory Mediator Expression Analysis—Apical supernatant samples (50-μl aliquots) were taken from each filter growing polarized CFBE cells and frozen for subsequent analysis using the human cytokine Lincoplex kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) run on a Bio-Plex suspension array system (Bio-Rad), as previously described (43.McAllister F. Henry A. Kreindler J.L. Dubin P.J. Ulrich L. Steele C. Finder J.D. Pilewski J.M. Carreno B.M. Goldman S.J. Pirhonen J. Kolls J.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the Bio-Plex manager software and exported to Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis. We have previously found that AMPK binds to and phosphorylates CFTR and inhibits CFTR currents in polarized colonic and lung epithelial cells (18.Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A.

This AMPK-CFTR functional interaction may afford the coupling of ion transport to cellular metabolic status (30.Hallows K.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and raises the question of whether changes in the normal function or expression of CFTR, as occur in the CF airway, may modulate AMPK function. AMPK is involved in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, including metabolic, inflammatory, growth, apoptotic, and gene transcriptional (21.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24A"
https://openalex.org/W1978427676,"Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway in mammalian cells and plays a key role in the activation of numerous nucleoside analogues used in anti-cancer and antiviral chemotherapy. Although compelling evidence indicated that dCK activity might be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, direct demonstration was lacking. Here we showed that dCK overexpressed in HEK 293T cells was labeled after incubating the cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Sorbitol, which was reported to decrease dCK activity, also decreased the labeling of dCK. These results indicated that dCK may exist as a phosphoprotein in vivo and that its activity can be correlated with its phosphorylation level. After purification of 32P-labeled dCK, digestion by trypsin, and analysis of the radioactive peptides by tandem mass spectrometry, the following four in vivo phosphorylation sites were identified: Thr-3, Ser-11, Ser-15, and Ser-74, the latter being the major phosphorylation site. Site-directed mutagenesis and use of an anti-phospho-Ser-74 antibody demonstrated that Ser-74 phosphorylation was crucial for dCK activity in HEK 293T cells, whereas phosphorylation of other identified sites did not seem essential. Phosphorylation of Ser-74 was also detected on endogenous dCK in leukemic cells, in which the Ser-74 phosphorylation state was increased by agents that enhanced dCK activity. Our study provided direct evidence that dCK activity can be controlled by phosphorylation in intact cells and highlights the importance of Ser-74 for dCK activity.

Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK 4The abbreviations used are: dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; 32P, [32P]orthophosphate; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; CdA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine; λ-PP, protein phosphatase; UV, ultraviolet; WT, wild-type. ; EC 2.7.1.74) catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine, with ATP or UTP as phosphoryl donor. This reaction is the rate-limiting step of the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway that supplies cells with precursors of DNA as an alternative to de novo synthesis (1Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In addition, dCK initiates the activation of several chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogues, such as 1-β-d-arabinosylcytosine (cytarabine), 9-β-d-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (fludarabine), and 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (CdA, cladribine), commonly used in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine), active against solid malignant tumors (2Plunkett W.

The anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (zalcitabine) and 2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine (lamivudine) are also phosphorylated by dCK (5De Clercq E. J. Clin. Virol. 2004; 30: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these inactive pro-drugs by dCK is a prerequisite for their pharmacological action, as demonstrated by the resistance of cells lacking dCK activity to nucleoside analogues (6Carson D.A. Wasson D.B. Kaye J. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Robins R.K. Montgomery J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Verhoef V. Sarup J.

Moreover, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies indicated a positive correlation between dCK activity and nucleoside analogue sensitivity (10Kawasaki H. Carrera C.J. Piro L.D. Saven A. Kipps T.J.

Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), which explains the clinical success of nucleoside analogues against lymphoproliferative disorders, such as hairy cell leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (16Goodman G.R.

Because dCK plays an essential role in the therapeutic efficacy of nucleoside analogues, identification of mechanisms that control dCK activity is of particular interest. In recent years, several genotoxic agents, including DNA polymerase and topoisomerase II inhibitors, UV light, γ-irradiation, and nucleoside analogues such as CdA, have been shown to activate dCK in human normal or leukemic lymphocytes (18Sasvari-Szekely M.

Activation of dCK by these agents could not be explained by allosteric effects or by a change in dCK protein levels, suggesting that dCK activity might be regulated by reversible covalent modification, e.g. via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Accordingly, the activity of dCK in extracts of normal or leukemic lymphocytes was markedly decreased on treatment with λ-protein phosphatase (23Csapo Z. Keszler G. Safrany G. Spasokoukotskaja T. Talianidis I. Staub M. Sasvari-Szekely M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or protein phosphatase 2A (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also, further studies indicated that dCK might be dephosphorylated in vivo by protein phosphatase 2A (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, dCK activity was surprisingly enhanced by several cell-permeable protein kinase inhibitors in various types of leukemic cells (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and decreased by hyperosmotic stress, known to induce extensive changes in several cell signaling pathways (23Csapo Z. Keszler G. Safrany G. Spasokoukotskaja T. Talianidis I. Staub M. Sasvari-Szekely M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite all the evidence suggesting that dCK is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, direct demonstration was lacking. To verify that dCK is indeed phosphorylated, human dCK was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells as a His-tagged fusion protein. Following incubation of the cells with [32P]orthophosphate and purification of dCK, four phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides. Phosphorylation of Ser-74, the most 32P-labeled site in vivo, was found to be crucial for dCK activity in HEK 293T cells. In addition, data obtained in CCRF-CEM cells showed that Ser-74 phosphorylation could also be important for dCK activity in leukemic cells. Materials—Sequencing-grade trypsin was purchased from Promega. HPLC-grade solvents and acids were from Acros Organics. Phosphate-free DMEM, pEF6/His expression vector, and T4 DNA ligase were from Invitrogen. Primers for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis were from Eurogentec (Ougrée, Belgium). Reverse transcriptase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Taq polymerase were from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Pwo polymerase and restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. Other chemicals, materials, and reagents were from Sigma, Calbiochem, or Bio-Rad. Cell Culture—HEK 293T cells, kindly provided by Prof. J. Van Lint (Department of Biochemistry, Katholiek Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium), were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm ultraglutamine in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. CCRF-CEM cells, a human T-acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line, were cultured as described elsewhere (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The coding region of dCK from human CCRF-CEM lymphoblasts was amplified by PCR and first cloned in pBluescript II SK(+) vector for DNA sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen midiprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Wild type constructs were used as a template (20 ng) to create single mutations by PCR (T3A/T3E, S11A/S11E, S15A/S15E, and S74A/S74E). The complete dCK coding region of all plasmids was sequenced on a CEQ2000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter) to verify the newly introduced mutations and the absence of random mutations. The dCK cDNA was then subcloned into the eukaryotic pEF6/His vector between the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites for expression of normal or mutated polyhistidine fusion proteins with a His6 tag at the N-terminal position. Transfection and Purification of Recombinant dCK—For transient transfections, 1.5 × 106 HEK 293T cells were plated in 8.5-cm dishes and transfected the following day by the jetPEI procedure (PolyPlus Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and by using 8 μg of plasmid DNA. After 48 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in lysis buffer (buffer A) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1 mm p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and anti-pain), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were lysed by one cycle of freeze-thawing. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were loaded on a Talon (Co2+) affinity column (Clontech). After three washings with buffer B containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors, and 300 mm NaCl, followed by two washings with buffer B supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, recombinant dCK was eluted with buffer B devoid of NaCl but containing 150 mm imidazole. Depending on the experiment, the purified protein was stored at -80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol, concentrated by ultrafiltration, precipitated with chloroform/methanol (25Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), or boiled in Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer. Protein Phosphatase Treatment of Cell Extracts—For dephosphorylation experiments, cell lysis was carried out in buffer A devoid of protein phosphatase inhibitors. Samples containing ∼15 μg of cell protein were incubated at 30 °C with or without λ-protein phosphatase, as described previously (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After 1 h, 10-μl aliquots were taken for the measurement of dCK activity. Western blotting with anti-poly(His) antibody was also performed on 1 μg of cell protein extract. dCK Assay—HEK 293T cell extracts were prepared as described above. Extraction of CCRF-CEM cells and dCK assay was performed as reported previously (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using 4–40 μg of cell extract protein or 20–200 ng of purified dCK for the measure of activity. Except for determining the Km value for deoxycytidine, dCK activity was measured under Vmax conditions, with 10 μm deoxycytidine and 5 mm ATP in the assays. The protein content of samples was measured by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) by using bovine serum albumin as standard. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-dCK antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of human dCK (amino acids 246–260) was generated by Eurogentec, according to the procedure of Hatzis et al. (27Hatzis P. Al-Madhoon A.S. Jullig M. Petrakis T.G. Eriksson S. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30239-30243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Anti-poly(His) monoclonal antibody was from GE Healthcare. Anti-phospho-Ser-74 antibody was raised in New Zealand White rabbits injected with a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 68–79 of human dCK with an N-terminal cysteine (CEELTMpSQKNGG), for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For immunoblot analysis, HEK 293T cell lysates (1–5 μg) or purified dCK (50–100 ng) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in gels containing 12% (w/v) acrylamide and transferred to Hybond C-extra membranes (GE Healthcare, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). Membranes were blocked in PBS with 5% (w/v) fat-free milk powder and probed with either anti-poly(His) monoclonal antibody (1/2000), anti-phospho-Ser-74 antibody (1/1000), or anti-dCK antibody (1/1000) in PBS-T (Tween 0.1%, w/v) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000). After further extensive washing in PBS-T, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Quantification of dCK expression or phosphorylation was carried out by using National Institutes of Health image software. In Vivo Labeling with [32P]Orthophosphate—HEK 293T cells were cultured and transfected as described above. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 3.5 h with the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free; GE Healthcare) (4 mCi/dish, 670 μCi/ml). Four dishes were used for each experiment. Labeling was stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of buffer A. dCK was purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography as described above, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and subjected to SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Alternatively, dCK was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-poly(His) antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Immune complexes were washed six times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, and three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 0.1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Phosphorylation Site Identification by Tandem Mass Spectrometry— For in vivo phosphorylation site analysis, HEK 293T cells were labeled as described above, except that cells were preincubated for 1 h with 0.5 m sorbitol and washed before labeling and that the latter was performed in the presence of 0.5 μm okadaic acid. After purification by affinity chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and Colloidal Blue staining, bands corresponding to dCK were cut from the gel and chopped into 1-mm cubes. The gel pieces were washed, reduced with dithiothreitol, and treated with iodoacetamide prior the tryptic digestion and a two-step extraction of peptides (28Woods A. Vertommen D. Neumann D. Turk R. Bayliss J. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carling D. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28434-28442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The yield of radioactivity in the two-step extraction was about 80% as determined by 32P counting by Cerenkov radiation. Labeled tryptic peptides obtained from 4 dishes of 32P-labeled HEK 293T cells were then mixed with peptides from 10 dishes of unlabeled HEK 293T cells using exactly the same protocol. The combined extracts were concentrated to about 20 μl in a SpeedVac® concentrator, and trifluoroacetic acid was added to a concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Peptides were separated by reverse-phase narrow-bore HPLC at a flow rate of 200 μl/min (28Woods A. Vertommen D. Neumann D. Turk R. Bayliss J. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carling D. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28434-28442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The radioactivity of each fraction was measured by Cerenkov counting. Radioactive peaks were concentrated to about 10 μl, mixed with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, desalted using a Ziptip C18 pipette tip (Millipore), eluted in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid, and analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS/MS) in an LCQ Deca XP Plus ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Spectra were taken in full MS and Zoom scan mode to determine parent ion monoisotopic masses and their charge states. The source voltage was set at 0.8 kV, and the collision-induced dissociation energy was adjusted to the minimum needed for fragmentation. Phosphopeptides were identified in MS2 mode by the loss of H3PO4 (98 Da) under low collision-induced dissociation energy, and the phosphorylated residue was pinpointed in MS3 mode. Data Analysis—All experiments have been repeated two or more times. The results of experiments repeated at least three times are given as the means ± S.E. Significance was estimated by the paired two-tailed Student’s t test. Properties of Human dCK Overexpressed in HEK 293T Cells—The activity of dCK measured after overexpression as a His tag fusion protein in HEK 293T cells was 500–1000-fold higher than in nontransfected cells. A one-step purification of (His)6dCK by affinity chromatography gave a major 34-kDa band in Coomassie Blue-stained gels that was recognized following immunoblotting with anti-poly(His) antibody (data not shown). This molecular mass, somewhat greater than that of 30.5 kDa established by Chottiner et al. (29Chottiner E.G. Shewach D.S. Datta N.S. Ashcraft E. Gribbin D. Ginsburg D. Fox I.H. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1531-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) for the dCK subunit, is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the polyhistidine-tagged recombinant fusion protein (34.3 kDa). Size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-200) gave a single peak of dCK activity eluting with a molecular mass of 68 kDa, indicating that the active form of recombinant dCK is a dimer (result not shown), as reported for the native enzyme (30Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Kmvalue of purified recombinant (His)6dCK for deoxycytidine, with 5 mm ATP as co-substrate, was 0.16 ± 0.01 μm (n = 3), in agreement with values reported previously for dCK expressed in bacteria (31Johansson M. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Extracts of HEK 293T cells were incubated with λ-protein phosphatase, which led to a marked (∼ 85%) decrease in dCK activity (Fig. 1A), as observed previously for the native enzyme from normal (21Csapo Z. Sasvari-Szekely M. Spasokoukotskaja T. Talianidis I. Eriksson S. Staub M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or leukemic human lymphocytes (24Smal C. Cardoen S. Bertrand L. Delacauw A. Ferrant A. Van den Berghe G. Van Den Neste E. Bontemps F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, this drop in activity was accompanied by a slight increase in electrophoretic migration of the recombinant protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1B), as often observed for nonphosphorylated versus phosphorylated proteins. These results indicated that the activity of dCK expressed in eukaryotic cells could be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In Vivo Phosphorylation of dCK—To verify that dCK was phosphorylated in vivo, HEK 293T cells expressing recombinant dCK were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 3.5 h to label the intracellular ATP pool and also phosphoproteins. Purification of dCK by affinity chromatography, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2), revealed labeling of a 34-kDa band. This labeled band corresponds to the major band revealed by Colloidal Blue staining and to the band recognized by the monoclonal anti-poly(His) antibody, indicating that the labeled band was indeed recombinant dCK. The phosphorylation of a protein is considered to be physiologically relevant, when modification of its 32P labeling occurs in parallel with a change in function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of hyperosmotic stress, which has been shown to decrease dCK activity in human lymphocytes (23Csapo Z. Keszler G. Safrany G. Spasokoukotskaja T. Talianidis I. Staub M. Sasvari-Szekely M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were treated with or without 0.5 m sorbitol for 1 h before the end of the incubation with [32P]orthophosphate, and dCK was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-poly(His) antibody followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The amount of immunoprecipitated protein was similar in sorbitol-treated and in untreated cells, as assessed by Colloidal Blue staining. By contrast, autoradiography revealed that the labeling of the band corresponding to recombinant dCK was markedly reduced after sorbitol treatment, which led to a decrease in dCK activity (72% in this experiment; Fig. 3B). These data suggest that dCK activity can be controlled by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in intact cells. Identification of in Vivo Phosphorylation Sites in dCK—Before incubation with [32P]orthophosphate, HEK 293T cells were treated for 1 h with 0.5 m sorbitol which was then washed out. In addition, okadaic acid was included during the incubation with [32P]orthophosphate to inhibit protein phosphatases. This strategy would be expected to increase 32P incorporation as the procedure resulted in a recovered dCK activity that was 1.5-fold higher than the initial activity. Radiolabeled dCK was purified by affinity chromatography and digested with trypsin. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and fractions were counted by emission of Cerenkov radiation. Several radioactive peaks were detected, indicating the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites in the recombinant protein (Fig. 4). Five labeled peaks (I to V) were observed, with peak I appearing in the flow-through fraction. Except for peak I, each radioactive peak was screened for phosphopeptides by neutral loss of H3PO4 (98 Da) by nano-ESI-MS/MS. Peak II contained a phosphopeptide consistent with a single phosphate addition to a predicted tryptic fragment of the N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged portion of dCK (Table 1). The first two amino acids of this fragment, aspartate and proline, belong to the expression vector pEF6/His and are followed by Ala-2 of dCK; the initial methionine was absent because of the introduction of a BamHI restriction site in the dCK cDNA. The sequence of the tryptic peptide was confirmed by fragmentation, and the phosphorylated residue was identified as Thr-3. Peak III corresponded to a tryptic peptide of dCK containing two phosphates. Fragmentation of the tryptic peptide identified Ser-11 and Ser-15 as the phosphorylated residues. The tryptic peptide present in peak III was detected with four different monoisotopic masses (Table 1) because of alkylation of Cys-9 by iodoacetamide, covalent modification of this residue by acrylamide, or the presence of one or two phosphates. In peak IV, no phosphopeptide was detected, possibly because of poor ionization or because of ion suppression by other peptides in this fraction. By contrast, a phosphopeptide was detected in peak V, and Ser-74 was identified as the phosphorylated residue (Table 1). This phosphopeptide was also present with different isotopic masses because of acrylamide modification of Cys-59 or its alkylation by iodoacetamide and oxidation of Met-73.TABLE 1Sequences of dCK phosphopeptides determined by nano-ESI-MS/MS Labeled (His)6dCK HPLC peaks (Fig. 4) were analyzed by nano-ESI-MS/MS. Phosphopeptides were identified by loss of 98 Da upon collision-induced dissociation, and the phosphorylated residue was further identified by fragmentation in MS3 mode. c, acrylamide(propionoamido)-modified cysteine or iodoacetamide (carboxamidomethyl)-modified cysteine; p, phosphorylated residue; Mox, oxidized Met; ND, not detected.PeptideMeasured average masses [M + H+]Theoretical monoisotopic masses [M + H+]SequencesII961.3961.4pEF6/HisDPA2pTPPKR7III1452.5; 1466.4; 1532.4; 1546.21452.5; 1466.5; 1532.5; 1546.58ScPpSFSApSSEGTR20IVNDV2455.8; 2472.02456.0; 2470.058WcNVQSTQDEFEELTMoxpSQK76 Open table in a new tab In summary, analysis of HPLC-purified peptides by nano-ESI-MS/MS indicated that recombinant dCK was phosphorylated in vivo on at least four residues, Thr-3, Ser-11, Ser-15, and Ser-74. The relative labeling of the HPLC peaks was calculated in three separate experiments. Calculation of the percentage of total 32P incorporation into each peak indicated that the major in vivo phosphorylation site of dCK was Ser-74 (peak V, 44.6 ± 6.2%), followed by Thr-3 (peak II, 10.9 ± 5.7%), and Ser-11/Ser-15 (peak III, 9.9 ± 1.7%). Peaks I and IV represented 22.3 ± 8.9 and 10.3 ± 3.7% of total 32P incorporation, respectively. It is noteworthy that the sequence surrounding Ser-74 is well conserved between human and other species (>66% identity) with dCK sequences from mouse, frog, chicken, and two fish, whereas the phosphorylation site sequences located in the N-terminal region of dCK are less conserved (Table 2).

The ClpC form of HSP100 is an essential, highly conserved, constitutively expressed protein in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts, and yet little is known regarding its specific activity as a molecular chaperone. To address this point, ClpC from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (SyClpC) was purified using an Escherichia coli-based overexpression system. Recombinant SyClpC showed basal ATPase activity, similar to that of other types of HSP100 protein in non-photosynthetic organisms but different to ClpC in Bacillus subtilis. SyClpC also displayed distinct intrinsic chaperone activity in vitro, first by preventing aggregation of unfolded polypeptides and second by resolubilizing and refolding aggregated proteins into their native structures. The refolding activity of SyClpC was enhanced 3-fold in the presence of the B. subtilis ClpC adaptor protein MecA. Overall, the distinctive ClpC protein in photosynthetic organisms indeed functions as an independent molecular chaperone, and it is so far unique among HSP100 proteins in having both “holding” and disaggregase chaperone activities without the need of other chaperones or adaptor proteins.

Overall, the distinctive ClpC protein in photosynthetic organisms indeed functions as an independent molecular chaperone, and it is so far unique among HSP100 proteins in having both “holding” and disaggregase chaperone activities without the need of other chaperones or adaptor proteins. The cell of photosynthetic organisms is an ever-changing environment and is one in which the control of protein activity and interactions is of utter importance. To cope with this dynamic situation, all living cells have evolved surveillance systems that include a network of molecular chaperones and proteases. Chaperones interact transiently with hydrophobic residues exposed in unfolded polypeptides to facilitate their correct folding, prevent protein aggregation, and translocate them across cell membranes (1Feldman D.E. Frydman J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Chaperones are vital not only during normal growth as housekeeping enzymes but also under severe stress conditions to maintain cell viability. They function as either solitary enzymes or in concert with other chaperones, while a few also act with a proteolytic partner to degrade proteins that have become terminally damaged and thus beyond repair (2Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). HSP100 is a highly conserved family of molecular chaperones that consists of several subtypes: ClpA-E and L (Class I), and ClpX-Y (Class II). Despite variations in size and gene structure, Class 1 proteins all have two distinct ATP-binding domains, also known as AAA modules (3Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). ClpA is found only in Gram-negative eubacteria like Escherichia coli, ClpB in most eubacteria and eukaryotes, ClpC in cyanobacteria, plants, and most Gram-positive eubacteria, ClpD exclusively in plants, and ClpE and ClpL in certain Gram-positive eubacteria. Class II proteins have only a single AAA module. ClpX is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, whereas ClpY is restricted to certain bacteria (3Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In general, HSP100 chaperones have a protein unfolding activity dependent on ATP hydrolysis. ClpB promotes protein disaggregation by extracting aggregated proteins by unfolding and then delivering them to the DnaK chaperone system for refolding (4Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben Zvi A.

Chem. 2004; 28: 29139-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As components of the Clp protease, E. coli ClpA and ClpX unfold targeted native protein substrates and translocate them into the proteolytic ClpP chamber for degradation (6Hoskins J.R. Pak M.

(Tokyo). 1998; 333: 671-676Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A similar mode of action is shared by ClpY (HslU), transferring unfolded protein substrates into the adjacent ClpQ (HslV) proteolytic core (8Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S. McKay D.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although Clp proteins are found throughout nature, those in photosynthetic organisms are by far the most numerous and diverse (9Clarke A.K. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 1999; 83: 593-599Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At least 23 distinct Clp proteins exist in the genome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, while 10 exist in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (10Clarke A.K. MacDonald T.M. Sjögren L.L.E. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 406-412Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Multiple paralogs also occur for many of the different types of Clp proteins, as exemplified by the proteolytic subunits, with three ClpP paralogs in Synechococcus and six in A. thaliana (11Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 12Clarke A.K. Schelin J. Porankiewicz J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of these many Clp proteins, the constitutive ClpC protein is one of the most functionally important, being essential for cell viability in both cyanobacteria and plants (13Clarke A.K. Eriksson M-J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Sjögren L.L.E. MacDonald T.M. Sutinen S. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is also highly conserved, with the chloroplast-localized ClpC protein being ca. 90% similar to the orthologs in cyanobacteria (15Zheng B. Halperin T. Hruskova-Heidingsfeldova O. Adam Z. Clarke A.K. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 114: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By analogy to other HSP100 proteins, ClpC in photobionts is believed to act as a chaperone both independently and as a regulatory subunit within Clp proteases, although as yet little experimental evidence supports this assumption. Many of the features for ClpC in photobionts differ markedly from the orthologs in Gram-positive bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, ClpC is not essential for normal growth (16Krüger E. Völker U. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Msadek T. Kunst F. Rapoport G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5788-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and is instead a general stress protein critical for growth at high temperatures, as well as being necessary for certain developmental processes such as genetic competence and sporulation (17Msadek T. Kunst F. Rapoport G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5788-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of B. subtilis ClpC (BsClpC) 3The abbreviations used are: BsClpC, Bacillus subtilis ClpC protein; SyClpC, Synechococcus elongatus ClpC protein; Sce, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; CBD, chitin-binding domain; SyClpS1, Synechococcus elongatus ClpS1 protein; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; KJE, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE proteins; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); BSA, bovine serum albumin. relies on specific adaptor proteins known as MecA, which both target specific protein substrates to BsClpC and activate its ATPase activity (18Turgay K. Hamoen L.W. Venema G. Dubnau D. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Persuh M. Mandic-Mulec I. Dubnau D. J.

A. 2003; 100: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The need for such adaptors also occurs for other HSP100 proteins. In E. coli, ClpX requires RssB to target the starvation sigma factor σS for degradation (21Muffler A. Fischer D. Altuvia S. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), as well as the SspB adaptor for enhancing the binding and degradation of SsrA-tagged polypeptides (22Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Similarly in E. coli, the adaptor ClpS modulates the substrate specificity of ClpA (23Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the current dearth of information regarding the chaperone activity of ClpC in photosynthetic organisms, we purified the full-length ClpC from the model cyanobacterium S. elongatus (SyClpC) using an E. coli-based overexpression system. The purified recombinant protein exhibited significant basal ATPase activity, as well as functioned as a molecular chaperone without the need of additional chaperones or adaptor proteins. SyClpC was also shown to stabilize unfolded polypeptides and prevent their aggregation, as well as resolubilize protein aggregates and restore their native enzymatic activity. Purification of SyClpC—The Synechococcus clpC gene (2520 bp) was amplified from genomic DNA with the high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using primers with SapI and PstI restriction sites for directional cloning. The digested clpC gene was ligated into pIMC104 (IMPACT, New England Biolabs) in-frame to the 3′ end of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce) VMA1 intein gene with an internal chitin-binding domain (CBD). The resulting plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain DH5α. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 10-liter LB cultures (+0.2% glucose, 50 mg ml–1 carbenicillin) to an A600 of 0.6–0.7, and then moved to 15 °C. After 1 h, IPTG (0.3 mm final concentration) was added and the culture left overnight (∼15 h) at 15 °C. After induction, cells were pelleted (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and then resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine). Cells were ruptured using a French Press (2.5 atm), and the soluble cell fraction was collected after centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The soluble cell extract was then loaded onto a 100-ml chitin affinity column (New England Biolabs). To minimize nonspecific binding the column was washed overnight at 4 °C with 300 ml of buffer A, followed by 300 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm benzamidine). Cleavage of the bound fusion protein was initiated by loading the column with buffer B containing 80 mm DTT and then left at 4 °C for 3 days. The first fraction of cleaved SyClpC protein was then eluted, and another column volume of buffer B at pH 8.5 with 80 mm DTT was added to cleave the remaining bound fusion protein, which was later collected after another 3 days. Both SyClpC fractions were pooled and purified further by anion exchange chromatography (Hi Prep 16/10 QxL, Amersham Biosciences) (24Riggs P. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Greene Publishing Association Inc., New York1990: 1-14Google Scholar). The eluted SyClpC fraction was then purified on a gel filtration column (Hi Load Superdex 16/60, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 260 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The SyClpC fraction was detected on a 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) stained with SimplyBlue safestain (Invitrogen). The final purified protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, and 30% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce), with the concentration of SyClpC used in each assay based on a hexameric conformation. Purification of ClpS1—The full-length Synechococcus clpS1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the high fidelity pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with primers containing BamHI and HindIII restriction sites to facilitate directional cloning. The digested PCR product was ligated into the N-terminal His6-vector PQE-80L (Qiagen) in-frame with the 3′-end of the His-tag. The ligation product was transformed into TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the clpS1 insert being sequenced to verify its integrity. Cells expressing the His-tagged ClpS1 protein (SyClpS1) were grown as described above. IPTG was added (0.4 mm) and cultures left for 5 h at 16 °C to induce protein expression. Afterward, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), resuspended in buffer D (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 5 mm DTT) and ruptured in a French Press (1000 atm). The soluble cell extract was collected after centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and then loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the column with buffer D, SyClpS1 was eluted with buffer E (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 5 mm DTT). SyClpS1 was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (16/60 Superdex column, Amersham Biosciences) using buffer F (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT). The SyClpS1 fraction was detected as described above and the purified protein stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce), with the concentration of SyClpS1 used in each assay based on a monomeric conformation. CD Spectra of SyClpS1—CD spectra of native and denatured SyClpS1 (10 μm) in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT) were analyzed in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. For the denatured sample, SyClpS1 was heated at 47 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature prior to the analysis. A CD spectrum over the range of 240 to 220 nm was performed on duplicate samples for both native and denatured SyClpS1. ATPase Assay—SyClpC ATPase activity was determined using a Malachite Green Assay (25Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Reactions were done at 37 °C in 50 μl buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) with 0.5 μm SyClpC. Unless stated otherwise, 5 mm ATP was also included in the assays. When testing the effect of varying pH, MES buffer was used at pH 6.5 and 6.0. Proteins tested for their possible stimulatory effect on ClpC ATPase activity were present at 1 μm. Release of inorganic phosphate was monitored spectrophotometrically at 650 nm (UV-120-02 spectrophotometer, Shimadzu). Standards were made by dissolving KH2PO4 in buffer and diluting to a range of 1–12 nmol of inorganic phosphate in 50 μl. All reactions were carried out at least in triplicate. Prevention of Aggregation with Heat-denatured Luciferase—To determine the ability of ClpC to prevent aggregation, SyClpC (1.2 μm) and ATP or ATPγS(2 mm) were preheated in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) for 5 min at 43 °C and then used to dilute luciferase to 0.1 μm final concentration. Control reactions were also done with only preheated buffer or with SyClpC in the absence of ATP. Aggregation of luciferase at 44 °C was detected by increasing turbidity at 575 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55B spectrofluorometer). Interaction of SyClpC with Aggregated MDH—2 μm MDH was heat-denatured in MDH buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) and diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm in the presence of SyClpC (1 μm) with or without ATPγS(2 mm). The same procedure was performed with native MDH as control. Reactions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—All surface plasmon resonance studies were performed using a BIAcore X (BIAcore AB). His-tagged SyClpS1 or B. subtilis MecA was captured on the surface of a sensor chip nitrilotriacetic acid by metal chelation via Ni2+-activated nitrilotriacetic acid, yielding a 2000 response units of immobilized protein. With a flow rate of 20 μlmin–1 eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20), 1 μm SyClpC or control proteins (EcClpB, BsClpC, casein, and BSA) were passed over the chip to test for interaction with the immobilized protein. The affinity between SyClpC and SyClpS1 was determined by passing different SyClpC concentrations, ranging from 125 nm to 1 μm, over the immobilized protein. After each run the chip was regenerated with buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 350 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20) and recharged with 500 μm Ni2+. MDH and Luciferase Disaggregation and Refolding—Disaggregation of aggregated MDH was done by first denaturing 2 μm MDH in MDH buffer at 47 °C for 30 min. The heat-aggregated MDH was diluted to 1 μm either alone or in the presence of SyClpC, SyClpC, and MecA (0.5 μm) or SyClpC and SyClpS1 (0.5 μm). As a control, SyClpC was substituted with the E. coli ClpB (1 μm) and KJE proteins (1 μm DnaK, 0.2 μm DnaJ, 0.1 μm GrpE). All reactions were performed with an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 ng μl–1 pyruvate kinase). Disaggregation of MDH was measured at 30 °C by decreasing turbidity at 600 nm. For the MDH disaggregation/refolding assays, MDH (2 μm) was pre-aggregated at 47 °C for 30 min and then diluted to 1 μm either alone or with SyClpC, SyClpC and MecA (0.5 μm) or SyClpC and SyClpS1 (0.5 μm). As a control, SyClpC was substituted with the E. coli ClpB (1 μm). All reactions included the ATP regenerating system as detailed above. MDH activity was measured as described previously (20Schlothauer T. Mogk A. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Turgay K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the luciferase assays, luciferase was diluted in MDH buffer to 100 nm, denatured at 43 °C for 15 min to form aggregates, and then diluted to 50 nm either alone or with SyClpC, SyClpC, and MecA (0.5 μm) or SyClpC and SyClpS1 (0.5 μm). All reactions included the ATP-regenerating system as detailed above. As a control, SyClpC was substituted with the E. coli ClpB (1 μm). Reactions were incubated over time at 30 °C. Luciferase activity was determined as described previously (20Schlothauer T. Mogk A. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Turgay K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SyClpC—SyClpC was purified using an E. coli overexpression system. Upon induction with IPTG, SyClpC was expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein of 147 kDa with the Sce VMA1 intein and CBD (Fig. 1). After cell lysis, the soluble fusion protein was bound to a chitin affinity column and washed extensively to remove nonspecific protein contamination. SyClpC (87 kDa) was then eluted after cleavage of the fusion protein under reducing conditions, with the intein/CBD partner remaining bound to the column. Subsequent purification of SyClpC by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography removed the remaining protein contaminants (Fig. 1). According to gel filtration chromatography, SyClpC is a dimer in the absence of nucleotide but with the addition of ATP and casein forms a hexamer (data not shown) similar to that of other HSP100 proteins (26Beuron F.

Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). SyClpC Displays Basal ATPase Activity—To determine whether SyClpC has basal ATPase activity, we used an assay that measures the release of free inorganic phosphate when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP. SyClpC exhibited increasing ATPase activity with increasing substrate concentration (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the ATPase activity showed apparent biphasic kinetics, with the first phase having a Km of 2.05 mm. Tests of other parameters revealed optimal ATP hydrolysis by SyClpC between 37 and 45 °C and within pH 7.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 2, B and C). SyClpC activity was dependent exclusively on ATP and not supported by other nucleotides. It was also stimulated ∼2-fold by addition of casein, but not BSA. Strong product inhibition was also found, with ADP demonstrating a concentration dependent effect on ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2D). SyClpC Prevents Formation of Protein Aggregates—Certain chaperones like GroEL and ClpA in E. coli hold denatured proteins in a non-aggregated state (31Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether SyClpC also has such a function, luciferase was heat-denatured in the presence of SyClpC and ATPγS and analyzed for inhibition of aggregation. Luciferase is a highly heat-labile protein in the absence of SyClpC and quickly aggregated at high temperature (Fig. 3). Addition of SyClpC without ATP had no effect on the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase (data not shown). However, addition of SyClpC with ATP greatly reduced the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase, indicating SyClpC can stabilize denatured proteins. With the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, SyClpC protected essentially all luciferase from aggregation (Fig. 3), suggesting that SyClpC binding to the denatured substrate is the critical step in this holding activity. Substituting SyClpC with BSA failed to prevent luciferase aggregation, indicating that SyClpC acts specifically as a “holder” chaperone. SyClpC Interacts with Aggregated Proteins—Another role performed by certain chaperones is to bind aggregated proteins and then initiate their resolubilization. SyClpC was tested for such activity by using preformed protein aggregates in the form of heat-aggregated MDH. SyClpC was incubated for 5 min with aggregated MDH in the presence or absence of ATPγS and then centrifuged to pellet all insoluble proteins. The pelleted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). Only in the presence of ATPγS (lane 2) was a large proportion of SyClpC present in the pelleted fraction along with aggregated MDH, demonstrating the nucleotide dependence of SyClpC binding to aggregated proteins. In contrast, substituting aggregated with native MDH resulted in no SyClpC or MDH in the pelleted fraction (lane 3), indicating SyClpC binds specifically to the aggregated MDH. ClpC Exhibits Disaggregation Activity in Vitro—Because of the association between SyClpC and aggregated MDH, we next examined whether SyClpC could resolubilize protein aggregates. For this assay, the ability of SyClpC to resolubilize heat-aggregated MDH in the presence of ATP was determined by aggregate turbidity. As a control, we included the E. coli ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE) chaperone system, which is well known for its disaggregation activity in vitro (4Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). SyClpC alone exhibited only minor disaggregation activity in comparison to the ClpB/KJE system (Fig. 4B). This disaggregation activity of SyClpC, however, was significant when compared with the control of MDH alone (Fig. 4C). Given that BsClpC requires the MecA adaptor to attain disaggregation activity (20Schlothauer T. Mogk A. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Turgay K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we next tested whether MecA could also stimulate SyClpC disaggregation activity. As previously observed (20Schlothauer T. Mogk A. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Turgay K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), MecA alone had no disaggregation activity (data not shown). However, in the presence of MecA, SyClpC did indeed exhibit enhanced disaggregation activity but not to the same extent as the ClpB/KJE system (Fig. 4B). Purification of SyClpS1—Although MecA increased SyClpC disaggregation activity in vitro, no obvious MecA ortholog exists in cyanobacteria or higher plants. However, orthologs to another adaptor protein, ClpS, do exist in photosynthetic organisms (33Lupas A.N. Koretke K.K. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In E. coli, ClpS redirects the substrate specificity of ClpA toward protein aggregates (23Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because of this, we purified the Synechococcus ortholog, SyClpS1, most homologous to E. coli and plant chloroplast ClpS. SyClpS1 (14 kDa) was overexpressed in E. coli with an N-terminal His-tag (Fig. 5A). Following induction in E. coli, the soluble SyClpS1 protein was purified to homogeneity by sequential affinity and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5A). According to the gel filtration chromatography, SyClpS1 is a monomeric protein similar to the ClpS homolog in E. coli (34Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Zeth K. Ravelli R.B. Paal K. Cusack S. Bukau B. Dougan D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CD spectra analysis of native and denatured SyClpS1 showed that the recombinant protein had distinct three-dimensional structure (data not shown) and thus is likely to be in a folded state. To determine whether SyClpS1 affects the chaperone activity of SyClpC, we first tested for any physical interaction between the SyClpS1 and SyClpC proteins. Using surface plasmon resonance measurements, increasing concentrations of purified SyClpC were passed over immobilized SyClpS1, giving a change of the refractory index indicative of strong binding (Fig. 5B). When tested with immobilized MecA, addition of SyClpC produced a similar response (data not shown), again demonstrating a strong association between the two proteins. Replacing SyClpC with other HSP100 proteins (i.e. BsClpC and EcClpB) or the control proteins BSA and casein in the same assays gave no discernible change of the refractory index with SyClpS1 (Fig. 5C), indicating the specificity of the SyClpC interaction to SyClpS1. We next examined whether the binding of SyClpS1 could influence SyClpC ATPase activity. Addition of SyClpS1 gave no change in SyClpC ATPase activity, whereas adding MecA stimulated this activity ∼3-fold. Moreover, SyClpS1 had no effect on the holder chaperone activity of SyClpC as shown in Fig. 3 (data not shown). SyClpC Disaggregation and Refolding Activity Is Unaffected by SyClpS1—SyClpS1 was next tested for its effect on the disaggregation of heat-aggregated MDH by SyClpC. Addition of SyClpS1, however, failed to noticeably increase the low level of MDH disaggregation by SyClpC as previously observed (data not shown). Given the low basal level of SyClpC resolubilization activity as measured by the turbidity assay, we next used more sensitive assays of protein disaggregation/refolding based on the re"

Despite the physiological importance of RCE, the enzymatic mechanism of this protease remains undefined. In this study, we have evaluated the substrate specificity of RCE orthologs from yeast (Rce1p), worm, plant, and human and have determined the importance of conserved residues toward enzymatic activity. Our findings indicate that RCE orthologs have conserved substrate specificity, cleaving CVIA, CTLM, and certain other CAAX motifs, but not the CASQ motif, when these motifs are placed in the context of the yeast a-factor precursor. Our mutational studies of residues conserved between the orthologs indicate that an alanine substitution at His194 completely inactivates yeast Rce1p enzymatic activity, whereas a substitution at Glu156 or His248 results in marginal activity. We have also determined that residues Glu157, Tyr160, Phe190, and Asn252 impact the substrate selectivity of Rce1p. Computational methods predict that residues influencing Rce1p function are all near or within hydrophobic segments. Combined, our data indicate that yeast Rce1p function requires residues that are invariably conserved among an extended family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes and that these residues are likely to lie within or immediately adjacent to the transmembrane segments of this membrane-localized enzyme.

The Ras converting enzyme (RCE) 2The abbreviations used are: RCE, Ras converting enzyme; TPCK, N-tosylphenylalanylchloromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin. is required for the maturation of Ras and certain other lipid-modified proteins, specifically those having a C-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic; and X, one of several amino acids) (1Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York2001: 155-213Google Scholar). Proteins bearing a CAAX motif (CAAX proteins) typically undergo three ordered post-translational modifications: thioether attachment of an isoprenoid lipid (farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) to the cysteine, proteolytic removal of the AAX tripeptide, and carboxyl methyl esterification of the proteolytically exposed isoprenylated cysteine (2Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York2001: 155-213Google Scholar). RCE promotes the proteolytic step in this modification pathway. Because of the important role that certain CAAX proteins have in cellular transformation (e.g. Ras and RhoB), agents that inhibit the maturation and activity of CAAX proteins are seen as having chemotherapeutic potential (3Gibbs J.

This hypothesis is supported by the recent development of farnesyltransferase inhibitors that prevent isoprenoid attachment to CAAX proteins, which apparently moderates tumor growth (5Baum C.

Yeast RCE1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized protein (Rce1p) that is predicted by hydropathy analysis to contain multiple membrane spans (8Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).

Despite the relatively low degree of primary sequence conservation, all Rce1p orthologs examined to date can substitute for yeast Rce1p in the maturation of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone (11Cadiñanos J.

These observations suggest that the RCE family may have conserved substrate specificity. In the absence of their respective RCE encoding gene, yeast are incapable of producing fully modified Ras and a-factor, and mice are incapable of producing mature forms of certain CAAX proteins, including Ras and lamin B1 (1Boyartchuk V.L.

Through in vitro studies, RCE-dependent activity has been determined to be sensitive to a number of compounds, including general protease inhibitors, organomercurials, and substrate mimetics (11Cadiñanos J. Schmidt W.K. Fueyo A. Varela I. Lopez-Otin C. Freije J.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, RCE orthologs are reportedly inhibited by a non-hydrolyzable substrate mimetic, TPCK, organomercurials, and certain divalent metal ions (i.e. zinc and copper) (11Cadiñanos J. Schmidt W.K. Fueyo A. Varela I. Lopez-Otin C. Freije J.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cadiñanos J. Varela I. Mandel D. Schmidt W.K. Díaz-Perales A. López-Otín C.

In sum, the evidence strongly supports the protease classification of RCE. However, RCE has not been shown to possess proteolytic activity in a purified system. Thus, the protease classification and mechanism of RCE remains formally unresolved. RCE has atypical features for a protease. RCE is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized membrane protein that is predicted to possess multiple membrane spans (8Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Other established proteases with multiple membrane spans include the STE24 CAAX protease that has a partially overlapping role with RCE, the presenilins that are involved in Aβ production and Notch signaling, S2P that is involved in production of the sterol-response element-binding protein, SPP that is involved in clearance of signal sequences, and rhomboid that is involved in the production of Drosophila epidermal growth factor-α (17Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46798-46806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). RCE is also atypical in that it lacks a readily identifiable protease motif. Certain amino acids have been identified that are reportedly critical for RCE activity. These include cysteine, glutamate, and histidine residues (14Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Combined mutational and inhibitor data have led to the proposal that RCE is a cysteine protease (14Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By contrast, a bioinformatic study of eukaryotic and putative prokaryotic RCE orthologs has identified a set of invariably conserved residues that are typically found in metalloenzymes (i.e. histidine and glutamate residues) (19Pei J. Grishin N.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 275-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whether any of the residues purportedly essential for RCE activity are properly oriented to compose an active site has not yet been determined (i.e. the active site should be disposed toward the cytosol so that it can interact with cytosolic protein substrates). In this study, we have used genetic, mutational, and biochemical analyses to gain insight into the functional properties of yeast Rce1p and its orthologs. We demonstrate that the substrate specificity of RCE enzymes is evolutionarily conserved, which has implications for the identification of novel substrates of this enzyme. We also show that the enzymatic activity of yeast Rce1p requires a glutamate and a pair of histidine residues that are invariably conserved among RCE orthologs but not a conserved cysteine that has been proposed to be a catalytic residue.

The knock-out of the STE24 gene in SM3689 was facilitated by the use of a DNA fragment that was derived from pWS405 (CEN URA3 ste24::KanR), which was created by replacing the STE24 open reading frame in pSM1093 (CEN URA3 STE24) with a KanR cassette (23Fujimura-Kamada K.

Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In brief, mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to contain the desired mutation were used to generate PCR products that were co-transformed into SM3614 (MATa trp1 leu2 ura3 his4 can1 ste24::LEU2 rce1::TRP1) along with pSM1314 that had been linearized with a restriction enzyme near the intended site of mutation. The plasmids that formed in vivo by recombination were isolated from several independent yeast transformants, screened for the presence of a silent restriction site that was typically introduced along with the mutation, and candidates carrying the restriction site were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. SacI DNA fragments derived from the pSM1314-based plasmids (containing RCE1 coding and 3′-untranslated regions) were subcloned into pWS479 to create overexpression vectors. pWS479 was created by subcloning the SacI fragment of pSM1314 containing part of the open reading frame of RCE1::HA and its 3′-untranslated regions into the same sites of pWS123 (2μ URA3 PPGK-RCE1::His). pWS123 was created by subcloning a PCR fragment containing RCE1 into the BamHI and NotI sites of pSM703 such that the oligonucleotides also introduced a polyhistidine tag at the 3′-end of the open reading frame. pSM703 has been described before (28Zhang Y.

Fusions of yeast RCE1 to the OST4-His4C reporter were created by recombinational cloning. In brief, PCR products encoding full-length or truncated RCE1 with ends homologous to pJK90 were co-transformed with pJK90 that had been linearized with SmaI (25Kim H. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10208-10213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids were recovered and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion to identify the desired clones. Yeast Mating Assays—The ability of Rce1p mutants to promote a-factor production was assessed by genetic tests in which the growth of diploids is indicative of mating and a functional Rce1p enzyme (11Cadiñanos J. Schmidt W.K. Fueyo A. Varela I. Lopez-Otin C. Freije J.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nijbroek G.L. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the substrate specificity study of CAAX protease orthologs, mating tests were performed either by spotting cultures of washed MATa cells onto a lawn of MATα cells or by carrying out the serial dilution mating assay. For both approaches, a yeast strain lacking the a-factor and CAAX protease genes (yWS164) was co-transformed with plasmids encoding an Rce1p or Ste24p ortholog and the indicated a-factor CAAX variant (11Cadiñanos J. Schmidt W.K. Fueyo A. Varela I. Lopez-Otin C. Freije J.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the co-transformed strain was cultured in selective media. For the washed cells approach, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with sterile H2O, and spotted (μl spots) onto a lawn of MATα (SM1068) cells that had previously been spread on a minimal agar plate. The MATα cells were prepared as a suspension of cells in YPD (yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose), and 300 μl of this suspension was spread on the minimal plate. The small amount of YPD allows the auxotrophic MATa and MATα haploid yeast to survive for a short amount of time during which mating events can occur but does not allow the growth of visible haploid colonies. For the serial dilution approach, the serial dilution mating test was performed as described below. For both approaches, the formation of diploid colonies was scored after 2–3 days of growth at 30 °C. For the genetic analysis of Rce1p mutants (site-directed and truncation), a serial dilution mating test was used. In brief, MATa cultures were grown for 24 h in selective media along with a MATα culture that was grown in YPD. The cultures were all normalized to 1 A600 by dilution with appropriate growth media. The MATα cell suspension was loaded into the wells of a 96-well plate (90 μl/well), which was followed by the addition of each MATa cell suspension to individual wells in the first row of the multiwell plate (10 μl/well). The cell populations were mixed using a multichannel pipetter, and a volume (10 μl) of each first row suspension was transferred to the corresponding second row well of the multiwell plate. The above steps were repeated for the remaining rows so as to create a 10-fold serial dilution of each MATa culture. The cell suspensions from all the wells were spotted onto a minimal agar plate, and the formation of diploid colonies was scored after 2–"
https://openalex.org/W2040527840,"tRNAs are transcribed as precursors with a 5′ end leader and a 3′ end trailer. The 5′ end leader is processed by RNase P, and in most organisms in all three kingdoms, transfer ribonuclease (tRNase) Z can endonucleolytically remove the 3′ end trailer. Long (L) and short (S) forms of the tRNase Z gene are present in the human genome. tRNase ZL processes a nuclear-encoded pre-tRNA ∼1600-fold more efficiently than tRNase ZS and is predicted to have a strong mitochondrial transport signal. tRNase ZL could, thus, process both nuclear- and mitochondrially encoded pre-tRNAs. More than 150 pathogenesis-associated mutations have been found in the mitochondrial genome, most of them in the 22 mitochondrially encoded tRNAs. All the mutations investigated in human mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) affect processing efficiency, and some affect the cleavage site and secondary structure. These changes could affect tRNase Z processing of mutant pre-tRNAs, perhaps contributing to mitochondrial disease. tRNAs are transcribed as precursors with a 5′ end leader and a 3′ end trailer.

These changes could affect tRNase Z processing of mutant pre-tRNAs, perhaps contributing to mitochondrial disease. Mitochondria, the intracellular organelles responsible for most of a eukaryotic cell energy production, possess their own maternally inherited genome. The circular 16,568-base pair human mitochondrial genome (1.Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Brujin M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Shreier P.H.

Two rRNAs and 11 mRNAs encoding 13 polypeptides (all of them subunits of complexes in the respiratory transport chain) are punctuated by 22 tRNAs (1 tRNA for each of 18 amino acids and 2 each for leucine and serine with different anticodons) with very little intergenic RNA (2.Montoya J. Ojala D. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 3.Ojala D. Montaya J. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Several thousand additional polypeptides required for mitochondrial metabolism are nuclear-encoded, cytoplasmically translated and imported. Precursor tRNA transcripts have a 5′ end leader and a 3′ end trailer. Eukaryotic nuclear-encoded tRNAs are transcribed from RNA polymerase III promoters with short 5′ end leaders and 3′ end trailers ending with a U3 tail. The characteristic length and sequence of mitochondrial pre-tRNA leaders and trailers, on the other hand, depend on the setting of individual tRNAs among the neighboring functional RNA units (other tRNAs, mRNAs, rRNAs) on the long polycistronic H- and L-strand transcripts (4.Levinger L. Morl M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5430-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The 5′ end leader is removed from pre-tRNAs by RNase P in a largely conserved, well characterized reaction (5.Xiao S. Scott F. Fierke C.A. Engelke D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are different paths to a mature tRNA 3′ end (6.Mörl M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the tRNAs of some prokaryotes, CCA is transcriptionally encoded, and the 3′ end trailer is removed by the sequential activity of an endonuclease (RNase E) and exonucleases (7.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. RNA. 2002; 8: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, in most organisms in all three kingdoms and in extranuclear organelles, CCA is not transcriptionally encoded and can be added to the discriminator (the unpaired nucleotide after the 3′ end of the acceptor stem, which is retained in mature tRNA) after precise endonucleolytic removal of the 3′ end trailer by tRNase Z (9.Castaño J.G.

Intriguingly, CCA is a tRNase Z anti-determinant that prevents mature tRNA from recycling through tRNase Z, thus ensuring that tRNA proceeds smoothly to aminoacylation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The CCA anti-determinant effect characterized in processing extracts and active fractions from mammalian and fruit fly cells (15.Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1148-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16.Mohan A. Whyte S. Wang X. Nashimoto M. Levinger L. RNA. 1999; 5: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was confirmed with expressed tRNase Z from Bacillus subtilis (17.Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but was not observed with expressed tRNase Z from Arabidopsis thaliana or Methanococcus jannaschii (18.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). tRNase Z is found in a short form (tRNase ZS) in bacteria and Archaea (19.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All eukaryotes have a long form (tRNase ZL), and some have both forms. Recent high resolution crystal structures of bacterial tRNase ZS provide a basis for modeling the active site and binding domains (20.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21.Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14138-14144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but structures of a eukaryotic tRNase ZS, any tRNase ZL, or any tRNase Z-tRNA complex have not yet been reported. The human genome encodes both tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS. tRNase ZL may have arisen from a duplication of the tRNase ZS gene (22.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H.F. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), in which the carboxyl region of tRNase ZL retained all the sequence motifs required for catalysis, leaving the amino half free to diverge, perhaps improving the efficiency of pre-tRNA processing or acquiring additional functions. Human tRNase ZL was first characterized as a prostate cancer susceptibility gene (22.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H.F. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and yeast tRNase Z (a long form) has been suggested to have notable mitochondrial functions (23.Chen Y. Beck A. Davenport C. Chen Y. Shattuck D. Tavtigian S.V. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although tRNase Z demonstrably functions in human mitochondrial pre-tRNA maturation (4.Levinger L. Morl M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5430-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it is not mitochondrially encoded and must, therefore, be imported. Sorting servers (e.g. ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html) suggest that human tRNase ZL possesses a strong mitochondrial localization sequence. In fruit fly cells, a single tRNase ZL gene encodes both the nuclear and mitochondrial enzyme (24.Dubrovsky E.B. Dubrovskaya V.A. Levinger L. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human tRNase ZL is herein demonstrated to process nuclear-encoded pre-tRNA 1600-fold more efficiently than tRNase ZS, furthermore suggesting that it is the important enzyme for pre-tRNA 3′ end processing in organisms such as human, in which both are present. More than 150 pathogenesis-associated mutations have been found in the mitochondrial genome, ∼⅔ of them in tRNA genes (see www.mitomap.org). No nuclear-encoded cytoplasmic tRNAs are known to be imported into human mitochondria, and pathogenesis-associated mutations have been confirmed in most of the mitochondrially encoded tRNAs, suggesting that they are all needed for efficient translation of mitochondrial messages. Pre-tRNA end processing defects could, thus, contribute to mitochondrial diseases (for review, see Ref. 4.Levinger L. Morl M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5430-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). tRNASer(UCN), a mitochondrial L-strand transcript, may be a hot spot for mutations associated with maternally transmitted hearing loss and other symptoms, including epilepsy, ragged red fibers, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, ataxia and myoclonus, and mental retardation (www.mitomap.org). Several naturally occurring mutations in tRNASer(UCN) are tightly clustered at two locations, on the 5′ side of the acceptor stem and in the pre-tRNA 3′ end trailer immediately after the discriminator, suggestive of possible effects on tRNase Z processing. Wild type pre-tRNASer(UCN) and these mutants were produced with a mature 5′ end and a 3′ end trailer to investigate their tRNase ZL cleavage sites, processing kinetics, and substrate secondary structures. The observed effects could all contribute to mitochondrial pathogenesis. Baculovirus Expression of Human tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS—cDNAs encoding human tRNase ZL (also known as ELAC2, a gift of S. Tavtigian (22.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H.F. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar)) and tRNase ZS (also known as ELAC1) were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector FastBac HTa (Invitrogen), transposed into bacmid DNA, and transfected and expressed in insect Sf9 cells. tRNase ZL was expressed from Gly-50 of 826 amino acids, producing an 86-kDa polypeptide. Expression of soluble active enzymes can depend on the choice of expression system and also on the translation start. tRNase ZLs are highly diverged around the amino end. The first conserved residues found (22.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H.F. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), the start of a Ψ-His domain around r60, suggest that the region on the amino side of r60 is without a specific essential function apart from the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence within the first 25–30 residues. Initiation at Gly-50 produced a soluble enzyme with a high catalytic efficiency. Full-length 40-kDa (363 amino acid) tRNase ZS was expressed. Expressed proteins were affinity-purified by nickel chelate chromatography (Qiagen) and the His tag was removed using rTEV protease. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay and confirmed using discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) and scanned with a Storm 840 Imager as in Zareen et al.

In combination with universal upstream EcoRI-T7 promoter and downstream PstI-3′ end trailer or HindIII-hepatitis delta virus ribozyme oligonucleotides, overlapping products were joined and amplified by extension PCR (30.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Inserts were subcloned, and accuracy of construction was confirmed by sequencing (Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University). Structure probing of wild type and mutant tRNASer(UCN) transcripts with RNase T1 under semidenaturing conditions (see “Results”) confirms the correct location of the G residues. A previous sequence/construction error was corrected (nucleotides AA at positions 37 and 38 on the 3′ side of the anticodon loop in Fig. 4 is the correct sequence); observations in the present work are generally in agreement with earlier results (27.Levinger L. Jacobs O. James M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4334-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preparation of Pre-tRNAs—Wild type and mutant unlabeled pre-tRNAs were prepared by runoff transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Transcripts were recovered by precipitation, redissolved in 200 μlof dH2O, refolded by heating for 1 min at 90 °C, mixed with an equal volume of 2× ribozyme buffer to make 400 μl containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Ribozyme reaction products were precipitated and gel-purified. Expected bands were detected by UV shadowing, and pre-tRNAs were recovered. Concentrations were determined by A260 and confirmed by gel electrophoresis, staining with Sybr Green II (Molecular Probes), and scanning with a Storm 840 Imager. Pre-tRNAs were 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, gel-purified, and recovered as described (14.Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, pre-tRNAArg was 3′ end-labeled with α-32P-labeled cyticline 3′-phosphate and T4 RNA ligase (31.Levinger L. Bourne R. Kolla S. Cylin E. Russell K. Wang X. Mohan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pre-tRNAs were sometimes refolded by heating in water for 1 min at 90 °C, mixing with 2× processing buffer (see below), and cooling to room temperature for 5 min. Refolding did not affect pre-tRNA structure or processing of the tRNASer(UCN) wild type or two of the most impaired mutants (7445U→ C and 7445U→ G; data not shown) and was, therefore, not routinely used. Optimization of Processing Efficiency for Nuclear-encoded and Mitochondrially Encoded Substrates—The processing conditions were optimized, including the enzyme (tRNase ZL or tRNase ZS) and substrates (nuclear encoded pre-tRNAArg or mitochondrially encoded pre-tRNASer(UCN)), divalent metal ions, monovalent metal ions, and pH. 25-μl reactions using a trace concentration (0.1 nm) of labeled pre-tRNA substrate were sampled after 0, 5, 10, and 15 min of incubation at 37 °C by transferring 5 μl to 2.5 μl of formamide-marker dye mix in a multiwell plate on ice and heated to 90 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to a storage phosphor screen, scanned with a Storm 840 imager, and analyzed with ImageQuant (as in Zareen et al. (25.Zareen N. Yan H. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Processing of nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg with tRNase ZL was most efficient using 25 mm K-MOPS, pH 6.75, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 4 units/ml RNasin, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Processing of pre-tRNAArg with tRNase ZS was optimal with 1 mm MnCl2 in place of MgCl2 as previously suggested (32.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mitochondrially encoded pre-tRNASer(UCN) was most efficiently processed with tRNase ZL using 2.5 mm CaCl2 instead of MgCl2. Processing of mitochondrial pre-tRNASer(UCN) with tRNase ZS was also optimal with 2.5 mm CaCl2 and could not be detected with Mn2+ alone or in a mixture with Ca2+. In vitro pre-tRNA processing of unmodified transcripts has both advantages and limitations (4.Levinger L. Morl M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5430-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The endonucleolytic end processing reactions may precede most of the nucleoside modifications; even so, the absence of the post-transcriptional nucleoside modifications in tRNASer(UCN) (e.g. Ψ28, m3C32, ms2i6A37, T54, Ψ55 (34.Toompuu M. Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Hakkinen T. Spelbrink J.N. Watanabe K. Jacobs H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22240-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) could contribute to lower processing efficiency compared with nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg (see “Results”). Processing Kinetics—Michaelis-Menten kinetics was performed as previously described (25.Zareen N. Yan H. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) under optimal reaction conditions (see above) using constant input-labeled substrate (0.1 nm, more than 10-fold less than the lowest km for the enzyme) and varying the concentration of unlabeled substrate over a factor of 20, centered on km. Efficiency and kinetic experiments using nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg were performed with a tRNase ZL concentration of 1 pm, ensuring multiple turnover conditions. In the case of combinations of another enzyme (tRNase ZS) and substrates (mitochondrial pre-tRNAs), when kcat was lower, it was necessary to use a higher concentration of enzyme, as noted in the figures. Experiments with each combination of enzyme and substrate were performed at least twice, with the wild type substrate alongside the mutants each time. S.E. are reported in the second through fourth columns in Tables 1 and 2. Values for “relative to wild type” (the fifth column in Tables 1 and 2) were calculated using the mutant and wild type values from experiments performed the same day.TABLE 1tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS processing and binding kineticsEnzymekcatkmkcat/kmRe kcat/kmaRe kcat/km (n-fold reduction) refers to the relative ratio of processing efficiencies; kcat/km (tRNase ZS)/kcat/km (tRNase ZL) in parallel kinetic experiments.min-1×10-8 m×108 m/mintRNase ZL371 ± 1512.2 ± 0.5160 ± 321tRNase ZS1.24 ± 0.2413.2 ± 3.90.097 ± 0.0106.08 ± 1.9 E-04a Re kcat/km (n-fold reduction) refers to the relative ratio of processing efficiencies; kcat/km (tRNase ZS)/kcat/km (tRNase ZL) in parallel kinetic experiments.

Open table in a new tab Structure Probing—Secondary structures of 5′ end-labeled tRNAs were analyzed by structure probing as previously described (28.Levinger L. Giegé R. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1904-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), including one unincubated pre-tRNA (0), one alkaline ladder, one semi-denaturing ribonuclease T1 reaction (SD-T1), two native T1 reactions (final concentrations 1 and 2.5 × 10–3 units/μl; United States Biochemical Corp.), two native S1 reactions (1 and 2.5 units/μl; New England Biolabs), and two native V1 reactions (0.04 and 0.1 units/μl; Pierce). Processing buffers were used for native structure probing but without tRNase Z and with Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, substituted for K-MOPS to avoid electrophoresis artifacts. Samples were split and electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel until the xylene cyanol was 6 cm above the bottom for highest resolution of the 3′ half of the pre-tRNAs and on a 12% gel with the bromphenol blue run to 10 cm above the bottom to analyze the 5′ half. Efficiency and Kinetics of Human Nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg Processing by tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS—To choose the best enzyme for analysis of pre-tRNA 3′ end processing in vitro, human tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS were characterized using nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg as a substrate under optimized reaction conditions (Fig. 1). Efficiently expressed affinity-purified soluble tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS display apparent molecular masses just below 90 kDa and around 40 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). To obtain a comparable extent of processing of nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg (Fig. 1B) based on the reaction time course, 2 pm tRNase ZL and 5 nm tRNase ZS were used (Fig. 1, C and D), a 2500-fold higher concentration of tRNase ZS than tRNase ZL. tRNase ZL also processed mitochondrially encoded substrates substantially more efficiently than tRNase ZS (see below). Kinetic analyses were performed to determine the relative contributions made by changes in kcat and km to the more efficient processing of pre-tRNAArg by tRNase ZL than by tRNase ZS (Fig. 2, Table 1). The processing efficiency (kcat/km) with tRNase ZL is about 1600 times higher than with tRNase ZS (Fig. 2; the 5th column of Table 1) due to a ∼250× higher kcat (Table 1, 2nd column) and a ∼6× lower km (Table 1, third column). Based on the much higher processing efficiency and the suggestion that both human and fruit fly tRNase ZL have mitochondrial transport signals (24.Dubrovsky E.B. Dubrovskaya V.A. Levinger L. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), only tRNase ZL was used to analyze processing kinetics with wild type and mutant mitochondrially encoded tRNASer(UCN). tRNase Z Is an Endonuclease—Nuclear-encoded pre-tRNAArg labeled at the 5′ and 3′ ends was processed with tRNase ZL and electrophoresed so as to keep the 3′ end trailer on the gel (Fig. 3). The presence of the 18-nt 3′ end trailer at the expected position on the gel (Fig. 3B) confirms that tRNase Z is an endonuclease and that the cleavages observed throughout this report are in the expected position on the 3′ side of the discriminator. Naturally Occurring Mutations in Mitochondrially Encoded tRNASer(UCN)—Six mutations have been found in the body of mature tRNASer(UCN), and four have been identified in the 3′ end trailer (www.mitomap.org; the last of these mutations are entered under “Coding and Control Region Point Mutations,” not under rRNA/tRNA Point Mutations because they do not occur in the body of the mature tRNA). From the standpoint of 3′ end processing, clustering of three mutations on the 5′ side of the acceptor stem (35.Nakamura M. Nakano S. Goto Y. Ozawa M. Nagahama Y. Fukuyama H. Akiguchi I. Kaji R.

Mutat. 1994; 3: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 39.Guan M.X. Enriquez J.A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Puranam R.S. Lin C.P. Maw M.A. Attardi G. Mol. Cell.

Effect of Substitutions in tRNASer(UCN) after the tRNase Z Cleavage Site on Cleavage Site Selection and Processing Efficiency—Cleavage by tRNase ZL is usually precise, but variant sequences in both substrate and enzyme can affect cleavage site selection (42.Nashimoto M. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12089-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two substitutions past the tRNase Z cleavage site in tRNASer(UCN), 7445U→ C and 7444C→ U (Fig. 4), lead to a predominant tRNase ZL cleavage one nucleotide in the 3′ direction from the normal cleavage site (Fig. 5, panels B and D, indicated with an asterisk; cf. product bands in A, C, and E). tRNA-N↓ and -N+1↓ cleavage products (in which N represents the discriminator) are present in the proportion between 1:10 and 1:5 throughout the reaction time courses. Because the aberrant cleavage products dominate the pattern with these two mutant tRNAs, products were combined to obtain the kinetic parameters (Table 2); processing efficiencies for 7445U→ C and 7444C→ U would be 5–10-fold lower if the aberrant cleavage products were excluded. The concentration of tRNase ZL was adjusted to match the overall extent of processing in the time courses and kinetic analyses (Fig. 5). Wild type tRNASer(UCN) can be efficiently processed using 12.5 pm tRNase ZL; the 7445U→ C mutant requires 100-fold higher enzyme concentration, and 7444C→ U reactions can be performed with a 2-fold lower enzyme concentration than with the wild type substrate, but as illustrated above (Fig. 5), the reaction products are aberrant. Kinetic Parameters for Wild Type and Mutant Mitochondrial pre-tRNASer(UCN) Processing by tRNase ZL—Wild type mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) is processed by tRNase ZL with an efficiency (kcat/km) ∼16 times lower than that of human nuclear-encoded tRNAArg (4th column of Table 2, cf. 4th column of Table 1). The kcat for tRNASer(UCN) is reduced ∼75-fold, and the km is also reduced ∼5-fold. Three mutations on the 5′ side of the acceptor stem (7512A→ G, 7511A→ G, 7510A→ G; Fig. 4) reduce tRNase Z processing efficiency (4th and 5th columns of Table 2) due to an ∼33% lower kcat (2nd column of Table 2) accompanied in the latter two mutants by an up to 2-fold higher km (3rd column of Table 2). Interestingly, the efficiency is progressively more reduced with increasing distance from the end of the acceptor stem an"
https://openalex.org/W2066486192,"Diaphanous related formins (DRFs) are cytoskeleton remodeling proteins that mediate specific upstream GTPase signals to regulate cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell polarity, and organelle motility. Previous work on the Rho-interacting DRF mDia has established that the biological activity of DRFs is regulated by an autoinhibitory interaction of a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) with the DRF N terminus. This autoinhibition is released upon competitive binding of an activated GTPase to the N terminus of the DRF. Analyzing autoregulation of the Rac1-interacting DRF FHOD1, we utilized in vitro binding studies to identify a 60-amino acid DAD at the protein C terminus that recognizes an N-terminal formin homology (FH) 3 domain. Importantly, the FH3 domain of FHOD1 does not overlap with the proposed Rac1-binding domain. The FHOD1 DAD was found to contain one functional hydrophobic autoregulatory motif, while a previously uncharacterized basic cluster that is conserved in all DRF family DADs also contributed to the FH3-DAD interaction. Simultaneous mutation of both motifs efficiently released autoinhibition of FHOD1 in NIH3T3 cells resulting in the formation of actin stress fibers and increased serum response element transcription. A second putative hydrophobic autoregulatory motif N-terminal of the DAD belongs to a unique FHOD subdomain of yet undefined function. NMR structural analysis and size exclusion chromatography experiments revealed that the FHOD1 DAD is intrinsically unstructured with a tendency for a helical conformation in the hydrophobic autoregulation motif. Together, these data suggest that in FHOD1, DAD acts as signal sequence for binding to the well folded and monomeric FH3 domain and imply an activation mechanism that differs from competitive binding of Rac1 and DAD to one interaction site.

Structural analyses have provided the molecular basis of a tethered dimer architecture that may allow formins to stair-step on the barbed end of an elongating nascent filament by binding two actins, one permitting monomer binding and the other permitting monomer dissociation (24Shimada A.

However, in context of the full-length proteins, DRF molecules are thought to exist in an inactive state due to an intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal autoregulatory DAD and its N-terminal recognition domain (8Alberts A.S.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and is suggested to mask the conserved FH1 and FH2 domains, thereby autoinhibiting their biological activity. DRF-DADs also contain a highly conserved cluster of positively charged residues with yet unknown relevance to autoregulation (8Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This autoinhibition is released upon interaction with specific members of the Rho-family GTPases in their activated state (8Alberts A.S. J. Biol.

Consequently, DRF proteins lacking the DAD or its recognition domain behave as dominant active molecules with substantial actin remodeling activity (8Alberts A.S. J. Biol.

Recent structural data have shed light on the activation interaction for the mDia1 protein (31Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A.

Hagan I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), also referred to as diaphanous inhibitory domain (29Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was found to interact with the autoregulating DAD (32Otomo T. Otomo C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), while a small preceding region forms the GTPase-binding subdomain of mDia1 that interacts with the switch I and II regions of the Rho GTPase (31Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A succeeding three-helix bundle forms a dimerization domain, which is believed to be followed by a coiled-coil region before the proline-rich FH1 domain starts.Several lines of evidence suggest that the molecular mechanisms of autoinhibition for FHOD formins could differ from that of Dia-family formins. First, although the N-terminal regions of mDia1 and FHOD1 are of similar length, there is no apparent homology between the two different subfamily proteins (16.7% identity over 570 residues). In fact, the overall modular domain architecture of FHOD1 and mDia1 seems to be distinct, since the GTP-binding region was suggested to directly precede the FH1 domain in FHOD1 (Ref. 16Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-46459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1A) while it was mapped to a near N-terminal domain in mDia1 (27Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 28Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr.

Cell. 2005; 18: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, FHOD family proteins interact with Rac1 instead of Rho or CDC42 GTPases (16Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-46459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mDia-GTPase interaction, binding of FHOD1 to Rac1 is not regulated by the loaded nucleotide state of the GTPase and activated Rac1 fails to induce the full phenotype observed with dominant active FHOD1 (16Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-46459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, also the C-terminal DAD in FHOD1 differs from Dia family DADs by its length and the number of potential autoregulation signals (Fig. 1, B and C). This leads to an ambiguous alignment between these DADs. While current listings (e.g. SMART) provide a lineup with no gaps between the FH2 and DAD, an alternative alignment scheme might assemble the C-terminal motifs for functional similarities (Fig. 1D, left and right panels).This study focused on the biochemical analysis of the autoregulation within human FHOD1. We found that an N-terminal stable domain (FH3, 1-377) directly interacted with the DAD. Mutation of the three proposed DAD consensus motifs showed that only the two C-terminal motifs contributed to FH3 domain binding in vitro and control FHOD1 activity in cells. Structural analysis of the FHOD1 DAD revealed an intrinsically unstructured domain with some tendency for a helical conformation in the hydrophobic consensus motif. The DAD could act as signal sequence for binding to the well folded and monomeric FH3 domain. These data imply that distinct, individually adapted molecular surfaces mediate the autoregulation and activation mechanism of FHOD1 that contains an additional region in between the FH2 domain and DAD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Sequence Analysis—Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure predictions were done prior to protein fragmentation using following protein sequence data base entries: FHOD1 (human) Q9Y613, FHOD1 (mouse) AAH60654, FHOD2 (mouse) BAC98303, FHOD3 (human) XP_371114, mDia1 (mouse) O08808, DRF1/hDia1 (human) O60610, mDia3 (mouse) O70566, DRF2/hDia2 (human) O60879, diaphanous (Drosophila) P48608, DRF3/mDia2 (mouse) Q9Z207, and Bni1p (yeast) P41832. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the MultAlign software (au.expasy.org/). For domain architecture analyses and secondary structure predictions following open access programs were quoted: SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), Prosite (au.expasy.org/prosite/), and PredictProtein (www.predictprotein.org/).Plasmid Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The coding DNA sequence for human fhod1 (GenBank™ accession code: AF113615) was used to generate fragments thereof by PCR-mediated amplification with primer containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Fragments were cloned in the procaryotic expression vectors pProEx-HTb (Invitrogen) or pGEX-2T-tev (Amersham Biosciences) for protein expression and purification. Codon optimization of the DAD was performed using the mega-primer method for mutagenesis as described previously (34Schulte A. Czudnochowski N. Barboric M. Schonichen A. Blazek D. Peterlin B.M. Geyer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24968-24977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of DAD consensus motifs was conducted similarly using both sense and antisense oligo nucleotides. Full-length plasmids for cellular transfection assays were cloned in the pEF-HA vector similarly as described (17Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which contained an N-terminal HA-epitope for immunostaining.For expression of FHOD1 protein domains the coding plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), expressed at 30 °C and induced at an A600 of 0.6 to 1.0 with 0.3 mm IPTG for 5 h growth. For His-tagged proteins cells were fluidized in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 20 mm imidazole and cleared by spinning for 45 min at 30,000 × g. The lysate was loaded onto 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A the protein was eluted with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A using a linear gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole. The peak fractions were dialyzed in buffer A, and if required the histidine tag was cleaved off at 4 °C over 12 h with Tev protease. FHOD1 was depleted of the protease and of uncleaved fragments by affinity chromatography. The protein containing flow-through was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration on a S75 column in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl. GST fusion proteins (377-573 and 1104-1164) were expressed as described above and fluidized in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After washing with 20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm GSH and cleaved by Tev-protease at 4 °C over 12 h. GSH was removed by gel filtration and GST by GSH affinity column. Uniformly 15N-labeled DAD of FHOD1 was produced in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing FHOD1 proteins (about 98% pure) were concentrated (Amicon filter) and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and extinction coefficient measurements.GST Pull-down Assays and Western Blotting—For direct interaction assays between various DAD constructs and the N-terminal domains of FHOD1 (1-573), the FH3 domain (1-377), and the proposed GBD domain (377-573), about 2 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with 10-20 μg of the respective target protein. Binding reactions were performed in 500 μl of buffer solution (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1-3 h at 4 °C or for 0.5 h at room temperature, respectively. Beads were washed three to five times in the same buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining or Western blotting, respectively, using standard protocols. Recombinant proteins were detected with an anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Expression of HA-tagged FHOD1 proteins in transfected NIH3T3 cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting of postnuclear cell lysates with an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Transfections and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Functional analyses of FHOD1 proteins were carried out in NIH3T3 cells essentially as described previously (17Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells were plated onto coverglasses overnight and subsequently transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA using Metafectene (Biontex). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (15 min at room temperature), permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. HA-tagged FHOD1 proteins were revealed by staining with the mouse monoclonal antibody F-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). F-actin was stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Following extensive washing, cells were mounted with Histogel (Linaris), and indirect fluorescence images were monitored with an Olympus IX70 microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop.SRE Transcription Assay—Activation of the SRE by FHOD1 was quantified in NIH3T3 cells as described previously (17Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase activity of NIH3T3 cells was determined 24 h post-transfection of FHOD1 expression vectors, the 5×SRE-Luc reporter plasmid, and pTK-Renilla with a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Laboratories) using the dual luciferase reporter assay system kit (Promega). SRE firefly luciferase counts were normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase internal control and calculated as fold transactivation with the counts for FHOD1-wt arbitrarily set to 1.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The thermodynamic parameters of the FHOD1 interaction with wild type and mutant DAD were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (MCS-ITC, MicroCal). All proteins were dialyzed against ITC buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP), and the DAD fragment (1104-1164) was thermostated in the sample cell at 25 °C at a concentration of 35 μm. The FH3 domain-containing fragment (400 μm) was injected stepwise by volumes of 8 μl from the syringe into the solution. The change in heating power was observed for 4 min until equilibrium was reached before the next injection was started. Further data evaluation was performed using the manufacturers analysis software, yielding ΔG° and ΔH° values with 0.5 kcal/mol errors each and typical errors for dissociation constants of 0.5 μm and somewhat higher for weak binding mutants.Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—Analytical gel filtration experiments were performed with a multicomponent Waters 626 LC system (Waters) using a Superdex 75 column (10/30, column volume 25.7 ml, Amersham Biosciences) or a Biosep-SEC-S2000 column (300 × 1.8 mm, Phenomenex) with a separation range for globular proteins from 1 to 300 kDa. The columns were first equilibrated in the respective running puffer following injection of the protein samples. The flow rate was set to 0.5 or 1.0 ml/min for the Superdex or Biosep column, respectively. Elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm. The void volume (V0) was determined with blue dextran (Sigma). The columns were calibrated with the following standards (Bio-Rad): thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). The ratio of elution volume to void volume (Ve/V0) was plotted versus the log(Mr) for each standard to generate a linear calibration curve. FHOD1 samples were dialyzed from frozen stocks into the equilibration buffer, diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml each, and injected onto the column at a volume of 90 μl. Protein complexations were incubated for 30 min prior to subjection to the column. The apparent molecular weight of each FHOD1 fragment was determined from the standard curve. Gel filtration experiments were performed repeated times at room temperature.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments with homonuclear or 15N-labeled protein samples were performed on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer, equipped with a triple resonance probe with shielded Z gradients. Proteins were dissolved in phosphate buffer (20 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP) at a concentration of 0.6 mm and measured at 25 °C in SHIGEMI tubes. Homonuclear two-dimensional experiments and 15N/1H-heteronuclear HSQC experiments were recorded following the Varian NMR suite with typically 2048 × 512 data points. NMR spectra were converted to Bruker format and processed with XWINNMR and evaluated and plotted with Aurelia (35Neidig K.P. Geyer M. Gorler A. Antz C. Saffrich R. Beneicke W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The assignment strategy was based on the identification of individual resonance spin systems from homonuclear TOCSY experiments following the sequential path with homonuclear two-dimensional and 15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY spectra similarly are described (36Geyer M. Munte C.E. Schorr J. Kellner R. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of the Diaphanous Autoregulatory Domain in FHOD1 and Its Interacting Domain—We started to analyze the domain boundaries of the interacting C-terminal DAD and its N-terminal recognition domain by GST pull-down binding assays. To this end we first expressed a construct in Escherichia coli bacterial cells that started C-terminal to the proposed FH2 domain at position 1032 and went up to the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A, left lane). Analytical mass spectrometry, however, revealed a proteolytic cleavage or premature truncation of the fragment that corresponded to an apparent mass of 10,046 Da (data not shown). This termination corresponded to the second appearance of a rare AGG codon at amino acid position 1126, which encoded the first arginine residue of the positively charged cluster of the DAD ("

In yeast, GPI also plays important roles in the production of mannoprotein in the cell wall. We previously isolated gwt1 mutants and found that GWT1 is required for inositol acylation in the GPI biosynthetic pathway. In this study we isolated a new gwt1 mutant allele, gwt1-10, that shows not only high temperature sensitivity but also low temperature sensitivity. The gwt1-10 cells show impaired acyltransferase activity and attachment of GPI to proteins even at the permissive temperature. We identified TAT2, which encodes a high affinity tryptophan permease, as a multicopy suppressor of cold sensitivity in gwt1-10 cells. The gwt1-10 cells were also defective in the import of tryptophan, and a lack of tryptophan caused low temperature sensitivity. Microscopic observation revealed that Tat2p is not transported to the plasma membrane but is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in gwt1-10 cells grown under tryptophan-poor conditions. We found that Tat2p was not associated with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), which are required for the recruitment of Tat2p to the plasma membrane. A similar result was obtained for Fur4p, a uracil permease localized in the DRMs of the plasma membrane. These results indicate that GPI-anchored proteins are required for the recruitment of membrane proteins Tat2p and Fur4p to the plasma membrane via DRMs, suggesting that some membrane proteins are redistributed in the cell in response to environmental and nutritional conditions due to an association with DRMs that is dependent on GPI-anchored proteins.

The lipid moiety of the GPI anchor is also subject to modification, such as variation of the fatty acids, ceramide remodeling, or alkyl chain attachment (2.McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In yeast and mammalian cells, inositol acylation, mostly palmitoylation, is the third step in the GPI anchor biosynthetic pathway, generating glucosaminyl-acyl-PI (GlcN-(acyl)PI) from glucosaminyl-PI. We previously reported that Gwt1p is required for this step in yeast (15.Umemura M. Okamoto M. Nakayama K. Sagane K. Tsukahara K. Hata K. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23639-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells a palmitoyl chain is added to glucosaminyl-PI by PIG-W, and acylation of inositol is critical for the attachment of GPI to proteins (16.Murakami Y. Siripanyapinyo U. Hong Y. Kang J.Y. Ishihara S. Nakakuma H. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4285-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, GPI-anchored proteins are concentrated in sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich domains (17.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar, 18.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7947) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of these domains is their resistance to extraction with detergent, typically Triton X-100 (TX-100). Therefore, they are referred to as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Some DRM-associated proteins are sensitive to TX-100 but resistant to other detergents such as CHAPS (19.Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich domains, also referred to as lipid microdomains or lipid rafts, play key roles in signal transduction and membrane trafficking (17.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar, 20.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 21.Lafont F.

Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DRMs are composed of sphingolipids and ergosterol, which is slightly different from cholesterol, and they contain GPI-anchored proteins similar to those found in mammalian cells (25.Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 26.Sievi E. Suntio T. Makarow M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of GPI-anchored proteins in DRMs of yeast cells are still unknown, lipid microdomains are known to deliver a GPI-anchored protein, Gas1p, from the ER to the plasma membrane (25.Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The recent results obtained in sec18 cells, in which ER-to-Golgi transport is blocked in a secretory pathway, suggest that the formation of DRMs and their association with certain proteins, including GPI-anchored proteins, are initiated in the ER (25.Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 27.Dupre S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Traffic. 2003; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Presumably such domains contain ceramide as their sphingolipids because GPI-anchored proteins cannot associate with DRMs in the absence of ceramide (25.Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and because ceramide is required for the specific transport of GPI-anchored proteins from the ER to the Golgi (28.Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29.Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J.

Ceramide may help drive the incorporation of GPI-anchored proteins into ER-derived vesicles that are specific to the GPI-anchored proteins by participating in the formation of DRM structure in the ER. Besides GPI-anchored proteins, many plasma membrane transporters, such as Pma1p, Tat2p, Fur4p, and Can1p, have been reported to be associated with DRMs, which are required for the precise delivery of these proteins to the plasma membrane (25.Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 27.Dupre S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R.

Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Tat2p is a high affinity tryptophan permease whose cellular location is affected by the external tryptophan concentration. At high external tryptophan concentrations, Tat2p membrane proteins are sorted to the early endosomes and subsequently to the vacuole through the late endosomes, whereas at low tryptophan concentrations they are sorted to the plasma membrane (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In erg6 cells, which are defective in the synthesis of ergosterol, Tat2p cannot associate with DRMs and is inappropriately polyubiquitinated and mislocalized to the vacuole even at low tryptophan concentrations (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ubiquitination and association with DRMs may be involved in the regulation of Tat2p sorting and that sterol may participate in this mechanism at the post-Golgi stage. In this report we found that gwt1-10 cells show reduced tryptophan uptake similar to erg6 cells and that this defect is caused by a failure of Tat2p to be recruited to the plasma membrane due to a lack of association with DRMs. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored proteins may play an important role in the transport of membrane proteins that change their cellular localization in response to nutritional conditions.

McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar) and the following primers: for deletion of BUL1, BUL1-F (5′-CGAAAAGAGACTGTTCGTGTGTGTCAACAGGTATATCGTACGCTAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and BUL1-R (5′-ATCTATATCTATAAGAAAAGTAACGAGAATTTTTTCTAATGTTTTTGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′); and for deletion of ERG6, ERG6-F (5′-TTAAAAAAACAAGAATAAAATAATAATATAGTAGGCAGCATAAGCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and ERG6-R (5′-TATATCGTGCGCTTTATTTGAATCTTATTGATCTAGTGAATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′). Deletion of TAT2 was carried out by using pKU41 (kindly provided by K. Umebayashi, National Institute of Genetics) as described previously (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging of Hxt1p was carried out by a PCR-based method using an integrative cassette derived from the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65-T)-TRP1 and primers HXT1-F (5′-ACCTAATGCATGATGACCAACCATTTTACAAGAGTTTGTTTAGCAGGAAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and HXT1-R (5′-TAAATACTGTATAAGTCATTAAAATATGCATATTGAGCTTGTTTAGTTTAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′). Construction of Plasmids—The plasmid to produce the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-tagged Tat2p was constructed as follows. The SpeI-SpeI fragment containing the open reading frame of mRFP was prepared from pBlues-mRFP (kindly provided by T. Sumita, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) and subcloned into the XbaI site of pKU42 (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) containing the TAT2 open reading frame to generate pMO9 (pUCTAT2-mRFP). The PstI-HindIII fragment containing TAT2-mRFP was cloned into the PstI-EcoT22I site of pRS315 (CEN, LEU2) to generate pMO10 (YCpTAT2-mRFP). The plasmid for the expression of TAT2 fused with three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was derived from pKU46 (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The EcoRI-PstI fragment containing TAT2-3HA was blunt-ended using a DNA blunting kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and then inserted into the SmaI site of pRS315 to generate pMO12 (YCpTAT2-3HA). The plasmid to produce the GFP-HDEL fusion was constructed as follows. The Kar2p signal-peptide sequence (the first 135 nucleotides of the KAR2 gene), which bears a SalI site upstream of the initiation codon of KAR2 and a ClaI site at the C terminus, was amplified by PCR and inserted into pBluescript SK+. Next, the GFP gene modified to encode a C-terminal HDEL tetrapeptide, which bears a ClaI site at the N terminus and an XbaI site at the C terminus, was amplified by PCR and inserted into this plasmid. The SalI-XbaI fragment containing KAR2-GFP-HDEL was cloned into the YCp50 expression vector (CEN, URA3), which contains the TDH3 (which encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter and the actin terminator, to generate pMO13. The AatII-SphI fragment containing the TDH3 promoter and KAR2-GFP-HDEL was blunt-ended and then inserted in the SmaI site of pRS314 (CEN, TRP1) to generate pMO14 (YCpGFP-HDEL). The plasmid used to produce the Fur4p-GFP was constructed as follows. The promoter and open reading frame region of FUR4, which has the SpeI site just before the stop codon at the C terminus, was amplified by PCR and inserted into YEp351 (2μ, LEU2) containing a CMK1 terminator. Next, the XbaI-XbaI fragment containing GFP was prepared from pUC119-GFP and inserted into the SpeI site to generate pMO24 (YEpFUR4-GFP). Isolation of gwt1-10 Mutant Cells—Temperature-sensitive alleles of GWT1 were screened by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (15.Umemura M. Okamoto M. Nakayama K. Sagane K. Tsukahara K. Hata K. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23639-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The multiple missense mutations were separated by replacing the homologous fragments of wild-type GWT1, and a gwt1-10 allele containing a single mutation that generates temperature sensitivity was identified. The gwt1-10 allele was subcloned into integration vector pRS306 and then integrated into the ura3 locus on the chromosome of WDG2 cells (36.Tsukahara K. Hata K. Nakamoto K. Sagane K. Watanabe N.A. Kuromitsu J. Kai J. Tsuchiya M. Ohba F. Jigami Y. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were selected, and gwt1-10 cells were identified by segregating with His+, Ura+, and temperature sensitivity selection after the tetrad analysis. [3H]Inositol Labeling of Proteins—Cells were grown to the early logarithmic phase at 24 °C and then incubated at 24 or 16 °C for 12 h. Cells were washed and resuspended in SC inositol-free medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without inositol and amino acids (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented with 5% glucose and nutrient supplements, incubated at 24 °C or 16 °C for 30 min, mixed with 0.74 MBq of myo-[1,2-3H]inositol (1.11 TBq/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO), and incubated at the indicated temperature for 2 h. Proteins and lipids labeled with [3H]inositol were isolated as described previously (15.Umemura M. Okamoto M. Nakayama K. Sagane K. Tsukahara K. Hata K. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23639-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in 65:25:4 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel). Labeled proteins were detected after TLC and electrophoresis using a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Biosynthesis of GPI Precursors in Vitro—ER-enriched membranes were prepared from the cells grown in YPAD medium at 24 °C as described previously (37.Costello L.C. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8599-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (300 μg) were incubated in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm MgCl2) containing 21 μg/ml tunicamycin, 10 μm nikkomycin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 1 mm coenzyme A (CoA), and 1 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding 3.7 kBq of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (10.7 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then incubated for 1 h at 24 or 16°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 1:1 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH to yield a final mixture of 10:10:3 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O. Radiolabeled lipids were separated by centrifugation, and the supernatants were pooled. The pellet was re-extracted with 10:10:3 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O. The confined lipid extracts were dried and desalted by n-butyl alcohol extraction. Radiolabeled lipids were separated by TLC in 10:10:3 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O and detected by autoradiography with a Molecular Imager FX. Tryptophan Uptake Assay—The rate of import of radiolabeled tryptophan was measured as described previously (38.Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to the early logarithmic phase in YPAD medium at 28 °C and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for an assay at 28 °C, and the other was incubated for an additional 8 h at 16 °Cand then used for an assay at 16 °C. Cells were resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.7 in a solution containing 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 2% glucose. The uptake assay was started by mixing 297 μl of cell culture with 3 μl of radiolabeled tryptophan solution (1:100 dilution of 1.11 Bq of [5-3H]tryptophan (1.18 TBq/mmol); Amersham Biosciences) at 28 or 16 °C. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of import reaction mixtures were withdrawn at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 45 min. Cells were filtered onto a Whatman GF/C filter and washed twice with 2 ml of cold water. The bound radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter and corrected for differences in cell density. Isolation of DRMs and Western Immunoblotting—Cells were grown to the logarithmic phase at 25 °C in tryptophan-free or uracil-free SC medium. DRMs for the Tat2p analysis were isolated essentially as described by Umebayashi and Nakano (31.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After incubation with 20 mm CHAPS (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, the lysates were subjected to Optiprep density gradient floatation by centrifuging for 5.5 h at 37,000 rpm in a SW55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C. After centrifugation, nine fractions of equal volume were collected starting from the top. Each fraction was mixed with sample buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blotting (Millipore, Billerica, MA). DRMs for the Fur4p analysis were isolated as described by Dupre and Haguenauer-Tsapis (27.Dupre S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Traffic. 2003; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out using anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Berkeley Antibody Co., Berkeley, CA), anti-GFP monoclonal antibody JL-8 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), anti-Pma1p monoclonal antibody MCA-40B7 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or anti-vacuolar alkali phosphatase monoclonal antibody 1D3-A10 (Molecular Probes) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). An ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the immunoreactive proteins. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 24 °C in SD medium with low SO42- concentration (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% casamino acids, 5% glucose, nutrient supplements, and 200 μm ammonium sulfate). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in SO42- medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose, nutrient supplements) lacking tryptophan at 10 A600 eq/ml. Cells were incubated at 24 or 37 °C for 10 min and then labeled with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine/cysteine (37 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) per A600 equivalent of cells for 40 min at each temperature. Radiolabeled proteins were subjected to CHAPS extraction and density gradient floatation as described above (see “Isolation of DRMs and Western Immunoblotting”). Fractions 2 and 3 were separated as insoluble fractions, and fractions 7 and 8 were soluble fractions. For immunoprecipitation of Tat2-3HAp and Gas1p, each fraction was divided in two halves, one of which was used for immunoprecipitation of Tat2-3HAp and the other for immunoprecipitation of Gas1p. After adding SDS (final 1%), the samples for immunoprecipitation of Tat2-3HAp were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and those of Gas1p were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were diluted in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% TX-100) and precleared with Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. After removal of Sepharose CL-4B by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of anti-HA antibody-bound affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) or 1:150 rabbit anti-Gas1p antibody (kindly provided by K.

https://openalex.org/W2116801690,"Androgens are important for male sexual development, which depend on the cognate receptor, the androgen receptor. The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor, like other nuclear receptors, is regulated by accessory proteins that can have either positive or negative effects. Through a yeast functional screen, we have identified SUMO-3 as a regulator of androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells. SUMO-3 is one of three eukaryotic proteins that become post-translationally conjugated to their target proteins in a manner analogous to the attachment of ubiquitin. In primary prostate epithelial cells, PrEC, and the prostate cancer cells, PC-3, SUMO-3 has a weak negative effect on androgen receptor transcriptional activity. In contrast, SUMO-3 and it close relative SUMO-2 strongly enhance transactivation by endogenous androgen receptor in LNCaP cells. This positive effect is observed in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Interestingly, SUMO-1, unlike SUMO-3 and SUMO-2, can inhibit, but not stimulate, androgen receptor activity. Mutational analysis of the androgen receptor and SUMO-3 demonstrates that the SUMO-3-positive activity does not depend on either the sumoylation sites of the androgen receptor or the sumoylation function of SUMO-3. Stable overexpression of SUMO-3 in LNCaP cells significantly enhances the androgen-dependent proliferation of these cells. Additionally, siRNA-mediated repression of SUMO-2 significantly inhibits the growth of both androgen-dependent and -independent LNCaP cells. Collectively, these results suggest (i) a novel mechanism for elevating AR activity through the switch of SUMO-3 from a weak negative regulator in normal prostate cells to a strong positive regulator in prostate cancer cells and (ii) a proliferative role for SUMO-3 and SUMO-2 in the growth of prostate cancer cells that is independent of sumoylation of the androgen receptor.

Through the regulation of target genes, androgens and AR play an essential role in male sexual development and the proper development and function of male reproductive organs, such as prostate and epididymis (7.Linzey J. Kumar M.J. Grossman M. Tindall D.J. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 383-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Patients with 5α-reductase II deficiency, which results in low levels of DHT, have ambiguous external genitalia and a highly underdeveloped and impalpable prostate (8.Thigpen A.E. Davis D.L. Milatovich A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9.Wilson J.D. Griffin J.E. Russell D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 577-593PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction or loss of AR activity in males results in androgen insensitivity syndrome (10.Quigley C.A. Belli D. Marschke A. el-Awady K.B. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to normal prostate development, AR is essential for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. The best demonstration of this is the effectiveness of anti-androgen and androgen ablation therapy in inhibiting the development of prostate cancer in the early stage of the disease (11.Suzuki H. Ueda T. Ichikawa T. Ito H. Endocr. Cancer. 2003; 10: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, local recurrences and metastases will eventually develop in most, if not all, patients after therapy, and prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent (12.Savarese D.M. Halabi S. Hars V. Akerley W.L. Taplin M.E. Godley P.A. Hussain A. Small E.J. Vogelzang N.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Since AR is expressed in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer, this receptor is probably involved in the progression to androgen independence. Moreover, it has been determined that about 10–20% of prostate tumors harbor mutations in the AR gene, and the frequency of mutation generally is higher in androgen-independent, metastatic tumors compared with untreated lower grade primary tumors (13.Suzuki H.

Like other nuclear receptors, the AR is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (19.Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar), acetylation (20.Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Angelletti R. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Sumoylation represents an important post-translational modification system that regulates the activity of many transcriptional regulators (reviewed in Ref. 23.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The continually growing list includes not only AR but also other nuclear receptors and transcriptional activators, coactivators, and corepressors (reviewed in Ref. 24.Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The biological functions of sumoylation include protein subcellular translocation, subnuclear structure formation, and modulation of transcriptional activity (reviewed in Ref. 25.Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Sumoylation depends upon the activity of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), a protein moiety that is conjugated to a specific lysine residue on target proteins (reviewed in Ref. 23.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Three SUMO family members exist, SUMO-1/Smt3C, SUMO-2/Smt3A, and SUMO-3/Smt3B, and all are ubiquitously expressed in mammals (27.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 28.Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). At the amino acid level, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 87% identical but only ∼50% identical to SUMO-1 (27.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although they exhibit low homology in amino acid sequence, SUMO-1 and ubiquitin are structurally related and share significant similarity in secondary and tertiary structures (29.Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that the processes of sumoylation and ubiquitination are mechanistically similar (reviewed in Ref. 24.Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Like ubiquitination, the conjugation of SUMO is mediated by a series of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that are distinct from those enzymes that catalyze ubiquitination (27.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The SUMO E1 enzymes SAE1 (SUMO-activating enzyme) and SAE2 activate SUMO and transfer it to the E2 enzyme Ubc9, which then directs the conjugated SUMO to its target substrates (27.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In vitro evidence has indicated that Ubc9 is sufficient for binding to the SUMO acceptor site and efficiently transferring SUMO to selected targets (27.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence shows that a specific E3 ligase might be required for efficient sumoylation in vivo. Three classes of proteins have been identified to have SUMO E3 ligase activity: the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family proteins (30.Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31.Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the polycomb protein Pc2 (32.Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and RanBP2 (Ran-binding protein 2) (33.Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The PIAS proteins are reported to act as SUMO-E3 ligases for the SUMO-1 conjugation to AR in vivo and in vitro (34.Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), resulting in inhibition of AR transcriptional activity (22.Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that the PIAS proteins can have multiple effects on AR activity, depending on the type of PIAS protein, promoter, and cells (reviewed in Ref. 35.Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The PIAS family is composed of several homologous proteins, including PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy. Nishida et al. (34.Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) showed that AR-dependent transcription is either repressed by PIAS1 and PIASxα in the presence of exogenous SUMO-1 and PIAS RING finger-like domain or enhanced in the absence of sumoylation. PIAS3 inhibits AR transactivation in LNCaP and HeLa cells but enhances AR activity in HepG2 and AR-overexpressing LNCaP cells (36.Gross M. Liu B. Tan J. French F.S. Carey M. Shuai K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37.Kotaja N. Aittomaki S. Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Mol.

Commun. 2000; 278: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ubc9, the SUMO E2 enzyme, can stimulate AR transcriptional activity that is independent of its ability to catalyze SUMO-1 conjugation (39.Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Karvonen U. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19441-19446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the enzymes of the sumoylation pathway can have diverse effects on AR activity. We add to this diversity with the current study, in which we show that SUMO-3 can have a negative or strongly positive effect on AR, depending on the type of prostate cancer cells. Further, the positive effect does not depend on either the sumoylation sites of AR or the sumoylation function of SUMO-3. Finally, SUMO-1 is different from either SUMO-3 or SUMO-2, because it is unable to enhance AR activity. Plasmids—For mammalian expression, AR and c-Jun in pSG-5 have been described (40.Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3839-38349Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). SUMO-3, SUMO-2, and SUMO-1 (generous gifts from Dr. T. Nishimoto) were expressed from the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV-FLAG (41.Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr.

Chambon) has been described (44.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). FLAG-SUMO3/pCI-Neo was constructed by first excising SUMO-3 from FLAG-SUMO3/pCMV with EcoRI/SmaI and inserting it into the pCI-Neo vector digested with EcoRI/SmaI. Then the FLAG segment was inserted into SUMO-3/pCI-Neo digested with EcoRI/XbaI. The FLAG segment was the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCAT-3′. SUMO-3(ΔGG) was constructed by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-AATTGATGTGTTCCAACAGCAGACGTGACCC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCACGTCTGCTGTTGGAACACATC-3′ (from Integrated DNA Technology) and inserting into FLAG-SUMO-3 digested with SmaI and MfeI. The reporter plasmids used in mammalian cells have the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by different promoters. The AR-inducible reporter plasmid MMTV-CAT (40.Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3839-38349Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and ARE3-E1B-CAT (generous gift from Dr. E. Sanchez) (45.Sanchez E.R. Hu J.L. Zhong S. Shen P. Greene M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocr. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are described previously. For the yeast functional screen, LexA-AR(AB) was constructed by digestion of the AB region out of AR(AB)/pTL1NLS (46.Bubulya A. Wise S.C. Shen X.Q. Burmeister L.A. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and BglI and inserting into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEG202 (47.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). All newly generated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (done by the Ohio State University Plant Microbe Genomics Facility). Cell Transfection and CAT Assays—PC-3 cells were maintained in F12K medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone). LNCaP (androgen-dependent and -independent cells) and DU145 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. PrEC cells were maintained in the PrEGM medium (Clonetics). C33 and C81 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Lin) (48.Igawa T. Lin F.F. Lee M-S. Karan D. Batra S.K. Lin M-F. Prostate. 2002; 50: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI1640 medium with 5% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 0.5% gentamycin. All cells were cultured with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. These cell lines were grown in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FBS and 0.1 mg/ml neomycin. β-Galactosidase assay and CAT assay were described previously (40.Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3839-38349Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For transient transfection of LNCaP and DU145 cells, cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in RPMI1640 complete medium. Four hours before transfection, medium was changed to RPMI1640 with 5% FBS (dextran-coated charcoal-treated). Transient transfection was performed with FuGene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). DHT was added 24 h after transfection. LNCaP and DU145 cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI1640 with 5% FBS (dextran-coated charcoal-treated) with or without DHT, respectively. Reporter analysis (β-galactosidase assay and CAT assay) were done after the incubation. For PC-3 cells, transient transfection was performed with the calcium phosphate precipitation (CaPO4) method (49.Shenk J.L. Fisher C.J. Chen S.Y. Zhou X.F. Tillman K. Shemshedini L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38472-38479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In PrEC cells, transient transfection was performed with FuGene6 in PrEGM medium. Transfection efficiency was standardized by measuring β-galactosidase activity, originating from the co-transfected plasmid pCH110 (2 μg). Note that for all transfections, empty expression plasmid was used to bring the final plasmid amount to 9 μg/transfection. CAT activity was quantified by scanning with the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX of autoradiograms of three independent replicates for each transfection. Thus, each CAT value represents the average of three repetitions plus the S.D. siRNA Transfections—LNCaP and C81 cells were transfected with a SUMO-2 siRNA (5′-GGGAUGAAUCUGUAACUUAtt-3′ and anti-sense oligonucleotide) (purchased from Ambion). A luciferase siRNA with 42% GC content was used as control siRNA (GL3 siRNA from Dharmacon). The X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent was used to transfect siRNA into cells following the prescribed protocol (Roche Applied Science). Generation of Stable Cell Lines—LNCaP cells were grown in 100-mm dishes with 10 ml of RPMI1640 complete medium until 60–70% confluence, and then cells were transfected with 2 mg of FLAG-SUMO3/pCI-Neo. The transfection was done with FuGene6 described above. After a 48-h incubation, the LNCaP cells were selected in RPMI1640 complete medium containing 0.9 mg/ml neomycin. The medium was refreshed every 4 days until individual colonies appeared. The generation of stable LNCaP cell lines C14 and AJ6 and PC-3 lines C-3, A-103, and V-28 has been described (50.Chen S.Y. The Role of Human Androgen Receptor in the Growth and Survival of Prostate Cancer Cells. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH2002Google Scholar). The AJ6 LNCaP cells stably express antisense c-Jun. C14 is a control LNCaP cell line stably transfected with an empty pCI-Neo vector. A-103 cells stably express AR, V-28 cells express a fusion protein containing AR and the VP16 activation domain (51.Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and C-3 cells were transfected with empty PCI-neo vector. Cellular Proliferation Assay—8 × 104 LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well plates with 5 ml of RPMI1640 medium containing 2% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS. After a 2-day incubation, either ethanol (vehicle control) or 100 nm DHT was added into the wells. After an additional 2, 4, or 6 days of incubation, the MTT assay was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Cell number was quantified by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm. Note that bar graphs represent the averages of thee independent experiments plus S.D. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, COS and LNCaP cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and subjected to transfection. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described (52.Bubulya A. Chen S.Y. Fisher C.J. Zheng Z. Shen X.Q. Shemshedini L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44704-44711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose blots were probed with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), anti-AR antibody PA1-111A (Affinity Bioreagents), or anti-β-actin AC-15 (Abcam). The ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to develop the Western blots. Northern Blot Analysis—A multiple human tissue blot was obtained from Clontech (catalog no. 7761-1) and probed for SUMO-3 mRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—To prepare RNA for the RT reaction, total RNA from LNCaP, PC-3, or PrEC cultured cells was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For the RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) assays, cDNA was prepared from the isolated RNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fisher). The PCRs were carried out using primers specific for the mRNA: the upstream primer 5′-GGGCAACCAATCAATGAAAC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AGTCAGGATGTGGTGGAACC-3′ (SUMO-3), the upstream primer 5′-CTGGCCCTCAAGCATGTAAC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AAATCTGAGGCCACAACACC-3′ (SUMO-2), the upstream primer 5′-ACCGTCATCATGTCTGACCA-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TGGAACACCCTGTCTTTGAC-3′ (SUMO-1); the upstream primer 5′-TCATAAGCAGCGACCTTGTG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-ACCGAAGGAAGAGACCCTGT-3′ (Ubc9); the upstream primer 5′-CTTCTTGTCGGCTTGAAAGG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-ACCATGGGGTTGAGATTCTG-3′ (SAE1); the upstream primer 5′-GACAGAGCTGACCCTGAAGC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TTTTCCGCCATAGTTTGTCC-3′ (SAE2). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers (upstream primer 5′-CGACCACTTTGTCAAGCTCA-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTG-3′) were used in the RT-PCR as a control. RT-PCR was carried out for 30 cycles using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoretically separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Yeast Transformation for the Functional Screen—The yeast transformation protocol was described previously (53.Shen X.Q. Bubulya A. Zhou X.F. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 281-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-ml culture of YPH499/pSH18–34 (47.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was grown and transformed with AR(AB)/pEG202 in Glu/CM–Ura–His liquid dropout medium overnight at 30 °C. The culture was diluted into a 300-ml Glu/CM–Ura–His liquid dropout medium with 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 30 °C until A600 reading reached 0.5, after which it was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000–1500 × g. The liquid was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of TE buffer, 0.1 m lithium acetate. 1 μg of P19 library (54.Howell B.W. Afar D.E. Lew J. Douville E.M. Icely P.L. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and 50 μg of high quality sheared salmon sperm carrier DNA were added to each of 30 sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. 50 μl of the resuspended yeast cells were added to each tube, and they were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and Me2SO was then added to 10%. The samples were heat-shocked for 10 min at 42 °C. For 28 tubes, the complete content of one tube was added per 24 × 24-cm Glu/CM–Ura–His–Leu/X-Gal dropout plate and incubated at 30 °C. For the remaining two tubes, 360 μl of each tube was spread on 24 × 24-cm Glu/CM–Ura–His–Leu/X-Gal dropout plate. The remaining 40 μl from each tube was used to make a series of 1:10 dilution in sterile water. Dilutions were plated on 100-mm Glu/CM–Ura–His–Leu dropout plates. All plates were incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared (2–3 days). Colonies were monitored for color (blue or white). Among 300,000 transformed colonies, nine white colonies appeared on the X-gal medium. Plasmid was isolated from each of the white colonies and used for retransformation. Only four of the isolated plasmids were able to cause a white phenotype upon retransformation. DNA sequencing showed that one of the four plasmids matched the open reading frame of mouse SUMO-3, as well as the part of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region. Yeast Liquid β-Galactosidase Assay—A single yeast colony was inoculated in 3 ml of YPD (or appropriate selective) medium and incubated overnight at 30 °C. 20–50 μl of each overnight culture was inoculated in 4 ml of YPD medium (or appropriate selective medium and/or inducing conditions) and grown to middle or late log phase. This was subjected to a liquid β-galactosidase assay using 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as described (55.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1998; 2 (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). DNA Sequencing Analysis—cDNA fragment was isolated from the positive clones using the Yeastmaker™ Yeast Plasmid Isolation Kit (BD Biosciences) and amplified using the upstream oligonucleotide 5′-GTTTTTCAAGTTCTTAGATG-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotide 5′-CTGGCAATTCCTTACCTTCC-3′ (Integrated DNA Technology). DNA sequencing for the nine putative cDNA clones was carried out using the same primers (sequencing done by Ohio State University Plant Microbe Genomics Facility). SUMO-3 Was Identified Using a Yeast Functional Screen—In an effort to identify novel repressors of AR, we developed a modified yeast two-hybrid system that we call a “yeast functional screen.” Like the yeast two-hybrid system, the yeast functional screen depends on a fusion protein containing the LexA DNA-binding domain fused to a protein of interest and the LexA-responsive LacZ reporter (47.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Unlike the yeast two-hybrid system, the protein of interest must have strong transcriptional activity so that all yeast colonies expressing this fusion protein will become blue when grown on X-gal plates. Expression of a protein that blocks the transcriptional activity of the protein of interest will cause yeast colonies to remain white (Fig. 1A). In the present study, the AR(AB) region acted as a bait protein and exhibited strong transcriptional activity in yeast, compared with t"
https://openalex.org/W2123429740,"Three-dimensional structures are not available for polysaccharide synthases and only minimal information on the molecular basis for catalysis is known. The Pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase (PmHAS) catalyzes the polymerization of the alternating β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine-β1,4-glucuronic acid sugar chain by the sequential addition of single monosaccharides to the non-reducing terminus. Therefore, PmHAS possesses both GlcNAc-transferase and glucuronic acid (GlcUA)-transferase activities. The recombinant Escherichia coli-derived PmHAS enzyme will elongate exogenously supplied hyaluronan chains in vitro with either a single monosaccharide or a long chain depending on the UDP-sugar availability. Competition studies using pairs of acceptors with distinct termini (where one oligosaccharide is a substrate that may be elongated, whereas the other cannot) were performed here; the lack of competition suggests that PmHAS contains at least two distinct acceptor sites. We hypothesize that the size of the acceptor binding pockets of the enzyme corresponds to the size of the smallest high efficiency substrates; thus we tested the relative activity of a series of authentic hyaluronan oligosaccharides and related structural analogs. The GlcUA-transferase site readily elongates (GlcNAc-GlcUA)2, whereas the GlcNAc-transferase elongates GlcUA-Glc-NAc-GlcUA. The minimally sized oligosaccharides, elongated with high efficiency, both contain a trisaccharide with two glucuronic acid residues that enabled the identification of a synthetic, artificial acceptor for the synthase. PmHAS behaves as a fusion of two complete glycosyltransferases, each containing a donor site and an acceptor site, in one polypeptide. Overall, this information advances the knowledge of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as well as assists the creation of various therapeutic sugars for medical applications in the future.

Overall, this information advances the knowledge of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as well as assists the creation of various therapeutic sugars for medical applications in the future. Glycosaminoglycans, linear chains composed of alternating disaccharide repeats containing a hexosamine, are a class of heteropolysaccharides that includes hyaluronan (HA), 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan, hyaluronic acid, or hyaluronate; PmHAS, P. multocida hyaluronan synthase; PmCS, P. multocida Type F chondroitin synthase; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; MP, methoxyphenol. heparin, chondroitin, and keratan. These carbohydrates serve essential roles in vertebrates, including as intracellular adhesives, signaling molecules, anticoagulants, and structural elements. Certain pathogenic bacteria take advantage of these versatile molecules to produce extracellular glycosaminoglycan capsules, thus constructing molecular camouflage to avoid host defenses and increase virulence. The bacterial Pasteurella multocida synthases are dual action enzymes that add both sugars of the glycosaminoglycan repeat to the non-reducing terminus of the acceptor oligosaccharides (1DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P. multocida Type A hyaluronan synthase PmHAS and the P. multocida Type F chondroitin synthase PmCS have been amenable to study due to their two active center architectures (2Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), their ability to polymerize long chains in vitro (4DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli K4 chondroitin polymerase KfoC (7Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is ∼60% identical to PmHAS and PmCS; therefore, this system probably operates in a similar fashion. The recently described P. multocida heparosan synthases, one from Type D (PmHS1) (8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and another cryptic enzyme from Types A, D, and F (PmHS2) (9DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), promise to be interesting experimental models of dual action enzymes as well, but their overall amino acid sequence appears to differ from PmHAS and PmCS. In general, enzymological studies of glycosyltransferases have focused on the catalytic residues, the donor binding site, and the acceptor binding site. Structural information on some “simple” glycosyltransferases that add only one sugar to a glycoconjugate has been obtained, but a structure has not been determined for a dual action enzyme or a polysaccharide synthase. PmHAS and PmCS each appear to possess an independent hexosamine donor transfer site and a glucuronic acid donor transfer site (2Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the nature and the number of sugar acceptor sites has not been determined. As a first step to analyze the acceptor site(s), here we have tested a range of acceptor sugars that PmHAS will elongate with the HA chain. We speculate that the size of the synthase acceptor binding pocket corresponds roughly to the size of the smallest high efficiency substrate. Our findings have allowed us to determine the optimal length of the sugar polymer necessary for efficient chain elongation and to design a synthetic, artificial acceptor for the synthase enzyme. In addition, we have indirect evidence for two distinct acceptor sites in PmHAS. Reagents and Enzyme Preparation—All reagents were of the highest grade available from either Sigma or Fisher, unless otherwise noted. The soluble, truncated dual action PmHAS1–703 enzyme was prepared by chromatography as described previously (10Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant cells expressing PmHAS1–703 were extracted with 1% (w/v) octyl thioglucoside in 1 m ethylene glycol and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. The clarified extract was purified on a Toyopearl Red AF resin (Tosoh, Montgomeryville, PA) column. The protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 m ethylene glycol with 0–1.5 m NaCl gradient in 1 h). The peak fractions with PmHAS, as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The protein content was quantitated by the Bradford assay (Pierce) with a bovine serum albumin standard. The final preparations were typically ∼95% pure PmHAS based on staining of the gels. Sugar Acceptor Substrates—The HA4 tetrasaccharide (with GlcUA at the non-reducing terminus) was derived from exhaustive digestion of HA (streptococcal) with testicular hyaluronidase (Type V), chloroform solvent extraction, and gel chromatography on P2 resin (Bio-Rad) (11DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Longer natural HA oligosaccharides (HA14, 15, 20, and 21) were synthesized chemoenzymatically from HA4 and UDP-sugars using immobilized enzyme reactors (11DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A series of HA-like oligosaccharides were synthesized by organic chemistry methodology; each sugar contained a para-methoxyphenyl group at the reducing end (12Halkes K.M. Slaghek T.M. Hypponen T.K. Kruiskamp P.H. Ogawa T. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 309: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For simplicity, a coding scheme was used to designate each monosaccharide: GlcUA, A; GlcNAc, N; methoxyphenyl, MP. For example, the compound AN-MP refers to GlcUA-GlcNAc-MP as read from non-reducing end to reducing end. Various synthetic glycosides were purchased, and again the simple coding scheme was applied: fluorescein mono-β-d-glucuronide, A-F; fluorescein di-β-d-glucuronide, A-F-A (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); fluorescein di-β-d-glucopyranoside, G-F-G (Molecular Probes); fluorescein di-β-d-N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc-F-GalNAc (Marker Gene Technologies, Eugene, OR); 1-naphthyl β-d-glucuronide, A-NAP; p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide, A-NP (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-galacturonide, GalA-NP; 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide, A-MUM; β-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide, A-F3MUM (Molecular Probes); 3-carboxyumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide, A-CU (Molecular Probes); 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, N-MUM; and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside, G-MUM. Single Sugar Addition Assays—The assays monitored the transfer of either (a) a single GlcUA to an acceptor with a non-reducing end terminating in GlcNAc according to the reaction,nUDP-GlcUA+nGlcNAc-X→nGlcUA-GlcNAc-X+nUDP or (b) a single GlcNAc to an acceptor with a non-reducing end terminating in GlcUA according to the reaction,nUDP-GlcNAc+nGlcUA-X→nGlcNac-GlcUA-X+nUDP where X = the remainder of the acceptor molecule. PmHAS (0.4 μm) was assayed in 25-μl reactions containing a titration of one of the various acceptors, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 m ethylene glycol, and either 1 mm UDP-[3H]GlcUA (0.15 μCi) or 1 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (0.15 μCi) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. Control assays without any acceptor were also performed in parallel; this background value was subtracted from the value obtained in the acceptor-containing assays. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for various times ranging from 4 to 1260 min. Enzyme activity was linear with respect to time, and the reactions consumed <5% of the UDP-sugar substrate. All assay points were performed in duplicate, and the values were averaged. The data were plotted using the Michaelis-Menten equation (V = Vmax [substrate]/Km + [substrate]) with Sigma Plot software (Rockware, Golden, CO), where the apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) were derived from the concentration of sugar that yields 50% of maximal incorporation. When the acceptor possessed a hydrophobic aglycone (e.g. MP, F, etc.), reversed phase solid phase extraction was employed to separate the products from the reactants. Descending paper chromatography was utilized when native HA was longer than HA14 (polymer size that is completely retained at the origin, thus facilitating single sugar transfer assays). For solid phase extraction analysis, reactions were terminated by placing on ice and diluting with 275 μl of ice-cold 1 m NaCl. The free unincorporated UDP-[3H]sugar precursors were separated from the elongated reaction products using reversed phase cartridges (Strata-X polymeric 33-μm resin; 30 mg of sorbent/1-ml cartridge; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and a vacuum manifold. When passing solvents through the column, the bed was not allowed to dry until directly before and after the elution step. The columns were sequentially conditioned with 1 ml each of 100% methanol, 50% methanol, and water. The columns were equilibrated with 1 ml of 1 m NaCl, and then samples in 1 m NaCl were added to the sorbent bed. The columns were washed with 7 ml of 1 m NaCl allowing retention of the methoxyphenol or hydrophobic compounds and the removal of UDP-[3H]sugars. After completing the NaCl wash, the column bed was air-dried for 30 s with vacuum suction. To release the acceptors from the sorbent, the columns were eluted with 2 ml of 50% methanol. BioSafe II mixture (4 ml) (Research Products International, Chicago, IL) was added to 1 ml of the eluted sample, and incorporation of the [3H]sugars was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For descending paper chromatography analysis, reactions were terminated by adding SDS to a final concentration of 2% and then spotted onto strips of Whatman No. 3MM paper, and the reaction products at the origin were separated from the free UDP-[3H]sugars by development with 65:35 ethanol/1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, overnight (2Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The origins were cut from the paper strips and eluted in 750 μl of water for 1 h. BioSafe II mixture (4 ml) was added, and incorporation of the [3H]sugars was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. HA Polymerization Assays—The PmHAS-catalyzed polymerization assay measured the incorporation of both GlcUA and GlcNAc onto acceptors to form longer HA chains as innUDP-GlcNAc+nUDP-GlcUA+nX→n(GlcNAc-GlcUA)n-X+2nUDPornUDP-GlcNAc+nUDP-GlcUA+nX→n(GlcUA-GlcNAc)n-X+2nUDP where X = the acceptor (exact product depends on the identity of the acceptor non-reducing terminus). PmHAS polymerization activity was assayed under the identical conditions as the single sugar addition assay, except 1 mm UDP-[3H]GlcUA (0.15 μCi) and 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc were present simultaneously. Descending paper chromatography was used to measure incorporation as described above. The experiments were performed in duplicate, and data points were averaged, unless otherwise noted. Sugar Competition Assays—To assess the number of acceptor sites within the PmHAS polypeptide, we devised competition experiments between two distinct oligosaccharides, each having a different non-reducing terminal sugar; HA14 terminates in GlcUA, whereas HA15 terminates in GlcNAc. Both oligosaccharides were present simultaneously in a 3–4-min reaction, with only one type of radiolabeled UDP-sugar nucleotide. In this situation, one oligosaccharide served as the acceptor substrate molecule and the other as the potential competitor molecule that cannot be extended. For example, in one experiment with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, HA14 (0.25 mm) functioned as the acceptor for the addition of the GlcNAc moiety, whereas HA15 served as the potential competitor. In the converse experiment with UDP-[3H]GlcUA, HA15 (0.15 mm) served as the acceptor for the addition of the GlcUA monosaccharide, whereas HA14 functioned as the potential competitor. The reactions without a potential competitor (only the acceptor with the appropriate non-reducing terminus) were run in parallel and served as the “100% activity” value. The products of the reactions were analyzed by paper chromatography. Analysis of in Vitro Synthesized HA—The synthetic molecule A-F-A was used as the acceptor to synchronize the synthesis of HA. Reaction conditions were 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 m ethylene glycol, 12.2 mm UDP-GlcUA, 12.2 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 14 μm PmHAS plus A-F-A acceptor at three different concentrations (8, 80, and 800 μm) in a total volume of 25 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C overnight. The size of the products was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2%; 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA); 30 V) and Stains-All dye detection (0.005% w/v in ethanol) (13Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Select-HA Lo and Hi Ladders composed of monodisperse HA polymers (10Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were used as standards for size estimates (Hyalose, Oklahoma City, OK). To assess the authenticity of the HA linkages, portions of the reactions were treated with Streptomyces HA lyase, an enzyme that degrades no other glycosaminoglycan except HA. The pH value for the reaction was adjusted to pH 6 by the addition of sodium acetate (50 mm final). The reaction was boiled for 1 min at 95 °C and centrifuged to remove PmHAS. After overnight incubation with Streptomyces lyase, the sample was loaded onto the agarose gel. To ascertain the presence of the aglycone in the product polymer chains, the reactions were adjusted to 0.2 m sodium nitrate and analyzed by high performance gel filtration chromatography on a Polysep 4000 column (1 ml/min, 0.2 m sodium nitrate; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with UV light absorbance detection at 272 nm for the A-F-A glycone. Fluorescent dextran standards with molecular masses of 4, 12, 50, and 580 kDa were used as calibrants (detection 490 nm). The masses of products formed after reaction of A-F-A with PmHAS and UDP-GlcNAc were measured by mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectra were obtained using a Voyager Elite DE mass spectrometer. The sample in water (1 μl of ∼0.01 μg/μl oligosaccharide) was spotted on a target plate followed by 1 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile, 49.9% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and then mixed and vacuum-dried. The samples were analyzed using a negative ion reflectron mode with the following parameters: acceleration, 20 kV; low mass gate, 400 Da; and delayed extraction, 200 ns. Catalytic Activities of PmHAS Transferase Sites—PmHAS has been shown previously to possess two relatively independent glycosyltransferase activities (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, glucuronic acidyl: β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase = GlcNAc-transferase and UDP-glucuronic acid, N-acetylglucosaminyl: β(1,3)glucuronic acidyltransferase = GlcUA-transferase) within a single polypeptide chain (2Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To directly compare the catalytic activities of the PmHAS GlcNAc-transferase site and GlcUA-transferase site, we performed parallel time course experiments monitoring the two single sugar addition reactions. For GlcNAc-transferase activity, HA22, an acceptor that possesses a GlcUA at the non-reducing terminus, was employed with the UDP-[3H]GlcNAc donor. HA21, an acceptor that terminates in GlcNAc, was utilized with the UDP-[3H]GlcUA donor for the GlcUA-transferase activity. The HA21 and HA22 oligosaccharides were chosen to mimic a long nascent HA polysaccharide chain but not cause the viscosity of the reaction mixture to increase. Portions of the reactions were removed at various times, quenched, and analyzed by descending paper chromatography (Fig. 1). The rate of each transferase activity corresponds to the slope (average ΔV/Δtime) at the initial phase of the reaction. The initial velocity of the GlcUA-transferase activity (6.5 nmol/min) was much more rapid (∼20-fold) than the GlcNAc-transferase activity (0.32 nmol/min). These values translate to an enzyme turnover number of 10 and 0.5 substrate molecules/s, respectively; for comparison, the turnover numbers for two well studied enzymes, DNA polymerase and hen egg lysozyme, are 15 and 0.5, respectively. Evidence for Two Acceptor Binding Sites—Although there is information regarding the PmHAS UDP-sugar donor binding sites, the number of acceptor binding sites was not known, and there is no precedent in the literature on any dual action glycosyltransferases. We performed a series of competition assays to detect the presence of single or multiple acceptor binding sites within the PmHAS polypeptide. In these reactions, one oligosaccharide (HA14 or 15) served as the acceptor for the appropriate radiolabeled UDP-sugar (UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GlcUA for even length or odd length HA polymers, respectively). The HA14 and HA15 oligosaccharides are convenient acceptors for paper chromatography assays that remain at the origin, allowing the facile monitoring of the single monosaccharide addition. The potential competitor oligosaccharide, which is incapable of being extended due to the lack of the appropriate UDP-sugar in the reaction, was introduced into the reaction at equimolar or 10-fold higher concentrations. For example, the PmHAS GlcNAc-transferase activity was measured for (i) HA14 alone (defined as 100% activity), (ii) 1:1 HA14 to HA15 (a potential competitor that ends in a GlcNAc and therefore cannot be extended), and (iii) 1:10 HA14 to HA15. Conversely, the PmHAS GlcUA-transferase activity was measured for (i) HA15 alone (again 100% activity), (ii) 1:1 HA15 to HA14, and (iii) 1:10 HA15 to HA14. Essentially, in these reactions, the competitor oligosaccharide could potentially bind to an acceptor site, but elongation by the supplied UDP-sugar is impossible. In Table 1, the lack of inhibition by the oligosaccharide with the inappropriate non-reducing termini suggests that PmHAS possesses at least two independent acceptor binding sites.TABLE 1Competition studies of GlcUA- or GlcNAc-terminated acceptors with PmHASExperimentAcceptorCompetitorRatioGlcNAc-transferase activityGlcUA-transferase activity%IHA14None100NAHA14HA151:1110NAHA14HA151:10150NAHA15NoneNA100HA15HA141:1NA93HA15HA141:10NA99IIHA14None100NAHA14HA151:1140NAHA14HA151:10160NAHA15NoneNA100HA15HA141:1NA98HA15HA141:10NA82 Open table in a new tab Analysis of HA Sugars as Acceptors for PmHAS—To determine the minimal acceptor structure necessary for efficient HA elongation, we investigated two series of authentic, synthetic hyaluronan ([β4GlcUA-β3GlcNAc]n = [AN]n or [β3GlcNAc-β4GlcUA]n = [NA]n) oligosaccharides containing a MP group at the reducing termini (Fig. 2). The use of sugars with (a) a non-reducing termini ending in GlcUA or (b) a non-reducing termini ending in GlcNAc allows the probing of both putative acceptor sites in the model. The relative activity of the MP sugars, including AN-MP, ANA-MP, ANAN-MP, ANANAN-MP, N-MP, NA-MP, NAN-MP, NANA-MP, and NANAN-MP, were tested. The hydrophobicity of the methoxyphenol group of these HA-related oligosaccharides permits the use of solid phase extraction with a reverse phase sorbent for facile analysis of single sugars to small molecule acceptors. Fig. 3 depicts a uniform, representative data set of all of the methoxyphenol sugars from two independent experiments. For the GlcUA-transferase activity, the tetrasaccharide NANA-MP and longer served as efficient acceptors for PmHAS-catalyzed elongation (i.e. rapid reactions (4 min) and low concentrations (1–2 mm) (Fig. 3A). Conversely, for the GlcNAc-transferase activity, the trisaccharide ANA-MP and longer were efficient acceptors (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two possible methoxyphenol disaccharides and NAN-MP were poor substrates that required longer times (30–60 min) and higher concentrations (10–30 mm) to detect sugar transfer. However, the worst acceptor, N-MP, may be elongated after extensive reactions (Table 2); thin-layer chromatography analysis of the solid phase extraction-purified product verified that this low level of activity was indeed true sugar addition and not simply an assay background problem (data not shown).TABLE 2PmHAS velocities (V) for methoxyphenol sugars and synthetic acceptorsSugarV (2 mm)V (10 mm)nmol/minAN-MP0.0013 ± 0.0005ANA-MP0.11ANAN-MP0.34ANANAN-MP0.22A-F-A0.091N-MP0.000055NA-MP0.0043NAN-MP0.0056 ± 0.002NANA-MP0.47 ± 0.14NANAN-MP1.8 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Synthetic Analogs as Acceptors for PmHAS—The data generated from the activity of the methoxyphenol sugars in elongation assays suggested a requirement of two GlcUA sugars for the high efficiency acceptors and thus enzyme recognition and/or utilization. Recently, with characterization of the PmHAS enzyme’s usage of HA-like analogs with unnatural hexosamine sugars, the hydrophobic interaction appears to be involved in binding or in catalysis. 3K. J. Williams, F. M. Haller, and P. L. DeAngelis, unpublished data. To confirm the significance of these putative critical structural elements of acceptors for PmHAS, multiple GlcUA groups, and a hydrophobic moiety on the hexosamine, we tested a variety of commercially available, synthetic analogs. A collection of hydrophobic glycosides were tested as PmHAS acceptors: A-F, A-F-A, G-F-G, GalNAc-F-GalNAc, A-NAP, A-NP, GalA-NP, A-MUM, N-MUM, Gluc-MUM, A-F3MUM, and A-CU. Most of the substrates tested were poor PmHAS acceptors, as seen by the production of no or small amounts of elongation products, even after utilizing extensive reaction times and/or high concentrations. However, A-F-A (Fig. 2) generated a signal similar to ANA-MP (V =∼0.1 nmol/min at 2 mm) (Table 2). Although A-F elongation was detected (∼9% of the A-F-A value), the addition of the second GlcUA to produce A-F-A greatly boosted the velocity. To verify that PmHAS was incorporating the GlcNAc sugar onto A-F-A, a single sugar addition reaction was analyzed by mass spectrometry. After a 2-h reaction incubation period, the major reaction product was a compound formed by the addition of a single GlcNAc residue (experimental = 683 Da; theoretical = 684 Da). Upon longer incubation, PmHAS added a GlcNAc to both sides of the substrate (experimental = 886 Da; theoretical = 887 Da), but the single addition product was still more abundant. Thus the increase in activity of A-F-A over A-F was not because of a simple doubling of the number of usable termini. The ability of PmHAS to extend both GlcUA groups of A-F-A (although at low levels in these experimental conditions) is probably the result of the initial NA-F-A product molecule rebinding to the enzyme and being elongated to form NA-F-AN. Two other structurally similar compounds, G-F-G and GalNAc-F-GalNAc, however, did not show high activity (<2% of the A-F-A value). Therefore, the substrate containing both the hydrophobic component (potentially mimicking the acetyl moiety of the GlcNAc saccharide and/or hydrocarbon face of the pyranose ring) as well as two GlcUA sugars elicited the best enzyme activity, reinforcing the importance of both characteristics. The predicted spacing between the two carboxylate groups of the ANA and the A-F-A molecules are similar (estimated distances from C6-GlcUA to C6-GlcUA: ANA, 9.0 ± 0.8 Å in aqueous solution or 10.7 Å if totally extended; A-F-A ∼12–20 Å), 4A. Almond, estimates from preliminary molecular modeling, dynamic simulations; personal communication. but the actual bound conformation of the saccharides in the acceptor site is not yet known. Synthesis of HA Polymers with Artificial Acceptors—The success of A-F-A as an acceptor substrate initiated the exploration of its utility as a primer for the synthesis of HA. An acceptor molecule will bypass the slow PmHAS initiation step, resulting in synchronized reactions that yield relatively monodisperse polymer products. Polymerization reactions with A-F-A at three different concentrations (8, 80, and 800 μm) were performed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The size of the products were ∼1,500, ∼400, or ∼110 kDa for various reactions where higher concentrations of A-F-A yielded smaller chains as expected. Essentially, the presence of a low concentration of acceptor with a finite amount of UDP-sugars will synthesize large HA products; conversely, the presence of a high concentration of acceptor and the same finite amount of UDP-sugars will synthesize smaller HA products (10Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis with ultraviolet absorbance detection proved that the polymer contained the fluorescein aglycone (not shown). Lyase degradation of the A-F-A reaction products proved that authentic HA chains were produced. Monodisperse HA built on A-F-A as a primer will not fluoresce until hyaluronidases remove the HA chains and β-glucuronidase cleaves the GlcUA groups proximal to the fluoresceine moiety. These degradation enzymes co-exist in the lysosome; thus"

The Hsf1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is extensively phosphorylated upon heat shock; a modification that is under positive regulation by its C-terminal regulatory domain (CTM). Hyperphosphorylation has been implicated in gene-specific transcriptional activation. Here, we surveyed genes whose heat shock response is reduced by a CTM mutation. The CTM is indispensable for transcription via heat shock elements bound by a single Hsf1 trimer but is dispensable for transcription via heat shock elements bound by Hsf1 trimers in a cooperative manner. Intragenic mutations located within or near the wing region of the winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain suppress the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype associated with the CTM mutation and enable Hsf1 to activate transcription independently of hyperphosphorylation. Deletion of the wing partially restores the transcriptional defects of the unphosphorylated Hsf1. These results demonstrate a functional link between hyperphosphorylation and the wing region and suggest that this modification is involved in a conformational change of a single Hsf1 trimer to an active form.

The perfect-type HSE consists of three or more contiguous inverted repeats of the unit (nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn), the gap-type HSE consists of two inverted units separated from a third unit by a 5-bp gap (nTTCnnGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn), and the step-type HSE consists of direct repeats of the nGAAn or nTTCn motif separated by 5 bp (nGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HSF encoded by the HSF1 gene regulates transcription under normal physiological conditions as well as under stress conditions, and it is essential for cell viability. The genes targeted by Hsf1 encode proteins that function in a broad range of biological processes, including protein folding and degradation, detoxification, energy generation, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell wall organization (12.Hahn J.-S.

Phosphorylation of mammalian HSF1 is implicated in both positive and negative regulation of the activator function, but the mechanistic details of this regulation are incompletely understood (23.Holmberg C.I.

BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 4-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Hsf1 is constitutively phosphorylated and is presumably controlled in a negative manner by the cAMP-dependent kinase (25.Ferguson S.B. Anderson E.S. Harshaw R.B. Thate T. Craig N.L. Nelson H.C. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further phosphorylation by the AMP-activated kinase Snf1 is required for glucose starvation-induced transcription mediated by Hsf1 (19.Hahn J.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5169-5176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Under heat shock and oxidative stress conditions, Hsf1 is extensively phosphorylated and acquires a stronger activating ability, although the responsible kinase(s) is unknown (17.Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18.Liu X.-D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The heat-induced hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1 is regulated intramolecularly by two domains, CE2 and CTM (26.Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The CE2 region functions negatively to restrict the activity of Hsf1 at low temperature and/or to convert the protein from an active to an inactive form (27.Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28.Høj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CTM is required for extensive phosphorylation, but this requirement is bypassed in an hsf1 mutant that lacks CE2, suggesting that the CTM alleviates the repressive effect of CE2 with respect to hyperphosphorylation (26.Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The CTM was originally identified as a domain essential for heat shock- and oxidative stress-induced transcription of the Hsf1 target gene CUP1. However, the CTM is dispensable when the gap-type HSE of CUP1 is replaced by a perfect-type HSE (29.Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A subsequent study revealed that the CTM regulates the activating ability of Hsf1 and thereby affects recruitment of the transcription machinery (30.Sakurai H. Hashikawa N. Imazu H. Fukasawa T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CTM and heat-induced phosphorylation are implicated in gene-specific activation and in mediating interactions between Hsf1 and the transcription machinery.In the present study, we investigated the role of hyperphosphorylation on HSE-specific activation by Hsf1. The CTM, through its influence on phosphorylation, was found to be required for an efficient heat shock response by approximately half of Hsf1 target genes. This requirement was related to cooperative interactions among Hsf1 trimers bound to the HSE. In addition, mutated versions of Hsf1 containing amino acid substitutions in the DBD activated transcription independently of hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that phosphorylation is involved in protein-protein interactions and in mediating conformational change of the DBD, a region that under normal conditions negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of Hsf1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Yeast Strains—Wild type HSF1, hsf1-ba1, and hsf1-AR1Δ-ba1 genes were cloned into yeast centromeric plasmids marked with URA3 or TRP1 (YCp-URA3 or YCp-TRP1) (26.Hashikawa N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1126-1127Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The plasmid YCp-TRP1-hsf1-wingΔ was created by deleting the wing region (amino acids 239–249) and substituting serine 250 with aspartate and aspartate 251 with proline (32.Cicero M.P. Hubl S. Harrison C.J. Littlefield O. Hardy J.A. Nelson H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hsf1-ba1 mutation was introduced into this plasmid to create YCp-TRP1-hsf1-wingΔ-ba1. The reporter genes were constructed by inserting HSE-containing oligonucleotides (see Fig. 2A) into the XhoI site lying upstream of the CYC1 promoter of pLG670Z (YEp-URA3-CYC1-lacZ) (33.Guarente L.

Data were deposited at the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO; ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with GEO accession number GSE3361. The hybridization of each sample was performed in duplicate. In each set of experiments, -fold changes were calculated from normalized intensities. Open reading frames that displayed at least a 1.5-fold lower signal intensity in hsf1-ba1 compared with HSF1 were selected, and the average -fold changes of duplicate experiments were calculated.

The chemiluminescence of CDP-Star was captured by a FAS-1000 lumino image analyzer (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by using GelPro Analyzer software as above.The transcripts of HSE-CYC1-lacZ reporter genes were analyzed as follows. The reporters were introduced into HSF1 and hsf1-ba1 cells, and transformed cells were grown in ESD medium lacking uracil and tryptophan at 28 or 39 °C for 20 min. Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR and analyzed as above, except that the reverse transcription reaction was carried out in the presence of a lacZ-specific primer to improve the synthesis of the cDNA.Gel Retardation Analysis—Cells were grown in YPD medium at 28 °C to an optical density of 1.2 at 600 nm. Cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads in a buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Four microliters of cleared extract was added to 12 μl of reaction mixture (1 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, 0.3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 ng of 32P-labeled probe DNA). After incubating at room temperature for 20 min, the samples were electrophoresed on an agarose gel and subjected to phosphorimaging as described previously (13.Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For Fig. 2B, cell extracts were prepared from a derivative of strain HS126 containing YEp-TRP1-HSF1, a multicopy plasmid YEplac112 (35.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) bearing HSF1, instead of YCp-URA3-HSF1, and were incubated with 0.2 ng of probe DNAImmunoblot Analysis—Cells were grown in YPD medium at 28 or 39 °C for 15 min, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Hsf1 antiserum (26.Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).RESULTSTranscriptional Changes in Cells Bearing a CTM Mutation—Upon heat shock, the Hsf1 protein is extensively phosphorylated, but this modification is inhibited by the hsf1-bal mutation, which contains amino acid substitutions in the CTM domain (26.Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To study the effect of hyperphosphorylation on Hsf1-regulated transcription at the whole genome level, we compared the heat-induced gene expression profiles of HSF1 and hsf1-bal cells using miniarray filters. The signal intensity of 29 genes displayed at least a 2.0-fold decrease in hsf1-ba1 cells relative to HSF1 cells after a temperature shift from 28 to 39 °C for 15 min (Table 1). To confirm these transcriptional changes, the expression levels of these genes were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR (Fig. 1A, left panel). In HSF1 cells, a temperature shift from 28 to 39 °C led to a rapid increase in the levels of transcripts from all genes analyzed. However, transcript accumulation was severely inhibited by the hsf1-ba1 mutation. We previously identified 59 Hsf1 target genes by the same method but with an hsf1 allele that confers a severe transcriptional defect (13.Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and 22 of the 29 genes identified here were also previously recognized as Hsf1 targets (Table 1). The remaining seven genes are also likely to be targets, because they are bound by Hsf1 (Ref. 12.Hahn J.-S. Hu Z. Thiele D.J. Iyer V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and data not shown). These results show that CTM-regulated hyperphosphorylation is required for the efficient heat shock response of approximately half of Hsf1 target genes, and we refer to these as CTM-dependent genes. Notably, several of them encode proteins involved in cell wall organization (Table 1), and it was recently discovered that Hsf1 has a role in cell wall remodeling at elevated temperatures (34.Imazu H. Sakurai H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).FIGURE 1Effect of the hsf1-ba1 mutation on transcription of Hsf1 target genes. A, mRNA levels of Hsf1 target genes in hsf1-ba1 cells. HSF1 wild type and hsf1-ba1 cells were grown in YPD medium at 28 °C, and then the temperature was shifted to 39 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots of cells were removed and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA prepared from each sample was subjected to Northern blot (SSE1, CPR6, HSP104, KAR2, SIS1, and ACT1) or RT-PCR (all other genes) analysis. Left and right panels show transcripts of CTM-dependent and CTM-independent genes, respectively. The ACT1 gene encoding actin was used as a control. B, classification of CTM-dependent genes by HSE type. Sixty-six Hsf1 target genes, including 59 genes identified in the previously study (13.Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and seven genes (KSP1, MHP1, NUS1, RPN4, SIP4, TIP1, and YDR210W) identified in this study, are classified. Genes for which a consensus HSE could not be readily identified were classified as “unknown.” Genes containing the perfect-type HSE are further divided into two groups based on the number of nGAAn units. CTM-dependent genes are shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Requirement for the CTM Is Dependent on HSE Architecture—Previous analyses implied that a requirement for CTM function can be ascribed to HSE architecture (26.Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29.Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We classified Hsf1 target genes with respect to their HSEs (Fig. 1B). The CTM-dependent genes contained gap-type or step-type HSEs or HSEs of indeterminable composition. The CTM was also necessary for the efficient heat shock response of several genes containing three perfect inverted repeats of the nGAAn unit (3P type). Notably, none of the genes containing four or more nGAAn repeats was recognized as CTM-dependent in the genome-wide survey. Consistent with this, heat-induced transcription of these genes was not significantly affected by the hsf1-ba1 mutation as judged by Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A, right panel).We evaluated the HSE-specific requirement for the CTM by using reporter genes containing HSEs with different arrangements of the nGAAn unit inserted upstream of the CYC1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene (HSE-CYC1-lacZ). The mRNA levels of lacZ in HSF1 and hsf1-ba1 cells were compared after normalizing them to ACT1 mRNA as a control (Fig. 2A). In HSF1 cells, the heat-induced mRNA levels of CYC1-lacZ reporters increased in parallel with increases in the number of nGAAn units, ranging from a 3-fold induction for a reporter containing a step-type HSE (HSEstep) to a 10-fold induction for a reporter containing six perfect inverted nGAAn repeats (HSE6P). The hsf1-ba1 mutation did not alter the levels of basal reporter transcription. In heat-shocked hsf1-ba1 cells, the level of HSE6P-CYC1-lacZ mRNA was comparable with that in HSF1 cells. However, transcription of reporters containing three nGAAn units, including HSE3P, HSEgap, and HSEstep, was not notably activated above the uninduced levels. The observed HSE-specific requirement for the CTM is consistent with the results of expression analysis for individual genes.Requirement for the CTM Is Affected by Cooperative Interactions among Hsf1 Trimers—Two nGAAn units can be positioned head to head (nGAAnnTTCn) or tail to tail (nTTCnnGAAn), and HSE oligonucleotides containing two head to head and two tail to tail repeats are denoted as 4Phh and 4Ptt, respectively (5.Perisic O. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 6.Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J.T. Cell. 1991; 64: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36.Bonner J.J. Ballou C. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In heat-shocked HSF1 cells, the relative orientations of nGAAn units did not significantly affect the mRNA levels of reporters (Fig. 2A). In hsf1-ba1 cells, HSE4Ptt-CYC1-lacZ transcripts accumulated to same extent as in HSF1 control cells, but HSE4Phh-CYC1-lacZ transcripts accumulated to only 50% of HSF1 control levels.It has been suggested that the 4Ptt configuration readily binds two HSF trimers, whereas 4Phh binds a second trimer with difficulty (36.Bonner J.J. Ballou C. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To address this proposal, HSE-Hsf1 interactions were then examined by gel retardation analysis using extracts prepared from HSF1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4 and 5–7, the addition of increasing amounts of protein caused the formation of DNA-protein complexes containing one and two Hsf1 trimers bound to the HSE3P and HSE6P fragments, respectively. The amounts of the complexes formed with HSE6P were larger than those formed with HSE3P because of cooperative binding of trimers (5.Perisic O. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13.Yamamoto A. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11911-11919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 37.Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4799-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HSE4Ptt and HSE4Phh fragments formed complexes with mobilities comparable with those formed with HSE6P and HSE3P, respectively, but with higher affinities than seen for HSE3P (compare lanes 2–7 with lanes 8–13). Therefore, the HSE4Ptt fragment allows the cooperative binding of two Hsf1 trimers, whereas the HSE4Phh fragment does not stably support two bound trimers, presumably because of slightly weaker interactions between the trimers.CTM-dependent genes contain three nGAAn units and bind a single Hsf1 trimer. When two trimers bind cooperatively to the 4Ptt-type and 6P-type HSEs, however, transcription is activated independently of the CTM. The 4Phh-type HSE exhibits an intermediate property with respect to Hsf1 binding and the CTM dependence of transcription. These observations imply that CTM function is related either to the overall number of Hsf1 trimers bound or to trimer-trimer interactions. To distinguish between these two possi"
https://openalex.org/W1992149773,"BRCT domains, present in a large number of proteins that are involved in cell cycle regulation and/or DNA replication or repair, are primarily thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The large (p140) subunit of replication factor C contains a sequence of ∼100 amino acids in the N-terminal region that binds DNA and is distantly related to known BRCT domains. Here we show that residues 375-480, which include 28 amino acids N-terminal to the BRCT domain, are required for 5′-phosphorylated double-stranded DNA binding. NMR chemical shift analysis indicated that the N-terminal extension includes an α-helix and confirmed the presence of a conserved BRCT domain. Sequence alignment of the BRCT region in the p140 subunit of replication factor C from various eukaryotes has identified very few absolutely conserved amino acid residues within the core BRCT domain, whereas none were found in sequences immediately N-terminal to the BRCT domain. However, mapping of the limited number of conserved, surface-exposed residues that were found onto a homology model of the BRCT domain, revealed a clustering on one side of the molecular surface. The cluster, as well as a number of amino acids in the N-terminal α-helix, were mutagenized to determine the importance for DNA binding. To ensure minimal structural changes because of the introduced mutations, proteins were checked using one-dimensional 1H NMR and CD spectroscopy. Mutation of weakly conserved residues on one face of the N-terminal α-helix and of residues within the cluster disrupted DNA binding, suggesting a likely binding interface on the protein."

MuSK gene expression is regulated by nerve-derived agrin and muscle activity. Agrin stimulates synapse-specific MuSK gene expression by activating GABPαβ transcription factors in endplate-associated myonuclei. In contrast, the mechanism by which muscle activity regulates MuSK gene expression is not known. We report on a 60-bp MuSK enhancer that confers promoter regulation by muscle differentiation, changes in intracellular calcium, and muscle activity. Within this enhancer, we identified a single E-box that is essential for this regulation. This E-box binds myogenin, and we showed that myogenin is necessary for not only MuSK but also nAChR gene regulation by muscle activity. Surprisingly, the same E-box functions in vivo to mediate muscle-specific and differentiation-dependent gene induction in zebrafish, suggesting an evolutionary conserved mechanism of regulation of synaptic protein gene expression.

Muscle activity impacts many aspects of muscle biology including formation of the neuromuscular junction, slow or fast fiber type, and muscle mass. Many of these effects are a result of activity-dependent control of gene expression. At the developing neuromuscular junction, muscle activity controls the expression of genes, the products of which make up the postsynaptic apparatus. In general, the expression of these genes is suppressed by muscle activity (1.Sane J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 2.Sunesen M. Changeux J.P. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Prior to muscle innervation, they are highly expressed throughout the multinucleated fiber; however, after innervation, their expression is localized to endplate-associated myonuclei (1.Sane J.R.

Denervation of adult muscle results in a return to the embryonic pre-innervation pattern of gene expression, and this is correlated with the ability of adult denervated muscle to become ectopically innervated.One of the key components in initiating neuromuscular junction formation is the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) 2The abbreviations used are: MuSK, muscle-specific kinase; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; CREB, cAMP element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; SpDBD, Sp protein DNA binding domain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TTX, tetrodotoxin; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short-interfering double-stranded RNA; shRNAi, short hairpin RNAi; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, minimal enkephalin; CaMK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; GABP, GA-binding protein.2The abbreviations used are: MuSK, muscle-specific kinase; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; CREB, cAMP element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; SpDBD, Sp protein DNA binding domain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TTX, tetrodotoxin; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short-interfering double-stranded RNA; shRNAi, short hairpin RNAi; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, minimal enkephalin; CaMK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; GABP, GA-binding protein.

This kinase is activated by nerve-derived agrin and is necessary for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) clustering and the initiation of postsynaptic differentiation. MuSK expression is tightly controlled by a combination of muscle activity that suppresses extrajunctional expression (3.Macpherson P.C. Suhr S.T. Goldman D. J. Cell.

Calvez S.L. Gajendran N. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Agrin participates in this process by stimulating clustering of Erb receptors in the postsynaptic membrane (5.Lacazette E. Calvez S.L. Gajendran N. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and by activating a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent signaling cascade that regulates GABPαβ activity (5.Lacazette E. Calvez S.L. Gajendran N. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling has also been suggested to contribute to synapse-specific MuSK gene expression (11.Kim C.-H. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38522-38527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In contrast to these well described mechanisms by which agrin and neuregulin control synaptic expression of the MuSK gene, extrajunctional suppression by muscle activity remains uncharacterized. In our studies of muscle activity and nAChR gene expression, we identified a calcium-dependent signal transduction cascade that depends upon CaMKII to suppress nAChR gene expression in cultured myotubes (12.Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13.Tang H. Sun Z. Goldman D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15638-15646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This signal transduction cascade ultimately regulates the expression of myogenin, a bHLH muscle-specific transcription factor that binds specific E-box sequences within the nAChR subunit promoters (13.Tang H. Sun Z. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26057-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15.Tang H. Macpherson P. Argetsinger L.S. Cieslak D. Suhr S. Carter-Su C. Goldman D. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In cell culture, myogenin is essential for both differentiation- and activity-dependent nAChR gene regulation in aneural myotubes (15.Tang H. Macpherson P. Argetsinger L.S. Cieslak D. Suhr S. Carter-Su C. Goldman D. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16.Hasty P. Brdley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). It is not known whether a similar mechanism contributes to activity-dependent nAChR gene expression in adult muscle and whether MuSK is regulated in a similar fashion.Interestingly, the MuSK promoter was recently reported to harbor a critical E-box that mediates promoter activation by the myogenic factor MyoD (11.Kim C.-H. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38522-38527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This E-box was shown to be important for inducing MuSK expression when myoblasts differentiate into multinucleated myotubes. MyoD is a muscle-specific bHLH transcription factor that can transactivate this promoter in transient transfection assays and is induced/activated upon myoblast differentiation. Recently, CREB was shown to bind directly to MyoD, suggesting a novel mechanism of MuSK promoter inhibition that may underlie extrajunctional activity-dependent MuSK suppression following muscle innervation (17.Kim C.-H. Xiong W.C. Mei L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To further this analysis of activity-dependent regulation, we carefully characterized the MuSK promoter elements contributing to activity-dependent gene regulation.Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo expression assays, we showed that a critical E-box residing in a 60-bp enhancer is crucial for mediating MuSK promoter regulation during muscle differentiation and in response to muscle activity. This same E-box also mediated calcium-dependent regulation of the MuSK promoter. We showed that myogenin binds this E-box and transactivates MuSK promoter activity. RNAi-mediated myogenin knockdown indicated that myogenin is essential for differentiation-dependent gene induction during development and denervation-dependent gene induction in adults. Finally, the human MuSK 60-bp enhancer conferred muscle-specific expression in developing zebrafish, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for MuSK induction is conserved between fish and mammals.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary Muscle Culture and Promoter Activity Assay—Rat primary skeletal muscle cultures were prepared as described previously (13.Tang H.

Muscle cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and antibiotics. At 80% confluence, DNAs were transfected into primary myoblasts for reporter gene assay with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The confluent myoblasts were induced to differentiate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 5 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX) to inhibit muscle contraction, and 2.8 μg/ml Ara-C to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Five days later, the well differentiated myotubes were incubated with or without TTX for the indicated time. The myotubes were then collected for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays as described previously (13.Tang H. Sun Z. Goldman D. J. Biol.

The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pEGFP1 (between HindIII and SalI) and PXP2 (between HindIII and Xhol) vectors, respectively.

Twenty-five μl of siRNA (20 μm) was injected into adult mouse tibialis anterior muscle and uptake by muscle fibers facilitated by electroporation using a BTX840 square wave electroporator. The parameters are 140 V/cm, 6 pulses, 60-ms duration, and 100-ms interval. pCS2GFP was co-injected with the siRNAs and allowed us to visualize siRNA/GFP-containing fibers using fluorescence microscopy. GFP-positive fibers were isolated in cold phosphate-buffered saline using fine forceps. Total RNA from these fibers was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and subjected to reverse transcription with Superscript II (Invitrogen). 1/20 of the cDNA mixture served as a template for the PCR reactions. Radioactive PCR was performed using [α-32P]dCTP to spike the reaction mix. The products were separated by 6% PAGE, and gels were subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film. Gene-specific primers were used to assay the transcript levels of myogenin, nAChR subunits, MuSK, γ-actin, muscle creatine kinase, and Sp family members. Primers are as follows: nAChR α-subunit, forward, 5′-CGTCTGGTGGCAAAGCT, and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCTCCATGAAGTT; nAChR γ-subunit, forward, 5′-ACGGTTGTATCTACTGGCTG, and reverse, 5′-GATCCACTCAATGGCTTGC; nAChR δ-subunit, forward, 5′-GTGATCTGTGTCATCGTACT, and reverse, 5′-GCTTCTCAAACATGAGGTCA; MuSK, forward, 5′-CTCGTCCTCCCATTAATGTAAAAA, and reverse, 5′-TCCAGCTTCACCAGTTTGGAGTAA; muscle creatine kinase, forward, 5′-GCCGGCGATGAGGAGTCCTACA, and reverse, 5′-GCAGTGCGGAGGCAGAGTGTAA; γ-actin, forward, 5′-ACCCAGGCATTGCTGACAGGATGC, and reverse, 5′-CCATCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG; SP1, forward, 5′-AGGAGAGAATAGCTCTGATC, and reverse, 5′-TGTGAGGTCTTGCCATATAC; SP3, forward, 5′-CAGTGGTGACTCTACACTG, and reverse, 5′-TGTGCTCTCAGATGTGAGG; Sp4, forward, 5′-TGACCAACTCACACAAGTGC, and reverse, 5′-CATCCAGTTGCATATGAACG.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as follows. The indicated E-box sequence was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over a G50 spin column. The radiolabeled DNA probe was incubated with C2C12 nuclear extract on ice for 40 min in the reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg poly(dI:dC), 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The DNA binding mixture was then resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film. Supershift assays were performed with anti-myogenin F5D (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) mouse monoclonal antibody. Mouse anti-Myc was used as control antibody.Western Blots—Cell lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl), pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (P8340 Sigma) at a dilution of 1/100. Cells are sheared via passing through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged briefly to remove debris. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Proteins are resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GFP antibody (1:3000, Invitrogen). Immunodetection was accomplished using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and subsequent chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Zebrafish Embryo Injection for Transient in Vivo Expression—Zebrafish embryo injection was performed as reported previously (31.Goldman D. Hankin M. Li Z. Dai X. Ding J. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For these experiments, zebrafish embryos, at the 1–2-cell stage, were injected with ∼300 pl of a solution containing 25–50 ng/μl wild-type or mutant expression vector DNA using a glass micropipette and picopump. pCS2dsRed expression vector was included in all injections for identifying DNA injected fish. At 48 h after injection, fish were anesthetized and examined for GFP reporter gene expression using fluorescent microscopy. Fish exhibiting MuSK promoter-driven GFP expression were counted along with the total number of fish expressing dsRed from the pCS2 promoter.RESULTSA Conserved 200-bp 5′-flanking MuSK Promoter Sequence Is Sufficient for Muscle-specific Expression—To investigate MuSK gene regulation, we cloned a 2.2-kb genomic fragment of the human MuSK gene that spanned nucleotides –2116 to +130. Although there are no obvious TATA or CAAT promoter sequences immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site, we did identify a putative initiator sequence that is conserved with the initiator sequences of a number of other genes including the nAChR δ-subunit, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and adenovirus major late promoters (Fig. 1A) (18.Chahine K.G. Walke W. Goldman D. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 213-219PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 20.Steinke J.W. Koopytek S.J. Peterson D.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Within this initiator resides the transcription start site of the MuSK promoter (5.Lacazette E. Calvez S.L. Gajendran N. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).We confirmed that this putative MuSK promoter fragment (referred to as MuSK2.2) functioned in a muscle-specific manner by cloning the 2.2-kb promoter fragment into the pEGFP-1 vector (Clontech) and transfecting primary muscle cells growing in tissue culture. These cells are a mixture of muscle and fibroblast-like cells. As expected, we observed robust reporter gene expression specifically in differentiated muscle (Fig. 1B). As a control, we compared this expression with that elicited by a vector harboring the simian CMV promoter (pCS2). Consistent with the promiscuous expression of the CMV promoter, we found that both muscle and non-muscle fibroblasts exhibit reporter gene expression (Fig. 1B).Comparison of the MuSK promoter sequences across human, mouse, and rat identified a highly conserved DNA fragment that extended from the initiator sequence upstream to approximately nucleotide –175. Interestingly, this sequence harbors three E-boxes (CANNTG) at positions –43, –76, and –152. Based on our experience characterizing nAChR subunit promoters, we suspected that the E-boxes most proximal to the initiator sequence would be most important for mediating muscle-specific and activity-dependent MuSK gene expression. To test this idea, we deleted nucleotides –208 to –9 from the 2.2-kb promoter using convenient EcoRI restriction sites. Because this fragment harbors three E-boxes, we refer to the 2.2-kb MuSK promoter with this fragment deleted as MuSK2.2(del3E). Transfection of muscle cells with MuSK2.2(del3E) confirmed that this region harbors important regulatory elements that are necessary to drive promoter activity in differentiated muscle cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, deletion of sequences –208 to –2116 (remaining promoter referred to as MuSK3E) did not significantly influence promoter activity in these qualitative assays (Fig. 1C). In addition, the three-E-box region of the MuSK promoter directs muscle-specific expression in both orientations, typical of an enhancer sequence (Fig. 1C, inset, MuSK3E with opposite orientation).We used Western blotting to quantify MuSK promoter activity in 10T1/2 cells with and without myogenin co-transfection. Western blots were normalized to co-transfected CMVCAT activity (Fig. 1D). This analysis showed that MuSK2.2, MuSK3E, and MuSK2.2(del3E) all had similar basal promoter activity; however, only MuSK2.2(del3E) was not induced upon myogenin co-transfection. Therefore, the three-E-box region of the MuSK promoter was sufficient to confer muscle-specific reporter gene expression and is indispensable for myogenin-dependent transactivation.A Specific E-box in MuSK3E Is Essential for Promoter Activation—We found that the –208 to –9 region, harboring the three E-boxes, was able to confer muscle expression to the heterologous minimal enkephalin (MEK) promoter (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the significance of each E-box in mediating increased promoter activity, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert each E-box sequence CANNTG to a non-E-box sequence GCNNTG. This analysis showed that only E-box 1, which is most proximal to the initiator sequence, is necessary for conferring high level promoter activity to MEK (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2MuSK3E harbors a unique E-box that preferentially binds myogenin and is essential for promoter activation by bHLH proteins. A, a conserved 200-bp MuSK 5′-flanking sequence with and without specific E-box mutations was placed upstream of the MEK and transfected into primary muscle cells along with CMVCAT for normalization purposes. Promoter activity is normalized luciferase activity. B, EMSA showing myogenin preferentially binds to E-box 1 of the MuSK3E sequence. Anti-myogenin antibodies (Ab) were used to identify myogenin bound probes by causing the bound DNA to supershift. C, E-box 1 of MuSK3E mediates activation by co-transfected bHLH encoding cDNAs. Primary muscle cells were co-transfected with MuSK3E or a mutant in MuSK3E harboring a mutation in E-box 1 (MuSK3E(E1m)) and various bHLH encoding cDNAs along with CMVCAT for normalization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inspection of the three different E-boxes indicates that E-box 1 harbors a sequence (CAGCTG) that is very similar to those found in nAChR promoters that are transactivated by myogenin and mediate muscle-specific and activity-dependent gene expression (21.Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Gilmore B.P. Goldman D. Chahine K.G. Gardner P.D. Dev.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, E-box 2 (CACTTG) and E-box 3 (CATCTG) are less similar. Interestingly, E-box 1 bound significantly more nuclear protein than the other E-boxes, and supershift assays confirmed that myogenin is a major component of the proteins binding to E-box 1 (Fig. 2B). We do note a very small amount of myogenin binding to E-box 3.In addition to its sequence, the location of the E-box relative to the basal promoter may be important for its function. Because E-box 3 appeared to bind myogenin at a low level, we asked whether E-box 3 could compensate for E-box 1 when placed in the E-box 1 position. In these experiments, we only replaced the E-box sequence, not the flanking nucleotides. Surprisingly, E-box 3 was able to restore MEK promoter activity in muscle when placed in the E-box 1 position (Fig. 2A). We next asked whether E-box 1 could function if placed in the E-box 3 position and found that it could not (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these latter data, we also showed that E-box 1 sequences placed in both E-box 1 and E-box 3 positions were not able to confer increased promoter activity beyond that of E-box 1 in the E-box 1 position (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that although a particular E-box sequence may be important, its location/flanking nucleotides is also critical for defining function.Although myogenin can mediate increased MuSK promoter activity via binding to E-box 1, we were interested in determining whether other muscle-specific bHLH proteins activate MuSK promoter activity via E-box 1 or whether they might utilize E-box 2 or 3. To address this question, we compared MuSK3E promoter activity with MuSK3E(E1m), which harbors a mutation in E-box 1. HEK293 cells were transfected with these expression vectors with and without bHLH proteins myogenin, MyoD, MRF4, or myf5. All bHLH proteins were able to transactivate the MuSK3E promoter (Fig. 2C); however, they were unable to activate the MuSK promoter harboring a mutant E-box 1. Although all the muscle-specific bHLH proteins tested could transactivate this promoter when overexpressed, our gel shift assays suggested that myogenin preferentially binds this particular E-box under more physiological protein concentrations (Fig. 2B).Identification of a 60-bp Enhancer from the MuSK Promoter—We used a promoter deletion strategy to identify a minimal sequence flanking the first MuSK E-box to further define the sequences necessary for high level MuSK promoter activity in muscle. For this analysis, we started with the –208 to –9 fragment of the MuSK promoter that harbors all three proximal E-boxes (Fig. 3A, MuSK3E). Deletion of 120 bp from the 5′ end of this sequence, along with mutation of E-box 2, had little effect on promoter activity (Fig. 3A, (E2m)E1MEKPXP2). The remaining 80 nucleotides of this promoter were sufficient to confer high level reporter gene expression in both orientations, suggesting that this region of DNA is functioning as a classical enhancer. In contrast, upstream sequences that harbor the 120-bp DNA sequence that was deleted in the construction of MuSK3E did not confer increased activity onto the heterologous MEK promoter (Fig. 3A, E3(E2m)(delE1)MEKPXP2).FIGURE 3An 80-bp MuSK promoter fragment mediates muscle-specific gene expression. A, various deletions and mutations identify an 80-bp sequence of the MuSK promoter that is capable of activating a heterologous promoter in both orientations. Primary muscle cells were co-transfected with the indicated promoter constructs along with CMVCAT for normalization. B, the first intron of the MuSK gene harbors four E-box consensus sequences and the functional N-box responsible for synapse specific expression. Primary muscle cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and CMVCAT for normalization. Promoter activity is reported as normalized luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the above data suggest that E-box 1 of the MuSK promoter is essential for maximal promoter activity, we were concerned that additional regulatory elements may reside in the first intron of the MuSK gene. Previous studies have suggested that the first intron harbors the N-box sequence that is responsible for synapse-specific expression of the MuSK gene in innervated muscle (5.Lacazette E. Calvez S.L. Gajendran N. Brenner H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also identified several E-box sequences within the first intron. To evaluate whether these intronic E-boxes can influence promoter activity, we cloned a 1-kb intronic fragment that harbored the N-box and E-box sequences. These sequences were cloned upstream of the minimal MEK promoter or the 3EMEK promoter. Transfection of primary muscle cells showed that regardless of which promoter was employed, E-boxes residing in the first intron did not result in promoter activation (Fig. 3B). In fact, these sequences may hinder promoter activity when juxtaposed to the 3E sequence (Fig. 3B"
https://openalex.org/W2148964640,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. CFTR consists of two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), and a regulatory domain. Previous biochemical reports suggest NBD1 is a site of stable nucleotide interaction with low ATPase activity, whereas NBD2 is the site of active ATP hydrolysis. It has also been reported that NBD2 additionally possessed adenylate kinase (AK) activity. Knowledge about the intrinsic biochemical activities of the NBDs is essential to understanding the Cl– ion gating mechanism. We find that purified mouse NBD1, human NBD1, and human NBD2 function as adenylate kinases but not as ATPases. AK activity is strictly dependent on the addition of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) substrate. No liberation of [33P]phosphate is observed from the γ-33P-labeled ATP substrate in the presence or absence of AMP. AK activity is intrinsic to both human NBDs, as the Walker A box lysine mutations abolish this activity. At low protein concentration, the NBDs display an initial slower nonlinear phase in AK activity, suggesting that the activity results from homodimerization. Interestingly, the G551D gating mutation has an exaggerated nonlinear phase compared with the wild type and may indicate this mutation affects the ability of NBD1 to dimerize. hNBD1 and hNBD2 mixing experiments resulted in an 8–57-fold synergistic enhancement in AK activity suggesting heterodimer formation, which supports a common theme in ABC transporter models.

The ABC transporter superfamily has a large number of functionally diverse transmembrane proteins that transport a variety of substrates (from ions to proteins) within, into, and out of the cell (1.Holland B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The typical ABC transporter consists of two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The NBDs are thought to utilize energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to transport substrates across the membrane. Some ABC transporters function actively against a concentration gradient, and others are passive transporters (e.g. CFTR). In the human genome sequencing efforts, 51 ABC transporter genes have been identified, 13 of which have been linked to genetic diseases (2.Stefkova J. Poledne R. Hubacek J.A. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: 235-243PubMed Google Scholar). The most common and intensely studied of these diseases is cystic fibrosis. Primary amino acid sequence analysis suggests CFTR is composed of homologous halves. Each half contains six membrane-spanning segments and an NBD. The two CFTR halves are linked by a cytoplasmic regulatory domain (R-domain) which is unique and not shared with other ABC transporters. The R-domain contains a number of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites (3.Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7689-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation at multiple sites is a prerequisite for the activation of CFTR chloride channel by ATP (4.Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To date, over 1300 disease-causing mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene (www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). These mutations are located throughout the coding sequence and include deletions and missense and nonsense mutations. Most mutations are rare in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population. The exception is the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508) that accounts for about 70% of CF mutations worldwide (5.Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The ΔF508 mutation is located in NBD1 and results in a CFTR protein that has a dual defect. First, the protein is improperly processed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell plasma membrane. Second, the mutant protein that reaches the membrane is reported to have only ∼30% of wild-type channel function (5.Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second most common CF mutation G551D is only defective in channel function (6.Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) and has a prevalence of 2–7% in the CF population (7.Cutting G.R. Kasch L.M. Rosenstein B.J. Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Antonarakis S.E. Kazazian H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Schemes of ATP binding and hydrolysis by CFTR have been proposed to govern channel gating responses (8.Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In CFTR, the NBDs are thought not to be functionally equivalent because of the lack of sequence conservation in three of the ABC transporter signature motifs (9.Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, biochemical reports suggest that NBD1 is a site of stable nucleotide interaction (10.Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas NBD2 has been reported to be the site of ATP hydrolysis activity (11.Berger A.L. Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, other biochemical studies where the NBD1 construct includes the regulatory (R) domain (NBD1-R) suggest that the protein had the ability to function as an ATPase (12.Howell L.D. Borchardt R. Kole J. Kaz A.M. Randak C. Cohn J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13.Annereau J.P. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 451-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interesting were biochemical reports by Randak et al. (14.Randak C. Neth P. Auerswald E.A. Eckerskorn C. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Randak C. Auerswald E.A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reenstra W.W. Machleidt W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that indicated the NBD2 possessed both adenylate kinase as well as ATPase activity. Adenylate kinases catalyze the phosphotransfer reaction (ATP + AMP ⇆ ADP + ADP). In experiments using patch-clamp analysis together with the Walker A lysine mutations in the NBDs, Randak and Welsh (16.Randak C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 837-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) concluded that NBD2, not NBD1, was responsible for adenylate kinase activity. The structural similarity of the CFTR NBDs to the adenylate kinases was reported (17.Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) soon after the CFTR gene was cloned in 1989. However, this observation was never investigated experimentally until 1997 (14.Randak C. Neth P. Auerswald E.A. Eckerskorn C. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mouse NBD1 (mNBD1) was recently determined (18.Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Henedrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E. Sauder J.M. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Zhang M. Zhao X. Emtage S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Comparing the mNBD1 and the adenylate kinase structures, we saw resemblances that raised the possibility that both NBDs may have adenylate kinase activity. To gain insight into the CFTR functional mechanism (Cl– ion gating) we have pursued a detailed biochemical examination of highly purified soluble and refolded cytoplasmic domains (i.e. NBD1, NBD1-R, and NBD2). Knowledge about the individual domains and their biochemical activities is essential for the proper understanding of the CFTR gating mechanism. Insight into the CFTR gating mechanism would be extremely useful in designing functional assays to both find and understand how small molecules function to restore CFTR channel activity. In this report, we provide evidence that the mouse NBD1, human NBD1, and human NBD2 all have the ability to function as an adenylate kinase (AK). Careful separation of all nucleotide products by thin layer chromatography (TLC) reveals that, in contrast to extant reports in the CFTR literature, the isolated CFTR NBDs do not catalyze ATP hydrolysis because no liberation of [33P]phosphate is observed from γ-33P-labeled ATP substrate. Although we have detected a nucleotide diphosphatase activity (EC 3.6.1.8), which affinity-purifies with the NBDs, this can be separated by a subsequent gel filtration chromatography step. Substitution of the Walker A box lysine for alanine in the hNBDs results in the loss of AK activity, which demonstrates that the activity is intrinsic to these proteins. We further demonstrate that mNBD1 protein can be specifically labeled with a related AMP substrate analog 8-azido-[32P]AMP. Each NBD at low protein concentration displayed an initial slower nonlinear phase in AK activity, which suggests that homodimerization may be important for activity. The G551D gating mutation has an exaggerated nonlinear phase as compared with wild type, and may indicate this mutation affects NBD1 ability to form dimers. In hNBD2 immunoprecipitation experiments, hNBD1 co-precipitates suggesting a physical association between the two NBDs. Mixing experiments with hNBD1 and hNBD2 at low protein concentration resulted in a significant synergistic enhancement in AK activity suggesting heterodimer formation. From our biochemical findings we therefore propose a CFTR gating mechanism based on AK activity. Cloning of the Mouse and Human CFTR NBDs—The NBDs were amplified by PCR from mouse and human cDNA libraries using Pfu/Taq polymerases (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the open reading frames were designed to introduce unique restriction sites. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction endonuclease and ligated to an Escherichiacoli expression vector pET28b (Novagen). The resulting human NBD plasmids, pET28b-hNBD1 and pET28b-hNBD2, produced both human NBDs with an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag hNBD1 (Thr390–Leu671) and hNBD2 (Lys1200–Leu1480). The mouse NBD1 fragment (Thr389–Asp673) was fused to the C terminus of the His6-tagged Smt3 fusion protein as described (19.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and was identical to the construct that yielded the NBD1 crystal structure (18.Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Henedrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E. Sauder J.M. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Zhang M. Zhao X. Emtage S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The mouse and human CFTR gene fragments were sequenced to ensure their integrity and were identical to the GenBank™ sequence, accession numbers (NM_021050) and (NM_000492), respectively. All mutant clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations. Expression, Purification, and Refolding of the CFTR NBD Proteins—Mouse and human CFTR NBD clones were expressed in E. coli using BL21 DE3 pLysS cells induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C. Soluble mouse NBD1 was initially purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography, followed by a Sepharose S200 (16/60 mm column) sizing chromatography step; the Smt3 tag then was removed using the Ulp1 protease (19.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a second nickel affinity step was employed to separate the tag from the cleaved mNBD1 protein. The human NBD proteins were found in the insoluble fraction. The cell pellets (30 g) were resuspended in 600 ml of buffer 1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) followed by the addition of protease inhibitors (E-64, pepstatin, and leupeptin at 2 μg/ml, DFP at 50 μm). The cell pellets were dounce-homogenized and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Samples were spun at 54,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 600 ml of buffer 2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) overnight on a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C. Samples were spun at 54,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To the supernatants, 30 ml of Nickel Hi-Selects resin (Sigma) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged to pellet resin and resuspended in buffer 2 and poured into a column. The packed column was washed with buffer 3 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing sequentially increasing amounts of imidazole. Fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing protein were concentrated by Centricon (Amicon) and loaded onto Superdex S-200 16/60 mm column. Proteins were eluted in buffer 4 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein containing fractions were concentrated to 1 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined from A280 using calculated extinction coefficients (20.Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The initial “in house” NDSB-256 (dimethyl benzyl ammonium propane sulfonate) (Anatrace Inc.) refolding buffer was (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm α-cyclodextrin, 0.1 mm GSH/0.01 mm GSSG, and 0.5 m NDSB-256). The refolding screen for the denatured proteins has been described (21.Willis Swope M. Hogan J.K. Prabhakar P. Liu X. Tsai K. Wei Y. Fox T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Larger batches (10 mg) of purified proteins were refolded (hNBD1 100 μg/ml, hNBD2 50 μg/ml) in either condition 10 (21.Willis Swope M. Hogan J.K. Prabhakar P. Liu X. Tsai K. Wei Y. Fox T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), condition 10 plus 0.5 m NDSB-256 or an NDSB-256 buffer from above. After 24 h incubation at 4 °C, samples were concentrated, filtered and sized on a Superdex S-200 10/30 mm column. Sizing fractions that yielded monomeric/dimeric NBD proteins were pooled. Protein concentrations of the refolded samples were determined by quantitative Westerns using specific monoclonal antibodies (hNBD1 clone L12B4) and (hNBD2 clone M3A7) (Chemicon Inc.) and known quantities of denatured hNBD proteins as a standard curve. Western detection was accomplished using infrared fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody and the Odyssey system (LI-COR Bioscience) (22.Shutz-Geshwender A. Zhang Y. Holt T. McDermitt D. Olive M.D. LI-COR Biosciences. Lincoln, NE2004Google Scholar). Adenylate Kinase and ATPase Assay—The forward adenylate kinase rates (ADP formation) were followed using labeled [γ-33P]ATP and TLC followed by autoradiography with a Fuji phosphorimaging analyzer. The reactions (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm [γ-33P]ATP, 400 μm AMP, and varying amounts of NBD were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reverse adenylate kinase rates (ATP and AMP formation) were followed using [8-14C]ADP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μm [8-14C]ADP, and varying amounts of NBD were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of 2 μl of 1 m formic acid. Aliquots (1–2 μl) were spotted onto poly(ethylene) imine (PEI)-cellulose TLC plates (catalog number 5579/7, EMD Chemicals Inc, Gibbstown, NJ), which were developed with a solution of 0.75 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. Determination of Kinetic Parameters and Data Analysis—The apparent Km and Vmax values for ATP, AMP, and ADP were determined by fitting the rectangular hyperbolic plot of linear rates of product (μm/min) versus increasing substrate concentration (μm) to the Michaelis-Menten equation. IC50 values for the ATP competitive inhibitor P1-(5′-adenosyl)P5-(5′-adenosyl) pentaphosphate (AP5A) (Sigma), AP5G, AP4A, AP6A (Jena Bioscience), were obtained by measuring the decrease in linear rates of adenylate kinase activity (μm/min) at increasing concentrations of inhibitor and fitting the data using a two parameter hyperbolic fit: y = IC50/(B × (X + IC50)), where B is proportional to 1/Vmax, y is the rate of inhibition (μm/min), and X is the concentration of the inhibitor. For all IC50 determinations, unless otherwise stated the substrate concentrations were at or within 2-fold of apparent Km, and the enzyme concentration was less than or equal to 2× the reported IC50. Expression and Purification of CFTR NBD Proteins—To understand the CFTR gating mechanism we have pursued a detailed biochemical examination of highly purified soluble and refolded cytoplasmic domains (i.e. NBD1 and NBD2) of the CFTR protein. The CFTR literature has demonstrated that the CFTR domains are extremely challenging to study because of their poor levels of expression and insolubility in most recombinant protein expression systems. The mNBD1, being the most tractable, was pursued as described by others (18.Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Henedrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E. Sauder J.M. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Zhang M. Zhao X. Emtage S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) with modification to the protein purification procedures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mNBD1 proteins (wild type and G551D) were purified to homogeneity as judged by a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1A). A total of nine mNBD1 wild type and four mNBD1 G551D independent protein samples were purified for this study. Western blotting confirmed the protein identity as it cross-reacted with the human NBD1 monoclonal antibody (clone L12B4, Chemicon) (Fig. 1B). The identity of the mNBD1 proteins was also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and N-terminal sequencing (not shown). The six histidine-tagged versions of hNBD1 and hNBD2 were overexpressed as insoluble proteins and purified under denaturing conditions to homogeneity (Fig. 1B). Four independently denatured wild-type hNBD1 and four hNBD2 samples were purified for this study. To obtain active, soluble hNBD proteins, we worked out conditions to refold these proteins. We initially pursued three methods of protein refolding; the first two have been described (23.Wang W. He Z. O'Shaughnessy T.J. Rux J. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1170-C1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24.Lu N.T. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the third was developed inhouse (see “Experimental Procedures”). Multiple attempts of refolding both hNBD1 and hNBD2 using the bovine serum albumin (BSA) method described by Wang et al. (23.Wang W. He Z. O'Shaughnessy T.J. Rux J. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1170-C1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. BSA removal after the refolding resulted in protein that reformed soluble aggregates and lacked adenylate kinase or ATPase activity. We conclude that BSA is not an effective chemical chaperone and instead acts as a dispersant. The other two methods relied on 0.5 m arginine (24.Lu N.T. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or NDSB-256 as chemical chaperones. For hNBD1, the refolding method employing 0.5 m arginine or NDSB-256 yielded active protein. Because active hNBD2 protein was obtained with the NDSB-256 procedure, the arginine method was not pursued. For both these methods, NBD protein recovery yields were <1%. In an effort to increase protein recovery yields we used a fractional factorial refolding screen (21.Willis Swope M. Hogan J.K. Prabhakar P. Liu X. Tsai K. Wei Y. Fox T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each protein was refolded at a 400-μl scale and after a 24-h, 4 °C incubation period, each screening condition was directly assayed for activity. For the hNBD1 protein, the best refolding conditions were condition 10 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 0.5 mm Tween-80, 5 mm TCEP, 550 mm GdnHCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) and condition 30 (50 mm MES pH 6.5, 0.5 mm Tween-80, 5 mm TCEP, polyethylene glycol 3350, 440 mm sucrose) with the hNBD1 protein screened at 100 μg/ml (not shown). Tween-80 and TCEP additives appeared important in hNBD1 refolding as these two components were shared between the two conditions. For hNBD2 protein (screened at 50 μg/ml), the two best conditions were also conditions 10 and 30. Whereas condition 10 for hNBD2 appeared to be superior (in terms of activity) to the NDSB-256 condition, the overall protein recovery yields did not improve dramatically. Large batches (10 mg) of hNBD1 and 2 were refolded three ways: condition 10, condition 10 plus 0.5 m NDSB-256 and the “in-house” NDSB-256 buffer. After the incubation period, samples were concentrated and sized on a 10/30 Superdex S200 column to remove aggregated (unfolded) material. Fractions corresponding to monomeric material were assayed and pooled. Protein concentrations of the pooled fractions were determined by quantitative Westerns using A280 determined amounts (20.Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) of the denatured NBD proteins for a standard curve. Each pooled fraction that was used for further study contained a known amount of hNBD1 (Fig. 1D) or hNBD2 (Fig. 1, E and F). During the purification and by Western analysis we saw that hNBD1 and 2 proteins had the propensity to form homodimers even under SDS-PAGE conditions. This was most apparent with hNBD2 (Fig. 1F) as higher concentrations of refolded protein were more readily obtained. With developed procedures in hand to purify mNBD1 protein and, having refolded the hNBD1 and 2 proteins we proceeded to characterize their biochemical activities. The CFTR NBDs Function as Adenylate Kinases and Not as ATPases—Previous biochemical reports on the CFTR NBDs have suggested low catalytic rates (1–10 turnovers per minute) and the possibility of multiple enzymatic activities residing in a single domain (14.Randak C. Neth P. Auerswald E.A. Eckerskorn C. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations indicated a need for a biochemical assay system that is highly sensitive to and capable of discriminating between multiple enzymatic activities (e.g. adenylate kinase and ATPase activity). We chose a PEI-cellulose TLC system and a radiolabeled [γ-33P]phosphate ATP substrate because of its sensitivity and ability to follow reactants and products directly. The TLC system also had a solvent (0.75 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid) that is able to separate multiple reaction products that can result from enzyme action on an ATP substrate (ADP, AMP, Pi, and pyrophosphate (PPi)). The importance of a sensitive and discriminatory assay system became obvious as we evaluated CFTR NBD affinity-purified samples. In the presence of 33P γ-labeled ATP and cold AMP substrate, all mNBD1 samples purified through a His tag affinity column displayed two activities (not shown): the formation of labeled ADP (i.e. adenylate kinase activity) and the formation of labeled pyrophosphate (i.e. ATP diphosphatase activity (EC 3.6.1.8)). The other product of the latter reaction would be unlabeled AMP from the 33P γ-labeled ATP. In the presence of 33P γ-labeled ATP, the affinity-purified NBDs displayed only ATP diphosphatase activity (not shown) as evidenced by the formation of [33P]pyrophosphate. The ADP formation was only detected in the presence of AMP, consistent with adenylate kinase activity. The observation that no labeled-free phosphate was detected above background (not shown) suggests that mNBD1 cannot hydrolyze ATP. The mNBD1 samples were further purified through a subsequent Sepharose S200 sizing chromatography step, which removed ATP diphosphatase activity and demonstrated that the activity was not intrinsic to the mNBD1 protein (i.e. contaminant). The adenylate kinase activity; however, associated with the mNBD1 (Fig. 2A) and was dependent on added AMP (Fig. 2B) and the divalent cation Mg+2 (not shown). All purified mNBD1 samples displayed adenylate kinase and not ATPase activity. GMP could not be substituted for the AMP substrate (not shown), indicating that the mNBD1 ADP-forming activity had the same specificity as other adenylate kinases. Bi-substrate inhibitors, diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnA), have been shown to be potent inhibitors of adenylate kinases (25.Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Berry M.B. Phillips G.N. Proteins. 1998; 32: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We found that the mNBD1 adenylate kinase activity was inhibited by Ap5A with IC50 = 70 nm± 4 nm (ATP and AMP substrates were at Km) (Fig. 2C). From this IC50 data and linear regression, we estimate the percent active mNBD1 molecules to be between 20 and 80%. A more potent inhibitor is needed for a more accurate active site determination. At 500 μm ATP/400 μm AMP, the IC50 increased to 500 nm± 30 nm (not shown) indicating a competitive inhibition mechanism. Shorter and longer ApnA analogs were less effective in inhibiting the mNBD1 activity (Ap4A IC50 = 66 μm± 8 μm, Ap6AIC50 = 7 μm± 0.7 μm) at 500 μm ATP/400 μm AMP (not shown). Similarly, Ap5G was also a significantly poorer inhibitor (IC50 = 50 μm) consistent with the observation that GMP could not substitute for AMP as a substrate (not shown). A mNBD1 time course showed that AK activity was linear and stable at 37 °C for up to 2.5 h (Fig. 2D). At 900 nm enzyme, the kinetic parameters of mNBD1 AK activity were determined (Table 1); at saturating ATP the apparent AMP Km was 30 μm and Vmax was 0.9 μm/min whereas, at saturating AMP (400 μm) the apparent ATP Km was 30 μm and Vmax was 1.2 μm/min. At concentrations above 500 μm AMP, the mNBD1 AK activity clearly demonstrated substrate inhibition (not shown). No substrate inhibition was detected up to 5 mm ATP.TABLE 1Wild-type and mutant protein kinetic parameters for AK activityEnzymeaEnzyme concentrations are mNBD1 WT (900 nm), G551D (1800 nm), hNBD1 (4.7 nm), hNBD2 (30 nm).MutationATPAMPADPKmbKm and Vmax values are apparent.,c± S.E.VmaxbKm and Vmax values are apparent.,c± S.E.KmbKm and Vmax values are apparent.,c± S.E.VmaxbKm and Vmax value"
https://openalex.org/W2138138589,"Alcohols and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs). This is hypothesized to occur by their binding to a pocket formed between the transmembrane domains of individual α1 GlyR subunits. Because GlyRs are pentameric, it follows that each GlyR contains up to five alcohol/anesthetic binding sites, with one in each subunit. We asked how many subunits per pentamer need be bound by drug in order to enhance receptor-mediated currents. A cysteine mutation was introduced at amino acid serine 267 (S267C) in the transmembrane 2 domain as a tool to block GlyR potentiation by some anesthetic drugs and to provide a means for covalent binding by the small, anesthetic-like thiol reagent propyl methanethiosulfonate. Xenopus laevis oocytes were co-injected with various ratios of wild-type (wt) to S267C α1 GlyR cDNAs in order to express heteromeric receptors with a range of wt:mutant subunit stoichiometries. The enhancement of GlyR currents by 200 mm ethanol and 1.5 mm chloroform was positively correlated with the number of wt subunits found in heteromeric receptors. Furthermore, currents from oocytes injected with high ratios of wt to S267C cDNAs (up to 200:1) were significantly and irreversibly enhanced following propyl methanethiosulfonate labeling and washout, demonstrating that drug binding to a single subunit in the receptor pentamer is sufficient to induce enhancement of GlyR currents. Alcohols and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs). This is hypothesized to occur by their binding to a pocket formed between the transmembrane domains of individual α1 GlyR subunits.

Although volatile anesthetics were long believed to have nonspecific, lipid-based mechanisms of action, accumulating evidence led to a shift in research focus to the study of protein sites of anesthetic action and especially to the effects of these drugs on ion channels (1Mihic S.J. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 35: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Rudolph U. Antkowiak B. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Among the most studied molecular targets for these drugs are members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels, including the glycine receptor (GlyR), 2The abbreviations used are: GlyR, glycine receptor; PMTS, propyl methanethiosulfonate; TM, transmembrane domain; wt, wild-type. the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the spinal cord and brain stem (3Legendre P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Studies in rats have shown that GlyRs mediate the immobilizing effects of the anesthetics halothane, isoflurane, and cyclopropane (4Zhang Y. Laster M.J. Hara K. Harris R.A. Eger E.I. Stabernack C.R. Sonner J.M. Anesth. Analg. 2003; 96: 97-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice expressing an alcohol-insensitive mutant GlyR, these receptors mediate, at least in part, the sedating and anesthetic effects of alcohol (5Findlay G.S. Wick M.J. Mascia M.P. Wallace D. Miller G.W. Harris R.A. Blednov Y.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These in vivo data agree with functional studies indicating that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of alcohols and volatile anesthetics potentiate GlyRs in both brain slices and heterologous expression systems (6Mascia M.P.

(Shannon). 1998; 100–101: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of alcohol and volatile anesthetic enhancement of GlyR function. The GlyR consists of a pentameric assembly of subunits surrounding a central, anion-conducting pore (10Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Each of these subunits contains a large, N-terminal extracellular domain responsible for agonist binding, as well as four transmembrane (TM) domains, of which TM2 lines the channel pore and forms the channel gate (11Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Mihic et al. (12Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) identified two amino acids, serine 267 (Ser-267) in TM2 and alanine 288 (Ala-288) in TM3, that, when mutated, blocked alcohol and anesthetic enhancement of GlyR-mediated currents. Alcohols and anesthetics were hypothesized to potentiate GlyRs by binding in a water-filled pocket formed between TM2 and TM3. A subsequent study supported this hypothesis by showing that thiol reagents could covalently react with cysteine residues at position 267 (S267C) to irreversibly enhance receptor function (13Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thiols, like volatile anesthetics, may enhance GlyR function by occupying space within the water-filled pocket. Interestingly, recent structural data for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, another Cys-loop family member, indicates that there is a water-filled crevice located between the transmembrane domains of each receptor subunit (14Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Each of the five subunits in a homomeric GlyR possesses a possible TM2/TM3 anesthetic binding site. In previous studies of binding pocket mutants, the mutant subunits were expressed without wt subunits so that all five subunits in receptors bore the mutation; as a result it was unclear how many subunits had to be bound by anesthetics for their enhancing effects to be observed. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that occupancy of a single anesthetic binding pocket per receptor pentamer is sufficient to potentiate GlyR currents. By co-injecting different ratios of the S267C mutant cDNA with wild-type α1 GlyR subunit cDNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we generated heteromeric receptors containing one to four mutant subunits and then tested the effects of alcohols, anesthetics, and the thiol labeling reagent propyl methanethiosulfonate (PMTS) on these receptors. Our results suggest for the first time that occupancy of even a single alcohol or anesthetic binding pocket in a GlyR pentamer can result in enhancement of GlyR function. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were conducted on X. laevis oocytes expressing α1 GlyR subunits. Frogs (Xenopus Express) were maintained and oocytes harvested and isolated as described previously (15Beckstead M.J. Weiner J.L. Eger E.I. Gong D.H. Mihic S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the wild-type (wt) α1 GlyR subunit was previously subcloned into the pBK-CMV expression vector (12Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), the codon for serine 267 was mutated to a cysteine codon (S267C) or a methionine codon (S267M) and the codon for proline 250 was mutated to a threonine codon (P250T). cDNA concentrations and purities were ascertained through UV absorption spectra on a DU 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman). Wild-type, S267C, S267M, and P250T cDNAs were injected into the nuclei of isolated oocytes, either individually to express homomeric GlyRs or in a range of wt:S267C, S267M:S267C, or P250T:S267C cDNA ratios so as to promote the expression of heteromeric GlyRs. Assuming that wt and S267C subunits are equally likely to assemble into receptor pentamers, the predicted distribution of receptor compositions can be described by the formula shown in Equation 1 P=100×pwtX×pS267C(5−X)×5!X!(5−X)!(Eq. 1) where P represents the percentage of receptors containing x wt subunits and (5 – x) S267C subunits, pwt represents the fraction of wt cDNAs injected, and pS267C represents the fraction of S267C cDNAs injected. Calculated receptor composition percentage distributions for the cDNA ratios tested are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Predicted prevalence of receptor subunit compositions according to the ratio of wt to S267C α1 GlyR cDNAs injected Open table in a new tab Recordings were made 1–7 days after cDNA injection. Oocytes were perfused with modified Barth's solution, impaled with two electrodes filled with 3 m KCl, and voltage clamped at –70 mV. Glycine and drug solutions were prepared in modified Barth's solution at the indicated concentrations and were applied through the bath perfusion. At the beginning of each experiment, maximal GlyR currents were determined by a 30-s application of 10 mm glycine. All subsequent glycine and glycine+ drug solutions were applied for 45 s and were followed by 10-min modified Barth's solution washouts to ensure receptor recovery from desensitization. In most experiments, the concentration of glycine producing roughly a 10% maximal effect (EC10) was determined next, and the oocyte was considered suitable for recording if the EC10 current magnitude changed less than 20% over a series of three applications. For the PMTS labeling experiments, EC10 glycine was established, the oocyte was washed for 5 min, 50 μm PMTS was applied for 220 s, and a second 5-min washout was allowed before the next glycine application. Bath concentrations of the volatile anesthetics represent ∼2× the minimal alveolar concentration and were determined by gas chromatography (16Eger E.I. Ionescu P. Laster M.J. Gong D. Hudlicky T.

All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich except for enflurane (Bristol-Myers Squibb), isoflurane (Marsam Pharmaceuticals), and PMTS (Toronto Research Chemicals). Culture and transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and single-channel recordings from outside-out patches were conducted as described previously (17Findlay G.S. Phelan R. Roberts M.T. Homanics G.E. Bergeson S.E. Lopreato G.F. Mihic S.J. Blednov Y.A. Harris R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8051-8059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Outside-out macropatch recordings were similar to single-channel recordings except that the patch electrodes had lower resistances (3–6 MΩ) to promote the formation of larger patches. Macropatches were rapidly perfused with an SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step system (Warner Instruments) connected to a theta-glass outlet to give a solution exchange time of ∼1 ms. Significant differences (p <0.05) were detected by one-way or two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test or t-tests with Bonferroni correction, using SigmaPlot (SPSS) or OriginPro 7.0 (OriginLab). The S267C mutation in TM2 of the α1 subunit of the GlyR blocks receptor enhancement by ethanol (18Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) but does not affect potentiation by isoflurane, enflurane, or octanol (13Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We confirmed and extended these findings by examining the effects of the alcohols ethanol and decanol and the volatile anesthetics chloroform, isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane on glycine-gated currents in oocytes expressing either homomeric wt α1 GlyRs or homomeric S267C α1 GlyRs. As expected, all these compounds produced significant potentiation of wt GlyR currents when co-applied with EC10 glycine (Fig. 1, A–C). In oocytes expressing the mutant receptor, the S267C mutation blocked GlyR potentiation by 200 mm ethanol and changed the strong potentiating effect of 1.5 mm chloroform into a slight inhibition (Fig. 1, A and B). S267C had no significant effect on receptor potentiation by 25 μm decanol, 0.6 mm isoflurane, 1.2 mm enflurane, and 0.5 mm halothane (Fig. 1, A–C). We hypothesized that varying the number of mutant subunits/GlyR would reveal a graded correlation between receptor composition and the degree of receptor potentiation by ethanol and chloroform. To express heteromeric GlyRs, oocytes were injected with mixtures of wt and S267C cDNAs prepared in ratios of 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4 (wt:S267C). Given the reasonable assumptions (addressed under “Discussion”) that wt and S267C cDNAs yield receptor subunits equally well and that the S267C mutation has little or no effect on pentamer assembly, these cDNA combinations should give rise to receptors with an average of one, two to three, and four mutant subunits, respectively. Table 1 provides calculated distributions of receptor subunit compositions for each of the cDNA ratios injected. In these oocytes, receptor enhancement by 200 mm ethanol and 1.5 mm chloroform decreased as the proportion of S267C subunits increased (Fig. 1D). For ethanol, GlyR potentiation was no longer apparent when an average of two-three of the receptor subunits contained mutant binding pockets, whereas for chloroform, potentiation was evident until an average of four subunits bore the mutant binding pocket. As with the homomeric receptors, potentiation of the heteromeric receptors by 25 μm decanol, 0.6 mm isoflurane, 1.2 mm enflurane, and 0.5 mm halothane did not depend on receptor subunit makeup, indicating that the heteromeric receptors retain the ability to be potentiated by alcohols and anesthetics (Fig. 1D). To more directly assess how many binding pockets must be occupied to induce receptor potentiation, we covalently modified the anesthetic binding pocket. PMTS is a small, uncharged molecule that reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues to attach a propyl group through a disulfide bond. It was previously demonstrated that perfusion of homomeric S267C mutant GlyRs with PMTS results in labeling of the mutant cysteine residue and permanent potentiation of receptor function after PMTS washout (13Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, before using this approach to examine binding pocket occupancy, we showed that 5 mm PMTS enhances GlyR function like alcohols or anesthetics when directly co-applied to wt and S267C GlyRs with an EC10 concentration of glycine (Fig. 2). After a 10-min washout, the wt response to EC10 glycine was slightly decreased from baseline, indicating that PMTS interacts reversibly with these receptors. In contrast, the S267C response remained significantly potentiated after PMTS washout, indicating that PMTS covalently labels the mutant cysteine residue in S267C receptors such that the binding pocket remains permanently occupied by the propyl group attached to the mutant cysteine. We next asked whether PMTS labeling of a single mutant cysteine residue in receptor heteromers containing four wt subunits and one S267C subunit would lead to receptor enhancement. To express receptors containing one mutant subunit, oocytes were injected with cDNAs in the ratio of 30:1 wt:S267C. Based on the calculated values shown in Table 1, this ratio should give rise to a pool of receptors in which 85% are homomeric wt and the remaining 15% are heteromeric. Of the heteromeric receptors, 94% were calculated to contain only one mutant subunit and the remaining 6% to contain two S267C subunits. For each oocyte, an EC10 concentration of glycine was established, 50 μm PMTS was perfused for 220 s, and the response to EC10 glycine was measured 5 min later (Fig. 3, A and B). Currents from oocytes injected with the 30:1 ratio of wt:S267C cDNAs were significantly potentiated following PMTS application and washout, as were currents from oocytes injected only with S267C GlyR cDNAs. In contrast, currents from wt cDNA-injected oocytes were not enhanced by the treatment. Because PMTS labeling of the 30:1 wt:S267C-injected oocytes yielded a sizable potentiation, we hypothesized that we could further decrease the proportion of S267C cDNAs injected and still observe a significant potentiation of GlyR function after PMTS labeling. By reducing the proportion of S267C subunits in the overall subunit pool, the chances of more than one mutant subunit assembling into a receptor pentamer would be minimized. To this end, oocytes were injected with increasing ratios of wt:S267C subunit cDNAs (50:1, 100:1, and 200:1), and, as above, the response to EC10 glycine was determined before and after 50 μm PMTS application. Confirming the hypothesis, potentiation was observed for each cDNA ratio, and the averaged data revealed a linear correlation between the predicted percentage of heteromeric receptors relative to total receptors and the degree of receptor enhancement (Fig. 3C). This correlation strongly supports the overall hypothesis that occupancy of a single alcohol and anesthetic binding pocket/receptor pentamer is sufficient to induce receptor potentiation. Because drug binding to one subunit/receptor pentamer was sufficient to enhance receptor currents, we tested the hypothesis that the remaining subunits not binding drug could modify the enhancing effects of the drug bound to the first subunit. To accomplish this, we utilized a serine to methionine mutation at position 267 (S267M) that cannot covalently react with PMTS. S267M GlyR do not display potentiation by most alcohols and volatile anesthetics when expressed homomerically (data not shown). Oocytes were injected with 100:1 and 30:1 ratios of S267M:S267C or wt:S267C α1 GlyR subunit cDNAs, and current responses to EC10 glycine were determined before and after application of 50 μm PMTS (Fig. 4A). At both the 100:1 and 30:1 cDNA ratios, the S267M mutation significantly reduced the enhancing effects of PMTS when compared with currents from oocytes injected with wt:S267C cDNAs at the same ratios (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that anesthetic enhancement of GlyR function can be affected by subunits in the pentamer that themselves are not directly interacting with anesthetic. To assess whether the S267C mutation significantly alters GlyR expression or function, we examined homomeric and heteromeric GlyRs in two assays. First, currents elicited from oocytes upon application of a maximal concentration of glycine (10 mm) were determined. The magnitudes of these responses provide a measure of the expression level and function of receptors (17Findlay G.S. Phelan R. Roberts M.T. Homanics G.E. Bergeson S.E. Lopreato G.F. Mihic S.J. Blednov Y.A. Harris R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8051-8059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was a small but significant difference (<30%) between the maximal currents elicited by homomeric wt and S267C receptors (Fig. 5A). Additionally, maximal currents from oocytes injected with the wt:S267C cDNA ratios examined in this report did not differ significantly from wt or S267C homomeric receptors. Because the magnitude of maximal currents depends on the unitary conductance, activation and desensitization kinetics, and cell surface expression levels of receptors, we characterized wt and S267C receptor function in recordings from human embryonic kidney 293 cell macropatches and single-channel patches to determine whether the S267C mutation specifically affects any of these properties. Rapid perfusion macropatch studies showed that the activation time constants were <1 ms for both wt and S267C homomeric receptors and that the receptors did not differ in their rates of desensitization in response to a 1-s pulse of 10 mm glycine (data not shown). The single-channel conductance of wt α1 GlyR in response to application of 10 μm glycine was 103 pS, whereas for homomeric S267C α1 GlyR it was 54 pS. The observed difference in maximally evoked currents from wt and S267C homomers seen in oocytes (Fig. 5A) can likely be explained by the lower conductance of S267C receptors. Thus, if channel kinetics do not differ between wt and S267C receptors (i.e. individual wt and S267C receptors behave almost identically) and unitary conductance can be accounted for, the whole-oocyte maximal currents should be reflective of channel numbers on the cell surface. It is therefore likely that the ratios of subunit cDNAs injected accurately reflect the protein levels of subunits found on the cell surface. Second, glycine concentration-response data were obtained from oocytes injected with wt or S267C cDNAs or a 30:1 mixture of wt:S267C cDNAs (Fig. 5B). Fits of the Hill function indicate that the S267C mutation had only a small effect on glycine sensitivity in both heteromeric and homomeric mutant receptors. To further test whether the S267C mutation might somehow increase subunit expression levels, we adapted an approach developed by Breitinger and Becker (19Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 331: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These investigators identified a GlyR α1 mutation (P250T) that results in receptors with significantly right-shifted glycine responses. When they mixed various ratios of wt to P250T cDNAs, they found that the glycine EC50s of receptors increased as the proportion of P250T cDNAs transfected increased. We reasoned that if this P250T mutant were co-injected with the S267C mutant, which shows no evidence of a right shift, and if the S267C mutant were expressed at a higher level than we predicted, then one would expect P250T:S267C heteromers to display greater glycine sensitivity than P250T homomers. This was not the case (Fig. 5B). Recent studies suggest that alcohols and anesthetics modulate GlyR function by binding to pockets formed between the transmembrane domains of individual GlyR subunits. Because GlyRs are pentameric, each GlyR necessarily contains five binding pockets. In the present study, we asked how many of these binding pockets must be occupied by drug in order to enhance GlyR currents. To examine this problem, GlyR subunits containing the S267C binding pocket mutation were co-expressed with wild-type subunits in various ratios to generate heteromeric receptors containing different numbers of mutant binding pockets. The properties of these mutant binding pockets were then used to investigate the modulatory effects of alcohols, anesthetics, and the thiol reagent PMTS on these receptors. In homomeric mutant receptors, the S267C mutation blocked GlyR potentiation by 1.5 mm chloroform and 200 mm ethanol but did not block potentiation by 25 μm decanol, 1.2 mm enflurane, 0.5 mm halothane, and 0.6 mm isoflurane. These data indicate that S267C blocks the enhancing effects of the relatively small ligands chloroform and ethanol but not those of larger ligands. This may be because the higher volumes of larger anesthetics cause them to interact with more residues in the binding pocket than do ethanol and chloroform, thereby allowing them to avoid the effects of the mutant residue in the binding pocket. It should be noted that the concentration of ethanol used in this study (200 mm) represents an anesthetic concentration and is much higher than the ∼17 mm blood alcohol concentration that defines the legal limit for alcohol intoxication. However, regulatory proteins, neuromodulators, and/or receptor phosphorylation may make the GlyR more sensitive to ethanol at concentrations closer to the legal limit (20Aguayo L.G. Peoples R.W. Yeh H.H. Yevenes G.E. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 869-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Martinez L.D. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When oocytes were injected with 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4 ratios of wt:S267C cDNAs, chloroform and ethanol potentiation of receptor currents decreased in a graded fashion as the proportion of S267C subunits increased. These data suggest that receptor currents could still be enhanced even when chloroform or ethanol could not productively interact with all possible binding pockets in the receptors. The low affinities of alcohols and anesthetics prevented us from using these drugs to more precisely determine the minimal number of binding pockets that needed to be occupied for enhancement of receptor function. Covalent labeling by PMTS, a molecule structurally related to alcohols and anesthetics that enhanced receptor currents just as an alcohol or anesthetic would, allowed us to circumvent this problem. We reasoned that co-injecting oocytes with a high ratio of wt:S267C GlyR cDNAs would strongly favor the formation of homomeric wt GlyRs. A small percentage of receptors would be assembled into heteromers containing four wt subunits and one mutant subunit, and fewer still would contain multiple S267C subunits. In oocytes injected with a 30:1 ratio of wt:S267C cDNAs, 50 μm PMTS application, followed by a 5-min washout, resulted in >150% enhancement of GlyR currents. Extending this approach, we increased the ratio of wt:S267C cDNAs injected to 50:1, 100:1, and 200:1. Each of these cDNA ratios yielded receptors that were significantly and irreversibly potentiated by PMTS. At the 200:1 ratio, 97.5% of receptors were calculated to be composed exclusively of wt subunits, whereas the remaining receptors contained only a single S267C subunit and four wt subunits. Because PMTS had no permanent enhancing effect on homomeric wt GlyRs, the observed enhancement of receptor currents could only be attributed to PMTS occupancy of the single mutant binding pocket in heteromeric receptors containing one S267C subunit. Importantly, the degree of potentiation in these receptors was linearly correlated with the cDNA ratio tested, confirming our hypothesis that fewer S267C subunits were expressed when less S267C cDNA was injected. Application of PMTS resulted in marked potentiation of GlyR function in receptors containing S267C subunits. For example, after injection of a 100:1 ratio of wt:S267C cDNAs, one would expect 5% of expressed receptors to contain a single S267C subunit and the remaining 95% to be composed completely of wt subunits. The 100% increase in current following PMTS application (Fig. 3C) must therefore have been due to a 20-fold increase in the current generated by this 5% of receptors. A 20-fold increase would be greater than the predicted EC100 glycine response for these receptors. Such a large potentiating effect is seen because PMTS, unlike volatile anesthetics, binds covalently and thus is always present when glycine binds to activate the receptor. A similarly large effect was previously observed with benzyl-MTS labeling of homomeric S267C GlyRs (22Lobo I.A. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33919-33927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, our estimate of the maximal effect of glycine (EC100) is likely an underestimate because drug perfusion in oocytes occurs slowly and considerable desensitization may have occurred before the current peak height was achieved. Thus, the calculated EC values for glycine in these experiments are likely overestimates. If PMTS binding to a single S267C residue is sufficient to enhance GlyR currents, why does ethanol and chloroform enhancement of GlyR function decrease as the number of S267C subunits increases in heteromeric receptors (Fig. 1D)? A logical supposition is that the properties of all subunits in a receptor and not just the ones physically interacting with anesthetics determine the GlyR responses to anesthetics, because all five subunits contribute to the formation of the channel gate and the central pore. We tested this hypothesis by producing receptors that had at most a single S267C subunit paired with four anesthetic-insensitive S267M subunits. After labeling with PMTS, we found that these receptors were significantly less enhanced than their wt:S267C counterparts. Thus, the ability of ethanol and chloroform to enhance receptors containing only one or two wt subunits may be blocked by the S267C subunits composing the rest of the receptor pentamer. Our interpretation of our results depends on the underlying hypothesis that the ratio of GlyR subunit cDNAs injected into oocytes is reflected in the ratio of subunits found in the resulting receptors. Thus, cDNAs injected in high wt:S267C ratios promote the formation of heteromeric receptors containing a single mutant subunit. Several lines of evidence argue that this is indeed occurring. First, the S267C mutation is made by changing one nucleotide in the GlyR α1 subunit cDNA, making it highly unlikely that there are differences in the rates of transcription and translation between wt and S267C cDNAs. Second, previous studies determined that the regions responsible for GlyR assembly are in the extracellular, N-terminal portion of the subunit, far removed from the S267C site in TM2 (23Griffon N. Buttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). If the S267C mutation somehow favored the formation of homomeric S267C receptors, then the identity of the subunit co-expressed with S267C should not affect enhancement of S267C receptors by PMTS labeling. Our data indicate, however, that when S267M and S267C cDNAs were co-injected, the effects of PMTS labeling were significantly reduced. Third, the substitution of a cysteine residue for serine is very conservative both chemically and functionally. Chemically, it involves exchanging a hydroxyl group for a sulfhydryl group. Functionally, it did not largely alter the glycine concentration-response curves in either heteromeric or homomeric S267C receptors nor did it affect receptor enhancement by some of the drugs tested. Fourth, at the 200:1 wt:S267C cDNA ratio, where it was predicted that >99% of the heteromeric receptors contained only one mutant subunit, the preponderance of wt cDNA made it highly unlikely that more than one S267C subunit could be assembled into any single receptor, and yet PMTS still significantly enhanced the currents elicited by these receptors. Our results lead to the conclusion that drug occupancy of a single alcohol or anesthetic binding pocket in a GlyR pentamer is sufficient to enhance receptor function. Previous findings suggest that proteins have a few discrete sites at which anesthetics can bind. For example, three binding sites for halothane were identified in human serum albumin (24Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), two binding sites for bromoform in luciferase (25Franks N.P. Jenkins A. Conti E. Lieb W.R. Brick P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2205-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and there is a single alcohol binding site in the Drosophila odorant-binding protein LUSH (26Kruse S.W. Zhao R. Smith D.P. Jones D.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of LUSH it was found that the binding of a single alcohol molecule dramatically increased the conformational stability of the protein (26Kruse S.W. Zhao R. Smith D.P. Jones D.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the case of the glycine receptor, whose alcohol binding pocket shares a motif with the LUSH alcohol binding pocket, there is therefore some precedent for the idea that the interaction of even a single anesthetic molecule at position 267 is sufficient to affect GlyR conformation and, by extension, GlyR function. This effect is perhaps due to the close proximity of Ser-267 to both the channel gate in TM2 and the TM2/TM3 loop that transduces agonist binding information to the gate (27Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our data do not indicate whether binding of additional drug molecules to a GlyR can lead to additional potentiation of receptor currents. It seems likely that this is the case. Single-channel studies indicate that binding of a single glycine molecule to one agonist binding site on a GlyR can lead to channel opening, whereas binding of additional glycine molecules increases both the likelihood and duration of opening events (28Beato M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Colquhoun D. Sivilotti L.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Burzomato V. Beato M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Colquhoun D. Sivilotti L.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10924-10940Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, one binding event is sufficient to modify activity, but multiple binding events may do so more effectively. This conforms to allosteric theory, which posits that, due to the symmetry of receptors, conformational changes in one receptor subunit will induce concerted changes in the remaining subunits (30Miller K.W. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method with homomeric cysteine mutants, Lobo et al. (22Lobo I.A. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33919-33927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently found that the GlyR alcohol and anesthetic binding pocket undergoes a conformational change upon receptor gating to the open state. This suggests that alcohol or anesthetic occupancy of the binding pocket promotes the open state by favoring an enlarged pocket conformation. Based on these studies and our current results, we propose that the binding of one alcohol or anesthetic molecule to the TM2/TM3 binding pocket of a single GlyR subunit can induce receptor-wide conformational changes that lead to enhancement of channel gating. We thank R. Adron Harris for helpful discussions."

Biologists are embracing nanotechnology—the engineering and manipulating of entities in the 1 to 100 nm range—and are exploiting its potential to develop new therapeutics and diagnostics. In late August, behind closed doors at the austere National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C., Samuel Stupp, a materials scientist and director of the Institute for BioNanotechnology in Medicine at Northwestern University, showed a video clip for a committee evaluating the United States' billion-dollar-a-year National Nanotechnology Program. “Everyone was so quiet watching this movie. It was amazing,” recalls Clayton Teague, director of the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office. The video's protagonist was a mouse with a damaged spinal cord that could only barely move using its front legs. Stupp's research involves engineering nanomolecules called peptide amphiphiles consisting of a hydrocarbon tail attached to a peptide into which is inserted amino-acid sequences that stimulate neurons to seek new connections with neighboring neurons. As the video clip revealed, two months after the injured mouse received an injection of Stupp's peptide amphiphiles, it was able to move (albeit awkwardly) using all four limbs. In bench tests, these same amphiphiles self-assemble into fibers with diameters in the nanometer-scale range, and the resulting nanofibers form neuron-friendly networks. Analyzing anatomical, molecular, and behavioral results from mice with spinal cord injury, Stupp and his collaborator, Northwestern neurology professor John A. Kessler, suspect that the amphiphiles, which form a gel when they self-assemble, prevent scar tissue from forming, thereby allowing initiation of the regenerative process in the injured spinal cord, a process that normally is blocked. Restoring a measure of mobility to a paralyzed animal, and the potential transfer of such a feat into human patients, is just one dramatic trajectory of the maturing and ever better funded face of biological nanotechnology and its most touted offshoot—nanomedicine. Its practitioners have entered a new era rife with video evidence like Stupp's and Kessler's, patents for sensitive molecular detectors, and nanoparticle-based contrast agents for detecting, monitoring, and treating many illnesses, from breast cancer to cold sores. Nanotechnology pioneer, Richard Smalley, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996 for discovering buckyballs—the all-carbon, soccerball-shaped molecules that helped to push nanotechnology into high gear. Smalley, who died of leukemia in October at the age of 62, was one of the most vocal champions of the beneficial potential of nanotechnology, which he argued was destined to solve major societal and medical problems. In many of his speaking engagements since his cancer diagnosis in 1999, he asked rhetorically, “am I part of the last generation to die of cancer, or the first to be saved by nanotechnology?” Now there is a growing roster of biological nanotechnologists who are taking audacious questions like Smalley's to heart and to their laboratories. The word “nanotechnology” conjures up the notion of human innovation and control over objects and processes on the nanometer scale. This is a compelling size range because it is here that many technologically useful properties emerge from assemblies of atoms and molecules. For example, it is in this range that semiconductor materials, such as cadmium selenide, can be designed to emit a rainbow of different colors and thereby serve as biomarkers in cells. The tools of nanotechnology continue to infiltrate molecular biology whose objects of study—DNA, RNA, and proteins—are perhaps the most elegant example of nanoscale constructions. It's important to avoid confusing terms like “nanobiology,” clarifies Jeff Schloss, a program director with the National Human Genome Research Institute and a member of a working group that oversees programs within the year-old research and development framework of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), known as the Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer. After all, Schloss notes, anything in biology that is subcellular in size falls within the nanometer range. A typical protein like hemoglobin is about 5 nm in diameter, DNA's double helix spans about 2 nm, a mitochondrion stretches over a few hundred nm. So, says Schloss, “if we allow the stuff in cells to be considered as nanotechnology, then it becomes hopeless to separate nanotechnology from regular biology.” The distinction between the two, he says, is that “nanotechnology is not nature. Technology is something people make.” Physician Andrew C. von Eschenbach, director of the NCI, has repeatedly identified nanotechnology as central to the Institute's “Challenge Goal” of, in his own words, “eliminating suffering and death from cancer by 2015.” Says Eschenbach: “The NCI is engaged in a concerted effort to harness the power of nanotechnology to radically change the way we diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer.” In 2004, the NCI launched the $144.3 million, 5-year Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer. In October of this year, the Alliance announced awards totaling $26.3 million for the first-year funding of seven “centers of cancer nanotechnology excellence.” Each of these brings together interdisciplinary expertise from neighboring academic, medical, and corporate partners to achieve common goals. Such goals include the development of magnetic nanoparticles for brain tumor imaging and treatment and in vivo nanoscale sensing devices that can monitor and report on gene expression. The Alliance also announced $7-million worth of first-year awards for the establishment of a dozen “Cancer Nanotechnology Platform Partnerships,” which fund research collaborations focused on developing technologies in six program areas. These areas include the development of in vivo imaging tools and methods to assess treatment efficacy in real time. In addition to the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer, the NIH has launched a related R&D framework, known as the NIH Nanomedicine Roadmap Initiative, which has earmarked about $80 million through 2009 for medically directed biology research on the nanoscale. So far, the Alliance has announced awards of nearly $6 million, which will fund the creation of four Nanomedicine Development Centers. Among the awardees is the Center for Design of Biomimetic Nanoconductors based at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. There, researchers will investigate the basic biology, manipulation, and design of ion channels, protein-based pores, and other nanoscale portals by which ions, chemical signals, and other molecules can move across cell membranes. A primary goal of the center will be to cull ideas from biological systems for the design of biobatteries that could be useful in implantable devices such as artificial retinas. The European research and development community also is gearing up for a strategic push into nanomedicine. In September, stakeholders in industry, private and public research centers, and academia released a “vision paper” entitled “European Technology Platform on NanoMedicine: Nanotechnology for Health.” According to a spokesman for the European Commission's Research Directorate-General's office, this document could lead to the specification of nanomedicine as a priority area in the European Union's ongoing Framework Programmes, the latest of which encompasses 17.5 billion Euros. Even as these large-scale R&D formats are designed and funded, Fortune 500 companies and startups are racing to develop and market biological nanotechnologies. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency, and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad struggle to identify potential health, environmental, and occupational hazards that could come with these new and still poorly understood products. These same agencies also are working toward protocols to manage those risks. Reports by market analysis firms claim that there are more than 100 nano-based biomedical products—including drugs, drug-delivery systems, therapeutic devices, and diagnostic tests—in various stages of development and commercialization. In January this year, the FDA approved Abraxane—described by the NCI “as the first of a new class of ‘protein-bound particle’ drugs”—for treating metastatic breast cancer patients who do not respond to chemotherapy or whose cancer returns after such treatment. Developed by American Pharmaceutical Partners in Schaumburg, Illinois and Santa Monica-based American Bioscience, Abraxane consists of molecules of the chemotherapy agent taxol (paclitaxel) attached to the blood serum protein albumin to form injectable medicinal nanoparticles. Phase III clinical trials in 454 breast cancer patients showed that Abraxane was better than Taxol alone at reducing the size of tumors (about 33% reduction for Abraxane treatment compared with 19% for Taxol alone) and at slowing tumor progression (about 22 weeks with no worsening of breast cancer for Abraxane compared with about 16 weeks for Taxol). In the standard Taxol treatment, the active drug (which is highly insoluble in water) is dissolved in a solvent derived from castor oil that can have serious side effects in patients. Because of its lower toxicity, Abraxane treatment can safely deliver more active drug to tumors. Among other investigational nanomedicines in clinical testing is Combidex, a magnetic nanoparticle that can be used to make certain cancers stand out more obviously in magnetic resonance imaging scans. These particles consist of nanoscale clumps of iron oxide wrapped in a carbohydrate shell, resulting in nanoparticles with a diameter of 40 nm. Because these nanoparticles are taken up by macrophages (immune cells present in healthy lymph nodes but not in cancerous nodes), the particles accumulate selectively in noncancerous lymph nodes. In MRI scans, therefore, healthy lymph nodes produce bigger signals, which makes them appear dark compared to cancerous nodes, which appear lighter. One aim of the technique is to help distinguish nodes that are enlarged due to cancer from those enlarged due to inflammation. Made by Advanced Magnetics Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the FDA issued this past March a so-called “approvable letter,” which indicates that the new nanoparticle-based contrast agent can be approved as long as the company provides additional clinical data. Abraxane and Combidex represent perhaps the largest class of nanoscale products in various stages of development, that is, nanoparticles. By mixing and matching various cores—made of polymers, metal oxides, semiconductor materials like cadmium selenide, and carbon nanotubes—with different coatings and molecular appendages (that add capabilities such as tissue-targeting, drug-delivery, imaging enhancement, and selective ability to absorb laser energy), researchers are developing a catalog of nanoparticles for medical applications. One of the more visible players in this arena is James Baker, director of the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences. It was the known dangers of another emerging molecular technology in the 1990s, gene therapy, that prompted his entry into the field of nanotechnology research. He was dismayed by the death in 1999 of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger during a controversial human trial of an experimental gene therapy treatment. Baker says, “at that point, it struck me that what was really needed was synthetic systems” that would be less likely to elicit dangerous immune responses. For many medical applications, he knew the most basic structural criterion that such systems would have to meet: “You have to be in a certain size range to get out of blood vessels and into cells—bigger than 25 nm but smaller than 70 nm,” he says. That's right in the middle of the classic size range—1 to 100 nm—that the nanotechnology community has defined as its own. By the mid-1990s, Baker and a few dozen colleagues in a variety of disciplines began pooling their expertise with the goal of developing medically valuable nanoparticles whose structures and properties were sufficiently uniform and well characterized to meet stringent FDA requirements for any drug candidate. In the late 1990s, the NCI awarded Baker and his colleagues a $12 million grant to, in Baker's words, “develop a platform that essentially would diagnose a cancer, treat it, image the tumor, and also see if the tumor was responding.” (Baker also is the principal investigator for one of the Cancer Nanotechnology Platform Partnerships recently awarded by NCI.) The nanoparticles that Baker and his colleagues are developing as drug delivery vehicles are called dendrimers. A dendrimer is an unusually well-defined polymer structure built up using simple monomeric units from a central core in precisely controlled steps that sequentially add layers. This synthetic procedure leads to spherical bush-like structures of specified and uniform nanoscale sizes. Conventional polymers grow into linear and often branching structures, but the individual molecules range vastly in size, a nonuniformity that would be unlikely to pass muster with the FDA. The most advanced dendrimer designed by Baker's team so far is based on a PAMAM (polyamidoamine) dendrimer that contains a mechanism for directing the dendrimer to cancer cells and a means for delivering an anticancer drug, such as methotrexate, once the nanoparticle has reached its target. “Targeting drugs directly to cancer cells reduces the amount that gets to normal cells, increases the drug's anticancer effect, and reduces its toxicity,” Baker says. To achieve such targeting, the researchers attach molecules of folate to chemical “hooks” built into the PAMAM nanoparticles. Because certain types of cancer cells overexpress folate receptors, dendrimers bearing folate molecules are able to home to these cells and stick to them. First, the investigators showed that when folate-bearing PAMAM nanoparticles carrying fluorescent marker molecules were injected into mice bearing certain human tumors the dendrimers became sequestered in the cancerous tissue. With up to 120 attachment points for molecular appendages, the PAMAM dendrimers can be readily engineered to carry chemotherapy agents such as methotrexate. In the June 15 issue of Cancer Research, Baker and his collaborators report that between 30 and 40 percent of the mice receiving the dendrimer-methotrexate nanoparticles lived for the trial's entire 99 day duration, whereas all mice in the control group died in that time period. By Baker's calculations, a three month delay in tumor growth for a mouse may be equivalent to a three year delay in the progression of a tumor in human patients. Their therapeutic potential notwithstanding, the question arises of whether nanoscale particles pose toxicological dangers that nobody has yet anticipated. The small portfolio of toxicology studies in hand so far suggest that nanoparticles, such as buckyballs and related all-carbon particles known as buckytubes, indeed can pose respiratory hazards in a similar way to nanoscale soot particles in diesel exhaust. But the higher-stakes question is whether the various nanoscale particles researchers are developing, and that are winding their way into products on store shelves and doctors offices, harbor toxicities and environmental hazards that are new. For example, could Stupp's amphiphiles end up migrating from the point of injection and self-assemble elsewhere in ways that, say, interfere with blood circulation or the filtering capacity of the kidneys? “We know nanoparticles can pass through the blood brain barrier. We know they can make it through the placenta,” says Toni Marechaux, director of the Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design of the National Research Council, a body of the National Academy of Sciences. Like many in the nanotechnology community, Marechaux and her colleagues worry that there may be heretofore unrecognized hazards posed by nanotechnologies as they enter widespread use, including those already on the market, such as sunscreens containing nanoscale particles of titanium dioxide. The toxicology studies have yet to be done, Marechaux notes. “We just don't know what the dangers might be.” That's true for every new nanoscale entity under development. Researchers in academia, industry, and government have only just begun to design and undertake health and environmental hazard studies for nanotechnologies. Early data indicate that nanoscale particles can pass through the skin and, in the case of carbon nanotubes, can lead to inflammation when inhaled into the lung, leading to the formation of small scar patches called granulomas. According to a National Toxicology Program fact sheet on nanoparticles, “particle size can impart toxicity equally if not more so than chemical composition,” a phenomenon “that hints at the complexity of the topic.” What's more, “there are indications…that manufactured nanoscale materials may distribute in the body in unpredictable ways.” “I am concerned about what could happen,” says Baker, a member of the Nanotechnology Technical Advisory Group of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. “I think it's crazy to have abject fear, but we need to be careful. If we in the field are claiming that by making particles nanoscale, we impart something unique to them, then we can't argue at the same time that we know they are safe.” The world is full of dangerous medicines and technologies that are beneficial because their toxicities and other hazards are known and manageable and their benefits are deemed to outweigh their risks, points out Teague, director of the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office. With that reality long in place, he and other biological nanotechnology devotees believe that the same ought to hold for the nanoscale wonders that they are making real."

Although the structural analysis of transcription has attained atomic resolution, techniques to manipulate single molecules involved in transcription have lagged behind. A recent paper in Nature by Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A. Greenleaf W.J. Shaevitz J.W. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar closes this gap. This study finds that individual molecules of bacterial RNA polymerase move in single base-pair steps and concludes that RNA polymerase acts as a Brownian ratchet that is driven forward by the binding of incoming nucleoside triphosphates. RNA polymerases (RNAPs) transcribe genetic material by selecting nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates according to the sequence of the DNA template. For thousands of nucleotide addition steps, RNAP translocates along the DNA without dissociating from either the template or the growing RNA product until it encounters a termination factor or signal. RNAP works against a considerable frictional drag in the cell. Indeed, RNAP from the bacterium Escherichia coli exerts mechanical forces that are substantially larger than those generated by “classic” molecular motors, such as kinesin and myosin. During transcription, RNAP responds to various inputs, including nucleic acids, small effectors, and protein factors, with changes in velocity and in the structure of the transcription elongation complex. RNAP does not move along the template monotonously; at certain sites, it falls into various “off-pathway” states that, far from being merely inactive complexes, are thought to be essential for transcriptional control. These off-pathway states likely mediate the recruitment of accessory factors and give rise to complexes that are paused, arrested, and prone to termination. The variety of mechanistically and biologically important states of the transcription elongation complex makes the analysis of transcript elongation crucial for understanding the mechanisms and regulation of gene expression. However, from a practical standpoint, the coexistence of several RNAP states complicates kinetic analysis because bulk measurements represent the ensemble average of these states. This problem can be addressed by single-molecule techniques, which apply forces on individual RNAP molecules and can be used to monitor their progression in real time, thus allowing, in principle, the analysis of only the rapidly moving, “on-pathway” transcription complexes. Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A. Greenleaf W.J. Shaevitz J.W. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar now report a major technological improvement in their “dumbbell” optical trap, in which the distance between two beads is measured. One bead is attached to the end of the DNA and the other to RNAP, which allows the movement of RNAP along the template to be monitored. Through ingenious engineering—which involved switching to a helium atmosphere to reduce the effects of random air currents and the design of a passive-force clamp that exerts a constant force over a range of bead displacements—the authors achieved the ultimate, single-nucleotide resolution of RNAP position on a template and demonstrated that RNAP moves in discrete, nucleotide-size steps of 3.7 ± 0.6 Å. The improved resolution, and the ability to “filter out” RNAPs that had fallen into backtracked states, allowed the authors to study the mechanism of enzyme translocation in the productive mode. Intuitively, upon completion of each nucleotide addition cycle, which is comprised minimally of NTP binding, phosphodiester bond formation, and pyrophosphate (PPi) release, RNAP should move forward one step. However, until now, it has not been proven that RNAP physically moves in one-nucleotide steps (as opposed to several-nucleotide leaps), and both the exact point in the nucleotide addition cycle at which translocation occurs and the force that drives it are under debate. As with any other motor, two mechanisms can be envisioned for RNAP. In a power-stroke model, the energy released upon NTP hydrolysis is transformed into an elastic deformation of the enzyme and then used to “push” the RNAP forward upon relaxation. In a Brownian ratchet model, RNAP oscillates back and forth along the template in response to thermal motions; to favor a net forward movement, these fluctuations must be biased, e.g., by binding of the substrate NTP. Several models positing that RNAP works as a Brownian ratchet have been put forth. Bulk biochemical assays demonstrate that, when slowed by NTP deprivation in vitro, RNAP oscillates among several modes, which differ in the position of the 3′ end of the RNA relative to the active site (Guajardo and Sousa, 1997Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Bar-Nahum et al., 2005Bar-Nahum G. Epshtein V. Ruckenstein A.E. Rafikov R. Mustaev A. Nudler E. Cell. 2005; 120: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and references therein). The incoming substrate may stabilize the 3′ end in the active site, thereby blocking RNAP oscillations. These observations, however, cannot necessarily be extended to transcription at physiological concentrations of NTPs. In fact, previous studies by the Block lab suggested that a few RNAP molecules that undergo reverse translocation may do so upon ribonucleotide misincorporation, which is clearly an off-pathway event (Shaevitz et al., 2003Shaevitz J.W. Abbondanzieri E.A. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). By contrast, structural analysis of the complete set of intermediates in the T7 RNAP translocation cycle made a strong case for the power-stroke model, in which pyrophosphate (PPi) release is tightly coupled to the translocation of RNAP by one nucleotide via movement of the catalytic O helix (Yin and Steitz, 2004Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although the corresponding structures of the bacterial transcription elongation complex are not yet available, interactions with the nucleic-acid chains and the geometry of the active site are strikingly similar between very distinct multisubunit bacterial and single-subunit bacteriophage T7 enzymes, suggesting that the mechanochemistry of transcription may be universal. Single-molecule experiments, in which application of external force would affect RNAP displacement along the DNA, can be used to distinguish between these models. The power-stroke model, in which PPi release drives translocation, predicts that, at low NTPs, when substrate binding is the rate-limiting step and the enzyme is “mostly translocated,” the force will have little effect on RNAP velocity. Conversely, at high concentrations of NTPs, the PPi release (which is coupled to translocation) would be selectively slowed by an opposing force or facilitated by an assisting force. However, force-velocity measurements with E. coli RNAP by Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A. Greenleaf W.J. Shaevitz J.W. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar reveal the opposite trend: RNAP is more sensitive to force at low NTP levels, whereas the force required to reduce its maximal velocity 2-fold decreased at high NTP levels. Together with the earlier data (cited in Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A. Greenleaf W.J. Shaevitz J.W. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) showing that elongation velocity is largely independent of PPi concentration, this study rejects the model for E. coli RNAP translocation in which a power stroke is tightly coupled to PPi release. Importantly, however, this work does not invalidate the power-stroke model for T7 RNAP (for which comparable data are not available), nor does it imply that the E. coli enzyme does not use the energy from NTP hydrolysis to produce another kind of movement. Instead, these data support a model in which binding of the NTP substrate biases thermal fluctuations of RNAP in the forward direction. Interestingly, although force-velocity data could be fitted with a mechanism in which the substrate binds to a single catalytic site, an even better fit was obtained if an intermediate site was postulated, where NTP binds prior to catalysis. Whereas neither of these sites can be identified by single-molecule experiments, recent structural studies of multisubunit RNAP reveal three distinct NTP binding sites (Kettenberger et al., 2004Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, Westover et al., 2004Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Temiakov et al., 2005Temiakov D. Zenkin N. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Kashkina E. Savkina M. Zorov S. Nikiforov V. Igarashi N. et al.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 655-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar proposed a model in which all three sites constitute a single NTP-loading pathway (Figure 1A ). Which of these three sites are consistent with the “two-site” model? The NTP binds to the preinsertion and insertion sites with high specificity, as revealed by its multiple interactions with residues in the protein and, most importantly, by base pairing with the DNA template. Together, these sites provide a double sieve for substrate selection by the RNAP. The importance of these sites is underscored by the presence of functionally analogous NTP binding sites in other proteins, such as T7 RNAP, CCA-adding enzymes, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In contrast, the low-affinity entry site (E site), in which the NTP does not interact with the template, is structurally unique (Westover et al., 2004Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is thought that NTP binding at the E site stimulates the forward translocation of the transcription elongation complexes; however, no direct evidence in support of this idea has been presented. Several observations question the functional importance of the E site. First, the E site does not appear to mediate loading of the correct substrate because only a noncognate NTP (which does not promote translocation; Temiakov et al., 2005Temiakov D. Zenkin N. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Kashkina E. Savkina M. Zorov S. Nikiforov V. Igarashi N. et al.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 655-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) binds in the E site, whereas the cognate NTP occupies the insertion site. Second, stable NTP binding to the E site, which is missing the determinants for substrate selection, would result in competition between the cognate and noncognate ribonucleoside triphosphates, or even deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, thereby inhibiting transcription and reducing fidelity. Third, it is not obvious that competition between the phosphates of the E site NTP and the 3′-terminal RNA nucleotide can disrupt the extensive interaction between the nucleic acids and RNAP, an effect that would be required to drive translocation. Finally, NTPs can access the E site only through the secondary channel, which also serves as a binding site for various regulators. Some of these factors would be expected to hinder substrate entry. However, tagetitoxin (a phytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tagetis), whose binding site overlaps with the E site, does not compete with the NTP (Vassylyev et al., 2005Vassylyev D.G. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Igarashi N. Matsugaki N. Wakatsuki S. Artsimovitch I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; (Published online November 6, 2005)https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By contrast, NTPs can enter the preinsertion site through the main channel, bypassing the secondary channel. Certainly, many additional experiments are required to elucidate the exact role of the NTP binding sites that are detected by structural analysis and are inferred from kinetic studies (for a review, see Landick, 2005Landick R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30 (Published online October 21, 2005): 651-654https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2005.10.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, we may yet discover additional substrate sites. However, a mechanism in which the NTP is delivered to the catalytic center via the “classic” two-step pathway, which is observed in many other nucleic-acid enzymes, adequately explains the available data. In this model (Figure 1B), the substrate first binds to the preinsertion site and then moves to the insertion site. This movement is accompanied by the structural isomerization of RNAP from the “open” to the “closed” conformation in which translocation is likely to be blocked. The energy released during catalysis may be used to facilitate reverse isomerization into the open state, a prelude for the next nucleotide addition cycle. This putative isomerization may involve relatively large rearrangements of the RNAP domains, which in turn may alter the distance between certain elements in RNAP and DNA. At their current resolution, single-molecule experiments may be able to sense these conformational transitions, the amplitude of which is comparable to single-nucleotide steps, thereby complementing the structural analysis of static transcription complexes."

Merging basic and clinical research in a determined effort to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms of disease and thus to develop effective drugs with fewer side effects is the tough journey ahead that big pharma needs to pursue to ensure a brighter future. Despite continuing financial success, many big pharmaceutical companies are facing an uncertain future. Merging basic and clinical research in a determined effort to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms of disease and thus to develop effective drugs with fewer side effects is the tough journey ahead that big pharma needs to pursue to ensure a brighter future. The Divine Comedy begins with the middle-aged poet Dante wandering alone through a dark forest, having lost his way on the “true path.” Driven deeper by frightening creatures blocking his escape route, he spies a human form that reveals itself to be the ghostly embodiment of the great Roman poet Virgil. Virgil offers to serve as Dante's guide out of the dark forest to Heaven but warns him that to get there they must first pass through Hell and Purgatory. Trusting his guide, Dante sets forth. What follows is a pilgrimage unlike any other recounted in Western literature, and Dante finds himself fundamentally changed forever.Hence, if the present world doth go astray, In you the cause is, be it sought in you.–Dante Alighieri, La Divina Commedia, Purgatorio, Canto XVI Despite their ongoing financial successes, the big pharmaceutical companies have got to feel a bit like Dante at the beginning of a tough journey. Frightening creatures appear on an almost daily basis: A dwindling pipeline of potential new blockbuster drugs, endless news reports about excessive drug prices, competition from generics, stunning liability judgments, and demands for greater transparency in clinical trial data continue to push big pharma deeper into a dark forest of public approbation. The creatures are dangerous: within the last few weeks, Merck and Company announced plans to close five manufacturing plants, three research laboratories, and to lay off 11% of its work force (Berenson, 2005Berenson A. Revamping at Merck to Cut Costs.The New York Times. November 29, 2005; Google Scholar). There is little empathy to be found in this world, as a recent Kaiser Family Foundation Health Poll Survey lists pharma's public approval rating at an all time low, although still more favorable than that of big oil and tobacco companies (Kaiser Family Foundation Health Poll Report Survey, 2005Kaiser Family Foundation Health Poll Report Survey http://www.kff.org/healthpollreport/feb_2005/5.cfmDate: 2005Google Scholar). There is an abundance of literature examining what precipitated this dramatic fall into the darkness of distrust. But the current negative press is nothing compared to the problems that big pharma will encounter unless it addresses its current predicament. Pharma faces a trip through Hell and Purgatory before a better future is realized, but it must first find a trustworthy guide to get it there. There are many would-be Virgils vying for the attention and resources of big pharma, but only one resumé stands out. In the postgenomics era, the ability to unravel the mechanisms of disease in the context of the entire human organism through the marriage of basic and clinical research is within our grasp. Focused scientific research is the Virgil that offers the best hope for pharma to find its way into a new future. Many may argue that pharma isn't about scientific research per se but about the application of such research. Although that may have been true at a time when there was a limited possibility of fully understanding the molecular mechanisms of how drugs work, the current state of biomedical research renders this a false distinction. The recent lawsuits over the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx reveal the bankruptcy of our understanding of—and, in the public's perception, pharma's lack of interest in—mechanisms of disease in the context of the whole organism (Waxman, 2005Waxman H.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 2576-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Frazier, 2005Frazier K.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1420-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The “bench” and the “clinic” are no longer sustainable as disparate areas of study, although many practitioners of one or the other have yet to fully appreciate that or figure out how to merge the two enterprises. With the fully annotated human genome sequence available, an initial catalog of human genetic variation, amazing technological breakthroughs in whole genome studies, and growing insights from developmental biology, we have before us the ability to look deeply into human biology and elucidate complete mechanisms of disease. An increase in our understanding of disease mechanisms should lead to new therapeutic interventions, but only if these efforts are led by scientific research that is open, collaborative, focused, and determined. In the spirit of Dante's quest, I think it is worth considering a few of the obstacles that big pharma faces on the journey ahead. Although “Hell” conjures up traditional punishment images of cloven-hooved demons and flames, the primary theological definition of Hell is “loss.” This deeper meaning goes to some of big pharma's major fears about what may happen should it follow the scientific Virgil. Three closely related fears are immediately apparent. The first and most obvious of these is financial. Pharma is convinced that it is in the business of human health, yet it really serves two masters. Pharma's shareholders demand—and have traditionally received— high returns on their investments. They rapidly punish those companies, or at least their corporate leaders, that do anything to threaten those returns. We have seen recently that the patience of new investors has a short time frame, whereas scientific research by its very nature cannot guarantee any specific deadline. As a result of this tension between expectations and reality, pharma are struggling to keep the “pipeline” of new drugs filled—particularly the late pipeline containing drugs in late-phase clinical trials. But there are not enough new drugs under development to fill every late pipeline to the satisfaction of investors, and efforts to do so divert valuable resources and attention from the basic research that needs to be done to understand disease in its physiological environment and to discover potentially excellent new drugs with few side effects. A firm commitment to rigorous and necessary scientific research as the basis of future drug development may necessarily mean the loss of many current shareholders and the uncertainty regarding the arrival of more far-sighted investors. A second major concern for pharma is that scientific research demands a high degree of transparency. Does it really cost $800 million or more (DiMasi et al., 2003DiMasi J.A. Hansen R.W. Grabowski H.G. J. Health Econ. 2003; 22: 151-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar) to discover and develop a new drug, and what exactly does that cost include? What are the data—all the data—that support a specific avenue of inquiry? Pharma enjoys a fairly impenetrable curtain of protection about these and related questions, but to engage the scientific world will require that this curtain be torn away. Indications of the peril of doing so can be seen in the fulminant reaction to Marcia Angell's analysis of drug development cost and other issues in her book “The Truth about Drug Companies” (Angell, 2004Angell M. The Truth About the Drug Companies. Random House, New York2004Google Scholar). In her book, Angell cites studies by Public Citizen (Public Citizen, 2001Public Citizen Rx R&D Myths: The Case Against the Drug Industry's R&D Scare Card.http://www.citizen.org/documents/rdmyths.pdfDate: 2001Google Scholar) and the Alliance on Tuberculosis Drug Development (Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, 2001Global Alliance for TB Drug Development http://www.tballiance.org/3_2_C_BalancingIncentivesandAccess.aspDate: 2001Google Scholar), concluding that the costs of drug development are not as high as pharma has suggested. Regardless of whether or not the analyses in the book are correct, the tone of the counterattack indicates that the cost of drug development is not an area that could readily become transparent, at least any time soon (PHRMA, 2004PHRMA Response to M. Angell's Book.http://www.phrma.org/publications/policy//2004-09-15.1077.pdfDate: 2004Google Scholar). A third fear goes to the very organizational structure of most pharmaceutical companies. There is a growing public perception that the amount of money spent on marketing a particular drug is out of proportion to the actual worth of the therapy being marketed, whether because of “just as good” but cheaper competitors or because the drug is targeted at “diseases” that are relatively benign. In an age where “blockbuster drugs” (a purely financial designation) reign, sales and marketing departments of pharma companies tend to be both large and to play a leading role in the directions a pharma company pursues. That will not change without a significant internal battle for the very soul of the company and will undoubtedly result in the loss of some traditional pharmaceutical jobs and a realignment of internal power, most of it coming to rest in the hands of the scientists who discover and develop the drugs. Once pharma gets past the big casualties of the Inferno, there is still a need for a major realignment of what remains as pharma passes through the Purgatorio (the theological meaning of Purgatory being “Purification”). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease implies that “large markets” such as diabetes will be fractured into many smaller mechanism-based patient populations. Just as there is no one genetic mechanism underlying type 2 diabetes, there is no one drug for all patients with this illness. Not that there is an infinite number of smaller markets—evolution simply won't allow that much human variation—but there are more smaller markets than the single phenotype of many diseases would suggest. By its nature, this fragmentation of patient populations according to different mechanisms of disease will require a significant overhaul of regulatory approval procedures, “marketing,” patient and physician education, the role of academia, and even the fundamental pharma business model. As mechanistic understanding circumscribes patient numbers, it will become increasingly impossible to do large-scale clinical trials, because in many cases there will not be enough patients to fully enroll a traditional trial. On the positive side, understanding disease mechanisms should enable the use of smaller, better-focused clinical trials. But if pharma is unprepared to retool its drug development program, drug regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are even less well prepared. Much has been made of the partnership between industry and government in shortening approval times for drugs. It is time to bring that partnership to a new level that rethinks the approval process and redirects resources to make it happen. The sad lack of scientific understanding by the general public currently assists pharma in its very successful direct-to-consumer marketing through advertisements on television and in magazines. This method of marketing certainly has benefits, but as drugs and drug combinations become more mechanism-based, direct-to-consumer marketing makes little sense given the generally poor scientific understanding of the general public. Thus, a huge educational effort has to happen. And not just for the would-be consumers, but for the physicians who prescribe these drugs and need to understand clearly how they work. Physicians will soon be faced with a palette of therapeutic options that will require a clear understanding of the multiple molecular contributions to the disease of the patient in front of them. The huge resources devoted to the current marketing corps of pharma companies could be retooled into a true educational operation, but only with significant changes. These include rethinking the entire rewards system (with its unforgiving emphasis on making the numbers) with the goal of providing a real understanding of how these drugs work, who should receive them, and how to determine this. Pharma already claims for itself a leading partnership in healthcare delivery. This kind of effort would make that claim more solid, both in the public perception of the industry and in fact. Pharma is already hearing the footsteps of academia, which is rushing to fill the growing void in pharma's pipeline of drugs in the early stages of discovery and even in development. Pharma may be yielding some of this ground but would do better to become an active partner with academia. This means not just licensing discoveries made at universities and research institutes but actively participating in the research under academic “rules.” More than just “splitting tasks” based on respective traditional strengths, this strategy would allow academia and pharma to inform each other throughout the research and drug development process. Working together, academia and pharma will build “trust, mutual scientific respect, and concomitant scientific goals” (Chin-Dusting et al., 2005Chin-Dusting J. Mizrahi J. Jennings G. Fitzgerald D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). That said, academia has picked up a few bad habits from its industrial partners, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and competitiveness that actually impede progress in biomedical research (Krimsky, 2003Krimsky S. Science in the Private Interest. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., Lanham, MD2003Google Scholar). It is time for academia to reclaim the scientific habits that are its foundation and that will ultimately benefit its industrial partners on the path to the development of more effective drugs with fewer side effects. “Blockbuster drugs” can still be developed in an increasingly fragmented market, but they can't be the basis of a business model. Pharma companies can still be profitable—perhaps not to the degree they have enjoyed so far—but still sufficiently so. However, given that pricing and profits necessarily will be transparent in this new world, pharma will have to transform its business model in the glare of public attention if it is going to not only survive but also thrive. If pharma emerges from its tough journey, it will undoubtedly look very different than it does now. It is impossible to say just how it will look, largely because this journey will not take place in isolation. Societal issues such as healthcare costs, access to medicines, and even the ethics of prolonging life, as filtered through elected bodies such as the U.S. Congress, will undoubtedly be as much a determinant of pharma's future as any changes it makes within. Yet the form that these external influences take will be determined in large part by how proactive pharma is in undertaking tough adjustments to realize a better future."
