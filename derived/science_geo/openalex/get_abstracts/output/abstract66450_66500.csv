https://openalex.org/W2014637397,"Recognition of the pitch of a tone was severely disrupted by the incorporation of six other tones during a 5-second retention interval, even though the intervening tones could be ignored. However, the requirement to recall six numbers spoken at equal loudness during the identical retention interval produced only a minimum decrement in the same pitch-recognition task. Further, the requirement to remember the tone produced no decrement in recall of the numbers. It is concluded that immediate memory for pitch is subject to a large interference effect which is highly specific in nature and which is not due to some limitation in general short-term memory capacity or to a distraction of attention."

https://openalex.org/W2038671527,"A series of lists of random words was presented. Following each list, the subject attempted to recall the words of the list prior to the list just presented. Recall probability for a given word depended on the length of the list in which it was embedded, not on the length of the list intervening between presentation and test. These results indicate that forgetting is a failure in the memory search during retrieval rather than a degradation of the memory trace occurring between presentation and test."
https://openalex.org/W2006153859,"After fruits, roots, or the mycelium of certain plants were treated with 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)-triethylamine hydrochloride, lycopene was detected in the tissue. This is the first known success in causing lycopene to accumulate in a wide range of carotenogenic tissues that normally do not accumulate the pigment at some stage of development. The response should be of value in the study of carotenoid biosynthetic pathways and gene control mechanisms."

Since 1910 changes with time over the globe appear to be either zero or smaller than the uncertainty in the measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2011280701,"Chronic alcohol consumption impaired the learning of a two-way shuttle box avoidance task in mice 10 to 14 days after the discontinuation of ethanol in the diet. Control groups received laboratory chow ad libitum or were pair-fed with the alcohol-consuming mice by diets containing isocaloric amounts of sucrose. The performance of the two control groups was indistinguishable from each other, and only the ethanol-consuming mice performed poorly. It was therefore concluded that alcohol consumption per se and not a nutritional deficiency was responsible for the impairment of learning."

https://openalex.org/W2037816718,"Cultures of the (-) strain of Blakeslea trispora synthesize trisporic acid C, a sex hormone, from precursors made by cultures of the (+) strain. The precursors are nonacidic compounds isolated from the culture medium of the (+) strain by chloroform extraction. Actidione does not inhibit trisporic acid synthesis from isolated precursors, suggesting that the enzymes involved in the synthesis in cultures of the (-) strain are constitutive."

https://openalex.org/W2040436908,"THE upper Jurassic fossils Archaeopteryx lithographica and A. siemensii Dames offer the only direct evidence of the morphological transition between reptiles and birds. There is therefore a large literature about these fossils, which deBeer1 has summarized. Much attention has centred on the structure of the skull and its similarities and differences with those of reptiles and birds1â€“5. Unfortunately, the structure of the lower jaw has been entirely neglected, or casually dismissed, as reptilian rather than avian, principally because of the presence of thecodont teeth3. I have been able to study the morphological distinctions between the lower jaws of reptiles and birds, and the results have a direct bearing on the level of organization (morphological grade) of Archaeopteryx."
https://openalex.org/W2019238190,"WE have studied the effect of various antilymphocyte sera on lymphocytes, using the Stereoscan electron microscope1, and more recently we described the formation of long intercellular processes between macrophages and lymphocytes in certain conditions2. Process formation was particularly marked if macrophages from rats sensitized to tuberculin were incubated first with PPD and then with either normal lymph node cells or lymph node cells from rats sensitized to tuberculin (Fig. 1). In the former case, many macrophages were seen to be closely surrounded by clusters of lymphocytes."

Some features of the smog aerosol spectra are not present in the spectra from either type of synthetic aerosol."

https://openalex.org/W2034079360,"HARRIS et al.1, last year published their findings on the suppression of malignancy by cell fusion in systems involving three mouse malignant ascites tumours crossed with the A9 low malignant cell line, and this was followed by discussion between these authors and Dr Ephrussi and his associates2. In their answer, Professors Harris and Klein3 refer to some of our original publications4,5, in which the phenomenon of somatic cell hybridization was first described. Unfortunately, the interpretation of this work may have been ambiguous and we wish to clarify certain points which to us are important."
