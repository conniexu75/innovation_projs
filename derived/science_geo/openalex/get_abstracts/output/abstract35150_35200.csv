https://openalex.org/W2114738441,"p105-RB is the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene. It is a nuclear phosphoprotein hypothesized to act as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation, yet surprisingly it is present in actively dividing cells. To look for changes in p105-RB that may regulate its activity during the cell cycle, we generated synchronized cell populations and followed their progression through the cell cycle. p105-RB is synthesized throughout the cycle, but is phosphorylated in a phase-specific manner. In the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, an unphosphorylated species of the protein is the only detectable form, whereas in the S and G2/M phases, multiple phosphorylated species of p105-RB are detected."
https://openalex.org/W2152432521,"Introduction of an exogenous retinoblastoma (RB) gene in RB-deficient retinoblastoma or osteosarcoma cells has been shown to suppress their neoplastic phenotype. In experiments designed to explore the potential mechanism of RB tumor suppression, we report here that the phosphorylation state of RB protein is modulated during normal cellular events. In resting cells, RB protein is present in its least phosphorylated form; in rapidly proliferating cells, RB protein is highly phosphorylated. Maximal phosphorylation is associated with S phase of the cell cycle. Induction of differentiation in several human leukemia cell lines by treatment with phorbol ester or retinoic acid leads to dephosphorylation of RB. Time course studies indicate that RB dephosphorylation precedes the total arrest of cell growth during differentiation. These observations strongly suggest that the function of RB protein is modulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism during cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2008457983,"The unprocessed Gag precursor from HIV-1, when expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells, is targeted to the plasma membrane and assembles in 100-120 nm particles budding from the cell surface. This process mimics HIV immature particle formation and is dependent on myristoylation of the N-terminal glycine, as deletion of the latter results in particle accumulation in the cytoplasm and, interestingly, in the nucleus, pointing to a potential role of this non-fatty-acid-acylated species in the viral life cycle. Inclusion of the pol gene in the construct results in efficient processing of Pr55gag and a pronounced decrease in particle formation. Deletion of the C terminus (p16) of the Gag precursor, including the finger domains, abolishes particle assembly, but membrane targeting and evagination still occur. Heterologous expression in insect cells may prove very useful for the study of the molecular events leading to retroviral particle morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965164228,"The products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gag gene exist in a highly multimerized state in the mature virion. For that reason, they may represent a particularly suitable target for the generation of dominant negative mutants. A number of HIV site-directed Gag mutants did show interference with the production of infectious viral particles from cells in which they were cotransfected with a wild-type proviral DNA. Furthermore, cells constitutively expressing such HIV Gag mutants had an impaired ability to support HIV replication when infected with wild-type virus. The block was localized to the late stages of the virus life cycle. Such Gag variants could constitute prototypes for the development of anti-HIV intracellular immunization."
https://openalex.org/W1483746134,"The unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) requiring ole1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to produce a defective Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase. This enzyme catalyzes double bond formation between carbons 9 and 10 of palmitoyl and stearoyl coenzyme A. A DNA fragment isolated by complementation of an ole1 strain repairs the ufa requirement in mutant cells. Genetic analysis of the cloned DNA fragment indicates that it is allelic to the OLE1 gene. Disruption of a single copy of the wild type gene in a diploid strain produces both wild type and nonreverting ufa-requiring haploid progeny upon sporulation. Membrane lipids of the disrupted haploid strains contain only ufas supplied in the growth medium. The recovery of activity in both wild type and disrupted segregants was examined after removal of ufas from the growth medium. Following ufa deprivation disruptant cells grew normally for about three generations and then at a slower rate for at least 0.6 generations. During that time cellular ufas dropped from 63 to 7.3 mol % of the total fatty acids. No production of the 16:1 and 18:1 products of the desaturase was observed in disruptant cells, whereas desaturation in wild type control cells was evident 2 h after deprivation. These results indicate that 1) the OLE1 gene is essential for production of monounsaturated fatty acids and is probably the structural gene for the Δ-9 desaturase enzyme. 2) A large part of membrane ufas present under normal culture conditions are not essential for growth and cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2082319816,"Mutations in the S. cerevislae SPT15 gene were isolated as suppressors of insertion mutations that alter the transcription of adjacent genes. Molecular and genetic analysis of the cloned SPT15 gene has shown that it is the same as the gene that encodes the TATA binding factor TFIID. Analysis of spt15 mutants has demonstrated that alterations in TFIID can change transcription initiation in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that TFIID is essential for growth and that spt15 mutations are pleiotropic, as spt15 mutants grow slowly and have defects in both mating and sporulation. Therefore, TFIID is an essential transcription factor in vivo, likely to be required for normal expression of a large number of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1536742797,"Mutants deficient in the vacuolar (lysosomal) endopeptidases proteinase yscA and proteinase yscB of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit a drastically reduced protein degradation rate under nutritional stress conditions. The differentiation process of sporulation is considerably disturbed by the absence of the two endopeptidases. Also under vegetative growth conditions and under conditions of false protein synthesis, the two vacuolar endopeptidases exhibit some effect on protein degradation, which is, however, much less pronounced as found under starvation conditions. Proteinase yscA deficiency leads to rapid cell death when glucose-grown cells starve for nitrogen or other nutrients. Whereas overall protein degradation is affected in the endopeptidase mutants, degradation of two distinct false proteins analyzed is not altered in the absence of proteinase yscA and proteinase yscB. Also catabolite inactivation and degradation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is not affected to a greater extent in the endopeptidase-deficient strains."
https://openalex.org/W2008468260,"A microscopic method for simulating quantum mechanical, nuclear tunneling effects in biological electron transfer reactions is presented and applied to several electron transfer steps in photosynthetic bacterial reaction centers. In this ""dispersed polaron"" method the fluctuations of the protein and the electron carriers are projected as effective normal modes onto an appropriate reaction coordinate and used to evaluate the quantum mechanical rate constant. The simulations, based on the crystallographic structure of the reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, focus on electron transfer from a bacteriopheophytin to a quinone and the subsequent back-reaction. The rates of both of these reactions are almost independent of temperature or even increase with decreasing temperature. The simulations reproduce this unusual temperature dependence in a qualitative way, without the use of adjustable parameters for the protein's Franck-Condon factors. The observed dependence of the back-reaction on the free energy of the reaction also is reproduced, including the special behavior in the ""inverted region."""
https://openalex.org/W1596526854,"We recently reported that a ribosome binding site (RBS) derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 (g10-L) causes a pronounced stimulation of expression when placed upstream of a variety of genes, and that this effect is probably due to a stimulation of translation efficiency in Escherichia coli (Olins, P. O., Devine, C. S., Rangwala, S. H., Kavka, K. S. (1988) Gene (Amst.) 73, 227-235). Here we present a model for the mechanism of action of the g10-L: the RBS contains a 9-base sequence which has the potential for forming a novel base-paired interaction with bases 458-466 of the 16 S rRNA of E. coli. Although such sequence homologies are rare in E. coli RBS regions, a number of similar sequences were found in the RBS regions of other bacteriophage structural genes. When an isolated homology sequence was placed upstream of a synthetic RBS, there was a 110-fold increase in the translation efficiency of the lacZ gene. Surprisingly, the homology sequence also stimulated translation when placed downstream of the initiator codon, indicating that this sequence is acting as a translational enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1556270322,"Abstract Two types of reversible protein modification reactions have been identified in bacterial chemotaxis, methylation of membrane receptor-transducer proteins at glutamate side chains and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins at histidine and aspartate side chains. CheB is a bifunctional enzyme that is involved in both these modification processes. Its C-terminal domain is a methylesterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of gamma-carboxyl glutamyl methyl esters in the cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptor proteins. Its N-terminal domain is a phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospho-CheA, the central response regulator of bacterial chemotaxis. Phospho-CheB, produced as an intermediate in the phosphatase reaction, has dramatically increased methylesterase activity. The interplay between the methylesterase and phosphatase activities of CheB may provide a crucial link between adaptation and excitation in stimulus-response coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1550805286,"We examined several compounds for their mechanisms of inhibition with the nickel-containing active site of homogeneous Klebsiella aerogenes urease. Thiolate anions competitively inhibit urease and directly interact with the metallocenter, as shown by the pH dependence of inhibition and by UV-visible absorbance spectroscopic studies. Cysteamine, which possesses a cationic beta-amino group, exhibited a high affinity for urease (Ki = 5 microM), whereas thiolates containing anionic carboxyl groups were uniformly poor inhibitors. Phosphate monoanion competitively inhibits a protonated form of urease with a pKa of less than 5. Both the thiolate and phosphate inhibition results are consistent with charge repulsion by an anionic group in the urease active site. Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) was shown to be a slow-binding competitive inhibitor of urease. This compound forms an initial E.AHA complex which then undergoes a slow transformation to yield an E.AHA* complex; the overall dissociation constant of AHA is 2.6 microM. Phenylphosphorodiamidate, also shown to be a slow-binding competitive inhibitor, possesses an overall dissociation constant of 94 pM. The tight binding of phenylphosphorodiamidate was exploited to demonstrate the presence of two active sites per enzyme molecule. Urease contains 4 mol of nickel/mol enzyme, hence there are two nickel ions/catalytic unit. Each of the two slow-binding inhibitors are proposed to form complexes in which the inhibitor bridges the two active site nickel ions. The inhibition results obtained for K. aerogenes urease are compared with inhibition studies of other ureases and are interpreted in terms of a model for catalysis proposed for the jack bean enzyme (Dixon, N.E., Riddles, P.W., Gazzola, C., Blakely, R.L., and Zerner, B. (1980) Can. J. Biochem. 58, 1335-1344)."
https://openalex.org/W1985859776,"Yeast mutants deficient in the clathrin heavy chain secrete a precursor form of the alpha-factor, a peptide-mating pheromone. Analysis of this defect indicates that the endoprotease Kex2p, which is responsible for initiating proteolytic maturation of the alpha-factor precursor in the Golgi apparatus, is unexpectedly present at the plasma membrane in mutant cells. This result suggest that clathrin is required for the retention of Kex2p in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1603365990,"Pullulanase secretion in Escherichia coli depends on the expression of a MalT-regulated operon called pulC. Characterization of the first two genes of this operon showed that they encode, respectively, a 31,000-Da protein (PulC) and a 70,600-Da protein (PulD) which has a putative signal peptide and that these two proteins are required for pullulanase secretion. The analysis of alkaline phosphatase hybrid proteins generated by TnphoA mutagenesis of pulC and pulD showed that both PulC and PulD contain export signals which can direct the alkaline phosphatase segment of the hybrids across the inner membrane. A representative PulC-PhoA hybrid protein fractionated mainly with the inner membrane upon isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation of membrane vesicles. This, together with sequencing data, suggests that PulC is an inner membrane protein. Antibodies raised against a purified PulD-PhoA hybrid protein were used to show that PulD was enriched in low density outer membrane vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2137421512,"The TrkA protein, which is essential for the activity of the constitutive Trk K+-uptake system of Escherichia coli, is a peripheral membrane protein. The protein was detected in immunoblots by polyclonal antibodies to sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured TrkA protein. In extracts from wild-type cells equal amounts of TrkA were found in the membrane and soluble fractions, suggesting that membrane binding is relatively weak. When the protein was moderately overproduced it appeared mainly in the soluble fraction; stronger overproduction led to the formation of aggregates that could not be solubilized by nonionic detergents. Mutations in the three other genes implicated in Trk activity, trkE, trkG, and trkH, reduced or abolished the binding of TrkA to the membrane. These results support the model, previously based solely on genetic data, that Trk is a multisubunit complex and implicates the products of the other trk genes in the normal binding of TrkA to the complex in the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1600220960,"We examined the effect of prostaglandin (PG) E2 on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and insulin-stimulated collagen formation in lung fibroblast cultures. TGF-beta increased type I collagen production 2-3-fold as determined by the densitometric analysis of autoradiograms from polyacrylamide gels and by measuring the amount of nondialyzable hydroxyproline. This was associated with a 5-6-fold increase in alpha 1(I) mRNA levels. PGE2 at 10(-7) M strongly inhibited type I collagen formation in TGF-beta-stimulated cultures by 60-70%. PGE2 blocked collagen formation in TGF-beta-stimulated cultures by decreasing levels of alpha 1(I) gene expression. PGE2 inhibited alpha 1(I) gene expression in part through inhibition of transcription. In contrast, insulin increased type I collagen production 2-fold and was associated with a 30-40% increase in alpha 1(I) mRNA. Although PGE2 also decreased alpha 1(I) mRNA levels in insulin-treated cultures, PGE2 had no effect on collagen formation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that collagen formation may proceed through two distinct pathways. These two pathways are distinguishable by their sensitivity to PGE2 treatment and their relationship to increases in collagen mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1517798915,"A family of four glutamine amidotransferases has a homologous glutamine amide transfer domain, designated purF-type, that is named after purF-encoded glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase. The glutamine amide transfer domain of approximately 194 amino acid residues is at the NH2 terminus of the protein chain. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace several of the 9 invariant amino acids in the glutamine amide transfer domain of glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase. The results indicate that a Cys1-His101-Asp29 catalytic triad is involved in the glutamine amide transfer function of this enzyme. The evidence suggests that His101 functions to increase the nucleophilicity of Cys1, which is used to form a glutamine-enzyme covalent intermediate. Asp29 has a role subsequent to formation of the covalent intermediate. The Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad is implicated in the glutamine amide transfer function of purF-type amidotransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1519968567,"Abstract It is shown that Serratia marcescens exports a hemolysin to the cell surface and secretes it to the extracellular space. Escherichia coli containing the cloned hemolysin genes shlA and shlB exported and secreted the S. marcescens hemolysin. A nonhemolytic secretion-incompetent precursor of the hemolysin, designated ShlA*, was synthesized in a shlB deletion mutant and accumulated in the periplasmic space of E. coli. Immunogold-labeled ultrathin sections revealed ShlA* bound to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane and to the inner face of the outer membrane. A number of mutants carrying 3' deletions in the shlA gene secreted truncated polypeptides, the smallest of which contained only 261 of the 1578 amino acids of the mature ShlA hemolysin, showing that the information for export to the cell surface of E. coli and secretion into the culture medium is located in the NH2-terminal segment of the hemolysin. We propose a secretion pathway in which ShlA and ShlB are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane via a signal sequence-dependent mechanism. ShlB is integrated into the outer membrane. ShlA is translocated across the outer membrane with the help of ShlB. During the latter export process or at the cell surface, ShlA acquires the hemolytically active conformation and is released to the extracellular space. The hemolysin secretion pathway appears to be different from any other secretion system hitherto reported and involves only a single specific export protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605434051,"The role of the signal sequence in the secretion of proteins remain unclear despite extensive research. We have examined properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to a family of signal sequences derived from the lamB gene of Escherichia coli, including five examples of known phenotype that contain mutations in the signal sequence. By circular dichroism spectroscopy, the wild type and export-component mutant signal peptides show a high alpha-helix content in membrane mimetic environments (sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and phospholipid vesicles). Tendency to adopt helical conformations is clearly not sufficient to define a functional signal sequence, however, as some nonfunctional mutant signal peptides also contain a relatively high proportion of alpha-helix. The affinity of these peptides for phospholipid monolayers as assessed by surface tensiometry reveals further distinguishing properties. Export-competent peptides show an increased affinity for and greater perturbation of phospholipid monolayers and bilayers than to export-defective peptides. These results suggest a lipid binding role for the signal sequence during protein export in addition to its recognition by proteins of the export pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1568681949,"Cytovillin is a microvillar cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein, with prominent expression in vivo in placental syncytiotrophoblasts and certain human tumors. Cytovillin cDNA was cloned from a human placental lambda gt11 library using affinity purified antibodies. The identity of cytovillin cDNA clones was confirmed by expression of cytovillin in Escherichia coli and using antibodies raised against the expressed fusion protein in comparison with antibodies against cytovillin purified from cultured human choriocarcinoma cells. In these cells Northern blotting analysis identified a major 3.5-kilobase cytovillin mRNA. The cDNA encodes a protein of 575 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of 68,084. According to secondary structure prediction, cytovillin is a hydrophilic protein with an extensive internal alpha-helical region ending in a sequence of 7 consecutive prolines. The predicted alpha-helical region showed limited homology to alpha-helical regions of cytoskeletal proteins and certain other proteins, but no extensive homologies were found in the cytovillin cDNA or the deduced amino acid sequence to other registered DNA or protein sequences. Southern blot analysis of a DNA panel of human mouse somatic cell hybrids localized the cytovillin gene to the end of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q22-q27). Our results show that cytovillin is representative of a novel class of microvillar proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1497570272,"The role of guanine nucleotides in catecholamine secretion was investigated in α-toxin-permeabilized chromaffin cells. The stable GTP analogues, GTP-γ-S (guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate) and GMP-PNP (guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate), potentiated calcium-evoked catecholamine release in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by GDP-β-S (guanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate) indicating that a GTP-binding protein plays a modulatory role in the calcium-dependent secretory process in chromaffin cells. Calcium and the phosphorylating nucleotide ATP were both necessary for secretion, even in the presence of GTP analogues, suggesting that the activation of a GTP-regulatory protein alone does not trigger exocytosis in these cells. TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), a direct activator of protein kinase C, was found to mimic the effects of the GTP analogues, inducing a dose-dependent potentiation of the calcium-evoked release in α-toxin-permeabilized cells. Treatment of the permeabilized cells with sphingosine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, completely abolished the stimulatory effects of both TPA and GTP-γ-S. Moreover, long term incubation of chromaffin cells with TPA, a treatment which depletes cells of protein kinase C activity, suppressed the stimulatory effects of GTP-γ-S. Protein kinase C is activated when it becomes membrane-bound in the presence of calcium and diacylglycerol; here, GTP-γ-S was found to enhance the calcium-induced translocation of protein kinase C to membranes in α-toxin-permeabilized cells. These results suggest that guanine nucleotides modulate secretion by activating protein kinase C-linked events in chromaffin cells. Furthermore, the potentiation of calcium-induced secretion in α-toxin-permeabilized cells following activation of protein kinase C either directly with TPA or indirectly with GTP analogues provides additional support for the concept that protein kinase C may exert a positive control directly on the intracellular exocytotic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1566001427,"The rate of energy-dependent transfer of pro-OmpA across Escherichia coli inner membrane vesicles in vitro was found to be a function of the ATP concentration. At concentrations above 0.1 mM ATP, the addition of a transmembrane electrochemical potential (proton motive force or pmf) increased the rate of pro-OmpA translocation. Additional experiments demonstrated that the overall reaction proceeded by at least two distinct energy-requiring steps. The first step required only ATP, was nearly unaffected by the pmf, and resulted in the insertion of the amino-terminal domain of pro-OmpA across the membrane. The insertion exposed the signal sequence cleavage site to the periplasmic side of the membrane, as measured by the appearance of a mature length translocation intermediate. However, this intermediate was partially exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In a second energy-dependent step, either ATP or the pmf was sufficient to complete the translocation of mature length OmpA across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1541052928,"Abstract The cDNA for rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase has been cloned, and the nucleic acid sequence has been determined. By comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence for S-adenosylhomocysteinase with that of the dinucleotide binding region for other proteins, the sequence from amino acids 213 to 244 in rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase was proposed to be part of the NAD binding site (Ogawa, H., Gomi, T., Mueckler, M. M., Fujioka, M., Backlund, P. S., Jr., Aksamit, R. R., Unson, C. G., and Cantoni, G. L. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 719-723). A vector has been constructed that expresses S-adenosylhomocysteinase in Escherichia coli in the presence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside by inserting the coding sequence of rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase cDNA downstream from the lac promoter of plasmid pUC118. The enzyme that is produced comprises as much as 10% of the soluble cellular proteins. The purified enzyme is a tetramer, contains 4 mol of tightly bound NAD, and has kinetic properties indistinguishable from those of the liver enzyme. Tryptic peptide mapping and NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicate that the recombinant enzyme is structurally identical to the liver enzyme except for the absence of the NH2-terminal blocking group. The rat liver enzyme has a blocked NH2-terminal alanine residue (Ogawa, H., Gomi, T., Mueckler, M. M., Fujioka, M., Backlund, P. S., Jr., Aksamit, R. R., Unson, C. G., and Cantoni, G. L. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 719-723). By oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis mutant vectors have been generated that express proteins in which each of the glycines in the Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly sequence of the putative NAD binding site (residues 219-224) was changed to valine. Immunoblot analysis of extracts of the cells transformed with these vectors reveals the presence of immunoreactive proteins with the subunit molecular weight of S-adenosylhomocysteinase. The mutant proteins have no catalytic activity, contain no bound NAD, and do not form the same quaternary structure as the recombinant S-adenosylhomocysteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1518346105,"Abstract Pro-ocytocin/neurophysin convertase is a divalent cation-dependent endoprotease isolated from both bovine corpus luteum and neurohypophyseal secretory granules. The putative pro-ocytocin/neurophysin converting enzyme cleaves the Arg12-Ala13 bonds of both pro-ocytocin/neurophysin (1----20) and pro-ocytocin/neurophysin obtained by hemisynthesis. The minimal efficient substrate structure allowing recognition by this processing endoprotease was defined by measuring its cleavage efficiency and the inhibitory properties of a set of 34 selectively modified derivatives of the (1----20) NH2-terminal domain of the ocytocin/neurophysin precursor. The data demonstrate that: (i) the basic Lys11-Arg12 doublet, although necessary, is not sufficient; (ii) a minimal substrate length of nine amino acids (residues 7-15 or 8-16) is essential; (iii) those amino acids around the Lys-Arg doublet which contribute to the formation of a possible beta-turn-alpha-helix secondary structure are critical; (iv) substrate recognition by the enzyme may involve several subsites in which structural determinants, situated on both sides of the basic doublet, participate; (v) the NH2-terminal sequence of neurophysin plays a critical role in the correct reading of the cleavage sequence by the processing endoprotease. It is proposed, first, that this type of structural feature may constitute the basis of a general coding system for endoproteases involved in the processing of polypeptide hormone precursors; second, that in addition to its role in the intragranular packaging of the nonapeptide hormone, neurophysin plays a key role in the correct processing of its common precursor with ocytocin."
https://openalex.org/W1484385092,"Abstract Sequence-specific pausing occurs during DNA synthesis catalyzed by the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme in the presence of the T4 helix destabilizing protein (gene 32 protein). Two of the six strongest pause sites on a double-stranded bacteriophage fd DNA template are in regions where hairpin helices are predicted to form when the DNA is single stranded. However, the other pause sites are in regions that are not obviously involved in secondary structure. The positions of the DNA chain ends produced at one pause site of each type were determined to within +/- 2 nucleotides. At this resolution, a clustering of sites is observed, suggesting that the polymerase holoenzyme may become destabilized when moving along selected regions of the DNA and then pause at one or more of several closely spaced positions. The addition of the T4 gene 41 protein (a DNA helicase that forms part of the T4 primosome) to the above replication system greatly increases the rate of fork movement and eliminates detectable pausing. In contrast, the addition of the T4 dda protein (a second DNA helicase that increases the rate of fork movement to a similar extent) has no affect on replication fork pausing. This difference could either be due to specific protein-protein interactions formed between the polymerase holoenzyme and the 41 protein or to the highly processive movement of the 41 protein along the displaced DNA strand."
https://openalex.org/W1573116518,"Abstract Normal development of the chicken embryo requires insulin and insulin receptors. Insulin and also insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can stimulate embryonic growth when applied in vivo at the beginning of organogenesis (Girbau, M., Gomez, J. A., Lesniak, M. A., and De Pablo, F. (1987) Endocrinology 121, 1477-1482). In the present work we chose the developing eye lens, an avascular organ composed of a single cell type, to characterize further the specific effects of insulin and IGF-I upon cell differentiation and gene expression. Epithelial cells (before terminal differentiation) and fiber cells (terminally differentiated) were cultured in the presence of the hormones. delta-Crystallin mRNA steady-state levels as well as nuclear delta-crystallin gene transcription were measured. Either insulin or IGF-I (0.1-10 ng/ml) increased (2-4-fold) delta-crystallin mRNA in epithelial and fiber lens cells from day 6 embryos. The effect of insulin was largely blocked by the Fab fragment of anti-insulin receptor antibody (B-10). By contrast, as it had been shown for metabolic actions in other systems, bivalent B-10 IgG itself mimicked insulin action, i.e. it induced an increase on delta-crystallin mRNA levels. Thus, insulin appears to act through its own receptor in regulating the levels of delta-crystallin mRNA. There was a differential transcriptional component in insulin and IGF-I effects on delta-crystallin gene expression. IGF-I induction of transcription, as measured by nuclear run-on assay, is greater than insulin induction (approximately 2.5-fold versus 1.4-fold) and faster. The delta-crystallin gene will provide the opportunity to analyze the action of insulin and IGF-I on the expression of a structural protein marker of cell differentiation during early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1587480418,"We found an endogenous growth factor, referred to here as heart-derived growth factor (HDGF), that stimulates the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. HDGF was purified from bovine myocardium using a procedure that involves denaturation of undesired proteins with methanol and chloroform. Soluble HDGF was purified essentially to homogeneity in a single step by heparin affinity chromatography. The purified HDGF was identified to be acidic fibroblast growth factor based on the following properties: molecular weight of 18,000, isoelectric point of 5.2, amino acid composition and sequence, its dissociation from a heparin affinity column at 0.9 M NaCl, potentiation of activity in the presence of heparin, and antigenicity. Our yield of HDGF was 500 µg/kg of tissue. Antiserum raised to HDGF localized HDGF in the cardiac myocytes in culture. These data indicate that a large amount of acidic fibroblast growth factor is present in the heart, and the cardiac myocytes are likely to be a major source of it."
https://openalex.org/W1523163243,"Abstract The methyl-accepting chemotactic transducers of Escherichia coli were found to bind strongly to Cibacron blue-Sepharose. Among potential elutants tested, only S-adenosylmethionine at moderate concentrations and NaCl at concentrations greater than 1.5 M caused dissociation of these detergent-solubilized transmembrane proteins from the dye. Release by S-adenosylmethionine may be a generalized effect rather than the result of a specific binding site for that compound on transducers. A truncated trg gene was created that coded for the carboxyl-terminal three-fifths of the transducer, which constitutes the cytoplasmic domain common to all four transducers in E. coli. This domain bound to Cibacron blue-Sepharose and was eluted in a pattern similar to that exhibited by intact Trg, indicating that interaction with the dye occurred in this conserved domain. Adherence to Cibacron blue and elution by high salt formed the core of an efficient purification scheme, developed for Trg but applicable to all transducers in E. coli and perhaps to methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in other species. Determination of the amino acid sequence at the beginning of purified Trg confirmed that it contained a longer hydrophilic segment at its amino terminus than other transducers of E. coli. The initial methionine of Trg is neither cleaved nor modified, in contrast to the Tar transducer in which the amino terminus was found previously to be blocked. Circular dichroic measurements of purified Trg indicated that the secondary structural organization of the protein is predominantly alpha-helix."
https://openalex.org/W1583807986,"In quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, the B subunit of cholera toxin, a protein which binds specifically to ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface, stimulates DNA synthesis and potentiates the effects of several other growth factors such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, bombesin, and even unfractionated serum. In contrast to its synergistic effect with other known growth factors, the B subunit markedly inhibited DNA synthesis induced by the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The inhibitory effect of the B subunit was observed even in the presence of insulin, which greatly potentiates the mitogenic response to TPA or the B subunit. In contrast to the effect of the B subunit, calcium ionophores and cholera toxin stimulated DNA synthesis induced by TPA. The antagonism between the B subunit and TPA is not simply due to their abilities to modify their mutual binding sites or known effector systems. TPA did not block the early rise in cytosolic free calcium in response to the B subunit, and conversely, the B subunit did not modify the ability of TPA to activate protein kinase C. However, in protein kinase C-deficient cells, the antagonistic effect between TPA and the B subunit was abolished. In addition, there was no indication for the involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in the antagonism. Maximum inhibition was found when the B subunit was added 2 h after the addition of TPA. Significant inhibition was still evident when the time of addition of the B subunit was delayed until 6 h after the addition of TPA. This suggests that the cross-talk between signal transduction induced through endogenous gangliosides and protein kinase C is a late step in mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1494605472,"Abstract The sugar specificity properties of the lactose permease were investigated. Free galactose was shown to competitively inhibit the lactose permease yielding a Ki value of 7.4 mM. This value was severalfold higher than the observed Km for lactose (1.3 mM). A variety of other monosaccharides also showed significant inhibition of lactose transport. With regard to -OH groups along the galactose ring it appears that the relative importance is OH-3 greater than OH-4 greater than OH-6 greater than OH-2 greater than OH-1. In general, galactosides with alpha-linkages exhibited significantly higher affinities compared with their beta-linked counterparts. An optimal size for the aglycone portion of the galactoside was reached with aglycones containing hexose residues or a benzene ring. The preferred size of the aglycone appears to be hexose, benzene ring greater than methyl group greater than no aglycone much greater than disaccharide greater than trisaccharide. However, neither the specific structure of the aglycone nor its relative hydrophobicity appeared to be important factors in permease recognition. For example, the hydrophobic beta-nitrophenyl-galactosides had lower affinities compared with lactose (a beta-galactoside), whereas the alpha-nitrophenylgalactosides generally had higher affinities compared with melibiose (an alpha-galactoside). In addition, no consistent preference was seen when considering the location of the nitro group on the benzene ring. From this work, a model is presented which depicts the binding of galactosides to the lactose permease."
https://openalex.org/W1553658403,"Abstract We have shown previously that during in vitro import into chloroplasts, the precursor of the major light-harvesting chlorphyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) generated from a wheat gene gives rise to two mature forms (25 and approximately 26 kDa) which are inserted into the thylakoids. However, during incubation of the LHCP precursor with a chloroplast-soluble extract in an organelle-free processing reaction, the NH2 terminus is cleaved, yielding only a 25-kDa peptide. In the present study, mutations at the transit peptide-mature protein junction were introduced in the LHCP precursor to investigate the relationship between the two peptides and the determinants of proteolytic processing. Mutant p delta 3 lacks 3 amino acids including Met34 at the primary cleavage site thought to give rise to the 26-kDa peptide. It is still processed during import and in the organelle-free reaction yielding in both assays only a 25-kDa peptide. Mutant p + 4 has 4 amino acids inserted immediately after Met34 and a proline that disrupts the alpha-helix predicted by the Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method (Garnier, J., Osguthorpe, D. J., and Robson, B. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 120, 97-120) to extend through this region. Although p + 4 is imported, it is inefficiently processed; both a 25- and 26-kDa peptide are found, but at least 60% of the imported precursor remains uncleaved. Less than 5% is processed in the organelle-free assay. Replacement of the predicted alpha-helix in the mutant p + 4 alpha restores processing upon import into the chloroplast, but this mutant, which also has a 4-amino acid insert, yields only a 26-kDa peptide. p + 4 alpha is not processed in the organelle-free reaction. These results provide evidence that the two forms of LHCP obtained during import are the result of independent processing at two cleavage sites: the first site at Met34, and a second approximately 10 amino acids downstream within what has been designated the NH2 terminus of the mature protein. Whereas p delta 3 has the first site removed but retains a functional second site, in p + 4 alpha only the first site, or one very near it, is accessible to the processing enzyme during import. The conditions of the organelle-free reaction are specific for processing at only the secondary site. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the heterogeneity of LHCP in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1586593308,"In the current study, lactose permease mutants were isolated which exhibited an enhanced recognition for maltose (an alpha-glucoside) but a diminished recognition for thiodigalactoside, TDG (a beta-galactoside). Maltose/TDGR mutants were obtained from four different parental strains encoding either a wild-type permease (pTE18), a mutant lactose permease which recognizes maltose (pB15) or mutant lactose permeases which recognize maltose but are resistant to inhibition by cellobiose (pTG and pBA). A total of 27 independent mutants were isolated: 12 from pTE18, 10 from pB15, 3 from pTG, and 2 from pBA. DNA sequencing of the 27 mutants revealed that the mutants contain single base pair substitutions within the lac Y gene which result in single amino acid substitutions within the lactose permease. All of the mutants obtained from pTE18, pTG, and pBA involved a change of Tyr-236 to histidine, phenylalanine, or asparagine. From pB15, three different types of mutants were obtained: Tyr-236 to histidine, Ile-303 to phenylalanine, or His-322 to asparagine. When assayed for [14C]maltose transport, the maltose/TDGR mutants were seen to transport maltose significantly faster than the wild type. Furthermore, although TDG was shown to inhibit the uptake of maltose in the four parental strains, all of the mutant strains exhibited a dramatic resistance to TDG inhibition. Most of the maltose/TDGR mutants were also shown to be very defective in the transport of lactose. However, certain mutants (i.e., Asn-322) exhibited moderate lactose transport activity. Finally, it was observed that all of the mutant strains were unable to facilitate the uphill accumulation of beta-methylthiogalactopyranoside. The locations of the amino acid substitutions are discussed with regard to their possible role in sugar recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1606265547,"Abstract A 40-kDa fragment of chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase was produced and partially purified from a bacterial expression system. This fragment exhibits calmodulin binding and substrate phosphorylation properties similar to those of the isolated chicken gizzard enzyme. A series of 3'-deletion mutants was prepared and used to produce proteins with the same NH2 terminus but with COOH termini varying over 180 amino acids. Results show that truncation of the enzyme at Ser-512 (based on the amino acid numbering system described for the partial cDNA clone by Guerriero, V., Jr., Russo, M. A., Olson, N. J., Putkey, J. A., and Means, A. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 8372-8381) does not alter calmodulin binding, calmodulin regulation, or enzymatic properties. Removal of an additional 5 residues from the COOH terminus completely inhibits calmodulin binding and results in an inactive kinase that can be fully activated by limited proteolysis. Site specific mutations within these 5 residues demonstrate that Gly-508 and Arg-509 are independently involved in calmodulin-dependent binding and activation of myosin light chain kinase. Truncation of the enzyme at residues within the protein kinase catalytic domain results in inactive protein that cannot be activated by proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1581545637,"Rat cellular retinol-binding protein II (CRBP II) is a 15.6-kDa intestinal protein which binds all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal but not all-frons-retinoic acid. We have previously analyzed the interaction of Escherichia coli-derived rat apoCRBP II with several retinoids using fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. Interpretation of these experiments is complicated, because the protein has 4 tryptophan residues. To further investigate ligand-protein interactions, we have utilized 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of CRBP II labeled at its 4 tryptophan residues with 6-fluorotryptophan. Efficient incorporation of 6-fluorotryptophan (93%) was achieved by growing a tryptophan auxotroph of E. coli harboring a prokaryotic expression vector with a full-length rat CRBP II cDNA on defined medium supplemented with the analog. Comparison of the 19F NMR spectra of 6-fluorotryptophan-substituted CRBP II with and without bound all-frans-retinol revealed that resonances corresponding to 2 tryptophan residues (designated WA and WB) undergo large downfield changes in chemical shifts (2.0 and 0.5 ppm, respectively) associated with ligand binding. In contrast, 19F resonances corresponding to two other tryptophan residues (WC and WD) undergo only minor perturbations in chemical shifts. The 19F NMR spectra of 6-fluorotryptophan-substi-tuted CRBP II complexed with all-trans-retina/ and all-trans-retinol were very similar, suggesting that the interactions of these two ligands with the protein are similar. Molecular model building, based on the crystalline structures of two homologous proteins was used to predict the positions of the 4 tryptophan residues of CRBP II and to make tentative resonance assignments. The fact that ligand binding produced residue-specific changes in the chemical shifts of resonances in CRBP II suggests that NMR analysis of isotopically labeled retinoid-binding proteins expressed in E. coli will provide an alternate, albeit it complementary, approach to fluorescence spectroscopy for examining the structural consequences of their association with ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1489157217,"Abstract A synthetic peptide analog of the precursor region of preproparathyroid hormone has been shown to be a specific substrate for hen oviduct signal peptidase. The sequence of the 31-residue peptide is Ser-Ala-Lys-Asp-norleucine (Nle)-Val-Lys-Val-Nle-Ile-Val-Nle-Leu-Ala-Ile-Ala-Phe-Leu-Ala-Arg-Ser-As p-Gly-Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-D-Tyr-amide (Caulfield, M. P., Duong, L. T., O'Brien, R., Majzoub, J. A., and Rosenblatt, M. (1988) Mol. Endocrinol. 2, 452-458). This sulfur-free signal peptide analog can be labeled with 125I on the C-terminal D-tyrosine and is cleaved by purified hen oviduct signal peptidase between Gly and Lys, the correct site of cleavage of preproparathyroid hormone in vivo. Amino acid sequence analysis of the cleavage product released 125I at the seventh cycle of Edman degradation, confirming that enzymatic cleavage occurs at the physiological site. Synthetic peptide analogs of the substrate with Lys, Pro, or Asp substituted for Nle-18 were poor substrates for the enzyme and were also poor competitive inhibitors of catalysis, suggesting that modifications at position -18, 12 amino acids from the site of cleavage, directly influence binding by the enzyme. Analysis of the reactivity of signal peptidase with these synthetic peptides provides insight into the cleavage specificity requirements of this eukaryotic signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W2141159656,"Abstract We have isolated and characterized a novel, large, multicatalytic protease from mammalian cells. This protease was designated PABI (protease accumulated by inhibitors). When baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in medium containing leupeptin, a potent serine-cysteine protease inhibitor, the trypsin-like protease activity (PABI) in the cells increased its level more than 100-fold over the control. This increase was also observed in other cultured cells such as COS, HepG2, and skin fibroblast cells. The activity was also elevated by treatment with other protease inhibitors including chymostatin or trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)butane. Immunoblot analysis, by employing antisera prepared against the purified PABI, also showed a concomitant increase of this protein in BHK, COS, and HepG2 cells on leupeptin treatment. PABI was purified to a homogeneous state from leupeptin-treated BHK cells. PABI is a glycoprotein of molecular weight 700,000. PABI was found to be a multimer of a major subunit of apparent Mr of 84,000, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopic analysis. PABI dissociates into subunits only under reducing conditions in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PABI has both trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like protease activities toward synthetic substrates. Both activities were inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor, and chymostatin. Leupeptin inhibited only the trypsin-like activity of PABI. p-Chloromercuribenzoate had no effect on either activity. Furthermore, PABI degraded collagen type I and fibronectin. These results indicate that PABI is a novel protease which differs from any known proteases including cytosolic high molecular weight proteases. The physiological function of PABI is yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1499453995,"Abstract Single crystals of recombinant Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase suitable for x-ray analysis have been grown from polyethylene glycol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The space group has been determined as P3(1) or P3(2), with one protein trimer of three identical 36.8-kDa subunits in the asymmetric unit. The unit cell dimensions are a = b = 105.1 A and c = 87.8 A. The crystals diffract well to 3-A resolution and are quite resistant to radiation damage. Single crystals have also been grown of a genetically engineered site-specific mutant for which the replacement of an arginine (Arg-57) to a glycine has been shown to not only drastically affect the enzyme activity but also its kinetic mechanism (Kuo, L. C., Miller, A. W., Lee, S., and Kozuma, C. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8823-8832). The crystals of the Arg-57----Gly mutant protein are isomorphous to those of the wild type. Crystal soaking experiments using both wild-type and Arg-57----Gly crystals in the presence of various ligands have provided evidence of specific conformational changes upon substrate binding which supports our previous kinetic and spectroscopic observations."

https://openalex.org/W1503994537,"Abstract Eukaryotic tRNA expression initiates with transcription by RNA polymerase III and requires two additional protein factors and two regions within the tRNA gene (the 5'-internal control region (ICR) or A-box and the 3'-ICR or B-box). Using a reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III system, the transcription of various 5'-ICR, 3'-ICR, and double mutation alleles of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sup3-e dimeric tRNA gene were studied. The sup3-e tRNA locus consists of an upstream serine tRNA gene and a downstream initiator methionine tRNA gene which are transcribed as a dimeric precursor and processed to give two tRNAs. Only the ICRs of the tRNA(Ser) gene are active in directing dimeric gene transcription. Mutations in the 3'-ICR of the tRNA(Ser) gene reduce transcription of the dimer more than those in the 5'-ICR. Mutations in the 5'-ICR were found which greatly increased or decreased transcription of the dimer, while base changes in the 3'-ICR were only found to decrease transcription. This suggests a modulatory role for the 5'-ICR in transcription regulation. Mutation of the methionine tRNA gene ICR has little effect on sup3-e transcription, and no detectable transcripts initiate from the methionine tRNA gene when the tRNA(Ser) gene promoter is inactivated by mutation. Comparison with transcription studies of other mutant tRNA genes suggests that nucleotides sites within the ICRs, such as nucleotides 8, 10, 13, 18, and 19 in the 5'-ICR and 48, 53, 56, 57, and 58 in the 3'-ICR, appear to have evolved universal importance for RNA polymerase III transcription in eukaryotes. Thus these ICR sequences may play a critical role in regulation of tRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1491264880,"Phage T7 DNA polymerase contains Escherichia coli thioredoxin as a subunit and is a 1:1 complex with T7 gene 5 protein. The enzyme showed high thioredoxin activity in assays at 37 degrees C using reduction of insulin disulfides with NADPH and thioredoxin reductase, leading Randahl (Randahl, H. (1982) FEBS Lett. 150, 109-113) to propose that the thioredoxin dithiol active site is exposed in T7 DNA polymerase. However, T7 DNA polymerase and free thioredoxin differ in reactivity with iodoacetic acid after preincubation with dithiothreitol or incubation with insulin. Insulin reduction assays work at low temperatures even at 0 degrees C. The time and temperature dependence of the thioredoxin activity of T7 DNA polymerase demonstrated that dissociation into subunits at 25 or 37 degrees C accounts for the previously observed activity. Thus, T7 DNA polymerase contains the reduced form of thioredoxin with its active site SH groups masked by the subunit contact with the gene 5 protein in agreement with the results of Adler and Modrich (Adler, S., and Modrich, P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6956-6962). The subunit interaction of thioredoxin and gene 5 protein is salt-insensitive, but markedly temperature-dependent consistent with involvement of a hydrophobic surface area in reduced thioredoxin."

https://openalex.org/W1574937631,"We constructed, by site-directed mutagenesis, a mutant pullulanase gene in which the cysteine residue in a pentapeptide sequence, Leu16-Leu-Ser-Gly-Cys20 within the NH2-terminal region of pullulanase from Klebsiella aerogenes, is replaced by serine (Ser20). The modification, processing, and subcellular localization of the mutant pullulanase were studied. Labeling studies with [3H]palmitate and immunoprecipitation with mouse antiserum raised against pullulanase showed that the wild form of both the extracellular and intracellular pullulanases contained lipids, whereas the mutant enzyme was not modified with lipids. Only the Cys20 was modified with glyceryl lipids. The bulk of the mutant pullulanase was located in the periplasm, but a portion of the unmodified, mutant pullulanase was secreted into the medium. Mutant pullulanases from the extracellular and the periplasm were purified and their NH2-terminal sequences were determined. Both the mutant pullulanases were cleaved between residues of Ser13 and Leu14 which is 6-amino acid residues upstream of the lipid modified pullulanase cleavage site. This new cleavage was resistant to globomycin, an inhibitor of the prolipoprotein signal peptidase of Escherichia coli. These results indicate that the pentapeptide sequence plays an important role in maturation and translocation of pullulanase in K. aerogenes. However, the modification of pullulanase with lipids seems to be not essential for export of the enzyme across the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2159778894,"Isotopic exchange kinetics at chemical equilibrium have been used to identify changes in the regulatory properties of aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) caused by site-specific mutation of Tyr240----Phe (Y240F) in the catalytic chain. With both wild-type and the mutant enzymes, ATP activates both [14C]Asp in equilibrium N-carbamyl-L-aspartate (C-Asp) and the [32P]carbamyl phosphate (C-P) in equilibrium Pi exchanges. In contrast, with wild-type enzyme, CTP inhibits both exchanges, but with Y240F mutant enzyme CTP inhibits Asp in equilibrium C-Asp exchange and activates C-P in equilibrium Pi exchange. The bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate), PALA, activates Asp in equilibrium C-Asp at a lower concentration with the Y240F enzyme, but the extent of activation is decreased, relative to wild-type enzyme. PALA activation of C-P in equilibrium Pi observed with wild-type enzyme disappears completely with the Y240F mutant enzyme. Analysis of perturbations of exchange rates by ATP and CTP were carried out by systematic methods plus computer-based simulations with the ISOBI program. These analyses indicate that (a) ATP increases the rates of association and dissociation for both C-P and Asp, but (b) CTP differentially increases the rate of C-P association to a greater degree than dissociation, but also decreases the rates for Asp association and dissociation in equal proportion. In addition, Arrhenius plots for Y240F ATCase suggest that ATP and CTP act by different mechanisms: ATP increases Vmax (decreases delta G not equal to) uniformly at all temperatures, whereas CTP does not alter either Vmax (delta G not equal to) or the Arrhenius slope (delta H not equal to)."
