https://openalex.org/W2023568503,"Cancers arise owing to mutations in a subset of genes that confer growth advantage. The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W1976342457,"Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci."

https://openalex.org/W2104261859,"We performed a systematic, large-scale analysis of human protein complexes comprising gene products implicated in many different categories of human disease to create a phenome-interactome network. This was done by integrating quality-controlled interactions of human proteins with a validated, computationally derived phenotype similarity score, permitting identification of previously unknown complexes likely to be associated with disease. Using a phenomic ranking of protein complexes linked to human disease, we developed a Bayesian predictor that in 298 of 669 linkage intervals correctly ranks the known disease-causing protein as the top candidate, and in 870 intervals with no identified disease-causing gene, provides novel candidates implicated in disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, epithelial ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Our publicly available draft of protein complexes associated with pathology comprises 506 complexes, which reveal functional relationships between disease-promoting genes that will inform future experimentation."

https://openalex.org/W2000327096,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many physiological and developmental processes in plants. The mechanism of ABA perception at the cell surface is not understood. Here, we report that a G protein–coupled receptor genetically and physically interacts with the G protein α subunit GPA1 to mediate all known ABA responses in Arabidopsis . Overexpressing this receptor results in an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype. This receptor binds ABA with high affinity at physiological concentration with expected kinetics and stereospecificity. The binding of ABA to the receptor leads to the dissociation of the receptor-GPA1 complex in yeast. Our results demonstrate that this G protein–coupled receptor is a plasma membrane ABA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2057675705,"Some of the most intriguing problems in solid state physics arise when the motion of one electron dramatically affects the motion of surrounding electrons. Traditionally, such highly-correlated electron systems have been studied mainly in materials with complex transition metal chemistry. Over the past decade, researchers have learned to confine one or a few electrons within a nanoscale semiconductor ""artificial atom"", and to understand and control this simple system in exquisite detail. In this Article, we combine such individually well-understood components to create a novel highly-correlated electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure. We tune the system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states, one familiar and one subtly new. The boundary between these states is a quantum critical point: the exotic and previously elusive two-channel Kondo state, in which electrons in two reservoirs are entangled through their interaction with a single localized spin."

https://openalex.org/W2092094210,"Background Sleep slow wave activity (SWA) is thought to reflect sleep need, increasing in proportion to the length of prior wakefulness and decreasing during sleep. However, the process responsible for SWA regulation is not known. We showed recently that SWA increases locally after a learning task involving a circumscribed brain region, suggesting that SWA may reflect plastic changes triggered by learning. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis directly, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in conjunction with high-density EEG in humans. We show that 5-Hz TMS applied to motor cortex induces a localized potentiation of TMS-evoked cortical EEG responses. We then show that, in the sleep episode following 5-Hz TMS, SWA increases markedly (+39.1±17.4%, p<0.01, n = 10). Electrode coregistration with magnetic resonance images localized the increase in SWA to the same premotor site as the maximum TMS-induced potentiation during wakefulness. Moreover, the magnitude of potentiation during wakefulness predicts the local increase in SWA during sleep. Conclusions/Significance These results provide direct evidence for a link between plastic changes and the local regulation of sleep need."
https://openalex.org/W2070190142,"Numerous epidemiological studies documented that obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer development in postmenopausal women. Leptin, the key player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight control also acts as a growth factor on certain organs in both normal and disease state. In this study, we analyzed the role of leptin and the molecular mechanism(s) underlying its action in breast cancer cells that express both short and long isoforms of leptin receptor. Leptin increased MCF7 cell population in the S-phase of the cell cycle along with a robust increase in CYCLIN D1 expression. Also, leptin induced Stat3-phosphorylation-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells as blocking Stat3 phosphorylation with a specific inhibitor, AG490, abolished leptin-induced proliferation. Using deletion constructs of CYCLIN D1 promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that leptin induced increase in CYCLIN D1 promoter activity is mediated through binding of activated Stat3 at the Stat binding sites and changes in histone acetylation and methylation. We also show specific involvement of coactivator molecules, histone acetyltransferase SRC1, and mediator complex in leptin-mediated regulation of CYCLIN D1 promoter. Importantly, silencing of SRC1 and Med1 abolished the leptin induced increase in CYCLIN D1 expression and MCF7 cell proliferation. Intriguingly, recruitment of both SRC1 and Med1 was dependent on phosphorylated Stat3 as AG490 treatment inhibited leptin-induced recruitment of these coactivators to CYCLIN D1 promoter. Our data suggest that CYCLIN D1 may be a target gene for leptin mediated growth stimulation of breast cancer cells and molecular mechanisms involve activated Stat3-mediated recruitment of distinct coactivator complexes.

The prevalence of obesity in the developed world has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. Obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer (1Calle E.E. Rodriguez C. Walker-Thurmond K. Thun M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1625-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (6033) Google Scholar). Obese breast cancer patients exhibit a higher risk for lymph node metastasis, larger tumor burden, and mortality when compared with non-obese breast cancer patients (2Berclaz G. Li S. Price K.N. Coates A.S. Castiglione-Gertsch M. Rudenstam C.M. Holmberg S.B. Lindtner J. Erien D. Collins J. Snyder R. Thurlimann B. Fey M.F. Mendiola C. Werner I.D. Simoncini E. Crivellari D. Gelber R.D. Goldhirsch A. Ann. Oncol. 2004; 15: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very important to understand the manner in which obesity adversely affects the prognosis of breast cancer (both estrogen receptor (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; OB, obese; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; JAK, Janus kinase; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; TGF, transforming growth factor; SH2, Src homology domain 2. positive and ER negative) to devise appropriate new approaches to their treatment. At present a biological explanation for risk associated between obesity and breast cancer is not known. Obesity is now considered as an endocrine disorder (3Dizdar O. Alyamac E. Med. Hypotheses. 2004; 63: 790-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) mediating its functions through adipocytokines (4Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. Obes. Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) acting by endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine modes (5Rajala M.W. Scherer P.E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Considerable efforts in adipocyte biology have emphasized the important role of adipocytokines in diverse processes such as energy metabolism, inflammation, and most importantly human cancer (6Housa D. Housova J. Vernerova Z. Haluzik M. Physiol. Res. 2005; 55: 233-244PubMed Google Scholar). Leptin, a product of the obese (OB) gene is a neuroendocrine hormone that has attracted attention since its identification in 1995 (7Huang L. Li C. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Rose D.P. Komninou D. Stephenson G.D. Obes. Rev. 2004; 5: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It is a multifunctional peptide hormone with wide ranging biological activities including appetite regulation, bone formation, reproductive function, and angiogenesis (9MacDougald O.A. Hwang C.S. Fan H. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9034-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Leptin circulates as a 16-kDa protein partially bound to plasma proteins (10Ahima R.S. Osei S.Y. Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and exerts its actions through its specific cell surface receptors present in a variety of tissues (10Ahima R.S. Osei S.Y. Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The leptin signaling is thought to be transmitted mainly by the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway (11Bahrenberg G. Behrmann I. Barthel A. Hekerman P. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Becker W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Bjorbaek C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Stat proteins were identified as mediators of cytokine signaling. Stat3 proteins get phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue (Tyr705) by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases such as JAK kinases (13Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) and activated Stat3 transcription factors translocate into the nucleus to activate target genes. The molecular basis of gene activation by transcription factors involves the recruitment of different coactivator complexes to create an open chromatin conformation. Histone acetyltransferase activity containing coactivators include members of p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family. These proteins are thought to function in part by associating with potent histone acetyltransferases such as the p300/CREB-binding protein and ultimately target the HAT activity to specific promoters (14Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Another type of coactivator complex is the TRAP/Mediator complex, which binds through its anchor subunit Med1 and possibly facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (15Ito M. Yuan C.X. Malik S. Gu W. Fondell J.D. Yamamura S. Fu Z.Y. Zhang X. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It is shown that histone acetylation is a prerequisite for Mediator complex recruitment and function (16Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transcription activation by Stat proteins relies on interactions with the coactivator CBP/p300 and requires its histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT) activity (17Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Stat proteins can recognize a conserved element in the promoter regions of target genes and activate transcription. Many Stat3 target genes are key components of the regulation of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (13Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). In recent years, a large body of evidence has shown that disruption of cell cycle control mechanisms is a common pathway in human cancer and overexpression of CYCLIN D1 is one of the most commonly observed alterations. CYCLIN D1 promoter contains multiple regulatory elements, including binding sites for AP-1, Stats, NF-κB, E2F, Oct1, Sp1, Myc/Max, Egr, Ets, CRE, and TCF/LEF (19Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27272-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Overexpression of D-type cyclins and cyclin E shortens the G1 phase and accelerates S phase entry indicating that their overexpression would result in increased proliferation in cancer (20Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Buckley M.F. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8022-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Indeed now there is conclusive evidence that CYCLIN D1 overexpression is associated with the ER positive, slow-growing, more differentiated phenotype of breast cancer (21Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms eliciting the biological effects of leptin in breast carcinoma cells. We show that leptin modulates cell cycle and augments proliferation via activation of the JAK/Stat3 axis in breast carcinoma cells. Leptin-mediated transactivation of CYCLIN D1 promoter involves recruitment of activated Stat3 and distinct coactivator protein containing histone acetyltransferase activity and anchor subunit of mediator complex. Antibodies—Antibodies for short and long form of leptin receptors OB-R (C-20), OB-R (B-3), OB-R (H-300), Med1, Med12, Med24, SRC1, and SRC2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies for pStat3 (phospho-Stat3-Tyr705), anti-Stat3, and CYCLIN D1 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies for SRC3, Ac H3, Ac H4, H3-K4, and H3-K9 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Treatments—The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, T47D, ZR75, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC-1806 were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 2 μml-glutamine (Invitrogen). For treatment, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106/100-mm tissue culture dish. After 24 h of serum starvation, the culture media were changed to serum-free media containing treatments as indicated. Cultures were treated with human recombinant leptin (Sigma) at 100 ng/ml. In other sets of experiments, cells were treated with STAT3 inhibitor AG 490 (Calbiochem) at 100 μm, PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling) at 10 μm, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD098059 (Sigma) at 10 μm for the indicated durations. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by UV absorption. RNA integrity was confirmed using formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification. A semiquantitative PCR amplification was carried out using specific primers designed to amplify leptin receptors, OB-RB (long isoform) and OB-RT (short isoform). The primers were as follows: OB-RB sense, 5′-TCACCCAGTGATTACAAGCT-3′; OB-RB antisense, 5′-CTGGAGAACTCTGATGTCCG-3′; OB-RT sense, 5′-CATTTTATCCCCATTGAGAAG TA-3′; OB-RT antisense, 5′-CTGAAAATTAAGTCCTTGTGCCCAG-3′. PCR generated 1071- and 273-bp fragments of the OB-RB and OB-RT genes, respectively. In addition, specific primers for the 18 S RNA were used as control. The primers were sense 5′-GAGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGG-3′ and antisense 5′-GTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTTGC-3′. PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoprecipitation of OB-RB and OB-RT—Immunoprecipitation of long and short forms of leptin receptor was performed essentially following our previously published protocol (22Sharma D. Saxena N.K. Vertino P.M. Anania F.A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 1-12Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using specific antibodies; OB-R (C-20) (specific for long form of leptin receptor) or OB-R (H-300) (for both long and short form of leptin receptor) followed by immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal OB-R (B-3) antibody (specific for both long and short forms of leptin receptor). Western Blot—Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells in 250 μl of ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF) (22Sharma D. Saxena N.K. Vertino P.M. Anania F.A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 1-12Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The lysate was rotated 360° for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to clear the cellular debris. Proteins were quantified using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blot analyses were performed using the previously described antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability assay was performed (22Sharma D. Saxena N.K. Vertino P.M. Anania F.A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 1-12Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by estimating reduction of XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide), using a commercially available kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. MCF7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at an initial density of 4 × 103 cells/well for 24 h. After 24 h of serum starvation, the culture media were changed to serum-free media containing treatments as indicated. XTT labeling reagent was added to each culture well to attain a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. After 4 h exposure at 37 °C, absorbance was measured at 450 and 690 nm using a 96-well plate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS, Molecular Devices, CA). Pilot experiments verified that the cell densities used in experiments performed were within the linear range of the XTT assay. A standard curve was prepared using cell densities from 1 × 103 to 1 × 106, and the results were calculated with respect to the number of cells. Plasmids and Luciferase Assays—Human CYCLIN D1 promoter reporter constructs used for luciferase assays –1745-CD1-Luc, –674-CD1-Luc, –261-CD1-Luc, and –143-CD1-Luc were a kind gift from Dr. Richard Pestell (Georgetown University, Washington, D.

Lefebvre (Faculte de Medecine Henri Warembourg, France) (28Flajollet S. Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20338-20348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with various expression vectors and luciferase constructs either alone or in combination as indicated in the figures using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were harvested and luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to Renilla luciferase activities. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis/Cellular DNA Flow Cytometry Using PI (S-phase Analysis)—FACS analysis of MCF7 cells was carried out using Cellular DNA Flow Cytometry analysis (Roche), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown and treated as described previously. Cells were harvested, adjusted to equal cell numbers, fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min at –20 °C, and suspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing RNase A (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) (250 mg/liter) for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were stained with PI (100 mg/liter) before FACS analysis as described elsewhere (29Saxena N.K. Titus M.A. Ding X. Floyd J. Srinivasan S. Sitaraman S.V. Anania F.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1612-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, after excitation of PI at 485 nm, red fluorescence from PI was collected through a 580-nm long pass filter and recorded to measure cellular DNA content. After counting 3.5 × 104 cells, the number of cells in each phase of cell cycles (G0/G1, S, and G2/M) was analyzed to assess the respective DNA content. The MCF7 cell cycle profile was determined using a BD Biosciences FACScan, and data were analyzed using ModFit LT 3.1. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analyses were performed using our published procedure (21Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Sharma D. Saxena N.K. Davidson N.E. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Chromatin samples were sonicated on ice three times for 10 s each (i.e. until the average length of sheared genomic DNA was 1 to 1.5 kb) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. The immunoprecipitated DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 25 μl of H2O. Total input samples were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O and diluted 1:100 before PCR analysis. Initially, PCR was performed with different numbers of cycles and/or dilutions of input DNA to determine the linear range of amplification; all results shown fall within this range. Following 28–30 cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on 1% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. All ChIP assays were performed at least three times with similar results. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were independently performed three times in triplicate. Data were analyzed using paired Student’s t test. Data were considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Leptin Modulates Cell Cycle and Augments Proliferation via Activation of JAK/Stat3 Axis in Breast Cancer Cells—A disruption of cell cycle control mechanism due to overexpression of CYCLIN D1 is a common pathway in human breast cancer. Overexpression of CYCLIN D1 correlates with poor prognosis. The relationship between CYCLIN D1 and cancer through the regulation of fat metabolism remains to be determined. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the proportion of MCF7 cells was increased in S-phase by leptin treatment as compared with cells subjected to serum-free conditions (Fig. 1A). D-type cyclins are active in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. They complex with cyclin-dependent kinases to catalyze the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (31Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Leptin modulates the cell cycle of breast carcinoma cells and one of the targets for leptin action may be CYCLIN D1 as leptin treatment induced up-regulation of CYCLIN D1 protein (Fig. 1B). The effect of leptin on the transcriptional activation of CYCLIN D1 was examined using a CYCLIN D1 promoter luciferase construct, –1745-CD1-Luc (the structure is shown in Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1C, MCF7 cells transfected with –1745-CD1-Luc demonstrate a 5–7-fold increase in luciferase expression in response to leptin, indicating that leptin positively regulates the activity of the CYCLIN D1 promoter. Leptin elicits its biological functions through binding to its receptors that mediate a downstream signal by activating multiple signaling pathways (10Ahima R.S. Osei S.Y. Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We next examined the expression of leptin receptors in ER positive (MCF7, T47D, and ZR75), ER negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468), and triple negative ER, PR, Her2 negative (HCC1806) breast cancer cells. The expression of leptin receptor mRNA and protein was examined using reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis. A predicted PCR product of OB-RB (long isoform) was obtained as 1071 bp and OB-RT (short isoform) as 273 bp by specific primers (Fig. 1D) in all breast cancer cells examined. Immunoprecipitation was performed using specific antibodies: OB-R (C-20) (recognizes only long form of leptin receptor) and OB-R (H-300) (recognizes both long and short form of leptin receptor) followed by Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal OB-R (B-3) (recognizes both long and short form of leptin receptor). Immunoprecipitates with specific antibodies show the presence of both long and short forms of leptin receptor in MCF7 cells, whereas IgG controls do not (Fig. 1E). Our studies show that leptin dysregulates cell cycle via overexpression of CYCLIN D1 (Fig. 1, A–C). Overexpression of CYCLIN D1 might lead to unchecked cell cycle progression and possibly tumorigenic growth. Therefore, we next examined the effect of leptin on breast carcinoma cell proliferation using the XTT assay. For these experiments, MCF7 cells were serum starved for 16 h followed by treatment with various concentrations of leptin for different periods of time. Leptin stimulated the growth of MCF7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1F). Substantial stimulation was observed at all time intervals after treatment of cells at 100 ng/ml leptin, whereas higher concentrations were not particularly more stimulatory. To gain insight into the signaling mechanism underlying the biological effect of leptin on breast carcinoma cells, we next examined the changes in signal transduction pathways plausibly involved in mediating leptin action. Previous studies have demonstrated that leptin activates JAK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates Stats in other systems (22Sharma D. Saxena N.K. Vertino P.M. Anania F.A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 1-12Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Saxena N.K. Titus M.A. Ding X. Floyd J. Srinivasan S. Sitaraman S.V. Anania F.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1612-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Total cellular proteins were extracted from cells treated with 100 ng/ml leptin for various time periods and lysates were immunoblotted with a specific phosphotyrosine Stat3 antibody. Stat3 phosphorylation was stimulated by 100 ng of leptin in a time-dependent manner resulting in an increase in Stat3 phosphorylation within 15 min of treatment (Fig. 2A). Immunoblots were reprobed with antibodies against Stat3 showing that the increase in Stat3 phosphorylation was not due to the increased Stat3 protein expression (Fig. 2A). Next, to investigate if activation of JAK/Stat3 axis is directly involved in leptin-induced proliferation of breast carcinoma cells, we studied the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of JAK/Stat (AG490), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (PD098059), and PI 3-kinase (LY294002) on leptin-induced growth stimulation. Treatment of cells with AG490 decreased the phosphorylation of Stat3 protein significantly without affecting the expression of total Stat3 protein (Fig. 2B), whereas PD098059 and LY294002 did not affect the phosphorylation of Stat3. Importantly, simultaneous treatment with leptin and AG490 could not restore the level of phosphorylation as achieved by treatment with leptin alone. Examination of cell proliferation in these treatment conditions clearly showed that blocking Stat3 phosphorylation significantly reduced the growth stimulation of MCF7 cells by leptin (Fig. 2C), indicating that the activation of Stat3 is essential for the cell proliferative effect of leptin in breast carcinoma. The JAK/Stat3 Pathway Is Important for Leptin-mediated Transactivation of CYCLIN D1 Promoter— Studies of cytokine signaling dependent gene expression showed that Stat proteins are signaling molecules with dual functions (32Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Stat proteins not only transmit a signal from the cell surface to the nucleus but also directly participate in gene regulation (32Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Our data showed that leptin uses the JAK/Stat3 pathway to augment breast cancer cell proliferation and increases CYCLIN D1 expression. Because the expression of CYCLIN D1 is elevated in Stat3-C (constitutively activated Stat3) expressing cells (25Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 33Dechow T.N. Pedranzini L. Leitch A. Leslie K. Gerald W.L. Linkov I. Bromberg J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it is plausible that activated Stat3 in response to leptin modulates transcriptional regulation of CYCLIN D1 in breast cancer cells. CYCLIN D1 promoter contains binding sites for a number of transcription factors (19Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27272-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

The consensus Stat binding motifs (TTC-NNNGAA) at –247 and –481 were of particular interest for these studies because these consensus sites have previously been shown to be sites for cytokine action mediated by Stats in other systems. Therefore, the effect of overexpression of wild-type, dominant-negative and constitutively active Stat3 on leptin signaling to the CYCLIN D1 promoter was examined. Cotransfection with wild-type Stat3 (HA-Stat3 WT) significantly increased CYCLIN D1 promoter luciferase activity, whereas cotransfection with dominant negative mutants carrying either phenylalanine substitution at Tyr705 (Stat3F) or mutations at the positions important for DNA binding (Stat3D) efficiently inhibited leptin-mediated transactivation of CYCLIN D1 promoter (Fig. 2D). We also found that leptin induced luciferase activity driven by the CYCLIN D1 promoter was"
https://openalex.org/W2008907352,"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) elements are abundant, non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons that comprise approximately 17% of human DNA. The average human genome contains approximately 80-100 retrotransposition-competent L1s (ref. 2), and they mobilize by a process that uses both the L1 endonuclease and reverse transcriptase, termed target-site primed reverse transcription. We have previously reported an efficient, endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition pathway (EN(i)) in certain Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are defective in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand-break repair. Here we have characterized EN(i) retrotransposition events generated in V3 CHO cells, which are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activity and have both dysfunctional telomeres and an NHEJ defect. Notably, approximately 30% of EN(i) retrotransposition events insert in an orientation-specific manner adjacent to a perfect telomere repeat (5'-TTAGGG-3'). Similar insertions were not detected among EN(i) retrotransposition events generated in controls or in XR-1 CHO cells deficient for XRCC4, an NHEJ factor that is required for DNA ligation but has no known function in telomere maintenance. Furthermore, transient expression of a dominant-negative allele of human TRF2 (also called TERF2) in XRCC4-deficient XR-1 cells, which disrupts telomere capping, enables telomere-associated EN(i) retrotransposition events. These data indicate that L1s containing a disabled endonuclease can use dysfunctional telomeres as an integration substrate. The findings highlight similarities between the mechanism of EN(i) retrotransposition and the action of telomerase, because both processes can use a 3' OH for priming reverse transcription at either internal DNA lesions or chromosome ends. Thus, we propose that EN(i) retrotransposition is an ancestral mechanism of RNA-mediated DNA repair associated with non-LTR retrotransposons that may have been used before the acquisition of an endonuclease domain."
https://openalex.org/W2027222713,"The C terminus of the β2-adrenoceptor (AR) interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins in an agonist-dependent manner, suggesting that conformational changes induced by ligands in the transmembrane domains are transmitted to the C terminus. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to examine ligand-induced structural changes in the distance between two positions on the β2-AR C terminus and cysteine 265 (Cys-265) at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain 6. The donor fluorophore FlAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix binder) was attached to a CCPGCC motif introduced at position 351-356 in the proximal C terminus or at the distal C terminus. An acceptor fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 568, was attached to Cys-265. FRET analyses revealed that the average distances between Cys-265 and the proximal and distal FlAsH sites were 57 and 62Å, respectively. These relatively large distances suggest that the C terminus is in an extended, relatively unstructured conformation. Nevertheless, we observed ligand-specific changes in FRET. All ligands induced an increase in FRET between the proximal C-terminal FlAsH site and Cys-265. Ligands that have been shown to induce arrestin-dependent ERK activation, including the catecholamine agonists and the inverse agonist ICI118551, led to a decrease in FRET between the distal FlAsH site and Cys-265, whereas other ligands had no effect or induced a small increase in FRET. Taken together the results provide new insight into the structure of the C terminus of the β2-AR as well as ligand-induced conformational changes that may be relevant to arrestin-dependent regulation and signaling.

They respond to a large array of structurally diverse ligands and are the largest group of targets for drug discovery. Structure/function analysis has identified amino acids important for G protein coupling and ligand binding for several well characterized GPCRs, including the β-2 adrenoceptor (β2-AR) (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Moreover, many of these studies provide support for the accuracy of three-dimensional models of GPCRs based on the high resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin (2Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, few studies have directly addressed the mechanism by which diffusible ligands activate G protein-coupled receptors. The most detailed information about structural changes associated with activation of a GPCR come from studies of rhodopsin. This is in part owing to its natural abundance and biochemical stability relative to other GPCRs. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies provide evidence that photoactivation of rhodopsin involves a rotation and tilting of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) relative to TM3 (3Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Light-induced conformational changes have also been observed in the cytoplasmic domain spanning TM1 and TM2, and the cytoplasmic end of TM7 (4Altenbach C. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Farrens D. Zhang C. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15493-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although rhodopsin has long been used as a model system for GPCR activation, it is unique among GPCRs because of the presence of a covalent linkage between the receptor and its ligand, retinal. Thus, the dynamic processes of agonist association and dissociation common to the GPCRs for hormones and neurotransmitters are not part of the activation mechanism of rhodopsin. The β2-AR is activated by a functionally broad spectrum of diffusible ligands and is also a good model system to study the structural basis of ligand efficacy. We have developed spectroscopic methods to characterize the structure of the β2-AR and monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in real time (7Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that agonists induce conformational changes in TM3 and TM6 of the β2-AR that are similar to those observed upon activation of rhodopsin. We have obtained direct evidence that agonists and partial agonists induce distinct conformational states and that the process of agonist binding and activation occurs through at least two kinetically distinguishable conformational states (7Swaminath G.

Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have primarily focused on ligand-induced conformational changes in TM segments involved in ligand binding and G protein coupling. However, agonists induce changes in the receptor structure that promote phosphorylation of the C terminus by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and binding of arrestins (10Benovic J.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: S229-S235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These processes are important for receptor desensitization and agonist-induced internalization. Recent studies demonstrate that arrestin is also a signaling molecule (11Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 12Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Of interest, arrestin-dependent activation of ERK has been observed following activation by agonists and inverse agonists (13Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11406-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), suggesting that the efficacy of ligands for guanine nucleotide binding protein Gs and arrestin signaling may differ. The recent 2.2 Å crystal structure of rhodopsin reveals a structured C terminus folded over the 8th helix and the first cytoplasmic loop (15Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). However, this domain has relatively low homology with the C termini of other GPCRs. Moreover, the C terminus of the β2-AR is 45 amino acids longer. It is therefore unlikely that they share the same structure. To investigate the structure and ligand-induced conformational changes in this receptor domain, we have developed a FRET approach that allows us to monitor ligand-induced movement at two positions in the C terminus relative to the cytoplasmic end of TM6. The donor fluorophore FlAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix binder) was attached to a CCPGCC motif introduced at position 351-356 in the proximal C terminus (10 residues after the palmitoylation site) or at the distal C terminus (after residue 413). The acceptor fluorophore Alexa Fluor 568 was introduced at a single reactive cysteine (Cys-265) at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. FRET analyses provided evidence that the C terminus is in an extended conformation; nevertheless, we observed ligand-specific effects on FRET between Cys-265 and the proximal and distal FlAsH sites. The results provide insights into structural features that may be relevant to interactions between the C terminus of the β2-AR and regulatory proteins such as GRKs and arrestins. The template used for site-directed mutagenesis was the human β2-AR cDNA epitope tagged at the N terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope and at the C terminus with 6 histidines. The mutations were generated on a background in which 4 of the 13 native cysteines in the receptor had been mutated as follows: C77V, C327S, C378A, and C406A. In this modified receptor (β2-AR-Δ4 background), the only maleimide-reactive cysteine is Cys-265 (16Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were all generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated cDNA was then digested with appropriate enzymes and cloned into pFastBac1 vector. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Sf9 insect cells were grown at 27 °C in suspension cultures in ESF-921 medium (Expression Systems) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). For receptor purification, Sf9 cell cultures at a density of ∼3 × 106 cells/ml were infected with appropriate viruses and harvested after 60 h by centrifugation (10 min at 5000 × g). The cell pellets were kept at -70 °C until used for purification. Receptors were purified using a two-step purification procedure. Appropriate amounts of cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm alprenolol, 160 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Following centrifugation (20 min at 30,000 × g), the lysed cells were resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1.0% n-dodecyl-maltoside (DDM) (Anatrace), 100 mm NaCl, 160 μg/ml benzamidine, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μm alprenolol), subjected to 30 strokes of tight dounces using Wheaton dounce tissue grinder (Millville, NJ), and then stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized receptor was purified by chromatography using M1 FLAG antibody affinity resin (Sigma). The eluate from the M1 anti-FLAG column was further purified on an alprenolol-Sepharose affinity column and finally through a second M1 FLAG antibody affinity resin purification step. Purified detergent-soluble receptor was stored in HLS buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% DDM). The concentration of functional, purified receptor was determined as follows: purified receptor was incubated in triplicate in HLS buffer with a saturating concentration of [3H]dihydroalprenol (10 nm) in a total volume of 100 μl for 1 h at room temperature. Free [3H]dihydroalprenol was separated from bound by passing through a Sephadex G50 Medium column (4 × 0.5 cm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm alprenolol. Purified β2-AR and Tet-Gαs protein were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:5 and reconstituted as described previously (17Swaminath G. Deupi X. Lee T.W. Zhu W. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22165-22171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, reconstituted receptor (100 nm, final concentration) and Tet-Gαs were resuspended in 500 μl of cold binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.4 nm [35S]GTPγS, and 1 μm GDP with or without β2-AR ligands. Incubations were performed for 30 min at 25 °C with shaking at 230 rpm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS and was always less than 0.2% of total binding. Bound [35S]GTPγS was separated from free [35S]GTPγSby filtration through glass fiber filters followed by three washes with 3 ml of cold binding buffer. Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For double-labeled receptor, purified receptors (100 μl) were reacted overnight at 16 °C in the dark with 3 equivalents of FlAsH (commercially known as Lumio™Green labeling reagent) and Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (100 μm). Alexa Fluor 568 maleimide (1.1 equivalents) was then added to the mixture for 10 min at 4 °C. For Alexa Fluor 568-labeled receptor, purified receptors (100 μl) were first incubated overnight at 16 °C in the dark in the exact same conditions as for the double-labeled receptor but without FlAsH and without TCEP. Then, 1.1 equivalents of Alexa Fluor 568 maleimide were added to the mixture for 10 min at 4 °C. The fluorophore-labeled receptors were separated from the free dye by gel filtration on a desalting column equilibrated with a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside with 0.01% cholesterolhemisuccinate. The donor/receptor and acceptor/donor ratio was determined by dividing the bound dye concentration (calculated by using the maximum absorbance of the donor- or acceptor-labeled receptor) by the donor or receptor concentration (determined by absorbance or ligand binding, respectively). The ratio of donor to receptor ranged from 0.8 to 1 dye/receptor. The typical acceptor/donor labeling ratios ranged from 1 to 1.3 (extinction coefficients ɛFlAsH,528 = 70,000 cm-1 m-1 and ɛAlexa568,578 = 91,300 cm-1 m-1). General Conditions—Experiments were performed on a SPEX FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer with photon counting mode using an excitation and emission bandpass of 2 nm in S/R acquisition mode. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at 25 °C. The final concentration of receptor used for spectroscopy ranged from 10 to 40 nm. FRET Spectroscopy—For each FRET experiment, spectra were taken from receptor labeled with donor at FlAsH sites and acceptor at Cys-265 or receptor labeled with only the acceptor fluorophore at Cys-265. For each type of receptor, two types of emission scans were acquired. The first emission scan (donor scan) acquired used the excitation maximum for the donor fluorophore. The second emission scan (acceptor scan) used the excitation maximum for the acceptor fluorophore. The donor/acceptor pair used 508 nm excitation for the donor and 578 nm excitation for the acceptor. For testing the effects of β2-AR-specific drugs, samples (±) drug were gently mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Three separate samples were used for testing each type of drug, and individual spectra were acquired and averaged. Drug concentrations varied from 10 μm to 1 mm. Emission spectra of the drugs in buffer were obtained at both the donor and acceptor excitation wavelengths and subtracted from the spectra obtained from the samples containing the receptor and drug (see below). Background fluorescence of the buffer was subtracted from spectra derived from the sample containing only the receptor. Removal of acceptor bleedthrough and correction of drug-induced acceptor fluorescence intensity changes were carried out and described in detail below. In this section, we use the following symbols to refer to the experimental emission spectra used for analysis, determined using the receptor with donor FlAsH on CCPGCC motif and acceptor Alexa Fluor 568 on Cys-265, or the receptor labeled only with acceptor on Cys-265, after excitation at the donor wavelength (ExcD) or at the acceptor wavelength (ExcA) as shown in Equation 1. {A=receptorlabeledwithdonorandacceptor,ExcDA′=receptorlabeledwith donor and acceptor, ExcAB=receptor labeled with acceptor, ExcDB=receptor labeled with acceptor, ExcAAdrug=same as A, with drug, ExcDA′drug=same asA′,with drug, ExcASbuff=buffer, ExcDS′buff=buffer, ExcASdrug=drug along, in buffer, ExcDS′drug=drug along, in buffer, ExcA(Eq.1) Background fluorescence from either buffer or drug is removed as shown in Equation 2. {C=A-SbuffC′=A′-S′buffD=Adrug-SdrugD′=A′drug-S′drugE=B-SbuffE′=B′-Sbuff(Eq.2) In spectrum E, the only signal is from direct excitation of the acceptor at ExcD. In spectra C and D, the signal from direct excitation of the acceptor is mixed with donor and FRET signals. However, the contribution from direct excitation of the acceptor in spectrum C and D is proportional to spectrum E, with a scaling factor that depends on the amount of acceptor fluorophores in the different samples. Importantly, the amount of acceptor is directly proportional to the intensities in spectra C′, D′, and E′, where the donor and the FRET signals do not contribute at all. Thus, the contribution from direct excitation of acceptor in spectra C and D can be subtracted as shown in Equation 3 {F=C-E×C′maxE′maxG=D-E×D′maxE′max(Eq.3) where “max” is defined as the intensity at the acceptor emission peak. The wavelength used to determine this value is 603 nm. If the intensity of the acceptor changes in response to the drug, the emission peaks for spectra C′ and D′ will be different as shown in Equation 4. drug response=D′maxC′max(Eq.4) This change in intensity will also modify the signal obtained when using ExcD, in spectrum G. For instance, if the drug response is 2 in spectrum D′, then the acceptor signal in spectrum G should actually be divided by 2 to have only the changes due to FRET (note that in our experiments, the responses were actually in the order of 1-3%). More generally, the acceptor signal in spectrum G should be corrected for FRET-independent drug response using the following correction factor as shown in Equation 5. correction factor=1-C′maxD′max(Eq.5) Because only the acceptor signal is affected, this correction factor should only be applied to the contribution of the acceptor in the total spectrum, which is a mix of donor and acceptor signals. The acceptor signal can be extracted using spectrum E and properly scaling it as was done above to obtain spectra F and G as shown in Equation 6. acceptor signal in spectrumG=E×GmaxEmax(Eq.6) Thus, the final corrected spectrum where the FRET-independent response to drug has been subtracted is as shown in Equation 7. H=G-(E×GmaxEmax)×(1-C′maxD′max)(Eq.7) Finally, spectra are normalized to keep the area under the curve constant, which also removed the contribution from any drug-induced fluorescent intensity change of the donor. As shown in Equation 8, the proximity ratio is then Proximity ratio=IAIA+ID(Eq.8) where ID and IA are the intensities of the donor and acceptor peaks, respectively. When comparing the responses to drugs we used the proximity ratio. The drug response is calculated as the change in proximity ratio between spectrum F and spectrum H. To be able to accurately calculate the distances between the fluorescent probes using the Förster theory, the proximity ratio needs to be corrected to give the FRET efficiency (18Ha T. Ting A.Y. Liang J. Caldwell W.B. Deniz A.A. Chemla D.S. Schultz P.G. Weiss S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 9. FRET efficiency=IAIA+γID(Eq.9) In Equation 10, the correction factor γ is defined as γ=ηAΦAηDΦD(Eq.10) where ηD and ηA are the collection efficiencies of donor and acceptor signals and ΦA and ΦD are the fluorescence quantum yields of the donor and acceptor, respectively. We assume ηA/ηD to be 1 to obtain Equation 11. FRET efficiency=IAIA+(ΦA/ΦD)/DEq.11 ΦA and ΦD were measured by using the following relation (19Chen R.F. Science. 1965; 150: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 12 ΦX=Φst.×FxFst.×ODst.ODx(Eq.12) where subscripts st. and x refer to the standard and unknown solutions, respectively. F is the relative integrated fluorescence intensity, and OD is the optical density at the exciting wavelength. Rhodamine 6G was chosen as the standard (quantum yield equal to 0.90 in water) (20Magde D. Wong R. Seybold P.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 75: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Emission spectra were obtained at 25 °C using 490 nm excitation while collecting fluorescence from 496 to 800 nm. The signal from buffer solution was subtracted from each sample and from the standard before integration. The R0 values for the FlAsH-Alexa 568 FRET pair were calculated as shown in Equation 13 using the relationship R0=(9.765×103)(J(λ)×κ2×ΦD×n-4)1/6(inpanelA)(Eq.13) where κ2 is the orientation factor (assumed to be equal to 2/3), n is the refractive index (equal to 1.3), ΦD is the quantum yield of the donor, and J(λ) is the spectral overlap integral between the emission spectrum of β2-AR-FlAsH and the absorption spectrum of β2-AR-Alexa 568 (in cm3·m-1). The anisotropy was determined according to Equation 14 r=I//-G/⊥I//+2G/⊥(Eq.14) where I//and I ⊥ are the fluorescence intensities measured for parallel and perpendicular components relative to the polarized excitation and G the collection efficiencies of parallel and perpendicular signals. We assumed the collection efficiencies of parallel and perpendicular signals to be the same (G = 1) to obtain Equation 15. r=I//-I⊥I//+2/⊥(Eq.15) Intensities were acquired at the maximum emission wavelength of each fluorophore over a 60-s time period and subsequently averaged. Samples were excited at the wavelengths described above. For determining any potential drug-induced changes in the anisotropy, samples were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the concentration of drug described above. Site-specific Labeling of the β2-AR with FlAsH and Alexa Fluor 568 to Monitor the Distance between TM6 and the C Terminus by FRET—We generated a modified β2-AR with a single FRET acceptor site at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 and two different FRET donor sites in the C terminus (Fig. 1). We started with a modified β2-AR where 4 of the 13 endogenous cysteines (Cys-77, Cys-327, Cys-378, and Cys-406) were mutated to alanine, valine, or serine (β2-AR-Δ4) (16Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 of the 9 remaining cysteines are not available for derivatization because of palmitoylation (Cys-341) (21O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or disulfide bond formation (Cys-106, Cys-184, Cys-190, and Cys-191) (22Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. DeBlasi A. Frielle T. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 3 remaining cysteines, Cys-116, Cys-125, and Cys-285, are poorly labeled with maleimide reagents. This leaves Cys-265 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 as the only remaining maleimide-reactive cysteine. This site was used for attachment of the FRET acceptor Alexa 568 maleimide. For the C-terminal FRET donor sites, we used the fluorophore 4′, 5′-bis(1,2,3-dithioarsolan-2-yl)-fluorescein, also called FlAsH, commercially known as Lumio Green labeling reagent (see Fig. 1). This fluorophore binds specifically to a CCPGCC motif (FlAsH site) (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The first FlAsH site was introduced by replacing residues Gly-351-Ser-356, located 10 residues after the palmitoylation site (β2-AR-351-CCPGCC), and the other was introduced following the last amino acid at the C terminus (β2-AR-C-ter-CCPGCC) (Fig. 1, green circles). As shown in Fig. 2A, when FlAsH was incubated overnight with the purified β2-AR-351-CCPGCC, almost no labeling occurred. This result is consistent with the requirement for a reducing agent like TCEP in the labeling reaction and with the fact that FlAsH is not able to react with sulfhydryls such as Cys-265 (24Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Jones J. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The results, presented in Fig. 2A, reveal that the addition of 10 μm TCEP significantly enhanced the receptor labeling. Maximal labeling was obtained using 100 μm TCEP and 3 equivalents of FlAsH overnight at 16 °C. Higher concentrations of TCEP (1 mm) and FlAsH did not further increase labeling. It should be noted that 100 μm TCEP does not reduce critical disulfides necessary for maintaining β2-AR structure. The same results were observed for the β2-AR-C-ter construct and the level of FlAsH labeling was similar (not shown). Hence, in all our experiments, we performed FlAsH labeling in the presence of 100 μm TCEP and 3 equivalents of free dye overnight at 16 °C. The labeled receptors were also characterized by SDS-PAGE. The gel (Fig. 2B) shows a fluorescent band corresponding to the molecular mass of the β2-AR for both constructs, confirming the reactivity of the CCPGCC motif. It is also interesting to note that SDS and reducing agent failed to dissociate the fluorescent labels. It is important to note that under the same conditions we did not observe any FlAsH labeling of a β2-AR lacking the CCPGCC motif (Fig. 2A), indicating that the remaining cysteines in the receptor are not reactive toward the FlAsH compound. Moreover, under the conditions used, Cys-265 is still accessible to thiol reactive probes as revealed by the efficient Alexa Fluor 568 labeling of β2-AR-351-CCPGCC prelabeled with FlAsH (Fig. 2C). The β2-AR-C-ter-CCPGCC construct gave similar results (Fig. 4A). The stoichiometry of FlAsH labeling ranged from 0.8 to 1 mol of dye/mol of receptor, and the acceptor/donor labeling ratio ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 (“Experimental Procedures”). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the FlAsH sites and Cys-265 are selectively labeled with a donor and an acceptor, respectively, allowing us to use FRET to monitor changes in distance between these sites. Functional Coupling of Labeled β2-AR to G Protein—The β2-ARΔ4 receptor has been previously characterized and retains normal function in both ligand binding and G protein-coupling assays (16Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show that the introduction of the CCPGCC motifs does not modify receptor-G protein coupling, we measured the ligand-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to purified Tet-Gαs protein reconstituted with purified receptor as previously described (17Swaminath G. Deupi X. Lee T.W. Zhu W. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22165-22171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The agonist responses for both constructs were indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor (the wild-type receptor gives routinely a 10-fold increase over basal [35S]GTPγS-specific binding, not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, unlabeled reconstituted β2-AR-351-CCPGCC and β2-AR-C-ter-CCPGCC gave a similar response after agonist (9.5 ± 0.7- and 8.6 ± 0.7-fold over basal, respectively) or inverse agonist (0.38 ± 0.04- and 0.53 ± 0.145-fold over basal) tr"

However, evidence for the effect has so far been indirect. We report precise optical photometric observations of a small near-Earth asteroid, (54509) 2000 PH5, acquired over 4 years. We found that the asteroid has been continuously increasing its rotation rate ω over this period by d ω/ dt = 2.0 (±0.2) × 10 –4 degrees per day squared. We simulated the asteroid's close Earth approaches from 2001 to 2005, showing that gravitational torques cannot explain the observed spin rate increase. Dynamical simulations suggest that 2000 PH5 may reach a rotation period of ∼20 seconds toward the end of its expected lifetime."

It has been postulated that the binding of pemphigus vulgaris IgG (PVIgG) to KCs induces “desmosomal” signaling. Because in contrast to integrins and classical cadherins, desmoglein (Dsg) molecules are not known to elicit intracellular signaling, and because PV patients also produce non-Dsg autoantibodies, we investigated the roles of both Dsg and non-desmoglein PV antigens.

The Src inhibitor PP2 decreased EGFRK and p38 activities by ∼45 and 30%, respectively, indicating that in addition to Src, PVIgG evokes other triggering events. The shrinkage of KCs (cell volume reduction) became significant at 120 min, keratin aggregation at 240 min, and an increase of TUNEL positivity at 360 min. Pretreatment of KCs with PP2 blocked PVIgG-dependent cell shrinkage and keratin aggregation by ∼50% and TUNEL positivity by ∼25%. The p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 inhibited these effects by ∼15, 20, and 70%, respectively. Transfection of KCs with small interfering RNAs that silenced expression of Dsg1 and/or Dsg3 proteins, blocked ∼50% of p38 MAPK activity but did not significantly alter the PVIgG-dependent rise in Src and EGFRK activities. These results indicate that activation of p38 MAPK is a late signaling step associated with collapse of the cytoskeleton and disassembly of desmosomes caused by upstream events involving Src and EGFRK.

Amagai M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It has been convincingly demonstrated that PVIgG binding to KCs evokes an array of intracellular biochemical events resulting in cell detachment and death. The binding of PVIgG to KCs activates phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, increases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol production, elevates the intracellular free calcium level, and leads to activation of various kinases, including protein kinase C and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) (reviewed in Ref. 2Lanza A. Cirillo N. Femiano F. Gombos F. J. Cutan. Pathol. 2006; 33: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among the known substrates of PVIgG-dependent phosphorylation are the adhesion molecules E-cadherin, Dsg3, β-catenin, and γ-catenin (a.k.a. plakoglobin) (3Nguyen V.T. Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I.

PVIgG binding to KCs leads to depletion of Dsg3 from desmosomes, nuclear trafficking of plakoglobin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator secretion, and c-Myc overexpression (reviewed in Ref. 5Kitajima Y. Aoyama Y. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). DNA microarray assays demonstrated that PVIgG down-regulates expression of the genes encoding keratinocyte adhesion molecules, antigen-processing proteins, regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis, differentiation markers, Na+,K+-ATPase, protein kinases, phosphatases, and others (5Kitajima Y. Aoyama Y. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, PVIgG decreased transcription of 198 genes and increased that of 31 genes. The pathobiologic outcome of the PVIgG-induced signaling is induction of the apoptotic and/or oncotic pathways, associated with collapse of the cytoskeleton, because of keratin filament retraction and actin reorganization, cell shrinkage, caused by cell volume decrease, and, finally, cell-cell dyshesion (acantholysis) (reviewed in Ref. 6Bystryn J.-C.

The in vitro and in vivo studies revealed not only the complexity of PVIgG signaling, but also clearly demonstrated the therapeutic potential of kinase inhibitors and pathway modifiers. PVIgG-dependent acantholysis in experimental animals could be ameliorated by inhibitors of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, p38 MAPK, other tyrosine kinases, calmodulin as well as cholinergic agonists (7Nguyen V.T.

The outside-in signaling of PVIgG may be elicited through both cholinergic receptors and desmosomal proteins, as well as other yet unknown PV antigens/receptors ligated on the cell membrane of KCs by an array of anti-keratinocyte autoantibodies produced in each PV patient, as explained by the “Multiple Hit” hypothesis (10Grando S.A. Dermatology. 2000; 201: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The major downstream signaling events resulting from activation/blockade of cholinergic receptors expressed in KCs have been characterized (11Grando S.A. Pittelkow M.R. Schallreuter K.U. J. Investig.

Recent studies have demonstrated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at an early step of PVIgG-induced signaling (13Frusic-Zlotkin M. Raichenberg D. Wang X. David M. Michel B. Milner Y. Autoimmunity. 2006; 39: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that such receptors are either novel specific targets of pemphigus autoimmunity or “innocent victims” of the “collateral damage” produced because of PVIgG binding to the keratinocyte plasma membrane, or both.The purpose of this study was to identify the primary pathways mediating PVIgG-induced acantholysis that can provide a promising target for development of novel therapies. We performed a time course correlation study of biochemical and morphologic events induced by PVIgG binding to human KCs. The results indicate that activation of p38 MAPK is a late signaling step associated with collapse of the cytoskeleton and disassembly of desmosomes caused by upstream events involving c-Src kinase (i.e. the protein encoded by the cellular counterpart of the translation product of the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus) and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (EGFRK). To dissect out the signaling pathways originating from of Dsg 1/3 and from those elicited due to ligation of non-Dsg antigens, we used KCs with the knocked-down expression of the DSG1 and/or DSG3 genes by small interfering RNA (siRNA). The earliest acantholytic events appeared to be triggered by non-Dsg antibodies.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Tissue Culture Reagents—A potent, cell-permeable, and selective p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, the inhibitor of Src family of protein tyrosine kinase PP2, and PhosphoDetect™ p38 MAPK ELISA kit were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (EMD Biosciences, Inc. La Jolla, CA). The FACE™ c-Src and EGFR kits were purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The predesigned and tested siRNA-targeting human DSG1 (NM_001942) mRNA (ONTARGETplus SMARTpool reagent L-011644-00) (siRNA-Dsg1) and siRNA-targeting human DSG3 (NM_001944) mRNA (L-011646-00) (siRNA-Dsg3) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The negative control siRNA targeting luciferase gene with the target sequence 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′ that was employed in all RNA inhibition experiments was also from Dharmacon. The DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System was from Promega (Madison, WI). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to Dsg1 and Dsg3 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and secondary, FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody, from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.Pemphigus and Normal Human IgG Fractions—The results reported herein were obtained in experiments utilizing pooled IgG fractions isolated from sera of 6 PV patients with active lesions on both oral mucosa and the skin, and sera of healthy people purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. This study had been approved by the University of California Davis Human Subjects Review Committee. The diagnosis of PV was made based on the results of comprehensive clinical and histological examinations, and immunological studies, which included direct immunofluorescence of skin biopsies, indirect immunofluorescence of patient sera on various epithelial substrates, and immunoblotting following standard protocols. The titer of “intercellular” antibodies determined on monkey esophagus ranged from 1/640 to 1/2560. The presence of anti-Dsg1 and -Dsg3 antibodies in each serum was established using the MESACUP Dsg-1 & Dsg-3 ELISA test system (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The index values for Dsg1 antibodies ranged from 64 to 136 and those for Dsg3 antibodies, from 82 to 176, i.e. were unequivocally positive. The IgG fractions were isolated by FPLC protein G affinity chromatography using the FPLC System purchased from Amersham Biosciences and following the manufacturer’s protocol, as detailed by us elsewhere (14Arredondo J.

Pathol. 2005; 167: 1531-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Keratinocyte Culture Experiments—Human keratinocyte cultures were started from normal neonatal foreskins (15Grando S.A. Kist D.A. Qi M. Dahl M.V. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 32-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glass Works, Coring, NY) in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium containing 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator. The keratinocyte cultures used in experiments were between passages 2 and 4, ∼80% confluent, grown from at least three different foreskin donors. The concentration of calcium in culture medium was adjusted to either 0.2 mm or 1.6 mm (see below). The IgG fractions were diluted in culture medium and added to the monolayers at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Prior to exposures, some monolayers were pretreated with kinase inhibitors (see “Results”). The control monolayers were left intact. All monolayers were incubated in culture media containing 1.6 mm calcium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for different periods of time (see “Results”), and then used in the Src, EGFRK, and p38 MAPK assays in accord with manufacturer’s protocols, quantitation of numbers of TUNEL (i.e. the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling)-positive cells, or for analyses of cell volume and keratin filament aggregation. The cytosolic volume was quantified by computing the cell diameter as detailed elsewhere (16Orlov M.D. Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Grando S.A. Autoimmunity. 2006; 39: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the result expressed as % control values determined in intact culture. KCs exhibiting keratin filament aggregation were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence in at least three microscopic fields at magnification ×100, using anti-pan keratin antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA).siRNA Transfection Experiments—For transfection with siRNAs, we followed the standard protocol described in detail elsewhere (17Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Karlsson E. Wessler I. Grando S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39220-39228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, KCs were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate, and incubated for 16-24 h to achieve ∼70% confluence. To each well, increasing concentrations of siRNA in the transfection solution with the DharmaFECT™ 1 siRNA Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) were added, and the transfection was continued for 16 h at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator. The siRNA transfection efficiency was assayed using FITC-labeled luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon). After transfection, the cells were grown for 24 h in culture with 0.09 mm calcium, and then switched to the medium containing higher concentration of calcium and incubated for additional time points (up to 72 h) to achieve maximum inhibition of the Dsg protein expression, as was experimentally determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. For immunoblotting experiments, KCs were dissolved in a sample buffer, separated via SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were developed using the ECL + Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned with Storm™/FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA). The PVIgG exposure experiments of transfected KCs were performed at 1.6 mm extracellular Ca2+. Some KCs transfected with siRNA-Dsg3 were cultured and exposed to PVIgG at 0.2 mm extracellular Ca2+. By immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence, at this concentration of Ca2+ KCs did not express Dsg1.Electron Microscopic Experiments—Normal human foreskin KCs seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with normal control siRNA (siRNA-NC), siRNA-Dsg1, or siRNA-Dsg3, grown for 48 h in keratinocyte growth medium with 0.09 mm calcium, and then switched to the medium containing 2 mm calcium overnight. On the next day, the cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, washed in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and post fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by embedding in epoxy resins. The ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, followed by observation under an electron microscope (JEM-100S, JEOL LTD, Tokyo, Japan) as detailed elsewhere (18Sato M. Aoyama Y. Kitajima Y. Lab. Investig. 2000; 80: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The traversing distance of the extracellular core domain (intercellular gap) of desmosome was calculated as follows: ∼50 electron micrographs were taken from each sample at a magnification of ×30,000 and developed at ×2.5. From 30-60 desmosomes were analyzed. The distance was measured on the right-angled line with the line of clear plasma membrane, illustrating trilamellar structure.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t test. Differences were deemed significant if the calculated p value was <0.05.RESULTSTime Course Study of Kinase Activities in KCs Exposed to PV IgG—To identify the effectors mediating intracellular signaling of PVIgG at the earliest stages of acantholysis, we studied the activities of Src, EGFRK, and p38 MAPK. The time course studies demonstrated that the activity of Src peaked at 30 min, EGFRK at 60 min, and p38 MAPK at 240 min (Fig. 1, A-C).To elucidate the hierarchy of signaling events, we used the Src inhibitor PP2, because the peak of Src activity was observed at the earliest point in time after addition of PVIgG, i.e. before that of EGFRK and p38 MAPK. The cells were pretreated with 10 μm PP2, incubated with PVIgG, and the activities of EGFRK and p38 MAPK were measured at 60 and 240 min of incubation, respectively, when the activities of these kinases peaked. Preincubation with PP2 decreased PVIgG-dependent EGFRK and p38 MAPK activities by ∼45 and 30% (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that: 1) Src activation is upstream of both EGFRK and p38 MAPK; and 2) in addition to Src, binding of PVIgG to KCs engages other primary signaling pathways.Correlation between Biochemical and Phenotypic Changes in KCs Treated with PVIgG—We have previously reported that PVIgG-treated KCs shrink, detach from neighboring cells, and die through a mixed apoptotic/oncotic pathway, featuring TUNEL positivity (14Arredondo J.

Autoimmunity. 2006; 39: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte shrinkage upon exposure to PVIgG (Fig. 2, A and B) is associated with collapse of the tonofilament scaffold supporting the polygonal shape of these epithelial cells (Fig. 2, C and D). To identify functional links between specific signaling events and alterations of keratinocyte morphology and viability resulting from PVIgG binding, we assayed changes in cell volume, keratin filament aggregation, and number of TUNEL+ cells in the monolayers at different time points after addition of PVIgG. The shrinkage of KCs became significant (p < 0.05) at 120 min, keratin filament aggregation at 240 min, and an increase of TUNEL+ cells at 360 min (Fig. 3, A-C).FIGURE 2Effects of PVIgG on keratinocyte morphology and keratin filament framework. Keratinocyte monolayers were treated with normal human IgG (A and C) or PVIgG (B and D) and then either examined by phase contrast microscopy (A and B) or fixed and stained with anti-pan keratin antibody described under “Materials and Methods” (C and D). Bar, 25 μm. A and B, shrinkage and intercellular dyshesion of KCs treated with PVIgG. Note, the polygonal shape of KCs in the monolayer changed to an irregular one, as the cells detached from each other, and then a spherical one, as cells rounded up, revealing large gaps in the monolayer. The cytosolic volume was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” (see Fig. 3, A and D). C and D, keratin intermediate filament aggregation. Note shrinkage of single KCs accompanied by keratin filament aggregation, which may spontaneously occur in intact monolayers (not shown), and also was seen in the monolayers treated with normal human IgG (C). Treatment with PVIgG, however, induced a massive collapse of intermediate filament framework and cell shrinkage (D). The keratin filament aggregation was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” (see Fig. 3, B and E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Correlation between biochemical and phenotypic changes in KCs treated with PVIgG. Measurements of the cytosolic volume (A and D), keratin filament aggregation (B and E) and TUNEL positivity (C and F) were performed in KCs exposed to PVIgG without (A-C) or with (D-F) pretreatment with the Src inhibitor PP2, 10 μm, or the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, 10 μm. A-C, time course analysis of keratinocyte cytosolic volume (A), keratin filament aggregation (B), and TUNEL positivity (C) in KCs treated with either PVIgG (- -• - -) or normal human IgG (—▪—).

Asterisks indicate significant (p < 0.05) differences compared with control KCs treated with normal IgG (control), and the pound signs indicate significant (p < 0.05) differences compared with the effect of PVIgG given alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To establish correlation between biochemical events and phenotypic changes developing in KCs upon PVIgG binding to their plasma membrane, we selected inhibitors of both “early” and “late” kinases, Src and p38 MAPK, respectively. Pretreatment of KCs with the Src inhibitor PP2, 10 μm, blocked PVIgG-dependent cell shrinkage and keratin aggregation by ∼50% (p < 0.05), and TUNEL positivity by ∼25% (p > 0.05). The p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, 10 μm, decreased these PVIgG effects by ∼15% (p > 0.05), 22% (p > 0.05), and 70% (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 3, D-F). These results indicated that Src was mainly responsible for early events in PVIgG-induced acantholysis, such as collapse of the cytoskeleton, whereas p38 MAPK, for late events, such as induction of apoptosis. Because neither kinase inhibitor could completely normalize studied parameters, as all remained significantly (p < 0.05) different from control values, PVIgG binding to KCs apparently engaged other signaling pathways contributing to the phenotypic changes.The Effects of Silencing of the DSG1 and DSG3 Genes on KCs and Their Response to PVIgG—To elucidate the roles of desmosomal and non-desmosomal targets of pemphigus autoimmunity, we asked whether silencing of the DSG1 or DSG3 genes would affect the biochemical events elicited because of PV IgG binding to KCs. The efficacy of knocking down the expression of Dsg1 or Dsg3 proteins in KCs with the Dharmacon-predesigned siRNAs was controlled by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Already 24 h after transfection with either siRNA-Dsg1 or siRNA-Dsg3, the KCs contained no measurable amounts of Dsg1 or Dsg3, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). siRNA-NC did not affect Dsg1 or Dsg3 expression. Transfection with either siRNA did not alter keratinocyte viability, evaluated by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and TUNEL staining (data not shown). The morphology of the monolayers comprised by KCs transfected with siRNA-Dsg1 or siRNA-Dsg3 or both was indistinguishable from that of intact cells or KCs transfected with siRNA-NC (not shown). The KCs transfected with either type of siRNA formed desmosomes visualized by electron microscopy.FIGURE 4Silencing of the DSG1 and DSG3 genes with siRNAs. Knocking down of the expression of Dsg1 (A) and Dsg 3 (B) was achieved through transfection of KCs with siRNA-Dsg1 and siRNA-Dsg3, respectively, followed by analysis of the monolayers by immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (C), as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” A and B, immunoblotting assay of Dsg1 was performed using 10% SDS-PAGE gel and that of Dsg3 using 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. As an internal control, both assays utilized anti-pan keratin antibody that visualized a double-band at ∼46 kDa. Note, transfection with Dsg-specific siRNAs, but not with negative control siRNA (siRNA-NC), eliminated completely both Dsg1 and Dsg3 protein bands in Western blots of keratinocyte proteins and staining of the keratinocyte cell membranes with specific antibodies. Bar, 20 μm. C, electron microscopic analysis of keratinocyte desmosomes revealed that KCs transfected with control siRNA-NC or siRNA-Dsg1 exhibited normal ultrastructural features of desmosomes. In contrast, KCs transfected with siRNA-Dsg3 showed fine filaments traversing the extracellular core domain of the desmosome with widening of the intercellular distance. Bars, 0.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if gene silencing of Dsg1 and Dsg3 affected desmosome ultrastructure, we compared the ultrastructure of KCs transfected with siRNA-NC, siRNA-Dsg1 and siRNA-Dsg3 (Fig. 4C). KCs transfected with siRNA-NC exhibited normal ultrastructural features of desmosomes. Their desmosomes were comprised by the plasma membranes with the outer dense plaque and the inner dense plaque overlapped with keratin intermediate-sized filaments, and a ∼22 nm-wide gap at the extracellular core domain (intercellular gap) without electron-dense midline. Similar desmosome structure was observed in desmosome produced by KCs transfected with siRNA-Dsg1. In Dsg3-deficient KCs, we observed fine filaments traversing the extracellular core domain of the desmosome with widened intercellular distance.The traversing distance of the extracellular core domain of desmosomes in KCs transfected with siRNA-NC was 22.5 ± 4.4 nm. In the KCs with knocked-down expression of Dsg1, this distance was not altered, 19.9 ± 4.4 nm. However, silencing of the DSG3 gene significantly (p < 0.0001) increased the distance to 31.2 ± 11.8 nm (n = 37), illustrating the widening of desmosomes.Transfection with siRNAs that inhibited expression of either Dsg1 and Dsg 3 alone or together in all cases blocked ∼50% of p38 MAPK activity (p < 0.05), but only insignificantly (p > 0.05) altered PVIgG-dependent raise in Src and EGFRK activities (Fig. 5), indicating that anti-Dsg1 and -Dsg3 antibodies contributed predominantly to the pathobiologic events resulting from activation of p38 MAPK, such as development of keratinocyte apoptosis.FIGURE 5Silencing of the DSG1 and DSG3 genes modifies PVIgG effects on kinase activities in KCs. The activities of Src (A), EGFRK (B), and p38 MAPK (C) were measured in control (untransfected) and experimental KCs transfected with negative control siRNA (siRNA-NC), siRNA-Dsg1, and/or siRNA-Dsg3 at the time points corresponding to the maximal activities of each kinase, i.e. at the 30th, 60th, and 240th min, respectively, after addition of PVIgG. Asterisks indicate significant (p < 0.05) differences compared with untransfected control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The experiments with the siRNA-Dsg3-transfected KCs that were performed at 0.2 mm of extracellular Ca2+ brought similar results (data not shown). Treatment of transfected cells with normal IgG did not elicit any measurable kinase activities at either concentration of extracellular Ca2+ tested, indicating that the signaling events observed in cells exposed to PVIgG occurred because of ligation of pemphigus autoantigen(s), rather than transfection with siRNAs.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study revealed the sequence of major intracellular biochemical events elicited due to PVIgG binding to the keratinocyte plasma membrane and their correlation with morphologic changes characteristic of acantholysis, and also defined rela"

https://openalex.org/W2038415055,"Background The dewlaps of Anolis lizards provide a classic example of a complex signaling system whose function and evolution is poorly understood. Dewlaps are flaps of skin beneath the chin that are extended and combined with head and body movements for visual signals and displays. They exhibit extensive morphological variation and are one of two cladistic features uniting anoles, yet little is known regarding their function and evolution. We quantified the diversity of anole dewlaps, investigated whether dewlap morphology was informative regarding phylogenetic relationships, and tested two separate hypotheses: (A) similar Anolis habitat specialists possess similar dewlap configurations (Ecomorph Convergence hypothesis), and (B) sympatric species differ in their dewlap morphologies to a greater extent than expected by chance (Species Recognition hypothesis). Methodology/Principal Findings We found that dewlap configurations (sizes, patterns and colors) exhibit substantial diversity, but that most are easily categorized into six patterns that incorporate one to three of 13 recognizable colors. Dewlap morphology is not phylogenetically informative and, like other features of anoles, exhibits convergence in configurations. We found no support for the Ecomorph Convergence hypothesis; species using the same structural habitat were no more similar in dewlap configuration than expected by chance. With one exception, all sympatric species in four communities differ in dewlap configuration. However, this provides only weak support for the Species Recognition hypothesis because, due to the great diversity in dewlap configurations observed across each island, few cases of sympatric species with identical dewlaps would be expected to co-occur by chance alone. Conclusions/Significance Despite previous thought, most dewlaps exhibit easily characterizable patterns and colorations. Nevertheless, dewlap variation is extensive and explanations for the origin and evolution of this diversity are lacking. Our data do not support two hypothesized explanations for this diversity, but others such as sexual selection remain to be tested."

As the carcinoma progresses, stromal fibroblasts are recruited, and their phenotype is altered through the action of growth factors and cytokines. The resulting tumor-associated stroma is recognized by pathologists as desmoplasia and forms a permissive and supportive environment for tumor growth (1Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. Nature. 2001; 411: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Compared with normal stromal fibroblasts, breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts display distinct gene expression and phenotypic changes (2Hornby A.E. Cullen K.J.

The emerging picture implicates soluble paracrine growth factors and extracellular matrix components in stroma-to-carcinoma cell signaling, but our understanding of these reciprocal pathways is presently incomplete. We and others have recently observed a dramatic overexpression of the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) 2The abbreviations used are: HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HMF, human mammary fibroblasts; G6PDH, glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, short interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; CSGAG, chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; RPE, (R)-phycoerythrin; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; m, murine; WT, wild type. syndecan-1 (Sdc1) in stromal fibroblasts of invasive breast carcinomas (9Stanley M.J.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sdc1 consists of an extracellular domain carrying heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSGAG) and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CSGAG), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The biological functions of Sdc1 are not fully understood, but co-receptor roles in signaling of HSGAG-dependent growth factors and in cell adhesion events are well documented. Most of these activities are mediated through the HSGAG chains, but core protein-specific functions have also been described (11Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar, 12Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Sdc1 ectodomain can be shed from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage at a juxtamembrane site (13Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The shed Sdc1 ectodomain retains its biologically active heparan sulfate chains and has been found to promote growth of myeloma tumors in vivo (14Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 is normally expressed in many types of epithelia and plasma cells. Mesenchymal Sdc1 expression has been observed during the development of various organ systems and pathologically in stromal fibroblasts of several carcinoma types (9Stanley M.J. Stanley M.W.

Oral Oncol. 2006; 42: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sdc1 expression in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts is seen in the majority of infiltrating breast carcinomas and resembles Sdc1 induction in fibroblasts surrounding terminal end buds during mouse mammary gland development (9Stanley M.J. Stanley M.W. Sanderson R.D. Zera R. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 112: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests that Sdc1 is involved in the reactivation of an oncofetal signaling pathway in breast carcinomas. Our previous study has demonstrated that highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells induce Sdc1 expression in fibroblasts in a two-dimensional co-culture system and that Sdc1 overexpression in fibroblasts promotes cancer cell proliferation (10Maeda T. Alexander C.M. Friedl A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The stimulating effect of stromal Sdc1 on mammary tumor cell growth has also been confirmed in vivo. Using mixed fibroblast-carcinoma cell xenografts, we have observed that forced expression of Sdc1 in fibroblasts promotes tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis (19Maeda T. Desouky J. Friedl A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although these studies have advanced our understanding of the importance of HSPGs in epithelial-stromal interactions, they also pose a series of new questions regarding the requirement of specific Sdc1 molecular domains and the molecular mechanisms involved. To maintain a physiologically relevant milieu, we have developed a three-dimensional co-culture system that combines organ site-specific fibroblasts with breast carcinoma cells in a collagen matrix. We found that the growth-stimulating effect is mediated by the HSGAG chains on Sdc1, requires cleavage of the Sdc1 core protein at the cell surface, and also requires FGF2 activity. Because expression of the FGF2 receptor FGFR1c was up-regulated in T47D breast carcinoma cells, a model is proposed that invokes the paracrine activity of fibroblast Sdc1-derived HSGAG forming a complex with FGF2 and FGFR1c on the carcinoma cell surface, resulting in accelerated growth. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse anti-delta heparan sulfate (3G10) antibody was purchased from Seikagaku America (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA). Goat anti-human FGF2 neutralizing antibody was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-human SDF1 polyclonal antibody and recombinant mouse SDF1 were bought from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Rat monoclonal antibody directed against mouse syndecan-1 extracellular domain was kindly provided by Dr. A. C. Rapraeger (University of Wisconsin, Madison).

Heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC were purchased from IBEX Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Type I rat tail collagen was purchased from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—The human breast carcinoma cell line T47D was obtained from Dr. M. Gould (University of Wisconsin, Madison). The normal mammary fibroblasts immortalized with human telomerase and labeled with GFP (RMF/EG) were generously provided by Dr. C. Kuperwasser (20Kuperwasser C. Chavarria T. Wu M. Magrane G. Gray J.W. Carey L. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Throughout this study, RMF/EG cells will be referred to as human mammary fibroblasts (HMF). T47D cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. HMF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Collagen Gel Co-culture and Cell Growth Assay—Three-dimensional collagen gel co-culture was established based on a method described previously by Wozniak and Keely (21Wozniak M.A. Keely P.J. Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7: 144-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T47D cells and HMF cells were mixed at a ratio of 2:1 in collagen type I gel at a final collagen concentration of 1.3 mg/ml. Collagen gel co-culture was maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Twenty four hours after transduction, HMF-siRNA cells were co-cultured with T47D cells in collagen gel for an additional 3 days. To quantify the cell growth in collagen gel, the collagen gel was first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 15 min, washed for 20 min with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing, fixed collagen gels were stained with the nuclear dye, Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Images were acquired using a SPOT imaging system (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) on an Olympus inverted microscope. Cell number was counted using MetaMorph image-processing software (Molecular Devices Corp. Downingtown, PA). To differentiate HMF and T47D cells in the co-culture sample, both Hoechst dye and green fluorescent images were taken and merged. HMF cells were distinguished from T47D cells by virtue of their elongated shape and GFP expression. In the T47D cell growth assay, a nucleus size exclusion strategy was applied during the cell counting procedure. Because HMF cells displayed a smaller nuclear size and a weaker nuclear staining than T47D cells in the Hoechst dye staining, they could be excluded during the counting process by defining a T47D cell-specific standard single nucleus size. Therefore, we collected the Hoechst dye images and then analyzed the T47D cell number. We compared this counting method with the image merging method described earlier. Both methods gave consistent T47D cell number count. Flow Cytometry—Cells were released from the collagen gels by collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml; Worthington) and enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) treatment (37 °C, 1 h) and washed with cold PBS containing 2% FBS. 106 cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 μg of mouse anti-human syndecan-1 IgG conjugated to RPE (B-B4-RPE). After washing, the samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur benchtop cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell scatter and propidium iodide (1 μg/sample; Sigma) staining profiles were used to gate live, single-cell events for data analysis. Cells were sorted under sterile conditions on a triple-laser FACSVantage SE equipped with the FACSDiva digital electronics analyzer. Quantitative RT-PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed to measure FGF receptor, syndecan-1, syndecan-2, and syndecan-4 mRNA levels. Cells were dissociated from collagen gel by collagenase and enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. HMF and T47D cells were separated by FACS. The total RNA was then isolated using RNeasy Protect mini kit (Qiagen). Same cell number equivalent of total RNA from T47D or HMF cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Thermo-Script™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1 (22Shimazu A. Bachchu M.A. Morishita M. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Iwamoto Y. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Five percent of the reverse transcription product was used in the quantitative real time-PCR with SYBR Green PCR master mix on an iCycler instrument (Bio-Rad). G6PDH mRNA level was used as an internal control for normalizing different samples. Immunofluorescent Staining—Collagen gel cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed for 20 min in PBS. Collagen gels were then treated with 0.15 m glycine in PBS at 4 °C overnight to reduce autofluorescence. After washing with PBS for 20 min, gels were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked with 3% FBS in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Collagen gels were then incubated with anti-human Sdc1 antibody (10 μg/ml, B-B4-RPE) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with PBS, the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100; Invitrogen), was added for 1 h at room temperature. The gels were then washed four times with PBS. In the negative control, collagen gels were only stained with the secondary antibody. Immunostaining was then analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). siRNA Transfection—siRNA transfection was performed as described (12Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Three siRNAs designed to specifically silence human syndecan-1 were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). 400 nm siRNA was added to 1 × 105 HMF cells using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM I transfection medium (Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with lipid-based vehicle alone. At 24–48 h after transfection, the HMF cells were lifted in trypsin (0.25% w/v) and co-cultured with T47D cells in collagen gel. Recombinant Adenoviruses Transduction—cDNAs for mSdc1 (from A. C. Rapraeger, University of Wisconsin), mGpc1 (from G. David, University of Leuven, Belgium), mSdc1-TDM, sol-mSdc1, and uc-mSdc1 (all from R. Sanderson, University of Alabama at Birmingham) were cloned into the Adeno-X™ Expression Systems 2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Clontech). Different doses (5, 10, and 50 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.)) of recombinant adenoviruses were applied to HMF cells prior to co-culture. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting. HSPG Extraction—Total HMF cell HSPGs were purified as described previously (23Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured cells were placed on ice, washed three times with cold HEPES-buffered saline, and extracted with 1 ml of TUT buffer per 10-cm dish (10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 8.0) for 5 min and scraped into a conical tube. After sonication, 80–100 μl of DEAE beads pre-equilibrated with TUT were added to the tube. Tubes containing DEAE beads and extraction solution were rotated overnight at 4 °C. HSPGs were eluted with high salt HEPES buffer (30 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4). To extract HSPGs, culture media were collected and diluted with TUT buffer with a ratio of 1:1. Then 150 μl of DEAE beads preequilibrated with TUT were added. The rest of the procedure was the same as total HSPG extraction. Isolation of Glycosaminoglycans—Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were isolated as reported by Lee et al. (24Lee P.H. Trowbridge J.M. Taylor K.R. Morhenn V.B. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48640-48646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, 80–100% confluent HMF cells were extracted with extraction buffer. The proteins and GAGs were precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The precipitate was digested exhaustively with proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 65 °C for 24 h. Proteins remaining in the digest were precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the supernatant was once again precipitated by 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The precipitate was dried and desalted on a PD-10 column using pyridine acetate buffer, pH 5.0, as an eluent. The eluted fractions were dried by speedvac and pooled. Quantitation of sulfated GAGs was carried out by the dye-binding assay of Chandrasekhar et al. (25Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using dimethyl-methylene blue (Aldrich), except that the absorbance was read at 525 nm. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Extracted HSPGs were digested with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC (0.002 units/ml) twice for 2 h to remove all glycosaminoglycan chains. Samples and pre-stained molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were denatured in sample buffer (SDS 2%, glycerol 10%, bromphenol blue, β-mercaptoethanol 2.5%) and heated to 100 °C for 1 min before gel electrophoresis. Samples were then electrophoretically separated on a Criterion™ XT precast gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were probed with anti-delta HS (3G10) antibody (0.03 μg/ml), which reacts with HS “stubs” generated by heparitinase treatment or rat anti-mouse Sdc1 (m281.2). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma) was used for detection. The signal was visualized with SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Mammary Stromal Fibroblasts Stimulate T47D Breast Carcinoma Cell Growth—In an organotypic co-culture model, T47D human breast carcinoma cells were combined with HMF and embedded in three-dimensional collagen gels. HMF cells had previously been immortalized by transduction with human telomerase and labeled by expression of GFP (20Kuperwasser C. Chavarria T. Wu M. Magrane G. Gray J.W. Carey L. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Collagen was chosen because it resembles the extracellular matrix milieu of invasive breast carcinoma better than Matrigel, which models the laminin-rich basement membrane-type extracellular matrix surrounding normal breast epithelium (21Wozniak M.A. Keely P.J. Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7: 144-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Gudjonsson T. Ronnov-Jessen L. Villadsen R. Rank F. Bissell M.J. Petersen O.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T47D carcinoma cells in monoculture arranged themselves into small spheroids or irregular clusters, which did not significantly increase in size throughout a 7-day culture period (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the presence of fibroblasts induced progressive carcinoma cell growth, resulting in large, irregular, and partially branched epithelial cell clusters. A quantitative assessment of epithelial cell numbers revealed that the presence of fibroblasts caused a highly significant growth stimulation of the T47D cells from day 3 onward (Fig. 1B). The overall growth rate of the fibroblasts was low, and their growth rate was slightly suppressed by the presence of T47D cells. T47D Breast Carcinoma Cells Induce Sdc1 Expression in Mammary Fibroblasts in Three-dimensional Co-culture—In a prior study, we had observed that the poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells induced expression of Sdc1 in mouse fibroblasts, whereas better differentiated carcinoma cells, including T47D, failed to do so (10Maeda T. Alexander C.M. Friedl A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using the three-dimensional co-culture system described here, T47D cells induced the fibroblast expression of Sdc1 mRNA ∼5-fold (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of the syndecan family members Sdc2 and Sdc4 remained relatively unchanged. The induction of Sdc1 was confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2B) and by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2C and supplemental Table 2) and closely resembled stromal Sdc1 induction in human and mouse mammary tumors in vivo. T47D Breast Carcinoma Cell Growth Stimulation by Mammary Fibroblasts Requires Sdc1 Induction in Fibroblasts—We have recently described that Sdc1 induction in mouse fibroblasts stimulates breast carcinoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, which prompted us to examine whether stromal Sdc1 induction in human fibroblasts was also responsible for breast carcinoma cell growth stimulation in three-dimensional culture (10Maeda T. Alexander C.M. Friedl A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Maeda T. Desouky J. Friedl A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transfecting fibroblasts with Sdc1 siRNA constructs prior to co-culture significantly diminished Sdc1 induction compared with the vehicle-only controls. Western blots probed with an anti-HS stub antibody, which recognizes all HSPGs after heparitinase treatment, showed a selective reduction of Sdc1 without any effect on the levels of other HSPGs (Fig. 3B). Mammary fibroblasts pre-treated with siRNA oligonucleotide 3 will be referred to as HMF-siRNA cells throughout the rest of the study. The suppression of Sdc1 induction in HMF-siRNA cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, which also demonstrated that Sdc1 expression in the carcinoma cells was unaffected (Fig. 3A). Silencing of Sdc1 induction in fibroblasts abolished the T47D carcinoma cell growth advantage provided by the presence of fibroblasts but had no effect on fibroblast growth (Fig. 3C). Importantly, forced expression of murine Sdc1 (mSdc1, which is not targeted by the siRNA oligonucleotides) in the HMF-siRNA cells by adenoviral transduction completely restored the T47D growth stimulation (Fig. 3F), indicating that Sdc1 induction in the fibroblasts is required for their mitogenic effect on the carcinoma cells. Expression of mSdc1 in HMF-siRNA cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. A band corresponding to mSdc1 was detected by anti-mSdc1 antibody (Fig. 3D), and mSdc1 expression did not affect the levels of other HSPGs (Fig. 3E). The Sdc1 Core Protein Is Dispensable for the Mitogenic Effect on T47D Breast Carcinoma Cells—The Sdc1 molecule is composed of a core protein and covalently linked HSGAG and CSGAG chains. Recent reports, which attributed important Sdc1 activities to its core protein domains (12Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27McQuade K.J. Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2445-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Langford J.K. Yang Y. Kieber-Emmons T. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3467-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate whether the core protein was required for carcinoma cell growth promotion by fibroblasts. HMF-siRNA cells were transduced to overexpress either murine glypican-1 (mGpc1, Fig. 4B) or mSdc1 as a control. Gpc1, which is expressed by mammary fibroblasts at baseline levels but is not induced in breast carcinoma stroma, was chosen because, like Sdc1, the molecule localizes to the cell surface but possesses no homology to Sdc1 apart from the GAG attachment consensus sites (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, mGpc1 overexpression in the HMF-siRNA fibroblasts restored carcinoma cell growth stimulation similar to mSdc1 expression, indicating that the Sdc1 core protein is not specifically required (Fig. 4C). The base-line Gpc1 levels present in mammary fibroblasts in mono- and co-culture are insufficient to maintain carcinoma cell mitogenesis, but forced mGpc1 overexpression evidently compensates for suppressed Sdc1 induction. HSGAG Chains on Sdc1 Are Necessary but Not Sufficient for T47D Carcinoma Cell Growth Stimulation—This result suggests that carcinoma cell growth stimulation may be related to HSGAG chains. To test this hypothesis more directly, we transduced HMF-siRNA cells with the mSdc1 mutant, TDM mSdc1. In this mutant, three serine residues, which constitute the three N-terminal HSGAG attachment sites, have been changed to alanine, rendering the molecule HS-deficient (29Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Western blots with and without prior heparitinase digestion verified that TDM mSdc1 was expressed and that its glycanation was significantly reduced compared with WT mSdc1 (Fig. 5B). Forced TDM mSdc1 expression in HMF-siRNA cells incompletely restored growth stimulation of T47D carcinoma cells, indicating that full glycanation of this HSPG is required for its activity (Fig. 5C). The partial activity seen with this mutant may be due to the remaining two GAG attachment sites near the transmembrane domain (serines 210 and 220), which are preferentially decorated with CSGAG chains but can also carry HSGAGs (29Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The dependence of the growth-promoting effect on Sdc1 HSGAGs was further tested by adding isolated HSGAGs to co-cultures of HMF-siRNA and T47D cells. Purified HSGAGs were able to restore the growth-promoting effects at concentrations similar to those expected during Sdc1 induction in the fibroblasts, but this activity was sensitive to heparitinase treatment (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, HSGAG chains did not promote T47D cell growth in monoculture, suggesting that other fibroblast-derived factors are required. Shedding of Sdc1 from the Fibroblast Surface Is Required for T47D Cell Growth Stimulation—We noticed that mammary fibroblasts and T47D cells had only limited contact in the three-dimensional collagen gels (Fig. 3A), raising the possibility that Sdc1 may act at a distance from its cell surface attachment site. Proteolytic cleavage of Sdc1 with release of the ectodomain from the cell surface has been described in vitro and in vivo.In a myeloma model, shed Sdc1 ectodomain accelerates tumor growth in vivo in an autocrine manner (14Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gpc1, which can substitute for Sdc1 in our assay, is also readily released from the cell surface by cleavage of its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. This led us to investigate the possibility that Sdc1 shedding may also play a role in paracrine breast carcinoma growth stimulation. When an Sdc1 mutant, which lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6A) and is efficiently secreted (sol mSdc1, Fig. 6B), was forcibly expressed in HMF-siRNA cells, the mitogenic effect on T47D cells was restored, indicating that the soluble Sdc1 ectodomain is fully active in this assay (Fig. 6C). Western blots with and without prior heparitinase digestion verified that soluble mSdc1 is expressed at levels similar to WT mSdc1 and is glycanated with HSGAG chains (Fig. 6B). To address the question whether shedding is required for Sdc1 activity, we expressed an Sdc1 mutant in which the putative juxtamembrane proteolytic cleavage site from Gln-238 to Gln-252 had been replaced with the corresponding domain of human CD4 (13Fitzgerald M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2034530348,"Recently we generated a mathematical model (Bentele, M., Lavrik, I., Ulrich, M., Stosser, S., Heermann, D. W., Kalthoff, H., Krammer, P. H., and Eils, R. (2004) J.

Mathematical modeling in combination with experimental data provided new insights into CD95-mediated apoptosis and allowed us to establish a threshold mechanism of life and death. Here, we further assessed the predictability of the model experimentally by a detailed analysis of the threshold behavior of CD95 signaling. Using the model predictions for the mechanism of the threshold behavior we found that the CD95 DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) is formed at the cell membrane upon stimulation with low concentrations of agonistic anti-APO-1 monoclonal antibodies; however, activation of procaspase-8 at the DISC is blocked due to high cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein recruitment into the DISC. Given that death signaling does not occur upon CD95 stimulation at low (threshold) anti-APO-1 concentrations, we also analyzed survival signaling, focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Interestingly, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation takes place under threshold conditions. These findings show that triggering of CD95 can signal both life or death, depending on the strength of the stimulus.

Following CD95 stimulation, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 3The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; c-FLIP, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein; DED, death effector domain; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. is formed (9Kischkel F.C.

The DISC consists of oligomerized, probably trimerized, CD95 receptors, the adaptor molecule FADD, two isoforms of procaspase-8 (procaspase-8/a and procaspase-8/b), procaspase-10, and c-FLIPL/S/R (6Peter M.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14507-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The interactions between the molecules at the DISC are based on homotypic contacts. The death domain (DD) of the receptor interacts with the DD of FADD, while the death effector domain (DED) of FADD interacts with the N-terminal tandem DEDs of procaspases-8, -10, and c-FLIPL/S/R. The binding of procaspase-8 to the DISC results in a two-step processing of the zymogen (11Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The first cleavage step generates the two subunits p43/p41 and p12. In a second cleavage step the active enzyme subunits p18, p10, and the prodomains p26/p24 are produced. As a result, the active caspase-8 heterotetramer p102-p182 is released into the cytosol to propagate the apoptotic signal (12Lavrik I. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Weyd H. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 144-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two CD95 signaling pathways were established (13Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Type I cells are characterized by high levels of CD95 DISC formation and increased amounts of active caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 directly leads to the activation of downstream effector caspases-3 and -7. Type II cells are characterized by lower levels of CD95 DISC formation and, thus, lower levels of active caspase-8 (13Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In this case, signaling requires an additional amplification loop that involves the cleavage by caspase-8 of the Bcl-2 family protein Bid to generate truncated (t) Bid and subsequent tBid-mediated release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria results in apoptosome formation, followed by activation of procaspase-9, which in turn cleaves downstream, effector caspases (14Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C.

Recently there have been a few reports demonstrating that CD95 is not only a potent apoptosis inducer but is also capable of activating multiple survival pathways (15Zuliani C. Kleber S. Klussmann S.

CD95 stimulation was shown to play a central role in neurite outgrowth and neuronal regeneration following injury (17Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This effect was shown to involve the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK1/2 (17Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In tumor cells resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis (e.g. MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL) the triggering of CD95 was reported to result in activation of survival pathways involving NF-κB, ERK1/2, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and AKT (16Peter M.E. Legembre P. Barnhart B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism of survival signaling via CD95 remains unclear. To gain a better understanding of CD95-induced apoptosis and to elucidate the decision-making steps of CD95 signaling we developed a mathematical model of this signaling pathway (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To estimate the parameters of the model we performed quantitative measurements of CD95-induced apoptosis in human B lymphoblastoid SKW6.4 cells. SKW6.4 cells are Type I cells that are highly sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis. The model made a number of important predictions on the mechanisms of life/death decisions in CD95-induced apoptosis. According to these predictions CD95 signaling is characterized by a threshold behavior. The model predicted that the threshold is defined at the DISC and depends on c-FLIP concentrations at the DISC (10Golks A. Brenner D. Fritsch C. Krammer P.H. Lavrik I.N. J. Biol.

In this study using the model predictions we address the question how initial events in CD95 signaling influence life/death decisions at the CD95. We show that the initial concentration of CD95L and the concentration of the inhibitor of caspase-8 c-FLIP at the DISC are the most important factors contributing to the cellular decisions for CD95-induced life and death. Cell Lines—The B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-FADD monoclonal antibodies (mouse IgG1) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-CD95 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-caspase-8 monoclonal antibody C15 (mouse IgG2b) recognizes the p18 subunit of caspase-8. Anti-APO-1 is an agonistic monoclonal antibody (IgG3) recognizing an epitope on the extracellular part of CD95 (APO-1/Fas) (8Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). FII23C antibodies (IgG3) are isotype control antibodies for anti-APO-1 (20Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C.

The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, -2a, and -2b were from Southern Biotechnology Associates. Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Merck. zIETD-afc and zDEVD-afc were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Sigma. Flow Cytometry Analysis—The percentage of viable cells was determined by forward scatter/SSC using a FACSscan cytometer (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample was analyzed. Specific cell death was calculated as follows: (percentage of experimental cell death - percentage of spontaneous cell death)/(100 - percentage of spontaneous cell death) × 100. Western Blots—For Western blot analysis the cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min on ice and centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 × g). Postnuclear supernatant equivalents of 0.5 × 106 cells or 25 μg of protein as determined by the BCA method (Pierce) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were quantified using the LumiImager TMF1 system and Lumi Analyst software Version 3.0 (Roche Applied Science). The measurements were always performed in the region of a linear relation between the amount of antigen and the signal strength. The light signal was measured in Boehringer light units and in relative amounts. The Boehringer light unit value calculated is the absolute integration value of the band that was evaluated. The S.D. was calculated from up to three independent experiments. Caspase Activity Assays—Cytosolic lysates were incubated with 50 μm site-specific tetrapeptide substrates (zIETD-afc for caspase-8, zDEVD-afc for caspase-3) in caspase assay buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 200 μl. The release of the fluorogenic group AFC was determined after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C by a microplate fluorescence reader Wallach 1420 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. DISC Analysis by Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—1 × 108 cells in a concentration of 106 cells/ml were treated with indicated concentration of anti-APO-1 (IgG3) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and subsequently lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Triton X-100 (Serva), and 10% glycerol) (stimulated condition) or lysed without treatment (unstimulated condition). The CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 μg of anti-APO-1 and Protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed five times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 12% polyaerylamide gel. Subsequently, the gels were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS/Tween at 4 °C overnight. Blots were developed with a chemoluminescence method following the manufacturer’s protocol (PerkinElmer). Caspase Inhibition Experiments—Z-VAD-fmk (pan-specific caspase inhibitor) was added to the cells in the final concentration of 50 μm 30 min before the addition of anti-APO-1. Proliferation Assays—For proliferation assays 1 × 105 cells were seeded into a 96-well titer plate and stimulated with either 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 or left untreated for up to 4 days. Proliferation was measured with a scintillation counter after tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation during the final 15-18 h of the culture. CD95 Stimulation with Low Concentrations of Anti-APO-1 Antibodies Results neither in Cell Death nor in Caspase Activation—The analysis of CD95 signaling in human B lymphoblastoid SKW6.4 cells using mathematical modeling in combination with biochemical approaches led to the finding of a threshold behavior of CD95-induced apoptosis (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We established the threshold concentration of anti-APO-1 antibodies that did not result in cell death in SKW6.4 cells to be 1 ng/ml (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We performed a more detailed analysis of CD95-mediated cell death in SKW6.4 cells than in our previous studies (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We varied the concentration of anti-APO-1 from 0.1 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml and measured cell death at different time points from 2 h to 4 days (Fig. 1A). Notably, we used the same concentration of SKW6.4 cells (106 cells/ml) as in our previous studies (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies (threshold concentration) we did not observe any cell death (Fig. 1A) nor did we see caspase activation using the fluorescent substrates of caspases zIETD-afc and zDEVD-afc (Fig. 1B). To assure that the threshold concentration of the anti-CD95 stimulus does not lead to an initial low level of caspase activation, which would disappear at a later time point, we analyzed caspase cleavage by Western blot in the first hours after stimulation (Fig. 1C). SKW6.4 cells (106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 1 ng/ml (threshold concentration) or with 100 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies. No processing products of procaspase-8, procaspase-3, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were observed upon stimulation with the threshold concentration of 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, upon stimulation with 100 ng/ml we observed cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, indicating triggering of the CD95-induced apoptosis. Thus, we reconfirmed the threshold concentration of anti-APO-1 (1 ng/ml) for SKW6.4 cells and further characterized the threshold behavior of these cells showing that caspases are not activated within the first hours after stimulation. The CD95 DISC Is Formed at Threshold Concentrations in Lower Amounts and c-FLIP Inhibits Caspase-8 Activation at the DISC upon Threshold Stimulation—Next, we tested the threshold mechanism at the DISC. Our model has made the following predictions for the mechanism of threshold behavior of CD95 signaling: lower amounts of CD95 DISCs, high c-FLIP recruitment to the DISC due to the highest affinity of c-FLIP to the DISC compared with other DED proteins (21Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and, consequently, inhibition of caspase-8 activation (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Our model suggested that upon threshold stimulation the CD95 DISC is formed, albeit in low amounts (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). So far we had not analyzed CD95 DISC formation and composition under threshold concentrations of anti-APO-1 antibodies. To address this issue we performed CD95 immunoprecipitations upon stimulations with 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). We used the same concentration of SKW6.4 cells (106 cells/ml) to strictly follow the threshold conditions for these cells established in Fig. 1 and Ref. 1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar. After stimulation the CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated by using only Protein A-Sepharose without the addition of anti-APO-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). Importantly, we observed that the CD95 DISC is indeed formed upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies. FADD, procaspase-8a/b, and c-FLIPL/R molecules were recruited to the DISC, albeit in lower amounts, as compared with the DISC formed upon stimulation with 100 ng/ml. As anticipated, we observed a prominent decrease of the receptors engaged in DISC formation upon stimulation from 100 to 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1. Thus, we confirmed the first statement of the model that the CD95 DISC is formed upon threshold concentrations of anti-APO-1, albeit in lower amounts (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Fig. 2B we also observed that the amount of c-FLIP recruited to the DISC was higher for stimulation with 1 ng/ml than with 100 ng/ml. This result confirms the next prediction of the threshold mechanism. Importantly, the processing of procaspase-8 at the DISC upon threshold concentrations also confirmed the model predictions (Fig. 2B). We observed that upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml procaspase-8 is processed only to p43/p41, indicating that processing of procaspase-8 is stopped after the first cleavage step. In contrast, for the stimulation with 100 ng/ml we also observed the generation of the p18 subunit, indicating that for the higher concentrations of anti-APO-1 the second cleavage step takes place and active caspase-8 is released into the cytosol to start the apoptotic signaling cascade. To rule out that under threshold stimulation of 1 ng/ml we immunoprecipitate low amounts of DISCs, which are spontaneously formed in the cells without stimulation, we performed immunoprecipitations from unstimulated cells with 1 and 10 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 (Fig. 2C). Procaspase-8 and c-FLIP were not associated to CD95 under these conditions. As the affinities of procaspase-8 and c-FLIP to the DISC are critical parameters for the decision making at the DISC, we compared the amounts of procaspase-8 and c-FLIP that were recruited to the DISC from corresponding lysates by quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 2D). For each molecule, e.g. procaspase-8 or c-FLIP, we measured their amounts at the DISC versus their amounts in the lysates. To prevent proteolytical processing of procaspase-8 to p26/p24, which is not detectable by anti-caspase-8 antibody directed against the C terminus of procaspase-8, we added pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Under these conditions we observed that the amount of c-FLIP at the DISC was eight times higher than the amount of c-FLIP in the lysates. The amount of procaspase-8 at the DISC was five times higher that the amount of procaspase-8 in the lysates. Thus, the affinity of c-FLIP to the DISC was roughly twice as high compared with that of procaspase-8. Thus, we showed that c-FLIP has a higher affinity to the DISC than procaspase-8. We could not compare the ratio of procaspase-8 to c-FLIP at the DISC due to the fact that we were using different antibodies. The question of stoichiometry of the DISC is a matter for future studies. Thus, we have confirmed our model predictions and show that at threshold stimulation c-FLIP is up-regulated at the DISC due to the high affinity of c-FLIP to the DISC, leading to the inhibition of caspase-8 activation and further downstream apoptotic events. Triggering of CD95 with Low Amounts of a CD95 Stimulus Does Not Result in Apoptosis but in MAP Kinase Activation—Next we analyzed whether stimulation of CD95 with threshold amounts of anti-APO-1 antibodies triggers reported survival pathways (15Zuliani C. Kleber S. Klussmann S. Wenger T. Kenzelmann M. Schreglmann N. Martinez A. Del Rio J.A. Soriano E. Vodrazka P. Kuner R. Groene H.J. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Martin-Villalba A.

We observed that stimulation of SKW6.4 cells with 100 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies resulted in activation of ERK and p38 (Fig. 3A). Importantly, this parallels procaspase-8 processing (Fig. 3A), resulting in cell death (Fig. 1). The stimulation with isotype control antibodies (FII23C) did not lead to MAPK activation (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment of SKW6.4 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit MAP kinase activation (Fig. 3C), indicating that CD95-mediated MAP kinase activation is caspase-independent. Interestingly, SKW6.4 cells are highly sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis; however, triggering of CD95 also leads to survival signaling apparently in parallel with death signaling. The decrease of concentrations of anti-APO-1 antibodies down to the threshold level (1 ng/ml) did not result in blockage of MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4A). However, we observed clear differences in the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation upon stimulation with different concentrations of anti-APO-1. Upon stimulation with high concentrations of anti-APO-1 pERK peaked earlier than for the stimulation with 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 antibodies. To address this issue in more detail we performed several new experiments of CD95-mediated pERK activation (Fig. 4B). We observed an increase in ERK phosphorylation for all concentrations used; however, the phosphorylation peaked at different time points in different experiments. This probably reflects the different initial status of ERK phosphorylation of the cells used for our experiments. To study whether threshold activation leads to engagement of other life pathways we looked at NF-κB activation, using as a readout the phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 4C). Indeed, we observed phosphorylation of IκBα upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1, even though the kinetics of phosphorylation were different from the ones when cells were stimulated with higher concentrations of anti-APO-1. To understand the physiological role of stimulations with low concentration of anti-APO-1 we performed proliferation assays in SKW6.4 cells upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml of anti-APO-1 (data not shown). However, we did not find a significant increase in proliferation rates in SKW6.4 cells. Because SKW6.4 are fast proliferating cancer cells it might be of advantage to establish a primary cell system to have a better readout of the increase in proliferation. This is a matter for future work. Thus, we observed that when cell death is blocked MAP kinase activation still takes place, indicating that triggering of CD95 with low concentrations of stimulus results only in survival signaling. In this study using the model predictions we address the question how initial events in CD95 signaling influence life/death decisions at the CD95. We showed that the initial concentration of CD95L and the concentration of the inhibitor of caspases c-FLIP are the most important factors contributing to the cellular decisions for CD95-induced life and death. We demonstrated that upon threshold stimulation 1) the CD95 DISC is formed, albeit in low amounts; 2) c-FLIP is quickly recruited to the DISC due to its high affinity to the DISC; and 3) c-FLIP inhibits caspase-8 activation by blocking the second step of procaspase-8 processing at the DISC, resulting only in the formation of p43/p41 subunits. We performed our study using only SKW6.4 cells and anti-APO-1 antibodies as we quantitatively characterized CD95-induced apoptosis in SKW6.4 cells in our previous work and experimentally determined the threshold concentration of anti-APO-1 antibodies in SKW6.4 cells (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This quantitative characterization allowed us to proceed directly to more detailed DISC analysis in the present study. The central molecule defining the threshold behavior in CD95-induced apoptosis is c-FLIP (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). c-FLIP has a dual function in CD95-mediated apoptosis. c-FLIPS/R is a devoted inhibitor of CD95-induced apoptosis, whereas c-FLIPL is described to play both pro- and anti-apoptotic roles (10Golks A.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). When present in the cells in low concentrations, c-FLIPL accelerates procaspase-8 activation at the DISC (21Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Upon high concentrations in the cells (e.g. overexpression conditions), c-FLIPL was reported to inhibit CD95-induced apoptosis (19Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The mechanism of c-FLIPL inhibition involves blocking the second step of procaspase-8 processing (19Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We observed that at threshold concentrations of anti-APO-1 procaspase-8 processing at the DISC is also stopped after the first cleavage step with the formation of p43/p41 subunits (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that inhibition of procaspase-8 processing at the DISC upon threshold stimulation is similar to the one seen when c-FLIP is up-regulated. Indeed, we observed that amount of c-FLIP at the DISC at threshold concentrations of anti-APO-1 is higher than the one for high concentrations of anti-APO-1 (Fig. 2B). This should lead to the inhibition of the second step of caspase-8 processing and, thereby, apoptosis (Fig. 5). In addition to inhibition of the second cleavage step of procaspase-8 at the “threshold” DISC, we also observed inhibition of the first cleavage step as judged by reduced amounts of p43/p41 (Fig. 2B). This might be explained by up-regulation of c-FLIPR at the threshold DISC blocking the first cleavage step. To get more insights into the mechanism of inhibition of procaspase-8 at the DISC upon threshold stimulation we compared the affinities of c-FLIP to procaspase-8 at the DISC (Fig. 2D). We found that affinity of c-FLIP is indeed higher than that of procaspase-8. This allows quick recruitment of c-FLIP to the DISC upon threshold stimulation in accordance with model predictions. Stimulation with low concentrations of anti-APO-1 antibodies can result in two scenarios. First, upon stimulation at the threshold concentration of anti-APO-1 caspase activity would be observed, however at a level low enough to not result in apoptosis. According to the second scenario caspase activation does not take place upon stimulation with threshold concentrations of anti-APO-1. The first scenario contradicts our mathematical modeling (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) as well as the experimental data (Fig. 1). The second scenario involves inhibition of caspase-8 activation at the DISC level. Furthermore, the second scenario was predicted by the model and confirmed by the original set of experimental data (1Bentele M. Lavrik I. Ulrich M. Stosser S. Heermann D.W. Kalthoff H. Krammer P.H. Eils R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study further confirm the model predictions, demonstrating in detail inhibition of caspase-8 activation at the DISC that consequently prevents the following apoptosis signaling cascade. To establish the functional relevance of stimulation with low concentrations of a CD95 stimulus we analyzed survival signaling, e.g. MAP kinase activation. Interestingly, we demonstrated that MAP kinase activation is not stopped upon threshold stimulation when death is blocked. These results go along with the fact that MAP kinase activation is not blocked by the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. This indicates that the mechanism of survival signaling via CD95 does not involve death components of the CD95 signaling pathway and caspase-8 activation. Transduction of the survival signal might occur via as yet uncharacterized proteins associated to the CD95. Our findings go along with the reports of survival signaling from CD95 in other cell types other than lymphocytes, e.g. primary neurons (15Zuliani C. Kleber S. Klussmann S. Wenger T. Kenzelmann M. Schreglmann N. Martinez A. Del Rio J.A. Soriano E. Vodrazka P. Kuner R. Groene H.J. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Martin-Villalba A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 13: 31-40Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In these cells the concentration of “death components” associated to the CD95 receptor might be lower than “survival components”, resulting in the preferential signaling of survival. Interestingly, our study also goes along with the findings that cells carrying heterozygous mutations in the CD95 DD are deficient in induction of apoptosis but can still efficiently activate the transcription factor NF-κB and the MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38 (23Legembre P. Barnhart B.C. Zheng L. Vijayan S. Straus S.E. Puck J. Dale J.K. Lenardo M. Peter M.E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on our studies we suggest the following model for CD95 signaling in CD95-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 5). At high doses of CD95 stimuli the CD95 DISC is formed and caspase-8 is activated, triggering the apoptotic cascade (Fig. 5, left). Survival signaling takes place in parallel; however, apparently it is not strong enough to prevent the cells from dying. At threshold concentrations c-FLIP molecules block caspase-8 activation at the DISC in accordance with the above described mechanism and survival signaling becomes the major event (Fig. 5, right). Understanding of the switch mechanisms between life and death of cells plays an important role in therapeutic intervention strategies in diseases that are associated with apoptosis. Thus, the detailed molecular mechanism of signal transduction for survival signaling from CD95 needs to be addressed further in future studies. It should also be noted that this study once again shows that mathematical modeling in combination with biochemical analysis is a powerful tool that allows a detailed characterization of complex signaling pathways.

They are distinct monofunctional enzymes in all eukaryotes and some bacteria but are fused into bifunctional enzymes known as proline utilization A (PutA) in other bacteria. Here we report the first structure and biochemical data for a monofunctional PRODH. The 2.0-Aå resolution structure of Thermus thermophilus PRODH reveals a distorted (βα)8 barrel catalytic core domain and a hydrophobic α-helical domain located above the carboxyl-terminal ends of the strands of the barrel. Although the catalytic core is similar to that of the PutA PRODH domain, the FAD conformation of T. thermophilus PRODH is remarkably different and likely reflects unique requirements for membrane association and communication with P5CDH. Also, the FAD of T. thermophilus PRODH is highly solvent-exposed compared with PutA due to a 4-Aå shift of helix 8. Structure-based sequence analysis of the PutA/PRODH family led us to identify nine conserved motifs involved in cofactor and substrate recognition. Biochemical studies show that the midpoint potential of the FAD is -75 mV and the kinetic parameters for proline are Km = 27 mm and kcat = 13 s-1. 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline was found to be an efficient substrate, and l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid is a competitive inhibitor (KI = 1.0 mm). Finally, we demonstrate that T. thermophilus PRODH reacts with O2 producing superoxide.

Oxidation of amino acids is a central part of energy metabolism. The oxidative pathway for proline consists of two enzymatic steps and an intervening nonenzymatic equilibrium (Scheme 1) (1Adams E.

The semialdehyde is oxidized in the second enzymatic step to glutamate. This 4-electron transformation of proline is common to all organisms, but the enzymes of proline catabolism differ widely among the three kingdoms of life. Amino acid sequence analysis shows that bacteria and eukaryotes share a common set of proline catabolic enzymes called proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH). Studies of the bacterial enzymes have shown that PRODH is an FAD-dependent enzyme with a (βα)8 barrel catalytic core (3Zhang M. White T.A. Schuermann J.P. Baban B.A. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J.

Biol. 2003; 10: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and P5CDH is an NAD+-dependent Rossmann fold enzyme featuring a nucleophilic Cys (5Inagaki E. Ohshima N. Takahashi H. Kuroishi C. Yokoyama S. Tahirov T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These enzymes are unrelated in sequence and structure to hyperthermophilic archaeal proline catabolic enzymes, which appear in unique hetero-tetrameric and hetero-octameric complexes (6Tsuge H. Kawakami R. Sakuraba H. Ago H. Miyano M. Aki K. Katunuma N. Ohshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31045-31049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An intriguing aspect of proline catabolism in eukaryotes and bacteria is that PRODH and P5CDH are separate enzymes in some organisms, whereas the two enzymes are fused in other organisms. The traditional view has been that PRODH and P5CDH appear as separate enzymes in eukaryotes and fused bifunctional enzymes known as proline utilization A (PutA) (7Menzel R. Roth J. J. Biol.

Jenkins J.L. Schuermann J.P. Zhou Y. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in bacteria. Fusion of enzymes catalyzing sequential steps of a metabolic pathway provides a kinetic advantage, because the intermediate can be channeled between active sites (16Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Indeed, Maloy's group reported kinetic data supporting substrate channeling for Salmonella typhimurium PutA (18Surber M.W. Maloy S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Eisenberg and coworkers (19Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Ng H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) refer to fused proteins, such as PutA, as Rosetta Stone proteins, because they decipher interactions between protein pairs. Thus, the Rosetta Stone hypothesis of protein evolution predicts that eukaryotic PRODH and P5CDH form physical and functional interactions. As we elaborate in this report, separate PRODH and P5CDH enzymes are not restricted to eukaryotes, but also appear in some bacteria. These bacterial monofunctional enzymes thus represent a new and unexplored group of enzymes. In addition, bacterial monofunctional PRODHs may serve as good models for understanding human PRODH. Moreover, the bacterial enzymes are convenient systems for studying protein-protein interactions and intermolecular channeling. To begin exploring these questions, we previously reported the cloning, isolation and crystallization of the monofunctional PRODH from Thermus thermophilus (TtPRODH) (20White T.A. Tanner J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure and kinetic characterization of this enzyme. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Se-Met TtPRODH—A 10-ml overnight culture grown in LB media was pelleted, and the LB medium was removed. The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of M9 media and diluted into 1.5 liters of M9 media. The culture was then grown to an optical density of 0.5 (λ = 600 nm). Methionine production was inhibited for 30 min as described previously (21Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) followed by induction of protein expression by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 12 h of induction at 22 °C with a shaking rate of 200 rpm, cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 at pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol, and frozen. Se-Met TtPRODH was purified using procedures described for purification of TtPRODH (20White T.A. Tanner J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), except for the following modifications. As observed for native TtPRODH, the pellet obtained after centrifugation of lysed cells was bright yellow, indicating that a significant amount of Se-Met TtPRODH was bound to the cell debris in addition to Se-Met TtPRODH in the supernatant. Therefore, the enzyme was extracted from the pellet by resuspending the pellet in 20 ml of 20 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation. The detergent extraction step was repeated once or twice until no additional TtPRODH was liberated. The extracted protein was then purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (20White T.A. Tanner J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Purified Se-Met TtPRODH was dialyzed overnight in the dark into 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm FAD, and 5% glycerol using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing (Spectrum Spectra/Por). After dialysis, the enzyme was passed through a 12-ml Sephadex G-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess FAD and then concentrated to 13 mg/ml using centrifugal concentrating devices (Amicon, Millipore). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford method (Pierce Coomassie Plus). Molecular masses of Se-Met and native TtPRODH obtained from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were 38208 ± 6 and 37968 ± 3 Da, respectively, which indicated 100% incorporation of Se-Met into all five Met positions of the TtPRODH polypeptide chain. Se-Met TtPRODH was crystallized using procedures described previously for native TtPRODH (20White T.A. Tanner J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, crystals were grown at room temperature in sitting drops by mixing equal volumes of the enzyme (2 μl) and reservoir (2 μl) solutions. The enzyme solution contained 2-3 mg/ml Se-Met TtPRODH and 20 mm of fresh n-octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside. The reservoir solution consisted of 100 mm imidazole (pH 7), 100 mm MgCl2, 17% MPD, and 5 mm DTT. The crystals typically appeared within 1 day after setup and grew to a maximum dimension of 0.2 mm. Crystals were prepared for cryogenic data collection by soaking in 100 mm imidazole (pH 7), 200 mm MgCl2, and 25% MPD, picked up with Hampton mounting loops, and plunged into liquid nitrogen. The space group is P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 82.1 Aå, b = 89.6 Aå, and c = 94.3 Aå. There are two protein molecules per asymmetric unit, with 46% solvent content and Matthews coefficient of 2.3 Aå3 Da-1 (22Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement— Data were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2 using a NOIR-1 charge-coupled device detector. The structure was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing using data collected at the energy corresponding to the experimentally determined maximum of f″. The data set used for structure determination and refinement consisted of 180 frames with a crystal-to-detector distance of 170 mm, oscillation range of 1°/frame, and exposure time of 30 s/frame. Integration and scaling were performed with d*TREK (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar).

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was used to identify a constellation of anomalous scattering centers, and the resulting single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phases were improved with solvent flattening in RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The partial chain trace from RESOLVE was used to determine the non-crystallographic symmetry transformation relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The RESOLVE phases were then improved with non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening in DM (25Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The DM phases were input to ARP/wARP for automated model building (26Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The model from ARP/wARP was improved with several rounds of model building in COOT followed by refinement against the Se-Met peak data set with REFMAC5 (27Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files for FAD were created using PRODRG (28van Aalten D.M. Bywater R. Findlay J.B. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and the Libcheck module of CCP4i (29Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The final model includes residues 5-296 of TtPRODH chain A and residues 1-294 of TtPRODH chain B. In addition, 6 residues of the N-terminal affinity tag were built for chain B (residues -5 to 0). The carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein are disordered with residues 297-307 and 295-307 omitted in chains A and B, respectively. The model also includes 1 FAD cofactor per TtPRODH chain, 272 water molecules, and 4 MPD molecules. See Table 1 for refinement statistics. Coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 2G37 (31Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar). PRODH Kinetic Characterization—TtPRODH was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20White T.A. Tanner J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was dialyzed into buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol at pH 8.0 and stored at 4 °C. PRODH activity was measured using the proline-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) oxidoreductase assay as described previously for PutAs (11Becker D.F. Thomas E.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4714-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One unit of PRODH activity is the quantity of enzyme that transfers electrons from 1 μmol of proline to DCPIP per minute at 25 °C. Steady-state kinetic parameters for l-proline were obtained using the DCPIP assay with proline as the variable substrate in the range of 0.1-100 mm. Three trials were performed for each proline concentration. The parameters Km and Vmax were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Origin software. Kinetic constants for an alternative substrate, 3,4-dehydro-l-proline, were determined similarly, with the substrate concentration varied in the range 3-500 μm. Inhibition by l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid (THFA), l-lactate, and l-mandelate were examined by steady-state inhibition kinetic measurements using proline as the variable substrate. Inhibition data were analyzed using the method of Dixon (32Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3269) Google Scholar). Thermostability was assessed by measuring PRODH activity as a function of incubation time at 90 °C. For this study, the enzyme was incubated in a water bath at 90 °C, and aliquots were removed at various time points and stored at 4 °C. After all of the aliquots were taken and cooled to 4 °C, activity assays were conducted at 25 °C in the presence of 25 mm proline. UV-visible Spectroscopy—Potentiometric titrations of TtPRODH were recorded at 20 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol using a three-electrode single compartment spectroelectrochemical cell as previously described (14Krishnan N. Becker D.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9130-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Stankovich M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Measurements were made under a nitrogen atmosphere in a Belle Technology glove box. All potential values are reported versus the normal hydrogen electrode. Methyl viologen (20 μm) was used as a mediator dye, and pyocyanine (5 μm) and indigo disulfonate (3 μm) were used as indicator dyes. The UV-visible spectra in each experiment were recorded for λ = 300-700 nm on a Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Clean spectra of TtPRODH were obtained by subtracting the spectra of the dyes in the absence of protein measured under identical conditions. The reduction potential (Em) and n values were calculated by linear regression of a Nernst plot of the data. TtPRODH was also titrated with proline under aerobic conditions in the proline concentration range 0-160 mm.At each proline concentration, the absorbance spectrum was acquired after incubating the enzyme (56 μm) for 5 min with proline. The absorbance values at λ = 450 nm were analyzed as previously described (11Becker D.F. Thomas E.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4714-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Brown E.D. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8972-8979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain an apparent equilibrium constant for the formation of a reduced enzyme-P5C complex (Reaction 1). TtPRODHox+proline↔TtPRODHred-P5CReaction 1 Proline:O2 Reactivity and Generation of ROS—The rate of proline:O2 activity was determined by monitoring the appearance of P5C as a function of proline concentration in the absence of an artificial electron acceptor. P5C was detected as the yellow dihydroquinazolinium complex with o-aminobenzaldehyde (o-AB) by monitoring absorbance at λ = 443 nm (ɛ = 2900 m-1cm-1) (35Mezl V.A. Knox W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The assay mixture included 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 20 μg of TtPRODH, 4 mm o-AB, and 0.5-25 mm proline. The reaction was monitored for 15 min, and data from the 5- to 10-min time period were used for rate calculations. One unit of proline:O2 activity is defined as the amount of TtPRODH that generates 1 μmol of P5C per minute at 25 °C. Production of superoxide by TtPRODH was studied by measuring reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (36Tarpey M.M. Fridovich I. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome c was indicated by an increase in absorbance at λ = 550 nm. For these assays, the l-proline concentration was 50 mm, and the concentrations of cytochrome c and TtPRODH were 0.02 mg/ml each. Production of H2O2 by TtPRODH (0.02 mg/ml) was measured using the Amplex Red H2O2/peroxidase assay kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and a standard curve obtained from solutions of known H2O2 concentration. Bioinformatics Analysis of the Bacterial PutA/PRODH Family—Multiple sequence alignment calculations of PutA PRODH domains and bacterial monofunctional PRODHs were performed with ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The data set of sequences used for these calculations was obtained from the Protein Information Resource using the Related Sequences tool with TtPRODH as the query sequence. A total of 287 homologs of TtPRODH were identified. Overall Fold—The TtPRODH structure was determined at 2.0-Aå resolution using Se-Met single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing (Table 1). There are two protein chains in the asymmetric unit, labeled A and B, and 1 FAD cofactor bound to each protein (Fig. 1A). The structure reveals a distorted (βα)8 barrel fold. The first strand of the barrel (β1) is preceded by 4 α-helices denoted αA, αB, αC, and α0 (Fig. 1A, the right side provides the best view). The major distortion of the TtPRODH barrel from the classic triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel concerns the placement of α8. Helix α0 packs against β1 thus occupying the location reserved for α8 in the classic TIM barrel. Consequently, α8 of TtPRODH is located above the carboxyl-terminal face of the β-barrel rather than alongside the β-barrel as in the classic TIM structure. The FAD cofactor of TtPRODH is bound at the carboxyl ends of the strands of the barrel (Fig. 1A). The re face of the isoalloxazine packs tightly against strands 4-6, whereas the si face opens to the substrate binding pocket and is available for hydride transfer from the substrate proline. Helices A-C and 8 form a small domain above the carboxyl-terminal face of the β-barrel (Fig. 1A, the right side provides the best view). Helices A and B form a right angle, as do helices B and C. Helix 8 fits into the cleft formed by helices A-C. These four helices pack together to form a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch (Fig. 1, B and C). The patch has a pronounced hole in the middle (Fig. 1C). Several hydrophobic side chains form the rim of the hole and line its sides, whereas the hydroxyl groups of Thr287 and Tyr283 form the bottom of the hole (Fig. 1, B and C). If TtPRODH interacts with T. thermophilus P5CDH (TtP5CDH), then the function of the hydrophobic patch may be to serve as a docking interface for TtP5CDH. The patch presents a concave hydrophobic surface to solvent (Fig. 1C), and thus it is tempting to speculate that this patch mates with a complementary convex surface of TtP5CDH. Involvement of this patch in interaction with TtP5CDH also makes sense for substrate channeling, because the patch is close to the TtPRODH active site. The pair of molecules chosen for the asymmetric unit corresponds to the largest interface in the crystal lattice, which buries 992 Aå2 of surface area. The two molecules interact primarily through the packing of α5 (residues 200-218) of one chain against α5 and α6 (residues 228-242) of the other chain (Fig. 1A). The orientation of the two molecules is such that the α5 helices form an angle of 50°. The interface has four intermolecular ion pairs (Lys213-Glu207 and Arg230-Asp200) and four intermolecular hydrogen bonds (His210-His210 and Tyr238-Glu170). Several hydrophobic side chains are also buried in the interface: Phe198, Leu203, Leu209, and Leu214. The significance of this interface is unclear at this time. It is not the one typically found in dimeric TIM, nor is it similar to the tetramer interface of archaeal TIMs (38Walden H. Bell G.S. Russell R.J. Siebers B. Hensel R. Taylor G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The classic TIM dimer interface involves loops 1-4 (38Walden H. Bell G.S. Russell R.J. Siebers B. Hensel R. Taylor G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and buries ∼1500 Aå2 of surface area, which is 50% larger than the TtPRODH interface. Analysis of detergent-solubilized TtPRODH with dynamic light scattering and gel filtration suggests the presence of apparent monomeric and dimeric species. It is possible that the pair of proteins in the asymmetric unit represents the dimeric species observed in solution; however, it is also possible that this interface is an artifact of crystallization. An additional complicating factor in assessing the biological relevance of this interface is the possibility that TtPRODH interacts with TtP5CDH. The TtPRODH structure is only the second PRODH structure solved to date, with the first being the PRODH domain of E. coli PutA (PutA86-669, PDB code 1TIW) (3Zhang M. White T.A. Schuermann J.P. Baban B.A. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12539-12548Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Lee Y.H. Nadaraia S. Gu D. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Residues 263-561 of PutA form a distorted TIM barrel that is similar to that of TtPRODH (Fig. 2A). Within this catalytic core, the sequence identity between the two enzymes is 29%, and the root mean square deviation for Cα atoms is 1.7 Aå for 243 aligned residues. Also, the general location of the FAD at the carboxyl-terminal tips of the strands is similar in the two structures. The major topological difference between the TtPRODH and the PutA86-669 barrels is an extra α-helix that appears in PutA86-669 but is absent in TtPRODH. Residues 437-449 of PutA form an α-helix (α5a in Fig. 2A) that is replaced by a 5-residue loop in TtPRODH (residues 190-195). As discussed in the next section, this topological difference has a dramatic effect on FAD conformation. FAD Conformation—Over a dozen residues interact with the FAD either through electrostatic or non-polar interactions. Electrostatic interactions with the FAD are shown in Fig. 3. The five hydrogen bonds to the isoalloxazine in TtPRODH are also present in PutA86-669 structures. Accordingly, the positioning of the isoalloxazine within the barrel is similar in TtPRODH and PutA86-669. Surprisingly, the FAD conformations of the two enzymes are dramatically different (Fig. 4). In TtPRODH the adenosine is under the dimethyl benzene ring of the isoalloxazine (Fig. 4A), whereas in PutA86-669 the adenosine is below the pyrimidine ring of the isoalloxazine (Fig. 4B). The difference is dramatic. When superimposed, the adenine groups of the two cofactors are separated by 13 Aå (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the"

In vivo, Vps75 is associated with the chromatin of both active and inactive genes and telomeres. Others have previously reported that Vps75 forms a complex with Rtt109, required for acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3 Lys-56). Cells lacking RTT109 are sensitive to hydroxyurea, pointing to a role in replication. We show that VPS75 is not required for H3 Lys-56 acetylation and that vps75Δ cells are insensitive to hydroxyurea, suggesting that although Rtt109 and Vps75 associate and are likely to be functionally connected, they also have separate roles.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is present in a highly compacted form called chromatin. The repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, formed from two histone H2A-H2B dimers and one histone H3-H4 tetramer around which 147 bp of DNA is wrapped (1Kornberg R.D.

Despite the tight packaging of its structure, chromatin is highly dynamic, a characteristic that is vital in regulating nuclear processes, such as transcription and replication, which require access to DNA. Processes that positively influence chromatin fluidity include post-translational modifications of histones, incorporation of histone variants, and histone exchange by dedicated histone chaperones (for review, see Ref. 2Luger K. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Histone chaperones are proteins that regulate the interaction of histones with other proteins and DNA and also act to prevent the highly basic histones from forming inappropriate complexes. In addition to playing an important role in histone exchange during nuclear processes, histone chaperones function in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of histones, histone storage, nucleosome assembly, and as a link between chromatin remodeling factors and histones (for reviews, see Refs. 3Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and 4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the diversity of these roles, it is not surprising that many different histone chaperones have been identified, including nucleoplasmin, ASF1, HIR proteins, Spt6, FACT, ACF, CAF1, and NAP1. Members of the NAP 2The abbreviations used are: NAP, nucleosome assembly protein; yNAP1, yeast NAP1; HTM, His8-TEV2-Myc9; TEV, tobacco etch virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; NES, nuclear export signal; AD, accessory domain. family of proteins, found from yeast to mammals, possess particularly diverse roles in histone metabolism (4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by a conserved central domain (the NAP domain), a non-conserved N-terminal region of variable length, and in general, a highly acidic C-terminal region. The NAP domain is required and sufficient for histone binding, although the acidic domain may enhance this activity (5Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized member of the NAP family is NAP1, which has been found in yeast, plants, flies, and mammals. Other NAPs include SET (also known as TAF-Iβ), ClNAP, TSPY, and a steadily expanding group of NAP1-like proteins (NAP1L1–NAP1L5) (4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel NAP family member from yeast. This protein, Vps75, was previously identified in genomic screens for vacuolar protein sorting genes and for factors that affect telomere length (6Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 7Bonangelino C.J. Chavez E.M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2486-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Vps75 is a bona fide histone chaperone with a preference for H3-H4 tetramers and that it may have a general role in chromatin assembly and rearrangement since it is found in both transcribed and non-transcribed regions in vivo. Yeast Manipulation—The following strains (genotype) were used for genetic experiments: W303A (MATa leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 can1-1); vps75Δ (as W303A, but vps75Δ::LEU2); BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0); and rtt109Δ and asf1Δ (as BY4741 but rtt109Δ::KANMX or asf1Δ::KANMX). The strain expressing C-terminal His8-TEV2-Myc9 (HTM)-tagged Vps75 had a wild-type phenotype. Details of affinity tagging are available on request. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—To purify Vps75 from yeast, HTM-tagged Vps75 cells were harvested, resuspended in an equal volume (w/v) of lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 250 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors), and lysed using a freezer mill. Lysate was clarified at 12,000 × g for 10 min and again in an ultracentrifuge using a Beckman Ti45 rotor (40,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated with 9E10 affinity resin for 90 min at 4 °C, and the resin was washed with 40 bed volumes lysis buffer and 10 volumes elution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol). Vps75-His was eluted twice by incubating with 1 volume elution buffer containing 40 μg of TEV protease for 2 h at 12 °C and further purified by MonoQ chromatography. GST-Vps75 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells from pGEX-6P-1 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose using standard techniques. Histone expression vectors were a kind gift from Brad Cairns. Individual yeast histones were purified from E. coli, and histone complexes (H2A-H2B dimers, H3-H4 tetramers, and octamers) were prepared as described (8Wittmeyer J. Saha A. Cairns B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 322-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HeLa core histones used in nucleosome assembly assays were prepared as described (9Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight using an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer. Binding Reactions and GST Pull-down Assays—To assess Vps75 binding to core histones, 9 pmol of Vps75-His purified from yeast was incubated with 20 μl of core histones immobilized on 4% agarose (Sigma H3889) or empty 4% agarose for 2 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 mm NaCl. Resin was washed in buffer A, and bound protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody to the His tag (Sigma). GST pull-down assays were done by incubating GST-Vps75 (or GST) and yeast histone complexes with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 250 μl of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl for 3 h at 10 °C. After extensive washing, bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Nucleosome Assembly Assays—Vps75 nucleosome assembly activity was measured essentially as described (5Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 60 fmol of pRS316 plasmid was relaxed by incubation with 3 units of calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen) in assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C. HeLa core histones (0.5–2 pmol) and Vps75 (from yeast; 4.5–18 pmol) were preincubated in assay buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were then mixed with 60 fmol of the relaxed pRS316 and further incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described (7Bonangelino C.J. Chavez E.M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2486-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Histone Association and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Qualitative histone association assays were carried out as described (10Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for the C terminus of histone H3 (a kind gift of Alain Verreault), and Vps75 was detected using a monoclonal antibody (9E10) directed against the Myc tag. ChIP assays were carried out essentially as described (11Kristjuhan A. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but with minor modifications; DNA co-precipitated with 9E10 was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using a Bio-Rad MyIQ iCycler in standard conditions and ABsolute™ QPCR SYBR Green reagents (ABgene). Primer sequences are available on request. Immunoprecipitation efficiency was determined by dividing the amount of precipitated DNA by the amount in the input sample. Growth Sensitivity Assays—The effect of hydroxyurea on growth was tested as described (12Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of Vps75—Although several NAP family members have been described in human and mouse cells, only one, NAP1, has been identified in yeast. However, homology searches revealed that yeast contains at least one other likely NAP protein, Vps75. A BLAST query of the Vps75 protein sequence indicated that a region encompassing amino acids 12–229 shares homology with the NAP domain. The structure of the NAP domain of yeast NAP1 (yNAP1) at 3.0 Å resolution was recently solved (13Park Y.J. Luger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It comprises two distinct domains (I and II), each of which can be further delineated into two subdomains (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment of Vps75 with various other NAP family members revealed that it is more closely related to the Drosophila and human SET/TAF-I and human TSPY proteins than yNAP1 (data not shown). This is supported by analysis of its domain architecture (Fig. 1A). Like SET and TSPY, Vps75 completely lacks subdomain B, termed the accessory domain (AD; shown in yellow in yNAP1). The AD has been implicated in regulating access to a functional nuclear export signal (NES; shown as a blue/white stripe) embedded in A (shown in blue) (13Park Y.J. Luger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Vps75, SET, and TSPY also lack a recognizable NES (data not shown), suggesting an evolutionary link between the conservation of the NES and the AD and supporting the idea that this domain plays a role in regulating access to the NES. These observations raise the possibility that unlike yNAP1 (14Mosammaparast N. Ewart C.S. Pemberton L.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6527-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), Vps75 does not function in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of histones but possesses a primarily nuclear role. This theory is consistent with the observations that Vps75 is found in the nucleus (15Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar) and that it lacks the phosphorylation sites implicated in translocation of Drosophila NAP1 between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (16Li M. Strand D. Krehan A. Pyerin W. Heid H. Neumann B. Mechler B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1067-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to the apparent differences observed between NAP domain I of Vps75 and yNAP1, domain II appears to be structurally conserved, apart from a small acidic region found near the start of subdomain D in yNAP1 that is lacking in Vps75. However, Vps75 contains a highly acidic region near its C terminus (Fig. 1A), a characteristic of most NAP family proteins, and has a theoretical pI of 4.47, which is also similar to other members of the family. Purification of Vps75—To experimentally address the possibility that Vps75 is a NAP family histone chaperone, we created a yeast strain expressing Vps75 tagged at the C terminus with HTM from the endogenous VPS75 promoter. Crude extract was passed over a 9E10 (anti-Myc) affinity column, and Vps75-His was eluted by TEV-mediated cleavage (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Co-purifying proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and included Ssb1, Rtt109, and Rlp24. These proteins were previously found to interact with Vps75 in a global screen of yeast protein complexes (17Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P. Punna T. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Shales M. Zhang X. Davey M. Robinson M.D. Paccanaro A. Bray J.E. Sheung A. Beattie B. Richards D.P. Canadien V. Lalev A. Mena F. Wong P. Starostine A. Canete M.M. Vlasblom J. Wu S. Orsi C. Collins S.R. Chandran S. Haw R. Rilstone J.J. Gandi K. Thompson N.J. Musso G. St Onge P. Ghanny S. Lam M.H. Butland G. Altaf-Ul A.M. Kanaya S. Shilatifard A. O'Shea E. Weissman J.S. Ingles C.J. Hughes T.R. Parkinson J. Gerstein M. Wodak S.J. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). Using anion-exchange chromatography, we were subsequently able to purify Vps75 to virtual homogeneity (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The absence of co-purifying proteins after MonoQ chromatography could indicate that these were contaminants and not truly associated with Vps75 in vivo. However, Vps75 interacts strongly with Q-Sepharose, and weakly associated proteins might be displaced by washing. As such, it is possible that at least Rtt109 exists in a complex with Vps75 in physiological salt conditions. Supporting this idea, Krogan et al. (17Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P. Punna T. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Shales M. Zhang X. Davey M. Robinson M.D. Paccanaro A. Bray J.E. Sheung A. Beattie B. Richards D.P. Canadien V. Lalev A. Mena F. Wong P. Starostine A. Canete M.M. Vlasblom J. Wu S. Orsi C. Collins S.R. Chandran S. Haw R. Rilstone J.J. Gandi K. Thompson N.J. Musso G. St Onge P. Ghanny S. Lam M.H. Butland G. Altaf-Ul A.M. Kanaya S. Shilatifard A. O'Shea E. Weissman J.S. Ingles C.J. Hughes T.R. Parkinson J. Gerstein M. Wodak S.J. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) found a stoichiometric complex of Vps75 and Rtt109 when either protein was purified by tandem affinity purification. Our own efforts indicate that Vps75 and Rtt109 form a complex that can be dissociated by high salt concentrations during isolation (data not shown). Vps75 Preferentially Binds H3-H4 Tetramers in Vitro—The defining feature of a histone chaperone is its ability to bind histones. To determine whether Vps75 possesses such an activity, we incubated it with resin-immobilized core histones. Vps75-His bound efficiently to this matrix but not to the control matrix lacking histones (Fig. 2A). A number of histone chaperones exhibit preferential binding to either H3-H4 tetramers (H3-H4)2 or H2A-H2B dimers (H2A-H2B) (3Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To determine the binding preference of Vps75, the interaction of GST-Vps75 with H3-H4 tetramers (H3-H4)2 or H2A-H2B dimers was analyzed using a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2B). GST-Vps75 isolated from E. coli bound efficiently to (H3-H4)2 tetramers (lanes 4–6) but exhibited only weak binding to (H2A-H2B) complexes (lanes 1–3) under the conditions used in this experiment. This was clearly evident when the different nucleosome subcomplexes were mixed prior to incubation with Vps75 (lanes 7–9). Nucleosome Assembly Activity of Vps75—A number of NAP family members are capable of assembling chromatin on naked DNA in vitro (4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid supercoiling assay, which measures the assembly activity on the basis of the introduction of negative supercoils into a relaxed DNA template (18Nelson T. Hsieh T.S. Brutlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was used to test whether Vps75 also possesses such activity. Vps75-His introduced negative supercoils on plasmid DNA, an effect that was dose-dependent (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5) and that required histones (lanes 7–9). This is indicative of nucleosome assembly and suggests that Vps75 may function in chromatin dynamics in vivo. Association of Vps75 with Chromatin in Vivo—To determine whether Vps75 associates with histones and/or chromatin in vivo, we first utilized a histone association assay (10Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes in yeast cells producing HTM-tagged Vps75 were cross-linked by formaldehyde treatment, and the resulting chromatin was sheared by extensive sonication to yield pieces averaging 500 bp in length. Immunoprecipitation with a histone H3-specific antibody was carried out, and following reversal of the cross-links, co-precipitated Vps75 was detected by immunoblotting. A proportion of cellular Vps75 was indeed found to be associated with histone H3 (Fig. 3A). In theory, this association could be mediated by DNA or via a direct interaction between Vps75 and histone H3. Because of the resistance of cross-linked chromatin to nuclease treatment (10Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we were unable to distinguish between these possibilities. Furthermore, this assay was unable to reveal whether Vps75 is associated with histones in chromatin or with free histones in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. To try and gain a more complete understanding of the putative interaction between Vps75 and chromatin, we carried out ChIP experiments. Vps75 was detectable at the promoter and within the body of a repressed gene, GAL10, and an active housekeeping gene, YEF3. It was also present in the middle of two other constitutive genes tested (the highly expressed FBA1 and the lowly expressed MRS5 genes) and at an open reading frame-free region at the telomere of chromosome VI, TEL6R (Fig. 3B). Vps75 Is Not Required for Histone 3 Lysine 56 Acetylation—A recent study demonstrated that Rtt109 is required for acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 56 (H3 Lys-56) in yeast (12Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Given that Vps75 co-purifies with Rtt109 and that it binds histones in vitro, we analyzed H3 Lys-56 acetylation in a vps75Δ strain. In contrast to strains lacking RTT109 or ASF1, H3 Lys-56 acetylation could still clearly be detected in vps75Δ (Fig. 4A). In addition, the vps75Δ strain showed no sensitivity to hydroxyurea, a drug that can be used as an indicator for defects in H3 Lys-56 acetylation (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggest that Vps75 is not required for H3 Lys-56 acetylation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it is involved in regulating this histone mark at a subset of regions in the genome. In this report, the identification and characterization of a new NAP family member from yeast, Vps75, is described. Using a GST pull-down assay, we demonstrated that Vps75 has a preference for (H3-H4)2 tetramers over (H2A-H2B) dimers. Chromatin assembly occurs by a two-step process in which a tetramer is deposited first followed by two dimers, and it is generally thought that different histone chaperones catalyze each step (4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments suggest that Vps75 belongs to the H3/H4 family of histone chaperones. This contrasts with many in vivo and in vitro studies that have generally described NAP family members as chaperones for H2A and H2B (for review, see Ref. 4Park Y.J. Luger K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a recent study reported that yNAP1 preferentially binds (H3-H4)2 tetramers in vitro (19McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44574-44583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We are currently conducting further experiments to elucidate the histone preference of Vps75 in vivo. Using ChIP, we found Vps75 at all genomic regions tested. Our data suggest that the presence of Vps75 is not strictly correlated with transcription since we detected it at a repressed gene (GAL10) and at high levels at the telomere of chromosome VI. It is important to point out, however, that a role in transcription cannot be ruled out on the basis of these experiments. However, the fact that Vps75 is detected at telomeres is particularly interesting in light of the finding that vps75Δ mutants display shortened telomeres (6Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, our data might suggest a role for Vps75 in assembly or maintenance of telomere chromatin. It is clear, however, that more work needs to be done to define a role for Vps75 in specific chromatin-related processes. We and others have found that Vps75 co-purifies with Rtt109, a protein recently implicated in H3 Lys-56 acetylation, and thus processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcription (12Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 21Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence from our work indicate that Vps75 is not required for deposition of this histone mark. First, a vps75Δ strain did not exhibit the dramatic reduction in bulk 43 Lys-56 acetylation observed in rtt109Δ and asf1Δ. Second, the vps75Δ strain was also not sensitive to hydroxyurea, which is toxic to strains with defects in H3 Lys-56 acetylation. Preliminary ChIP experiments with vps75Δ cells have also failed to uncover significant differences in the level of histone H3 Lys-56 acetylation in chromatin (data not shown). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Vps75 is important for H3 Lys-56 acetylation at a certain subset of genes or genomic locations, it is equally plausible that the Vps75/Rtt109 complex possesses a distinct function. One possibility is that Rtt109 modulates the interaction of Vps75 with histones, thereby serving to regulate the chromatin assembly/disassembly activity of Vps75. Rtt109 is a positively charged protein (theoretical pI 9.41) with some highly basic regions, which could conceivably compete with histones for binding to the acidic Vps75 protein. This is presently under investigation. In conclusion, we describe here the identification of Vps75 as a new member of the NAP domain family. This information should prove useful in unraveling the complexities of histone metabolism and important associated processes, such as DNA replication and transcription. We thank Alain Verreault and Brad Cairns for generous gifts of antibody and plasmids, respectively.

We now report that EGLN3 levels increase during C2C12 skeletal myoblast differentiation. EGLN3 small interference RNAs and EGLN3 antisense oligonucleotides blocked C2C12 differentiation and decreased levels of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family of myogenic regulatory factors, which plays a critical role in myogenic differentiation. We also report that EGLN3 interacts with and stabilizes myogenin protein, whereas VHL associates with and destabilizes myogenin via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The effect of VHL on myogenin stability and ubiquitination can be reversed, at least in part, by overexpression of EGLN3, suggesting that its binding to myogenin may prevent VHL-mediated degradation. These data demonstrate a novel role for EGLN3 in regulating skeletal muscle differentiation and gene expression. In addition, this report provides evidence for a novel pathway that regulates myogenin expression and skeletal muscle differentiation.

In addition to regulating cellular response to oxygen availability, EGLN3 appears to play a role in cellular homeostasis. p53-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in RAS-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts is associated with up-regulation of EGLN3 (11Madden S.L.

Butzmann U. Freeman R.S. Stahl R.A. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1305-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that EGLN3 is expressed in adult skeletal muscle and is induced during differentiation of mouse C2C12 skeletal myoblasts; in contrast, EGLN1 and -2 are constitutively expressed in C2C12 (19Lieb M.E. Menzies K. Moschella M.C. Ni R. Taubman M.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). EGLN3 is also developmentally regulated in skeletal muscle (20Moschella M.C. Menzies K. Tsao L. Lieb M.A. Kohtz J.D. Kohtz D.S. Taubman M.B. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). EGLN3 staining is first observed at E8.5 in the dermomyotomal cells of the rostral somites, and its expression progresses is in a rostral to caudal pattern, with highest levels seen in the muscle primordial and mature muscles. These studies prompted us to consider the possibility that EGLN3 might be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation. The formation of skeletal muscle is mainly orchestrated by a family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), including MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4 (21Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 22Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A wide array of proteins can interact with and regulate the myogenic potential of these MRFs. We now show that EGLN3 regulates differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and enhances levels of myogenin, a critical determinant of skeletal muscle differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that EGLN3 is a novel binding partner for myogenin and that it antagonizes VHL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the myogenin protein. These studies suggest that EGLN3 plays an important role in mediating skeletal muscle differentiation. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies included anti-EGLN3 (Novus), anti-myogenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-troponin T (Sigma), anti-VHL (BD Pharmingen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc (Sigma), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Santa Cruz), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), anti-lamin A/C (Cell Signaling), and anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitors were supplied by Sigma and Roche Applied Science. Expression Constructs—The PCR-amplified full-length EGLN3 coding sequence with or without a C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The mouse myogenin expression vector was a gift from Dr. R. Mech. The GST-tagged myogenin expression vector was provided by Dr. S. Burden. Wild-type and mutant VHL expression plasmids were obtained from M. Schoell. Wild-type and mutant ubiquitin expression plasmids were supplied by Dr. Y. Jin. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Murine C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (growth medium). To induce myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts at ∼70–90% confluency were shifted from growth medium into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum and antibiotics (differentiation medium). Cells were transiently transfected with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs and Antisense Oligonucleotide—Nucleotides corresponding to bases 359–377 and 621–640 of the mouse EGLN3 coding region were chosen as targeting sequences for siRNAs. SMARTpool EGLN3 siRNA and VHL siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. Control nontargeting siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon and Ambion. siRNAs were transfected into cells by using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Nucleotides corresponding to bases 10–29, 273–286, and 709–730 of the mouse EGLN3 coding region were chosen as the targeting sequences for antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense and corresponding sense oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen and directly applied to C2C12 cells. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and utilized to synthesize the first strand cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). To obtain the complete open reading frame of mouse EGLN3, PCR amplification was conducted using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 1 cycle (94 °C for 2 min), 30 cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s), and 1 cycle (72 °C for 10 min). To examine the expression of myogenin and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in differentiated C2C12 cells, RT-PCR was conducted using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Eppendorf) under the following conditions: 1 cycle (52 °C for 50 min), 1 cycle (94 °C for 2 min), 22 cycles (94 °C for 22 s, 60 °C for 22 s, and 68 °C for 50 s), and 1 cycle (72 °C for 10 min). Reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction as a control. Primer sequences are available on request. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Agarose gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose were performed as previously described (2Wax S.D. Rosenfield C.L. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13041-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization of 32P-labeled probes was conducted at 68 °C by using a Quick-Hyb™ hybridization mixture (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading of lanes was verified by staining the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA with ethidium bromide. Cellular Fractionation—All fractionation and centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. C2C12 cells grown in differentiation medium were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction. The pellet, containing the nuclei, was washed with PBS and then resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 10 min on ice, centrifuged, and collected the supernatant (nuclear fraction). The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were analyzed using Western blot. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in Triton X-100-based lysis buffer or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The whole cell lysates were clarified, and the soluble fractions were recovered and quantified using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, precleared lysates (∼300–500 μg of extracts) were incubated with specific antibody, or as a negative control normal mouse or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The incubation was continued for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. After extensive washing with lysis buffer as described above, the immunoprecipitated materials were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 25% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), heated for 5 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gel, Life Therapeutics), and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays—Expression and purification of the myogenin GST fusion protein (GST-myogenin) was conducted as described previously (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST alone or the fusion protein was immobilized on a glutathione resin that had been preblocked in PBS containing 0.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and incubated 4 h at 4 °C with the precleared cell lysates from transfected HEK 293 cells (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the complex was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, run on 12% polyacrylamide gels, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, or detected by Western blotting. Myogenin Decay Assays—HEK 293 cells transfected with expression vectors (as indicated in results), were exposed to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (30 μg/ml final concentration). At the times indicated, total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using an antibody to myogenin. The blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-β-actin antibody to confirm the equal protein loading. Gels were scanned and densitometry, employing a 256 grayscale, was performed using Image 2.0 software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The density of the myogenin band was normalized to β-actin and expressed as a percentage of the density measured at time 0. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. Ubiquitinylation Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding myogenin, His-tagged ubiquitin, and VHL and then lysed in 6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 8). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were added to the lysates, and the mixture was incubated with rotation at room temperature for 4 h. The beads were successively washed and eluted as described previously (24Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The eluate was subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-myogenin antibody. A ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with the plasmids as indicated. Cells were harvested in the Triton-based lysis buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-myogenin antibody, followed by the Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 5–10 min at room temperature, and then blocked in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with an anti-MF20 monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 4 °C overnight (to stain myosin heavy chain, a differentiation marker) followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml). At least 800 nuclei were countered from several random fields. The fusion index was calculated as follows: (the number of nuclei within MF20-positive myocytes containing three or more nuclei/total number of nuclei analyzed) × 100. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. EGLN3 Is Up-regulated during C2C12 Mouse Skeletal Muscle Cell Differentiation—Mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts have been widely used as an in vitro model to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle differentiation (25Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To examine the profile of EGLN3 expression during C2C12 differentiation, we first conducted Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGLN3 mRNA was up-regulated as early as 24 h after C2C12 cells were grown in differentiation medium to induce cell differentiation, as judged by troponin I, a biochemical marker of skeletal muscle differentiation. This finding is consistent with our previous report (19Lieb M.E. Menzies K. Moschella M.C. Ni R. Taubman M.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGLN3 protein is increased upon cell differentiation, extracts from C2C12 myoblasts shifted from growth medium to differentiation medium were analyzed on Western blots. As shown in Fig. 1B, EGLN3 protein was increased during differentiation as assessed by myogenin, an early biochemical marker of skeletal muscle differentiation (26Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 27Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 28Sassoon D. Lyons G. Wright W.E. Lin V. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Buckingham M. Nature. 1989; 341: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). EGLN3 Positively Regulates Gene Expression and Differentiation of Skeletal Muscle—To determine the role of EGLN3 in regulation of gene expression and differentiation of skeletal muscle, an expression vector encoding EGLN3 was introduced into C2C12 cells. These cells displayed elevated levels of EGLN3 expression (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of EGLN3 led to a considerable increase in the expression of myogenin and, to a lesser extent, troponin T (Fig. 2A), another differentiation marker and a downstream target of myogenin (29Mullen A.J. Barton P.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Wilson E.M. Tureckova J. Rotwein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpressing EGLN3 promoted earlier differentiation as evidenced by induction of more and larger myotubes at 48 h (Fig. 2C). To ascertain the role of endogenous EGLN3 in regulating myogenin expression and differentiation, siRNAs specific for EGLN3 and control siRNAs were transfected into C2C12 cells. EGLN3 siRNAs efficiently decreased EGLN3 and myogenin expression (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, treatment of cells with EGLN3 siRNA led to impairment of differentiation (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the fusion index revealed that treatment of C2C12 cells with EGLN3 siRNA resulted in a marked reduction in fusion capacity (Fig. 2E). In addition, an EGLN3-antisense oligonucleotide markedly diminished C2C12 cell differentiation, whereas no effect was seen with a sense oligonucleotide (Fig. 2F). Identical results were achieved with two additional antisense oligonucleotides (data not shown). EGLN3 Interacts with and Stabilizes Myogenin—Because EGLN3 is known to interact with several proteins, we examined whether EGLN3 associated with myogenin. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding myogenin and/or FLAG-tagged EGLN3. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Ab) or mouse IgG (as a control), followed by immunoblotting with an anti-myogenin Ab. Myogenin was present in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates but was absent from the control precipitates (Fig. 3A). Identical results were achieved with HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells (data not shown). To further examine this interaction, myogenin with a GST tag at its N terminus (GST-myogenin) was bacterially expressed and purified. A GST pulldown assay was then performed by incubation of the GST-myogenin fusion protein or GST alone (as a control) with extracts derived from HEK 293 cells expressing EGLN3. As shown in Fig. 3B, EGLN3 was retrieved by the GST-myogenin fusion protein, but not by GST alone, suggesting that EGLN3 specifically interacts with myogenin. To determine whether endogenous EGLN3 and myogenin can interact, extracts from C2C12 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-myogenin Ab and then immunoblotted with anti-EGLN3 Ab. As shown in Fig. 3C, EGLN3 was precipitated by anti-myogenin from extracts derived from differentiated, but not proliferating C2C12 cells. To demonstrate the subcellular localization of EGLN3 and myogenin in differentiated C2C12 cells, we performed cytosolic and nuclear fractionation. In our experiments, we found that α-tubulin (a cytosolic protein) was only detected in the cytosolic fraction, whereas lamin A/C (a nuclear protein) was exclusively present in the nuclear fraction. Interestingly, EGLN3 was primarily observed in the cytosolic fraction with only a minor portion being found in the nuclear fraction. Myogenin was present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction between EGLN3 and myogenin occurs primarily in the cytoplasm. To determine the functional significance of the EGLN3-myogenin interaction, myogenin was transfected into COS-7 cells alone or together with EGLN3. EGLN3 overexpression increased myogenin protein abundance (Fig. 4A). However, RT-PCR analysis indicated that forced expression or knockdown of EGLN3 in C2C12 cells had no significant effect on myogenin transcript levels (Fig. 4B). To examine myogenin stability, myogenin levels were measured in cells incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 4C, EGLN3 increased the stability of the Myc-tagged myogenin protein. By densitometric analysis of Western blots (n = 3), the half-life of Myc-tagged myogenin increased from ∼60 min to 120 min in the presence of EGLN3. To further reveal the role of endogenous EGLN3 in the stability of myogenin, we evaluated the impact of EGLN3 siRNA on the steady-state level of myogenin. Consistent with the finding shown in Fig. 4C, knockdown of EGLN3 led to a markedly decreased stability of endogenous myogenin (Fig. 4D). VHL Interacts with Myogenin—The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the principal system for proteolysis of short-lived proteins in mammalian cells (32Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that EGLN3 might stabilize myogenin by interfering with the polyubiquitination and degradation of myogenin, and that the VHL-containing ubiquitin ligase complex was involved. We therefore determined if VHL interacted with myogenin. HEK 293 cells were transfected with myogenin and/or VHL. Total cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-VHL Ab and then immunoblotted with anti-myogenin. Myogenin was detected in the anti-VHL precipitates (Fig. 5A). An identical result was achieved in the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment in which extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-myogenin and then probed with anti-VHL (Fig. 5B). To determine if endogenous myogenin and VHL interacted, extracts prepared from differentiated C2C12 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-VHL Ab and then immunoblotted with anti-myogenin. As shown in Fig. 5C, myogenin was precipitated by anti-VHL Ab but not by the IgG control. To demonstrate the subcellular localization of VHL and myogenin in differentiated C2C12 cells, we performed cytosolic and nuclear fractionation. Interestingly, subcellular fractionation showed that VHL was primarily observed in the cytosolic fraction with minor portion being found in the nuclear fractions. Myogenin was present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 3D). Together, our results suggest that the interaction between VHL and myogenin occurs primarily in the cytoplasm. VHL Destabilizes Myogenin Protein via the Ubiquitin-proteasome Pathway—Because VHL interacts with myogenin, we tested the possibility that VHL can catalyze the assembly of polyubiquitin (Ub) chain on the myogenin protein using a ubiquitination assay. Myogenin was transfected into HEK 293 cells with His-tagged Ub in the presence or absence of VHL. Lysates were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads to isolate the ubiquitinated proteins, and the eluates were examined by Western blotting with an anti-myogenin Ab. A smear of high molecular weight myogenin protein characteristic of ubiquitinated species was observed (Fig. 6A), which was markedly increased in the presence of co-expressed VHL (Fig. 6A). This finding suggests that VHL promotes the ubiquitination of myogenin. To determine whether VHL regulated the abundance of myogenin, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with myogenin and increasing amounts of VHL. Western blot analysis demonstrated that VHL down-regulated expression of myogenin protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Like with EGLN3, this appeared to be due to changes in protein stability, as shown in a cycloheximide chase experiment (Fig. 6C). To address if polyubiquitination of myogenin by VHL is essential for myogenin degradation, a vector expressing VHL C162F, a mutant that is unable to interact with elongin C/Cullin2 and thus lacks activity to ubiquitinate the target protein (33Ohh M. Takagi Y. Aso T. Stebbins C.E. Pavletich N.P. Zbar B. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Unlike wild-type VHL, the mutant exhibited no effect on myogenin expression (Fig. 6D), suggesting that polyubiquitination of myogenin is necessary for its degradation by VHL. To determine if the effect of VHL on myogenin is mediated by the proteasome, cells were transfected with myogenin and VHL in the presence of MG132, a widely used proteasome inhibitor (23Fu J. Jin Y. Arend L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52660-52672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with MG132 blocked the effect of VHL, resulting in accumulation of myogenin protein (Fig. 6E). The dominant negative Ub mutant UbK48R, in which Lys-48 is replaced by Arg, has been shown to inhibit the elongation of polymerized Ub chain and proteasomal degr"
https://openalex.org/W2056908467,"Many different cells' signalling pathways are universally regulated by Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] rises that have highly variable amplitudes and kinetic properties. Optical imaging can provide the means to characterise both the temporal and spatial aspects of Ca2+ signals involved in neurophysiological functions. New methods for in vivo imaging of Ca2+ signalling in the brain of Drosophila are required for probing the different dynamic aspects of this system. In studies here, whole brain Ca2+ imaging was performed on transgenic flies with targeted expression of the bioluminescent Ca2+ reporter GFP-aequorin (GA) in different neural structures. A photon counting based technique was used to undertake continuous recordings of cytosolic [Ca2+] over hours. Time integrals for reconstructing images and analysis of the data were selected offline according to the signal intensity. This approach allowed a unique Ca2+ response associated with cholinergic transmission to be identified by whole brain imaging of specific neural structures. Notably, [Ca2+] transients in the Mushroom Bodies (MBs) following nicotine stimulation were accompanied by a delayed secondary [Ca2+] rise (up to 15 min. later) in the MB lobes. The delayed response was sensitive to thapsigargin, suggesting a role for intra-cellular Ca2+ stores. Moreover, it was reduced in dunce mutant flies, which are impaired in learning and memory. Bioluminescence imaging is therefore useful for studying Ca2+ signalling pathways and for functional mapping of neurophysiological processes in the fly brain."
https://openalex.org/W2023521873,"Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, AC-Hly, or ACT) permeabilizes cell membranes by forming small cation-selective (hemolytic) pores and subverts cellular signaling by delivering into host cells an adenylate cyclase (AC) enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP. Both AC delivery and pore formation were previously shown to involve a predicted amphipathic α-helix502–522 containing a pair of negatively charged Glu509 and Glu516 residues. Another predicted transmembrane α-helix565–591 comprises a Glu570 and Glu581 pair. We examined the roles of these glutamates in the activity of CyaA. Substitutions of Glu516 increased specific hemolytic activity of CyaA by two different molecular mechanisms. Replacement of Glu516 by positively charged lysine residue (E516K) increased the propensity of CyaA to form pores, whereas proline (E516P) or glutamine (E516Q) substitutions extended the lifetime of open single pore units. All three substitutions also caused a drop of pore selectivity for cations. Substitutions of Glu570 and Glu581 by helix-breaking proline or positively charged lysine residue reduced (E570K, E581P) or ablated (E570P, E581K) AC membrane translocation. Moreover, E570P, E570K, and E581P substitutions down-modulated also the specific hemolytic activity of CyaA. In contrast, the E581K substitution enhanced the hemolytic activity of CyaA 4 times, increasing both the frequency of formation and lifetime of toxin pores. Negative charge at position 570, but not at position 581, was found to be essential for cation selectivity of the pore, suggesting a role of Glu570 in ion filtering inside or close to pore mouth. The pairs of glutamate residues in the predicted transmembrane segments of CyaA thus appear to play a key functional role in membrane translocation and pore-forming activities of CyaA.

Bordetella pertussis, the etiological agent of whooping cough, secretes an adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA, 3The abbreviations used are: CyaA, adenylate cyclase toxin; AC, adenylate cyclase; Hly, hemolysin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; pS, picosiemens. adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (AC-Hly), or ACT) that is a key virulence factor of the bacteria during early phases of respiratory tract colonization (1Weiss J.

CyaA is synthesized as a single polypeptide of 1706 residues and consists of an amino-terminal AC domain of about 400 residues and a pore-forming RTX (repeat in toxin) Hly moiety of about 1306 residues (9Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Ullmann A. Danchin A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The Hly bears a C-terminal secretion signal (10Masure H.R. Au D.C. Gross M.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of a calcium-binding glycine- and aspartate-rich nonapeptide repeat domain (last 700 residues), and of a fatty acyl activation domain (residues 800–1000). In the last, the essential covalent post-translational modification is taking place (13Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in the presence of the accessory acyltransferase, CyaC (14Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AC domain is enzymatically active by itself (15Glaser P. Elmaoglou-Lazaridou A. Krin E. Ladant D. Barzu O. Danchin A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The entire toxin is, however, needed for AC delivery into target cells (16Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where AC is activated by cytosolic calmodulin and catalyzes unregulated conversion of ATP to the key signal molecule, cAMP (18Hanski E.

A. 1980; 77: 3841-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In turn, membrane insertion and pore-forming (hemolytic) activities of CyaA do not require the AC domain and are located to the Hly portion (20Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Sebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This exhibits hemolytic activity on erythrocytes (16Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect.

CyaA binds target cells primarily via the αMβ2 integrin receptor known as CD11b/CD18, complement receptor 3 (CR3), or Mac-1 (23Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Guiso N. Ladant D. Leclerc C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This is expressed by granulocytes/neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, NK cells, and certain subsets of CD8+ T and of B cells. It is noteworthy, however, that the toxin can penetrate and intoxicate to detectable levels also a variety of other cell types lacking the CD11b/CD18 receptor and/or endocytic mechanisms, such as mammalian erythrocytes (5Hanski E.

Because of a lack of structural data, the mechanisms of membrane insertion of CyaA, its capacity to cross directly the cytoplasmic membrane, and its ability to form cation-selective membrane pores are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that translocation of the AC domain across membrane and formation of CyaA pores are two independent and separable membrane activities, resulting from membrane insertion of CyaA (22Szabo G.

Recently, we demonstrated that both of these activities involve a transmembrane α-helix predicted between residues 502 and 522 of the poreforming domain of CyaA. This harbors a pair of negatively charged glutamate residues, Glu509 and Glu516. A helix-breaking proline substitution E509P within this segment abolished the capacity of CyaA to deliver the AC domain into erythrocytes. Moreover, the charge-reversing lysine substitutions E509K and E516K strongly enhanced the specific hemolytic activity of CyaA, by up-modulating its capacity to form pores while ablating AC domain translocation into cells. In addition, combination of the substitutions in CyaA-E509K/E516K strongly decreased the cation selectivity of formed pores, indicating that Glu509 and Glu516 are located within or close to the membrane pore (34Osickova A. Osicka R. Maier E. Benz R. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On this basis, we suggested that prior to interaction with target membrane, two conformational isomers of CyaA might form, one being a translocation precursor allowing AC domain delivery into cell cytosol and the other being a pore precursor, whose insertion into membranes yields formation of oligomeric membrane pores (34Osickova A. Osicka R. Maier E. Benz R. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that AC membrane translocation and poreforming (hemolytic) activity of CyaA further depends on an additional predicted transmembrane amphipathic α-helix, localized between residues 565 and 591 of the pore-forming domain and comprising yet another pair of glutamate residues, Glu570 and Glu581. Moreover, we show for the first time that different amino acid substitutions of the glutamate residue at position 516 can increase the hemolytic activity of CyaA by two different molecular mechanisms. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used throughout this work for DNA manipulation and CyaA expression. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Wild-type CyaA and its mutant derivatives were expressed from the pCACT3 plasmid (29Betsou F. Sebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single amino acid substitutions were introduced into the cyaA gene by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using the TaqDNA polymerase and suitable pairs of mutagenic PCR primers (supplemental Table 1). PCR products with introduced substitutions were subcloned into the pCACT3, and the absence of other undesired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Complete sequences and detailed schemes of the plasmid constructs will be provided on request. Production and Purification of the CyaA-derived Proteins—Intact CyaA and its mutant variants were produced in E. coli transformed with appropriate pCACT3-derived constructs. Exponential 500-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C and induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 4 h before the cells were washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.2 mm CaCl2, and disrupted by sonication. The insoluble cell debris was resuspended in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2. Upon centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min, clarified urea extracts were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl. After washing, the CyaA-derived proteins were eluted with 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 m NaCl, diluted four times with the 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl buffer, and further purified on a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Unbound proteins were washed out with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the CyaA-derived proteins were eluted with 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA and stored at –20 °C. Assay of AC, Cell Binding, and Cytotoxic and Hemolytic Activities—Adenylate cyclase activities were measured in the presence of 1 μm calmodulin as previously described (35Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2612-2618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of AC activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed per min at 30 °C, pH 8.0. Because toxin alterations outside the AC domain do not affect the specific AC activity, concentrations of mutant CyaAs in the extracts and in the purified preparations were equalized on the basis of their AC content prior to activity testing. Cell-invasive AC and hemolytic activities were measured as previously described (16Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by determining the amount of AC enzyme activity protected against externally added trypsin upon internalization into erythrocytes and by hemoglobin release in time upon toxin incubations with washed sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108/ml), respectively. Erythrocyte binding of the toxins was determined as described in detail previously (17Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Determination of the Intracellular cAMP Level—Cytotoxic activity on sheep erythrocytes was determined as the capacity of various CyaAs to raise intracellular cAMP levels in 5 × 108/ml of sheep red blood cells upon incubation with 5 μg/ml of the CyaA proteins for 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS (10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm d-glucose) containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm HCl in 0.1% Tween 20, and the samples were boiled for 15 min at 100 °C to denature cellular proteins (cAMP is heat- and acid-resistant). The samples were neutralized by the addition of 150 mm unbuffered imidazol, passed through an Al2O3 column (aluminum oxide 90 active neutral, activity stage I; Merck), and cAMP concentration was determined by a competition immunoassay. Microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc-Immuno; Maxisorp) were coated with a cAMP-BSA conjugate (gift of D. Ladant) diluted to 5 μg/ml in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.5. The plate wells were washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0 (TBS-Tween), saturated for 3 h with 2% BSA in TBS (TBS-BSA), and washed three times with TBS-Tween. 100 μl of sample or of the cAMP standard (Sigma) were directly added to the plate wells coated with cAMP-BSA and containing 50 μl of anti-cAMP rabbit antibodies (gift of A. Ullmann) diluted at 1:3000 in 2% TBS-BSA. Upon incubation at 4 °C overnight, the plates were washed four times with TBS-Tween, and anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (1:1000) was added in TBS-BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the wells were washed four times with TBS-Tween, and the peroxidase activity was determined using o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as a substrate. Lipid Bilayer Experiments—The methods used for black lipid bilayer experiments have been described previously (36Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The experimental setup consisted of a Teflon cell with two water-filled compartments connected by a small circular hole. The hole had an area of about 0.4 mm2. Membranes were formed across the hole from a 1% solution of asolectin (lecithin type IIIs from soy beans from Sigma) in n-decane. The temperature was maintained at 20 °C during all experiments. All salts were obtained from Merck (analytical grade) and were buffered with 10 mm HEPES-KOH to a pH of ∼7. The electrical measurements were performed using Ag/AgCl electrodes (with salt bridges) connected in series to a voltage source and a homemade current-to-voltage converter. The amplified signal was recorded on a strip chart or tape recorder. For the selectivity measurements, the membranes were formed in a 100 mm KCl solution. Toxin was added to both sides of the membrane, and the increase of the membrane conductance due to insertion of pores was observed with the electrometer (Keithley 617). After incorporation of 10–100 pores into a membrane, the instrumentation was switched to the measurement of the zero current potential, and a KCl gradient was established by adding 3 m KCl solution to one side of the membrane. Analysis of the zero current membrane potential was performed using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (36Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For activity measurements, CyaA or CyaA mutants were added to both sides of the membrane, and the membrane conductance was taken 30 min after the addition, when further conductance increase in time was negligible (12Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous phase contained 1 m KCl and was also buffered to pH 7. The applied membrane potential was 50 mV. Statistical Analysis—Significance of differences in values was assessed by Student's t test. Substitutions of Glutamate 516 Increase Hemolytic Activity of CyaA by Extending Lifetime or by Enhancing Formation Frequency of CyaA Pores—In previous work, we showed that AC membrane translocation, as well as formation and cation selectivity of CyaA pores, depend on the structure and net charge of a potential amphipathic α-helical transmembrane segment (34Osickova A. Osicka R. Maier E. Benz R. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is predicted to form between amino acid residues 502 and 522 (α-helix502–522) and comprises a pair of negatively charged glutamate residues, Glu509 and Glu516 (Fig. 1A). To analyze the function of this α-helix in membrane activities of CyaA in more detail, the glutamate 516 was replaced here by a helix-breaking proline residue and by a neutral glutamine residue. The mutant CyaA proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by a combination of ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography (Fig. 2), and their specific cell-binding, cell-invasive, and hemolytic activities were compared with those of intact CyaA, using sheep erythrocytes as target cells. The cell-invasive AC activity of CyaA constructs was first determined as the amount of the AC enzyme activity internalized into erythrocytes and protected against digestion by externally added trypsin (17Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE analysis of purified wild-type CyaA and of its mutant variants. The proteins were expressed in recombinant E. coli K12 strains transformed with the pCACT3-derived plasmids and purified from urea extracts of cell debris by a combination of ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography as previously described (41Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Table 1, substitution of Glu516 by the proline residue modestly reduced the capacity of CyaA-E516P to bind erythrocytes while causing ∼4-fold reduction in the specific cell-invasive activity of the CyaA-E516P mutant, as compared with intact CyaA. In contrast, substitution of Glu516 by the neutral glutamine residue, not expected to disrupt the α-helical structure of the mutagenized segment, had little effect on the cell association capacity of the CyaA-E516Q mutant and on the membrane translocation capacity of its AC domain (Table 1). These results are consistent with those obtained previously for proline and glutamine substitutions of the glutamate residue in position 509 in the same segment (34Osickova A. Osicka R. Maier E. Benz R. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37644-37650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data, hence, further show that residues Glu509 and Glu516 are part of an α-helical structure that is crucial for AC domain translocation across target cell membrane.TABLE 1Activities of different CyaA mutants on erythrocytes and black lipid bilayer membranesToxinPercentage of activity of CyaA on erythrocytesaAll activities are expressed as percentages of intact CyaA activity and represent average values ± S.D. from at least three independent determinations performed in duplicate with three different toxin preparations.

The 1 m KCl solution was buffered by 10 mm HEPES and had a pH of 7.0. The applied voltage was 50 mV, and the temperature was 20 °C. The most frequent single-pore conductance, G, was determined from at least 100 single pore opening events. The error corresponds to the half of the counting interval of the single pore conductance histogram.LifetimeeThe number of pores with a given lifetime was plotted as a function of the mean lifetime. The graph was fitted with an exponential decay function, n = Noexp(-t/τ), and the lifetime was calculated as lifetime = τln2.Cation selectivityfZero-current membrane potentials were determined for a 10-fold gradient of KCl. The aqueous salt solutions were buffered by 10 mm HEPES and had a pH of 7.0; T = 20 °C. The permeability ratio Pcation/Panion was calculated with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (36) from the mean of at least three individual experiments.

These transcription factors bind to regulatory regions within hundreds of target genes to control their expression. Zfp206 is a recently characterized transcription factor that has a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency. We have demonstrated here that Zfp206 is a direct downstream target of Oct4 and Sox2. Two composite sox-oct binding sites have been identified within the first intron of Zfp206. We have demonstrated binding of Oct4 and Sox2 to this region. In addition, we have shown that Oct4 or Sox2 alone can activate transcription via one of these sox-oct elements, although the presence of both Oct4 and Sox2 gave rise to a synergistic effect. These studies extend our understanding of the transcriptional network that operates to regulate the differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells.

For proper developmental outcome, ESCs must tightly regulate their differentiation status, and through continuing study, the molecular basis of that regulation process is beginning to emerge. Systematic, genome-wide interrogations have identified hundreds of genes, including several transcription factors, which have expression patterns tightly correlated with ES cell differentiation (1Tanaka T.S.

Two key transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, have been identified that are crucial for maintenance of the pluripotent state of ESCs (7Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D.

ESCs lose the capacity to maintain pluripotency upon knockdown of expression of these transcription factors by RNA interference (9Matin M.M. Walsh J.R. Gokhale P.J. Draper J.S. Bahrami A.R. Morton I.

Gene knock-out studies confirm the importance of Oct4 and Sox2 for early embryonic development. It has been demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies that Oct4 and Sox2 bind to a few thousand regulatory sites in the ES cell genome (11Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E.

It is likely that many of these target genes play a role in modulating ES cell differentiation. Indeed, the transcription factor Nanog, an established regulator of pluripotency, is transcriptionally regulated directly by Oct4 and Sox2 (13Rodda D.J. Chew J.L. Lim L.H. Loh Y.H. Wang B. Ng H.H.

Wei H. Zhang S. Lei S. Murage J. Fisk G.J. Li Y. Xu C. Fang R. Guegler K. Rao M.S. Mandalam R. Lebkowski J. Stanton L.W. Nat.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4780-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Zfp206 contains a SCAN domain and 14 zinc-finger domains, which suggests that it may be a transcription factor that binds DNA directly. Zfp206 is expressed in the inner cell mass but not in trophectoderm, suggesting that it may play a role in establishing cell fate decisions regarding embryonic versus extraembryonic tissue (15Yoshikawa T. Piao Y. Zhong J. Matoba R. Carter M.G. Wang Y. Goldberg I. Ko M.S. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There is wide temporal and spatial distribution of RNA and protein in the early embryos, indicating that Zfp206 may regulate multiple cell fate decisions (14Zhang W. Walker E. Tamplin O.J. Rossant J. Stanford W.L. Hughes T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4780-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent data have demonstrated that overexpression of Zfp206 promotes the formation of undifferentiated mouse ESC colonies in vitro (14Zhang W. Walker E. Tamplin O.J. Rossant J. Stanford W.L. Hughes T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4780-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have obtained similar results and further found that overexpression of Zfp206 renders ESCs resistant to retinoic acid-induced differentiation, whereas knocked down expression of Zfp206 made ESCs more easily differentiated by retinoic acid (data to be published elsewhere). 3Z.-X. Wang and L. W. Stanton, unpublished data. 3Z.-X. Wang and L. W. Stanton, unpublished data. The pattern of expression and functional impact of Zfp206 on ESC differentiation establishes that this transcription factor plays an important role in maintaining pluripotency.Given that Zfp206 plays a key role in controlling ESC differentiation, it is important to understand how this transcription factor fits into the network of other transcription factors involved in maintaining pluripotency of ESCs, such as Oct4 and Sox2. Oct4 (also known as Oct3 and encoded by Pou5f1)isa POU domain-containing transcription factor that binds an octamer sequence, ATGCAAAT (12Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 18Pesce M. Scholer H.R. Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Oct4 and Sox2 were shown to reciprocally regulate Pou5f1 and Sox2 transcription via the Oct4·Sox2 complex in ESCs (16Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6031-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In addition, Oct4 and Sox2 positively regulate Nanog, revealing that a tight transcriptional network is at work to maintain the undifferentiated state of ESCs (13Rodda D.J. Chew J.L. Lim L.H.

To identify target genes regulated by these pluripotent transcription factors, studies have been carried out to map the binding sites for Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 on a genome-wide scale (11Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A.

Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 binding sites have been identified within a large number of genes with diverse functions, including other transcription factors. It has been observed that Oct4 binding within the enhancer of a number of genes is in close proximity to Sox2 binding sox elements. Such close proximity of the two binding sites suggests that these two transcription factors may interact with each other. Indeed, two structures for a POU·HMG ternary complex bound to composite sox-oct motifs have been solved, revealing that that the POU and HMG domains are capable of mediating specific protein-protein and DNA-protein interactions (20Remenyi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Scholer H.R. Wilmanns M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 21Williams Jr., D.C. Cai M. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This finding reinforces the importance of Oct4 and Sox2 at the top of the hierarchy in the maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs. Based on previous chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, two Oct4 and two Sox2 binding sites were found on the Zfp206 genomic locus (12Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). Each of the Oct4 binding sites lies in close proximity to the Sox2 binding site, suggesting that Oct4 and Sox2 may be partners in regulating the expression of Zfp206. The oct-sox elements are located at the beginning and end of the first intron of Zfp206. In this study, we have established that Oct4 and Sox2 are direct regulators of Zfp206 expression. These results position Zfp206 within the transcriptional regulatory network that maintains pluripotency and controls the differentiation of ESCs.MATERIALS AND METHODSES Cell Culture—E14 mouse ESCs (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)), either cultured on mouse primary embryonic fibroblast feeders or under feeder-free conditions, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (ESC-qualified; Invitrogen), 0.055 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acid, 5000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1000 units/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The V6.4 (129S4/SvJae × C57BL/6J)F1 ES cells cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.055 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor.Site-specific lacZ Knock-in Stable Cell Line—The Red/ET recombination method (Gene Bridges GmbH, Dresden, Germany) was employed to make the site-specific knock-in construct that contains 5.43 kb of left homologous arm and 10.374 kb of right homologous arm for the homologous recombination (20Remenyi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Scholer H.R. Wilmanns M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, we inserted prokaryotic Pgb2 promoter into the plasmid pTCT5.2 (20Remenyi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Scholer H.R. Wilmanns M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) to generate a plasmid pTCT5.2-Pgb2 that contains both eukaryotic PGK and prokaryotic Pgb2 promoters. The genomic DNA of Zfp206, which is 16,147 bp in length, was subcloned into a minimer vector by the Red/ET method using the bacterial artificial chromosome subcloning kit (Gene Bridges GmbH) from the BAC clone RP24–440G8 (containing 172 kb of genomic DNA). The cassette of PCR product from the pTCT5.2-Pgb2 plasmid was inserted into this subcloning plasmid to generate a novel plasmid in which part of the second exon (328 bp in length) of Zfp206 containing the translation initiation site has been replaced. For homologous recombination, V6.4 ESCs were stably transfected with the construct that contains the lacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter gene using a standard protocol of electroporation (20Remenyi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Scholer H.R. Wilmanns M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Individual colonies were picked after selection with 300 μg/ml G418 for 10 days with cells grown on neomycin-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DR4, ATCC). Southern blot was used to verify the site-specific integration into the genomic DNA. 20 μg of genomic DNA from different neomycin-resistant cell clones was digested by SpeI (New England Biolabs), loaded onto agarose gel, and transferred onto nylon membrane. Southern blot was conducted using PCR product localized on the upstream of the left homologous arm and was labeled using the PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions.Promoter Reporter Constructs—We cloned the Zfp206 promoter (1468 bp in length) from the BAC clone (RP24–440G8) and the Nanog (417 bp) promoter regions from the genomic DNA into pGL4-basic vector (Promega). The beginning of the first intron (1062 bp) or the end of the first intron (938 bp) were cloned upstream of the Zfp206 promoter-luciferase or Nanog promoter-luciferase construct in the forward or reverse orientation. The Sox2, Oct4, and both the Oct4 and Sox2 binding site were modified using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) to incorporate 3-bp mutations, which were subsequently verified by sequencing.RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi experiments were performed with Dharmacon siGENOME SMARTpool reagents against mouse Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog. The Dharmacon siCONTROL nontargeting small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) pool was used as a negative control. All duplexed RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Dharmacon as 21-mers with 3′-UU overhangs forming a 19-bp duplex core. Based on the manufacturer's instructions, four duplex individual siRNAs were combined into a signal pool for one target gene. Mouse ESCs were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, E14 cells were transfected with gene-specific SMARTpool or the siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA pool three times at days 0, 2, and 4 using DharmFECT 2 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). The RNA was extracted at days 1, 3, and 5 for reverse transcription-PCR assay. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using the high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) with 1500 ng of total RNA, and quantitative PCR analyses were performed in real time using an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Expression was normalized to β-actin, and each sample was analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. A threshold cycle (CT) of >33 indicates undetected transcripts. A 19-bp gene-specific RNAi sequence for Oct4 and Sox2 (13Rodda D.J. Chew J.L. Lim L.H. Loh Y.H. Wang B. Ng H.H. Robson P. J. Biol.

Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar).Luciferase and lacZ Reporter Assays—200 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 1 μgof Oct4 or Sox2 shRNA in plasmid pSUPER.puro, and 20 ng of plasmid pRL-SV40 were co-transfected into E14 cells in a 24-well plate by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the supplied protocol. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) was applied 24 h post-transfection. The pRL-SV40 plasmid served as an internal control for normalizing the transfection efficiency. After 48 h of puromycin selection, the E14 cells were lysed and luciferase activity determined with the Dual Luciferase system (Promega) using a Centro LB960 96-well luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Transfections were done in duplicate and on two independent occasions.To quantitate β-galactosidase activity (lacZ expression) in V6.4 ESCs upon Sox2 and Oct4 knockdown, 1 μgof Sox2 or Oct4 shRNA in plasmid pSUPER.puro and 3 ng of plasmid pRL-SV40 were co-transfected into V6.4 heterozygous ESCs in a 96-well plate. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) was applied 24 h post-transfection. The 96-well plates were equilibrated to room temperature before adding Beta-Glo reagent (Promega) after 48 h of puromycin selection. 100 μl of reagent was added to the culture medium. The sample was mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature and measured using a luminometer. The V6.4 cells were lysed, and Renilla activity was determined with the Dual Luciferase system (Promega) at the same time.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from E14 mouse ESCs grown under feeder-free conditions using the method of Rodda et al. (13Rodda D.J. Chew J.L. Lim L.H. Loh Y.H. Wang B. Ng H.H. Robson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24731-24737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Equal molar oligonucleotides labeled with Cy5 at the 5′ termini of both sense and antisense strands were annealed in 95 °C water until cooling to room temperature. The double-stranded DNA was diluted to 1 μm for EMSA assay. EMSA was performed in 10-μl mixtures containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1.66 mm dithiothreitol, 0.83 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 μl of Cy5-labeled double-stranded DNA (1 μm), 12–16 μg of nuclear extracts and 1 μl of poly(dG-dC) (2 μg/μl, Amersham Biosciences), 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).

Walker E. Tamplin O.J. Rossant J. Stanford W.L. Hughes T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4780-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and our own data (to be published elsewhere)3 have identified Zfp206 as a transcription factor that plays a key role in maintaining the pluripotency of ESCs. The expression pattern of Zfp206 is quite similar to the patterns of expression for Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 in ESCs; they are all expressed in undifferentiated cells, and that expression is quickly repressed upon differentiation. Because Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 are key transcription factors in the maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs, we set out to determine whether they can regulate the expression of Zfp206. Therefore, we examined the expression of Zfp206 in response to the knockdown of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 expression by RNAi. We were able to achieve efficient and substantial knockdown of the target genes in ESCs by a repeated transfection on alternative days with siRNA. When mouse ESCs were transfected with gene-specific siRNAs against Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, a 50% knockdown of expression was observed 1 day after transfection and a 70–90% reduction of the targeted gene was observed at day 5 (Fig. 1). These effects were gene-specific, as there was no knockdown of β-actin mRNA expression by these three siRNAs, and a non-targeting siRNA had no impact on the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2. The expression level of Zfp206 was examined in these transfected cells. Upon Oct4 or Sox2 knockdown (Fig. 1, A and C), a down-regulation of the Zfp206 transcript level to <30% of control levels was observed. In the Nanog RNAi cells, the transcript level of Zfp206 was reduced to only 70%. These results suggest that Zfp206 is regulated by Oct4 and Sox2, perhaps directly or indirectly, as part of the regulatory network that controls ESC pluripotency.Oct4 and Sox2 Regulate the Activity of Zfp206 in Vivo—To further examine the regulation of Zfp206 expression in ESCs, we knocked a lacZ reporter into the Zfp206 locus by homologous recombination. We constructed a targeting vector that contained a 5.5-kb genomic fragment upstream of the translational start site of the Zfp206 and a 10.4-kb genomic fragment downstream of the 3′ end of the second exon. The construct included the entire first exon and intron. The first 134 amino acids of the Zfp206 protein, which included the SCAN domain in the second exon, was replaced with a construct containing the internal ribosome entry site IRES-lacZ-neomycin-3′ UTR reporter and the selection cassette (supplemental Fig. 1A). The targeting construct was electroporated into V6.4 ESCs and 196 neomycin-resistant colonies were assessed for homologous recombination by Southern blotting. We identified four independent clones that had the correct restriction digest pattern (supplemental Fig. 1B). All four of the undifferentiated, heterozygous colonies were positive for lacZ, indicating appropriate expression of this reporter from the Zfp206 locus (Fig. 2A, upper panel). To determine whether down-regulation of lacZ expression was linked to endogenous Zfp206 expression, ESC clones were differentiated by retinoic acid. After five days of continuous retinoic acid treatment, the cell morphology changed significantly, and lacZ became undetectable (Fig. 2A, lower panel). There was also reduced lacZ expression in embryoid bodies generated by aggregation of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (Fig. 2B). lacZ expression was not detectable in the endoderm-like cells on the embryoid body surface. It was noted that lacZ expression appeared in the center of the embryoid bodies (which were undifferentiated) but not at the rim (differentiated cells), indicating that the regulatory region of Zfp206 contained elements that regulate Zfp206 expression in undifferentiated ESC.FIGURE 2LacZ gene knocked in at the Zfp206 locus is regulated by Oct4 and Sox2. A, expression of lacZ in undifferentiated V6.4 ESC. lacZ expression was visualized by microscopy before (upper panel) and after (lower panel) ESC differentiation induced by retinoic acid for five days. B, expression of lacZ restricted to undifferentiated ESCs located in the middle of five-day-old embryoid bodies. C, Sox2 and Oct4 protein expression following Sox2 and Oct4 RNAi by Western blot. Tubulin was used as a loading control. D, lacZ expression following Sox2 and Oct4 knockdown. V6.4 heterozygous ESCs were transfected with Sox2 or Oct4 RNAi, and after 48 h of puromycin selection, lacZ activity was measured. An irrelevant shRNA to Gfp and an empty vector served as negative controls. The change of lacZ reporter activity resulting from each RNA interference is given relative to the empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether Oct4 and Sox2 had an effect on the regulatory region of Zfp206, we knocked down the expression of Oct4 and Sox2 by RNAi. Immunoblotting showed that effective knockdowns of Oct4 and Sox2 were achieved (Fig. 2C). When these cells were assayed for lacZ reporter activity, it was found that Zfp206 expression was reduced by >40% with Oct4, Sox2, or both Oct4 and Sox2 RNAi, as compared with either vector control or Gfp RNAi (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that both Oct4 and Sox2 have a positive regulatory effect on the genomic region of Zfp206, because the knockdown of these two proteins"

Red harvester ant colonies run perfectly well without any overall direction from the queen, or from any other colony members. The coordination within a colony arises simply from the ways that workers use local information. Deborah Gordon sees the behaviour of such colonies as a pointer to the organization of the many biological systems — embryos and brains to name two — that operate without central control. By working on specific systems like this, she says, it should be possible to establish whether there are any general laws to explain the behaviour of non-hierarchical complex systems, now the focus of so much research in the life sciences."

Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania must survive in two separate and harsh environments to complete their life cycle: extracellularly within the midgut of the sand fly and intracellularly within the phagolysosome of vertebrate macrophages. A variety of abundant secreted and surface glycoconjugates have been implicated in key steps of the infectious cycle (1Naderer T. Vince J.E. McConville M.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 649-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several of the most abundant of these contain repeating phosphoglycan (PG) 2The abbreviations used are: PG, phosphoglycan; PPG, proteophosphoglycans; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; NST, nucleotide sugar transporter; Galf, galactofuranose; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcription; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. polymers, such as lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and proteophosphoglycans (PPGs) (2Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted acid phosphatases also contain PGs, and other less abundant PG-containing molecules exist (3Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Wiese M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Leishmania PG repeating units contain the disaccharide-phosphate Gal(β1,4)-Man(α1)PO4 (referred to hereafter as the PG repeat unit) (5Turco S.J. Hull S.R. Orlandi Jr., P.A. Shepherd S.D. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6233-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PG repeats frequently contain additional sugar substitutions in different species and strains, most commonly on the Gal residue, although modifications of the Man also occur (Fig. 1) (6Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Leishmania PGs can be linked to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment, directly as in LPG or through attachment to the protein backbone in PPGs (Fig. 1). The basic LPG structure has four domains: a 1-alkyl-2-lyso-PI anchor, a heptasaccharide core consisting of Gal(α1,6)-Gal(α1,3)-Galf(β1,3)-[Glc(α1-PO4)6]-Man(α1,3)-Man(α1,4)-GlcN(α1,6), the poly-PG “backbone” consisting of (Gal(β1,4)-Man(α1)P) PG repeat units (average n ∼ 15–30), and a terminating oligosaccharide cap (Fig. 1). In Leishmania major, LPG plays several roles in parasite survival, including control of parasite binding to the sand fly midgut wall, resistance to lysis by complement, protection from oxidative damage, and delaying phagolysosomal fusion (6Sacks D.L.

PPGs arise from a large gene family that encodes large proteins (>200 kDa) containing Ser/Thr-rich regions to which PG repeating units are attached (9Ilg T. Parasitol.

These PG-containing molecules play roles in parasite transmission and virulence following sand fly biting, such as modulating macrophage immune functions (11Rogers M.E. Ilg T. Nikolaev A.V.

The role(s) of secreted acid phosphatases in parasite virulence are not well understood, since their levels are relatively low in L. major (14Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Exp.

Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) transport cytoplasmically synthesized nucleotide sugars into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi lumen, where they are consumed in glycosylation reactions (19Berninsone P.M.

A large number of NSTs have been identified, and they now constitute a well characterized family of membrane proteins (20Handford M. Rodriguez-Furlan C. Orellana A. Braz. J. Med. Biol.

Previously, we showed that the Leishmania LPG2 gene encoded the Golgi GDP-Man transporter, one of the earliest NSTs identified, and the first multispecific NST, since it was additionally able to transport GDP-d-Ara and GDP-l-Fuc (17Ma D.

Mutant lpg2– L. major were unable to survive within macrophages or to cause pathology (8Spath G.F. Garraway L.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9536-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas lpg2– L. mexicana were able to survive and induce disease (26Ilg T. Demar M. Harbecke D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4988-4997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because Golgi GDP-Man transport is required for PG synthesis, we hypothesized there would be a matching requirement for UDP-Gal transport as well. Loss of UDP-Gal transport in L. major should therefore render parasites PG-deficient and provide an additional tool to study PG function. Galactose is found in other surface glycoconjugates of trypanosomatids (18McConville M.J. Mullin K.A. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 122-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), such as the glycan head groups of Type II glycosylinositolphospholipids and in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor side chains containing poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine (27Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although this modification is not known to occur in Leishmania. The phenotype of galactose-deficient trypanosomes has been investigated previously through inactivation of UDP-glucose epimerase (28Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a gene also found in Leishmania. Since our interests concerned the role of galactosylation reactions occurring within secretory compartments, our strategy focused on inactivation of UDP-Gal transport. Thus, it was necessary first to identify the parasite's UDP-Gal transporters. Twelve candidate NST sequences were identified in the L. major genome, with five showing varying degrees of similarity to known UDP-Gal transporters, including two pseudogenes. Our data indicate that two candidates, LPG5A and LPG5B, both encode UDP-Gal transporters and are required for phosphoglycan synthesis in L. major, although their functions differ significantly. More limited studies of another candidate, HUT1L, suggest that it may be the functional homolog of the ER UDP-Glc NST, shown recently to be important to the protein folding glucosylation/reglucosylation process (29Reyes F.

More limited studies were performed on L. major strains SD (MHOM/SN/74/SD) and Friedlin V1 (WHOM/IL/80/FN), whose genome was recently completed (32Ivens A.C. Lewis S.M. Bagherzadeh A. Zhang L. Chan H.M. Smith D.F. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). L. major strains are closely related, showing on average of less than 1% sequence divergence (33Beverley S.M. Ismach R.B. Pratt D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leishmania cells were transfected by electroporation using either a low voltage (31Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell.

Following transfection, cells were allowed to grow 16–24 h in M199 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and then plated on semisolid media containing 1% Noble agar (Fisher) and the appropriate selective drugs. Individual colonies were picked and grown in liquid medium. Clones were maintained in selective medium and then removed from selection for one passage prior to experiments.

For expression, oligonucleotide primers (Table S2) added an optimal translation initiation sequence (CCACC) upstream of the ORF start codon. PCR products were directly cloned into the TA vector pGEM-TEasy™ (Promega, Madison, WI), sequenced, and then liberated with BamHI and inserted into Leishmania expression vectors. Where indicated, ORFs were liberated from pXG vectors with BamHI and cloned into the unique BamHI site of pCDNA3 (B1974; Table S1). pXG(NEO)-hUGT1-cHA (B5541) and pMKIT-hUGT1-cHA (B5034) were gifts from H. Segawa. LPG5A allelic replacement constructs were made by inserting ORFs encoding hygromycin B (HYG) or puromycin (PAC) resistance between 0.95-kb 5′ and 3′ LPG5A flanking regions present in pBSK-LPG5Aflanks (B4748; Table S1), making pBSK-LPG5A-HYGKO (B5019) and pBSK-LPG5A-PACKO (B5020). Disruption constructs for LPG5B were made by inserting a 0.92-kb XhoI fragment from pXG(BSD) (B4098), which contains the DHFR-TS splice acceptor site and the BSD resistance gene, into the unique BsrGI site of pBSK-LPG5B subclone (B5025) to make pBSK-LPG5B-BSDdisrupt (B5025; Table S1). A 1.9-kb AccI/XhoI fragment from pXG(NEO) (B1288), which contains the DHFR-TS splice acceptor site and the NEO resistance gene, was cloned into the BsrGI site of pBSK-LPG5Bsubclone to make pBSK-LPG5B-NEOdisrupt (B5026; Table S1). Mapping of the LPG5A Splice Acceptor Site—Mapping of splice acceptor sites was accomplished using RT-PCR (36Dobson D.E. Scholtes L.D. Valdez K.E. Sullivan D.R. Mengeling B.J. Cilmi S. Turco S.J.

FV1 RNA was prepared from exponentially growing parasites using Trizol (Roche Applied Science) and used as a template to generate randomly primed cDNAs using Superscript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A universal miniexon primer (SMB936) was used in conjunction with oligonucleotide SMB1581 (Table S2) to amplify portions of gene-specific cDNAs from the pool of randomly primed cDNAs described above, using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The single product was cloned into pGEM-TEasy™ (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Generation of LPG5 Mutants and Add-back Lines—Targeting fragments for LPG5A and LPG5B were liberated from their respective vectors and purified prior to transfection into L. major LV39. For single-gene mutants, two rounds of transfection were done to recover homozygous mutants, and correct targeting was confirmed using Southern analysis. The names below follow the formal nomenclature for Leishmania (37Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M.

Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Δlpg5A/Δlpg5A clonal strain A1 was chosen for biochemical analysis and is referred to as lpg5A–. The ^lpg5B/^lpg5B clonal strain A3 was chosen for biochemical analysis and is referred to as lpg5B–. To produce a strain targeted in both LPG5A and LPG5B, LPG5B was disrupted in the lpg5A– mutant. Clonal strain 2A-2, whose genotype Δlpg5A/Δlpg5A/^lpg5B/^lpg5B was confirmed by Southern analysis, is referred to as lpg5A–/5B–. Further details are discussed in supplemental materials. Parasite strains were passed in vitro no more than six times (M1P6) before use. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates from L. major promastigotes were prepared from exponential growth or stationary phase parasites in SDS sample buffer; 5 ×106 cell equivalents/lane were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE on 4% stacking and 12.5% resolving gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading was assessed by staining with 5% Ponceau S, 1% glacial acetic acid (w/v) prior to Western analysis. Monoclonal antibody WIC79.3 (38Kelleher M. Bacic A. Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase were from Amersham Biosciences, and ECL reactions were conducted using Pierce or PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence kits. Heterologous Expression—WT Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Lec8 cells (40Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 41Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture following ATCC recommendations. Lec8 cells were transformed using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s instructions. Transfectants were selected in medium containing 640 μg/ml G418; 5,000–10,000 stable transfectants were pooled and maintained in 300 μg/ml G418. Lec8 cells were transfected with constructs pCDNA3, pCDNA-LPG5A, pCDNA-LPG5B, pCDNA-HUT1L, and pMKIT-hUGT1-cHA to make the strains Lec8/pCDNA3 (hereafter referred to as Lec8/empty), Lec8/LPG5A, Lec8/LPG5B, Lec8/HUT1L, and Lec8/hUGT1, respectively. Fluorescent Lectin Binding—The binding of fluorescein isothiocynate-labeled Maackia amurensis agglutinin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Transfectants were removed from antibiotic selection for one passage prior to experiments. Cells grown on coverslips for IFA or scraped from flasks for fluorescence-activated cell sorting were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 1 min in 3.7% formaldehyde (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 25°C in 20 or 40 μg/ml M. amurensis fluorescein isothiocyanate in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and visualized using an Olympus AX-70 microscope (Melville, NY) or a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Purification and Analysis of LPG—LPG was prepared from exponential and stationary phase parasites using previously described methods (42Orlandi Jr., P.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10384-10391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess side chain modification, phosphoglycan repeating units were obtained by depolymerization of LPG using mild acid hydrolysis, dephosphorylated, and covalently labeled with either 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfate or 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate and analyzed using fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis (43Barron T.L. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The number of PG repeating units per LPG molecule was determined using two methods. The first method used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (44Mahoney A.B. Sacks D.L. Saraiva E. Modi G. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9813-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipid anchor was cleaved by nitrous acid deamination, and the anhydromannose residue at the reducing end was further reduced with NaBH4 to produce a single anhydromannitol residue for each LPG molecule. The LPG was hydrolyzed with 2 n trifluoroacetic acid to release neutral monosaccharides and phosphorylated monosaccharides (mostly galactose 6-phosphate). The phosphorylated monosaccharides were removed by anion exchange chromatography, and then the neutral monosaccharides were acetylated before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ratio of mannose to anhydromannitol was calculated, which was adjusted to account for the mannose present in the LPG core and capping sugars, to determine the number of PG repeats present per LPG molecule. The second method utilized capillary electrophoresis (43Barron T.L. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Purified LPG was treated with nitrous acid, NaBH4, and trifluoroacetic acid as in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The released monosaccharides were directly labeled with 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate, omitting acetylation, and separated on a Beckman P/ACE 5000 (Fullerton, CA). As with the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method described above, the ratio of Man to anhydromannitol was determined to estimate the number of PG repeating units per LPG molecule. WT LPG was used as a control in all experiments. Data Base Mining for NST Candidates—We used the BLAST algorithm to identify candidate NSTs in the Leishmania Genome Project data bases (45Ivens A.C.

In the completed Leishmania major genome, 12 sequences showing similarity to one or more NSTs were found (Table 1). To prioritize those mostly likely to encode UDP-Gal transporters, we compared the candidate Leishmania NSTs with UDP-Gal transporters from humans, yeast, and plants as well as the GDP-Man transporter LPG2 and human YEA4 (Table 1).TABLE 1NST candidates identified in the L. major strain Friedlin genomeBLAST P score versus query sequenceaSequence comparisons were done using the BLAST or PSI-BLAST algorithms (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi).GeneSystematic IDbAssigned by the Leishmania Genome Project.Accession numberHomo sapiens UDP-Gal (hUGT1)Saccharomyces pombe HUT1Arabidopsis thaliana UDP-Gal (AtUTR1)H. sapiens YEA4 UDP-GAL. major LPG2 GDP-ManORF (nucleotides)Number of amino acidsTM domainscTM domains determined by submitting amino acid sequence to three different topology programs (see supplemental materials).LPG5ALmjF24.0360AY49100810-20NSdNS, no significant similarity.NSNSNS1,350eLmjF24.0360 was assigned a start codon by the Leishmania Genome Project leading to a predicted 600-amino acid ORF; however, our results show that the correct ORF is 451 amino acids.45110LPG5BLmjF18.0400AY49100910-30NSNSNSNS1,68656110(LPG5-like)LmjF15.0840fLmjF15.0840 is a pseudogene containing two internal stop codons, identified by both our and the Leishmania Genome Project sequence.

By contrast to common mechanisms in which transacting factors function directly at promoters, the hematopoietic GATA factors GATA-1 and GATA-2 often assemble dispersed complexes over broad chromosomal regions. For example, GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupy five conserved regions over ∼100 kb of the Gata2 locus in the transcriptionally repressed and active states, respectively, in erythroid cells. Since it is unknown whether the individual complexes exert qualitatively distinct or identical functions to regulate Gata2 transcription in vivo, we compared the activity of the -3.9 and +9.5 kb sites of the Gata2 locus in transgenic mice. The +9.5 site functioned as an autonomous enhancer in the endothelium and fetal liver of embryonic day 11 embryos, whereas the -3.9 site lacked such activity. Mechanistic studies demonstrated critical requirements for a GATA motif and a neighboring E-box within the +9.5 site for enhancer activity in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Surprisingly, whereas this GATA-E-box composite motif was sufficient for enhancer activity in an erythroid precursor cell line, its enhancer function in primary human endothelial cells required additional regulatory modules. These results identify the first molecular determinant of Gata2 transcription in vascular endothelium, composed of a core enhancer module active in both endothelial and hematopoietic cells and regulatory modules preferentially required in endothelial cells.

Tissue-specific gene regulation is a tightly controlled process directed and altered by a plethora of cellular cues. Although numerous cell type-specific transcription factors have been identified, and common biochemical mechanisms have emerged (1Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2004; 116: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), many questions remain unanswered regarding how ensembles of such factors function at complex mammalian loci. Considerable progress has been made in analyzing how members of the GATA transcription factor family (GATA-1 to -6) establish transcriptional networks that orchestrate developmental processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation into diverse blood cell types (3Bresnick E.H.

In addition to conferring developmental control, GATA factors can function in certain differentiated cell types, including endothelial cells. GATA-2 was initially identified as an activator of endothelin-1 expression in endothelial cells (5Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

The -1.8 and -2.8 sites are active predominantly in G1E cells, the -77 and -3.9 sites are similarly active in MEL and G1E cells, and whereas the +9.5 site has activity in both cells, the activity in G1E cells is considerably greater. Thus, despite the common feature of binding GATA factors, the enhancer activities of these elements in cultured hematopoietic cells differ. Furthermore, whereas GATA-1-mediated repression stimulates histone deacetylation at the Gata2 open reading frame and extending ∼4 kb upstream, encompassing four of the five GATA switch sites, histone acetylation at the -77 kb site is unaltered (29Grass J.A.

In principle, context-dependent functions can arise at the level of chromatin occupancy or postchromatin occupancy. Although GATA motifs are abundant throughout the genome, only a small subset are occupied in cells (29Grass J.A. Jing H. Kim S-I. Martowicz M.L. Pal S. Blobel G.A. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell.

Parameters that govern GATA motif occupancy include intrinsic features of the motifs, their relationship to nearest neighbor cis-elements, and the surrounding chromatin environment (39Bresnick E.H. Johnson K.D. Kim S-I. Im H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2006; 81: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since four of the five GATA switch sites can be occupied by either GATA-1 or GATA-2 at distinct stages of erythropoiesis (27Martowicz M.L. Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Guend H. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol.

Context-dependent post-chromatin occupancy activities can involve the combinatorial arrangement of GATA motifs with neighboring cis-elements; a particularly instructive example involves an Ets motif adjacent to a GATA motif. This configuration allows a GATA-1-FOG-1 complex to activate the megakaryocytic αIIB promoter in a transient transfection assay; without the Ets motif, the GATA-1-FOG-1 complex represses the reporter (40Wang X.

Considerably less is known about factors that function with GATA-2, but classical transcription factors, such as Sp1 (48Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Enhancer activities in transfection assays often do not recapitulate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, and therefore we tested whether GATA switch sites at the Gata2 locus have distinct enhancer activities in transgenic mouse embryos. We demonstrate that the +9.5 GATA switch site functions autonomously as a strong enhancer in endothelial cells and the fetal liver, a major site of erythropoiesis during embryogenesis. By contrast, the -3.9 GATA switch site, which binds GATA-1 and GATA-2 in erythroid precursor cells (27Martowicz M.L. Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Guend H. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), lacks autonomous activity in vivo and has little to no activity in cultured endothelial cells. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the +9.5 enhancer critically requires a core module, consisting of a GATA motif and a neighboring E-box, in both endothelial cells and erythroid precursor cells. Surprisingly, although the core module was sufficient for enhancer activity in the erythroid precursor cell line, its enhancer function in primary human endothelial cells required additional regulatory modules. These studies provide evidence that the combinatorial usage of enhancer modules can establish context-dependent GATA factor functions. Cell Culture—HUVECs and HAECs (Cascade Biologics) were maintained in Medium 200 (Cascade Biologics) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and Low Serum Growth Supplement (Cascade Biologics). G1E cells (31Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Gibco/Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen), 2 units/ml erythropoietin, 120 nm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 0.6% conditioned medium from a Kit ligand-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell line, and 15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—GATA-2 sequences were cloned from a murine 129SV bacterial artificial chromosome DNA isolated by Research Genetics/Invitrogen. Primers used to amplify genomic regions of Gata2 for the creation of the plasmid constructs used herein are available upon request. The integrity of cloned sequences was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The pGL3basic luciferase reporter plasmid was obtained from Promega. For LacZ reporter constructs, sequences identical to the respective transient construct were cloned into the pSVβ vector (Clontech). Generation of the 1SLuc, (-3.9)1SLuc, (-1.8)1SLuc, (+9.5)1SLuc, and (+9.5 mtG-1,2,3)1SLuc constructs was described previously (27Martowicz M.L. Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Guend H. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol.

The (+9.5 mtG-2)1SLuc and (+9.5 mtE)1SLuc constructs were generated by replacing the central GATA motif (AGATAA) with an EcoRI site (GAATTC), whereas the E-box (CATCTG) was replaced by a SalI site (GTCGAC). The individual 5′ and 3′ arm deletions, as well as the 5′ arm truncations (1Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2004; 116: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G.

For concurrent deletion of both the 5′ and 3′ arms of the +9.5 site, oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the 1SLuc plasmid digested with KpnI and XhoI. Similarly, insertion of the +9.5 GATA motifs/E-box in place of the -3.9 GATA sites was accomplished by ligating two sets of annealed oligonucleotides into the (-3.9)1SLuc plasmid digested with HinfI and NcoI. Finally, the -3.9 kb GATA motifs were inserted in place of the +9.5 GATA motifs/E-box by using chimeric primers partially homologous to the (+9.5)1SLuc template and partially nonhomologous (the -3.9 GATA motifs). The purified amplicon was digested with MboI and RsrII and ligated into an identically digested (+9.5)1SLuc plasmid. The 5′ arm was cloned upstream of pGL3pro (Promega), containing the SV40 promoter, to generate (+9.5 5′arm)SV40Luc. Transient Transfection Assay—HUVECs and HAECs were plated 1 day prior to transfection and were ∼60-70% confluent at the time of transfection. An equal amount of each plasmid (2 μg) was added to 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) reduced serum medium, incubated with Lipofectin reagent (6 μl/1 μg of DNA; Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 3 h before the readdition of Medium 200. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h post-transfection and were assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). G1E cell transfections were conducted as described previously (29Grass J.A. Jing H. Kim S-I. Martowicz M.L. Pal S. Blobel G.A. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of the lysate, as determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using γ-globulin as a standard. At least two independent preparations of each plasmid were analyzed. Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice harboring LacZ reporter constructs were generated by standard procedures by the University of Wisconsin Transgenic Animal Facility. Briefly, DNA constructs for F0 transgenic analysis were linearized, purified with an Elutip-d column (Schleicher & Schuell), and microinjected into fertilized mouse oocytes. To identify embryos containing LacZ transgenes, genomic DNA from yolk sac was subjected to PCR analysis with the following primers: LacZ Forward (5′-GATCTTCCTGAGGCCGATACTGTCGTCGTCCCCTCA-3′) and LacZ Reverse (5′-GTAGTCGGTTTATGCAGCAACGAGACGTCACGG-3′). For whole mount analysis, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-galactoside (X-gal; Sigma) staining was performed with E11 embryos as described previously (62Onodera K. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Ohta J.

Embryos were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Embryos were washed twice with PBS and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, and X-gal (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS. After X-gal staining, embryos were washed twice with PBS and postfixed with 4% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. For tissue sections, the post-fixed embryos were dehydrated through progressive washes in 50, 70, 85, 95, and 100% ethanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin and dried overnight at room temperature before being sectioned. The sectioned embryos (10 μm) were counter-stained with 0.1% Nuclear Fast Red staining solution in 5% aluminum sulfate. Distinct Functions of Gata2 Locus GATA Switch Sites in Vivo—GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupy five highly conserved regions (Fig. 1) of the Gata2 locus in erythroid precursor cells, and these GATA switch sites confer qualitatively and quantitatively distinct enhancer activities in GATA-1- and GATA-2-expressing hematopoietic cells in vitro (26Grass J.A.

To determine if the differential activities in vitro reflect unique activities in vivo, we analyzed the +9.5 and -3.9 sites in F0 transgenic mouse embryos. These elements, located at +9.5 and -3.9 kb relative to the Gata2 1S promoter, were cloned upstream of the 1S promoter fused to LacZ, injected into mouse oocytes, and implanted into recipient females. Embryos were harvested at E11 and stained with X-gal to reveal LacZ expression. The (+9.5)1SLacZ transgene displayed a reproducible expression pattern in 7 of the 31 embryos containing the LacZ transgene (Fig. 2A). The remaining embryos showed no detectable transgene expression. Transverse sections of all seven expressing embryos revealed expression throughout vascular endothelium, in endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart, and in a subset of cells in the fetal liver (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1), which is heavily colonized with GATA-1- and GATA-2-expressing hematopoietic precursor cells at E11 (53McGrath K.E.

Although quantitative differences in expression were apparent (compare whole mount images of two representative (+9.5)1SLacZ embryos in Fig. 2A), no ectopic staining was detected. Thus, the +9.5 element confers enhancer activity in multiple sites of endogenous Gata2 expression.FIGURE 2Endothelial enhancer activity of Gata2 +9. 5 site in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2058569591,"Regulated membrane fusion requires organelle tethering, enrichment of selected proteins and lipids at the fusion site, bilayer distortion, and lipid rearrangement. Yeast vacuole homotypic fusion requires regulatory lipids (ergosterol, diacylglycerol, and phosphoinositides), the Rab family GTPase Ypt7p, the multisubunit Ypt7p-effector complex HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting), and four SNAREs. One SNARE, Vam7p, has an N-terminal PX domain which binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and to HOPS and a C-terminal SNARE domain but no apolar membrane anchor. We have exploited an in vitro reaction of vacuole fusion to analyze the functions of each domain, removing the PX domain or mutating it to abolish its PI(3)P affinity. Lowering the PI(3)P affinity of the PX domain, or even deleting the PX domain, affects the fusion Km for Vam7p but not the maximal fusion rate. Fusion driven by the SNARE domain alone is strikingly enhanced by the PLC inhibitor U73122 through enhanced binding of Vam7p SNARE domain to vacuoles, and the further addition of Plc1p blocks this U73122 effect. The PX domain, through its affinities for phosphoinositides and HOPS, is thus exclusively required for enhancing the targeting of Vam7p rather than for execution of the Vam7p functions in HOPS·SNARE complex assembly and fusion. Regulated membrane fusion requires organelle tethering, enrichment of selected proteins and lipids at the fusion site, bilayer distortion, and lipid rearrangement.

The PX domain, through its affinities for phosphoinositides and HOPS, is thus exclusively required for enhancing the targeting of Vam7p rather than for execution of the Vam7p functions in HOPS·SNARE complex assembly and fusion. Regulated membrane fusion is central to neurotransmission, hormone secretion, and all constitutive intracellular vesicular traffic. Fusion entails docking, the enrichment of certain proteins and lipids at fusion sites, and bilayer rearrangement. We have studied these processes with the vacuole of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which undergoes constant fusion and fission as part of the cellular response to changes in osmolarity (1Bone N. Millar J.B. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Yeast vacuole fusion requires ergosterol, phosphoinositides, and diacylglycerol, and these chemically minor but functionally important lipids are termed “regulatory lipids” (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y.

SNARE proteins form coiled-coil complexes through super-helical bundling of four conserved SNARE domains. At the center of each SNARE complex one finds a set of conserved polar residues, 3 glutamines (Q) and 1 arginine (R), each from a separate SNARE domain. Yeast vacuoles have 3 Q-SNAREs (Vam7p, Vam3p, and Vti1p), which can form a subcomplex termed the t-SNARE and 1 R-SNARE (Nyv1p). The Vps39p subunit of HOPS has nucleotide exchange activity for Ypt7p (3Wurmser A.E. Sato T.K. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the HOPS complex binds selectively to the GTP form of Ypt7p (4Seals D.F. Eitzen G. Margolis N. Wickner W.T. Price A. Proc.

A portion of the vacuolar HOPS is bound to SNARE complexes, perhaps through its Vps33p subunit, a SM family member. Docked yeast vacuoles do not simply touch at a point like spheres, but are apparently drawn against each other until each pair has two closely apposed disc-shaped microdomains, termed “boundary membrane”, as well as “outside membrane,” which is not in contact. The ring-shaped region where the boundary and outside domains meet is termed the “vertex ring” domain. Each of the regulatory lipids, as well as Ytp7p, HOPS, and the SNAREs, become enriched at the vertex ring, and fusion occurs around the ring, joining the outside membranes to form the larger, fused organelle and joining the boundary membranes to form a lumenal vesicle (2Fratti R.A.

Each agent that interferes with vertex enrichment of proteins or lipids blocks fusion, and thus enrichment is believed to be required for the bilayer rearrangements of fusion per se. The proteins depend on each other for their vertex enrichment (6Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Wang L. Merz A.J. Collins K.M. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the lipids are also interdependent in this regard (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, the lipids depend on proteins such as the SNAREs for their vertex enrichment, and free regulatory lipids are needed for the SNAREs, Ypt7p, and HOPS to become vertex enriched as well (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Not all vertices in docked vacuole clusters show equal enrichment of fusion proteins and lipids, but those vertices enriched in one factor are enriched for many others as well (8Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vertex assembly is not a series of irreversible, ordered steps but rather appears to be a cooperative or reversible series of subreactions in constant flux (8Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each SNARE protein must contain information for membrane association, for sorting to the vacuole, for enrichment at the functional vertex microdomain, and for interactions with the other SNAREs and with HOPS. The resolution of these functions may be confounded by overlapping requirements for each of these functions and for protein folding. One SNARE, Vam7p, is especially amenable to biochemical analysis to address this question. Vam7p has no apolar membrane anchor but rather consists of an N-terminal PX domain with direct affinity for HOPS and for PI(3)P and a C-terminal Q-SNARE domain. All the Vam7p on purified vacuoles is present in cis-SNARE complexes and requires Sec17/18p and ATP to liberate it for trans-SNARE complex assembly. Recombinant Vam7p can be purified without detergents and added to intact vacuoles, thereby bypassing the need for Sec17p/18p and ATP for cis-SNARE complex disassembly (9Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test the roles of the domains of Vam7p, we have mutated VAM7 to either eliminate its affinity for PI(3)P by the well characterized Y42A mutation (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in the PX domain or to delete the PX domain altogether. Vam7pY42A shows a higher Km for supporting vacuole fusion, consistent with the affinity of Vam7p for PI(3)P contributing to its membrane targeting. Surprisingly, complete deletion of the PX domain leaves a SNARE domain which can still support membrane fusion, albeit with a yet further increased Km for the SNARE domain (SD). The fusion that is supported by the SD alone is strongly stimulated by the PLC inhibitor U73122, caused by enhanced association of SD with the vacuole membrane. Thus the PX domain of Vam7p, with its affinities for PI(3)P and for HOPS, has a central role in targeting the SNARE domain but is not required for the ensuing fusion per se.

Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion Assay—Vacuoles were isolated from the yeast strains BJ3505 (23Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and DKY6281 (24Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Standard fusion reactions (30 μl) contained 3 μg of BJ3505 vacuoles with inactive pro-Pho8p (pro-alkaline phosphatase) but lacking the protease Pep4p, 3 μg of DKY6281 vacuoles containing Pep4p but lacking Pho8p, standard fusion reaction buffer (125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol), ATP regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase), 10 μm coenzyme A (13Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and 930 nm IB2. After 90 min at 27 °C, Pho8p activity was assayed in 250 mm TrisCl, pH 8.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate. One unit of fusion is 1 μmol of p-nitrophenolate produced per min per μg of BJ3505 vacuoles. p-Nitrophenolate absorbance was measured at 400 nm. Vam7p has 2 domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal Phox homology (PX) domain binds to HOPS (5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and to the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), while the C-terminal SD associates with the SDs of Vti1p, Vam3p, and Nyv1p to form a four helical bundle. Here we examine the effects of mutating or deleting the PX domain of Vam7p on vacuole fusion and its subreactions. To analyze the role of lipid binding to the PX domain, we introduced a mutation at a critical tyrosine (Y42A), which abolishes its affinity for PI(3)P (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The overall function of the PX domain was evaluated by deletion. Vam7p can combine with the soluble domains of Vam3p and Vti1p to form inhibitory ternary complexes (8Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); Vam7pY42A is just as active as wild-type Vam7p in this regard, 4R. A. Fratti, K. M. Collins, C. M. Hickey, and W. Wickner, submitted for publication. and we therefore studied its activity in fusion assays. Vam7pY42A Supports Fusion in the Absence of ATP—Since Vam7p has no apolar membrane anchor, it can be produced in bacteria, purified in the absence of detergent, and added to in vitro fusion assays. Although the other SNAREs are present on isolated vacuoles in the unpaired state as well as in SNARE complexes, all the Vam7p on purified vacuoles appears to be in cis-SNARE complexes. In standard fusion reactions with ATP, the disassembly of these complexes by Sec18p and Sec17p provides the Vam7p for trans-SNARE complex formation. For this reason, the requirement for Sec18p/Sec17p and for ATP can be “bypassed” by added recombinant Vam7p (9Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, and thus ATP-dependent priming, Vam7pY42A supported fusion as effectively as wild-type Vam7p, albeit with a 5-fold higher Km (Fig. 2A). Vam7pY42A may still be able to function because, in addition to PI(3)P, other vacuole receptors for Vam7p such as HOPS (5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) contribute to its productive association with the vacuole. ATP is required for many vacuole functions in addition to priming, such as establishing gradients across the vacuole membrane. We therefore also tested conditions where, in the presence of ATP, priming is blocked by antibody to Sec17p and fusion is rescued by the addition of exogenous Vam7p (9Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Wild-type Vam7p bypassed this anti-Sec17p block with a Km of ∼15 nm (Fig. 2B); fusion was inhibited by the highest levels of added Vam7p, perhaps due to sequestration of phosphoinositides or HOPS by its PX domain (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, Vam7pY42A only showed a weak bypass of the anti-Sec17p block; even micromolar concentrations Vam7pY42A promoted less fusion than wildtype Vam7p (Fig. 2B), in contrast to the activity of Vam7pY42A in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that an ATP-dependent activity inhibits the ability of Vam7pY42A to support fusion. For each bypass fusion condition and for each form of Vam7p, the overall level of Vam7p association with vacuoles was indistinguishable (data not shown). The bypass fusion supported by Vam7pY42A in the absence of ATP showed similar sensitivities to well characterized protein and lipid-targeted reaction inhibitors as the reaction with wild-type Vam7p (supplemental Fig. 1). Physical Interactions of Vam7p with SNAREs and HOPS—Since Vam7pY42A binds to vacuoles yet differentially supports fusion, we examined its capacity to form protein complexes with SNAREs and HOPS. For this study, vacuole fusion was blocked for 15 min by antibody to Sec17p, secondary inhibitors were added and, after 5 min, the priming block was rescued by the addition of 400 nm Vam7p or Vam7pY42A (Fig. 3A), a level where Vam7Y42A supports reduced but measurable fusion activity (Fig. 2B). As reported (25Collins K.M. Thorngren N.L. Fratti R.A. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1775-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), wildtype Vam7p relieves the anti-Sec17p block to fusion (Fig. 3C) and enters into complexes with the SNARES Nyv1p and Vam3p (Fig. 3B). These interactions were sensitive to antibodies to Vam3p and Vps33p but were only partially inhibited by extraction of Ypt7p from vacuoles by the combined actions of the GTPase-activating protein Gyp1-46 and GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). This may reflect the recently reported capacity of Vam7p to enter nonproductive complexes with other SNAREs in a Ypt7p-independent manner (8Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vam7Y42A also interacted with SNAREs and HOPS as seen with wild-type Vam7p, albeit at clearly reduced levels, and these associations were also sensitive to antibodies against Vam3p and Vps33p. These reduced physical interactions are in accord with the reduced fusion. The SNARE Domain of Vam7p Promotes Vacuole Fusion—The PX domain of Vam7p contributes to membrane targeting through its affinities for PI(3)P (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and HOPS (5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and may be primarily required for membrane targeting. To test whether the PX domain has additional essential functions, we purified the SD of Vam7p and assayed its ability to support fusion. High concentrations of the SD of Vam7p (1-10 μm) support vacuole fusion, but only in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4A). These concentrations are ∼100-fold higher than the Vam7Y42A needed for fusion under the same assay conditions (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the affinities of the PX domain of Vam7p for HOPS and PI(3)P are important to target Vam7p for its function. To test whether this fusion supported by the SD domain was on the physiological pathway, we used a panel of well studied fusion inhibitors. Fusion was sensitive to most standard inhibitors, such as antibodies to the SNARE Vam3p, Vps33p (the SM subunit of HOPS), or the Rab Ypt7p, or to many (but not all) lipid ligands (Fig. 4B). In the presence of ATP, where SD supports very little bypass fusion (Fig. 4A), we observed a striking enhancement of SD-mediated fusion by the PLC inhibitor U73122 (Fig. 5A). The specificity of this stimulation is shown by its sensitivity to the addition of recombinant yeast Plc1p, by the fact that stimulation was not seen with the analog U73343 (which does not inhibit phospholipase C (26Staxen I.I. Pical C. Montgomery L.T. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. McAinsh M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)) and by its sensitivity to affinity-purified antibody to Vam3p (Fig. 5A) and other reaction pathway inhibitors (data not shown). U73122 only stimulated fusion over a narrow range of SD concentrations (Fig. 5B). In the absence of ATP, where little fusion was seen with μm or lower levels of SD (Fig. 4A), U73122 allowed even 0.1 μm SD to strongly stimulate fusion (Fig. 5C). In the absence of ATP or U73122, the substantial fusion supported by 1-10 μm SD is strongly inhibited by U73433. Even though U73433 does not inhibit PLC activity (26Staxen I.I. Pical C. Montgomery L.T. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. McAinsh M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), it might bind to PLC in a manner that interferes with its localization or other proper regulation. In the presence of U73122, high levels of SD cause a striking inhibition of fusion (Fig. 5, B and C, black circles) even where fusion is seen when the U73122 is omitted (Fig. 5C, open circles, 1-10 μm SD). High SD inhibition may be best understood when the full range of ATP effects on this reaction are further explored. Thus the composition of vacuole lipids is intimately involved with the activity of the Vam7p SD for fusion.FIGURE 5The PLC inhibitor U73122 augments SD-mediated fusion. A, fusion reactions blocked with anti-Sec17 were incubated with 1 μm SD, 1.6 μm U73122, 1 μm U73343, 2.7 μm Plc1p, 190 nm α-Vam3, or 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as indicated. Data represent mean fusion ± S.E. (n = 3). B and C, fusion reactions blocked with α-Sec17p were incubated with SD at the indicated concentrations in the presence (B) or absence (C) of ATP and with U73122, U73343 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since U73122 only supports bypass fusion over a restricted range of SD concentration, we examined the associations of SD when incubated with vacuoles in the presence or absence of this PLC inhibitor. U73122 dramatically enhanced the binding of S.D. to the vacuoles (Fig. 6, lane 5 versus lane 3), and this was accompanied by an increased level of SD-associated SNAREs and HOPS. Fusion, and at least some of the associations of SNAREs and HOPS with the bound SD, was sensitive to antibody to Vam3p or Vps33p or to Ypt7p extraction by the action of purified Gyp1-46 and Gdi1p, although these had only small effects on the association of SD with the vacuole. The facile production of large quantities of recombinant soluble Vam7p and Vam7-derived proteins enables mechanistic studies that distinguish binding to the vacuole, assembly into functional complexes with other SNAREs and HOPS, and catalysis of fusion. We observe dramatic shifts in the Km for Vam7 or Vam7 mutants, from the 10-20 nanomolar for wild-type Vam7p to micromolar levels for Vam7 SNARE domain, yet when the Km for each form of Vam7 is satisfied, the rate of the fusion reaction is essentially normal. Although this suggests that the assembly of the mutant Vam7p into a functional complex is impaired and requires higher concentrations, the assembled complex functions normally, as confirmed by sensitivities to our characterized fusion pathway inhibitors. Several affinities combine to promote the vacuole association of Vam7p. Although there is a substantial kinetic window between Sec17/18p-mediated disassembly of cis-SNARE complexes and the formation of trans-SNARE complexes (27Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), little Vam7p is released from vacuoles after priming during normal fusion incubations unless the regulatory lipids are sequestered by ligands (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), Ypt7p is inactivated (28Ungermann C. Price A. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8889-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which can also cause release of HOPS (29Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), or priming is performed on ice (14Boeddinghaus C. Merz A.J. Laage R. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus the affinities of Vam7p for HOPS (5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and for PI(3)P (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) contribute to the Vam7p membrane association yet do not suffice for its continued membrane association in the absence of SNARE complex formation. The ability of high levels of Vam7-SNARE domain to support fusion shows that the HOPS and PI(3)P “receptors” for the Vam7p PX domain promote Vam7p association with the other SNAREs in a strongly facilitative, yet not obligatory, fashion. The PX domain of Vam7p serves exclusively as a targeting domain, since a point mutation of Vam7p which inactivates its binding to PI(3)P simply requires higher levels to support fusion, and high concentrations of the SNARE domain alone suffice for fusion. It is unclear whether Vam7p can bind to HOPS, PI(3)P, and to other SNAREs at the same time or whether some of these interactions are mutually exclusive or are normally sequential. The PLC inhibitor U73122, which normally blocks standard vacuole fusion reactions (30Jun Y. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53186-53195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), promotes fusion driven by the SNARE domain of Vam7p and eliminates the otherwise striking inhibition of this fusion by ATP (Fig. 5). The enhanced association of SD with vacuoles in the presence of U73122 may reflect some affinity of this domain for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, although little such affinity was seen in preliminary studies (data not shown). The absence of the PX domain may elicit a need for compensatory adjustment in the proportion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and diacylglycerol at the fusion-active vertex ring. These data underscore the intimate relationship between SNARE function and lipid topology and composition. SNAREs regulate the vertex enrichment of phosphoinositides, which in turn are needed for normal SNARE vertex enrichment (2Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The HOPS·SNARE complex could bind phosphoinositides through the affinities of both HOPS (5Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Vam7p (10Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W1997964946,"HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of the adult T cell leukemialymphoma (ATLL). The viral regulatory protein Tax plays a central role in leukemogenesis as a transcriptional transactivator of both viral and cellular gene expression, and this requires Tax activity in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms involved in the nuclear localization of Tax. Employing a GFP fusion expression system and a range of Tax mutants, we could confirm that the N-terminal 60 amino acids, and specifically residues within the zinc finger motif in this region, are important for nuclear localization. Using an in vitro nuclear import assay, it could be demonstrated that the transportation of Tax to the nucleus required neither energy nor carrier proteins. Specific and direct binding between Tax and p62, a nucleoporin with which the importin beta family of proteins have been known to interact was also observed. The nuclear import activity of wild type Tax and its mutants and their binding affinity for p62 were also clearly correlated, suggesting that the entry of Tax into the nucleus involves a direct interaction with nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The nuclear export of Tax was also shown to be carrier independent. It could be also demonstrated that Tax it self may have a carrier function and that the NF-κB subunit p65 could be imported into the nucleus by Tax. These studies suggest that Tax could alter the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of cellular proteins, and this could contribute to the deregulation of cellular processes observed in HTLV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2058769459,"The c-Myb protein belongs to a group of early hematopoietic transcription factors that are important for progenitor generation and proliferation. These factors have been hypothesized to participate in establishing chromatin patterns specific for hematopoietic genes. In a two-hybrid screening we identified the chromatin remodeling factor Mi-2α as an interaction partner for human c-Myb. The main interacting domains were mapped to the N-terminal region of Mi-2α and the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb. Surprisingly, functional analysis revealed that Mi-2α, previously studied as a subunit in the NuRD co-repressor complex, enhanced c-Myb-dependent reporter activation. Consistently, knock-down of endogenous Mi-2α in c-Myb-expressing K562 cells, led to down-regulation of the c-Myb target genes NMU and ADA. When wild-type and helicase-dead Mi-2α were compared, the Myb-Mi-2α co-activation appeared to be independent of the ATPase/DNA helicase activity of Mi-2α. The rationale for the unexpected co-activator function seems to lie in a dual function of Mi-2α, by which this factor is able to repress transcription in a helicase-dependent and activate in a helicase-independent fashion, as revealed by Gal4-tethering experiments. Interestingly, desumoylation of c-Myb potentiated the Myb-Mi-2α transactivational co-operation, as did co-transfection with p300. The c-Myb protein belongs to a group of early hematopoietic transcription factors that are important for progenitor generation and proliferation. These factors have been hypothesized to participate in establishing chromatin patterns specific for hematopoietic genes. In a two-hybrid screening we identified the chromatin remodeling factor Mi-2α as an interaction partner for human c-Myb. The main interacting domains were mapped to the N-terminal region of Mi-2α and the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb. Surprisingly, functional analysis revealed that Mi-2α, previously studied as a subunit in the NuRD co-repressor complex, enhanced c-Myb-dependent reporter activation. Consistently, knock-down of endogenous Mi-2α in c-Myb-expressing K562 cells, led to down-regulation of the c-Myb target genes NMU and ADA. When wild-type and helicase-dead Mi-2α were compared, the Myb-Mi-2α co-activation appeared to be independent of the ATPase/DNA helicase activity of Mi-2α. The rationale for the unexpected co-activator function seems to lie in a dual function of Mi-2α, by which this factor is able to repress transcription in a helicase-dependent and activate in a helicase-independent fashion, as revealed by Gal4-tethering experiments. Interestingly, desumoylation of c-Myb potentiated the Myb-Mi-2α transactivational co-operation, as did co-transfection with p300. The c-Myb transcription factor plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, in particular in hematopoietic progenitor cells (1Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Studies in mice have shown that c-Myb is essential for normal hematopoiesis to take place (2Mucenski M.L. McLain K.

The transcription factor controls crucial steps at several stages during T- and B-cell development (3Allen 3rd, R.D. Bender T.P. Siu G.

Vegiopoulos A. Harman B. Jenkinson E. Anderson G. Frampton J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Two recent screening studies in mice, where genome-wide ENU mutagenesis was employed to identify genes controlling specific hematopoietic processes, both hit the c-myb gene as the main affected locus. One study identified a point mutation in c-myb that causes thrombocytosis, megakaryocytosis, anemia, lymphopenia, and lack of eosinophils (7Sandberg M.L. Sutton S.E. Pletcher M.T. Wiltshire T. Tarantino L.M. Hogenesch J.B. Cooke M.P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas the other study identified two point mutations that were able to rescue mice from a myeloproliferative syndrome with supraphysiological expansion of megakaryocyte and platelet production (8Carpinelli M.R. Hilton D.J. Metcalf D. Antonchuk J.L. Hyland C.D. Mifsud S.L. Di Rago L. Hilton A.A. Willson T.A. Roberts A.W. Ramsay R.G. Nicola N.A. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6553-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Transcription factors are typically regulated by, and exert their function in, larger protein complexes. Several proteins have been reported to interact with different subdomains of c-Myb and influence its activity (9Ness S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the first successful two-hybrid screening using full-length c-Myb as bait, which identified the SUMO-1 conjugase Ubc9 as a novel Myb-interacting protein (10Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we report that c-Myb also interacts with the chromatin remodeling factor Mi-2α, identified in the same screening.The recruitment of cofactors is a necessity to effectuate transcriptional regulation that converges at the chromatin level. Several cofactors harbor enzymatic activities capable of modifying histone tails and/or remodeling nucleosomes, which influence the chromatin dynamics. Today, modulation of chromatin dynamics is recognized as a fundamental way to regulate gene expression (11Khorasanizadeh S. Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 12Eberharter A. Becker P.B. J.

Both co-activator and co-repressor complexes seem to possess ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and/or histone-modifying activity.Mi-2α/CHD3 was originally identified as an autoantigen in the human connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis (14Ge Q.

Mi-2α and -β are integral components of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase) co-repressor complex and responsible for its chromatin remodeling activity. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the composition of the NuRD complex (17Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), probably reflecting its heterogeneity as well as its tissue and target specificity. In short, the consensus NuRD complex consists of the core subunits: HDAC1 and -2, RbAp46 and -48, Mi-2α and/or -β (18Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher Jr., F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In the present work, we report the identification of Mi-2α as an interaction partner of human c-Myb. The association has been confirmed by several interaction assays. We also provide evidence for a dual function of Mi-2α. Depending on context, Mi-2α is able to repress transcription in a helicase-dependent fashion and activate in a helicase-independent fashion, as revealed by Gal4-tethering experiments. In a c-Myb context, the latter dominates, causing Mi-2α to act as a co-activator of c-Myb, as seen both in transfection experiments and after knock-down of Mi-2α. Desumoylation of c-Myb as well as co-transfection with p300 further potentiate the Myb-Mi-2α transactivational co-operation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The low-copy number bait plasmid pDBT-hcM was used for expression of full-length human c-Myb in the two-hybrid screening (10Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Different regions of c-MYB (designated DBD, TAD, FAETL, TP, EVES, TAC, FAC, and TPC; Table 1 and Fig. 2A) were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare) or pGEX-KG (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) for expression of GST fusion proteins. The pGEX-2TK-SUMO-1 was kindly provided by Prof. G.

Mattei M.G. Galibert F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), covering the cDNA of Mi-2α from bp 945 to bp 6005, relative to ATG and a commercially bought construct pUC57-NTD-Mi-2α (GeneScript) covering the cDNA of Mi-2α from bp 1 to bp 974 relative to ATG) and the vector pCIneoB-3FLAG (unpublished construct; pCIneo from Promega). The mammalian expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1–315) of Mi-2α (pCIneoB-3FLAG-Mi2α-NTD) was made by subcloning the region encoding the N-terminal Mi-2α (GeneScript) from pUC57-NTD-Mi-2α into pCIneoB-3FLAG. To generate a plasmid for expression of the C-terminal domain, (c-Myb interaction domain) in mammalian cells (pCIneoB-3FLAG-Mi2α-CTD), the region encoding the amino acid residues 1655–2000, was amplified by PCR and inserted into pCIneo-3FLAG. The plasmid encoding the Mi-2α helicasedead mutant K767A was generated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on a subfragment of human Mi-2α.The mammalian expression vectors pCIneo-hcM-HA and pCIneo-hcM-HA-2KR (encoding wild type and sumoylation-deficient c-Myb, respectively) have been described (10Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). pCIneo-hcM-SUMO-1 was constructed by PCR amplification and modification of SUMO-1 from the appropriate IMAGE clone, followed by subcloning in-frame into pCIneo-hcM-HA (between PshAI and SalI), losing the HA tag, but gaining SUMO-1 in the expressed product.The p300 expressing mammalian vector pCMVβ-NHA-p300 was a kind gift from Prof. David Livingston and has been described previously (26Grossman S.R.

Gabrielsen O.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The mammalian expression vectors for Gal4-DBD fused to Mi-2α wild-type and K767A were made by PCR amplification of Gal4-DBD from the yeast vector pDBT (28Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subcloning into pCIneo (Promega), generating pCIneo-GBD2. Thereafter, Mi-2α wild-type and K767A were cloned in-frame into pCIneo-GBD2 yielding pCIneo-GBD2-Mi-2α and pCIneo-GBD2-Mi2α-K767A. The Gal4-tethering constructs pCIneo-GBD2-Mi2α-NTD and pCIneo-GBD1-Mi2α-ΔNTD encoding amino acid residues 1–315 and 316–2000, respectively, were made from pCIneo-GBD2-Mi2α by removing the PshAI-NotI fragment, filling in the gaps with Klenow and religating (Mi2α-NTD), or by subcloning the PshAI-BamHI fragment into pCIneo-GBD1 (alternative MCS) between SmaI and BamHI (Mi2α-ΔNTD). pCIneo-hcM-VP16–2KR was made by PCR amplifying the region encoding the VP16 transactivation domain (TAD) from pDBD11 described previously (29Bonner J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cloning it in-frame into pCIneo-hcM-HA-2KR, loosing the HA tag, but gaining VP16 TAD in the expressed product.The TRHR reporter, pGL2b-TRHR-1250 covering the area –1250 to +1 from the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor promoter has been described (30Matre V.

The SNRPN-driven Gal4 responsive luciferase reporter was made by PCR amplification of the SNRPN promoter (–942 to –426) from genomic human DNA. This promoter region was subcloned into pGL3 Basic (E1751; Promega). Thereafter, the 5×Gal4 responsive element (5×GRE) region was PCR-amplified from pGAL-tk (kind gift from Prof. U. Moens) and subcloned into pGL3b-SNRPN generating pGL3b-5GRE-SNRPN. The SV-40-driven Gal4 responsive luciferase reporter was made by PCR amplification of the SV-40 promoter from pGL3 promoter vector (E1761; Promega) and subcloning into pGL3b-5GRE-SNRPN between NheI and HindIII. This concomitantly removed the SNRPN promoter.All cloned fragments generated by PCR or by oligo-insertion were verified by sequencing. Primer sequences are available upon request.Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast two-hybrid screening has been described (10Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Proteins interacting with full-length human c-Myb were identified by growth on -Histidine plates with 5 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). The interaction between the Mi-2α (amino acid residues 1655–2000) and c-Myb was confirmed by retransformation, controlling reporter activation and assaying for β-galactosidase activity in a liquid β-Gal assay.Protein Expression—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as previously described (32Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The regions of human c-Myb expressed, spanned the amino acid residues given in Table 1. Some of the proteins (GST-TAD, GST-FAETL, GST-TAC, and GST-FAC) came in the insoluble fraction and had to be solubilized from the pellet with urea. To renature the proteins, the urea was removed by dialysis.GST Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with total cell extract from a 10-cm dish with transfected COS-1 cells lysed in 300 μl of F-buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm iodoacetate, 5 μm ZnCl2, pH adjusted to 7.10 Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). Beads were washed three times in 500 μl of F-buffer, and the proteins eluted in 20μ l of 3× SDS loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with immunoblotting.Cell Culture and Transfection, Luciferase Assays and Immunoblotting—COS-1, CV-1, and HD11 cells were grown as described (33Andersson K.B.

All three cell lines were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). For the luciferase assays, transfected CV-1 cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed in triplicate (24 well trays; 2 × 104 cells/well) using Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) and data from at least three independent transfection experiments are presented. In parallel transfected CV-1 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer and subjected to immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS-1 or CV-1 cells (15-cm dishes; 2.25 × 106 cells/dish; 1 dish per IP) were harvested 24 h after transfection in 300 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture), debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was diluted 1:1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Then 500 μl of diluted lysate (75 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitation was performed on a roller at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times in 300 μl of wash buffer (75 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and the proteins eluted in 70 μl Laemmli buffer with 5% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with immunoblotting.Antibodies—As immunoprecipitation antibodies we used anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (F3165, Sigma), anti-GST (27-4577-01, GE Healthcare) and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (17-0618-01, GE Healthcare). For immunoblot detection the following antibodies were used; the murine Myb 5e11 antibody (35Sleeman J.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1931-1941PubMed Google Scholar), anti-FLAG (described above), mouse anti-human p300 (33-7600, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-PML, (H238; sc-5621, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH-HRP (H86504P Biodesign, International), anti-mouse IgG-HRP (NA931, GE Healthcare) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (NA934, GE Healthcare).RNA Interference—K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with GlutaMAX™ (Invitrogen) to a density of ∼6 × 105 cells/ml. 1 × 106 cells were then nucleofected using the Cell Line Nucleofector™ Kit V (Amaxa) and the Amaxa Nucleofector (program T-16), following the online protocol optimized for K562 nucleofection (Amaxa). The following modifications were made: After nucleofection the cells were directly transferred to 5 ml of preheated medium. The suspension was then centrifuged at 125 × g, 5 min to remove the medium. The cells were then grown in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 with GlutaMAX™ for 24 h before subjected to RNA isolation and immunoblotting. The K562 cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 2 μm. A pool of three Mi-2α siRNAs (siCHD3; ID 9877, 216241, 216242; 16708A, Ambion) was used for specific knock-down of Mi-2α, while siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA (d-001210–02-05, Dharmacon) was used as control.RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from K562 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification with RNeasy (Qiagen). For HD11 cells total RNA was extracted using Absolutely RNA™ RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene). Total RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript™ III (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNA was diluted 1:5, 1:50, 1:500, and 1:5000 prior to real-time PCR on a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were performed in 20-μl volumes with 0.5 μm primers and LightCycler DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green kit (Roche Applied Science). The PCR conditions were optimized for annealing at 58–60 °C for 5 s and elongation at 72 °C for 10 –14 s. The efficiency of each primer pair was calculated from the slope of the standard curve (E =–1/slope), and each standard curve was developed using the LightCycler Data File Editor (Roche Applied Science). The quantification was performed using the second derivative maximum method, and the amount of each target gene was calculated relative to the reference genes HPRT (HD11) or the POLR2A (K562). Primer sequences are available upon request.RESULTSIsolation of Mi-2α as a c-Myb-interacting Protein—To identify novel gene products that interact with c-Myb, we used full-length human c-Myb as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a mixed cDNA library (human bone marrow and human erythroleukemia cell line K562) as described previously (10Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among the positively interacting clones, we identified a sequence identical to the C-terminal region of the human zinc finger helicase (hZFH) mRNA (GenBank™ accession no. U91543), encoding a Snf2-like helicase. The hZFH cDNA was by alignment and comparison with genomic sequences found to be identical to the human chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 3 (CHD3) (GenBank™ accession no. AF006515), except for a 102-bp insert present in the C-terminal part of hZFH and a slightly extended C terminus. The clone we identified started in this 102-bp insert, which has been shown to be an optional exon (25Aubry F. Mattei M.G. Galibert F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CHD3, also designated Mi-2α, is reported to be one of two helicase subunits of the NuRD complex (19Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Because hZFH appears to be an alternative splice variant of Mi-2α, we have designated the novel c-Myb-interacting partner as Mi-2α. The Myb-Mi-2α interaction was verified in yeast by retransformation and growth on reporter-selective media (not shown), and by reporter activation using both X-gal overlay and liquid β-gal assay (Fig. 1, A and B).FIGURE 1Isolation of Mi-2α as an interacting protein for human c-Myb. The C-terminal region of Mi-2α encoded by the library plasmid was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening with full-length human c-Myb as bait. The c-Myb-Mi-2α interaction was verified as shown. A, empty library vector (pACT2) and plasmids encoding the C-terminal domain of Mi-2α fused to Gal4-AD (pACT2-Mi2α-CTD) were transformed into the yeast two-hybrid strain PJ69–4α. Similarly, empty bait vector (pDBT), and full-length human c-Myb fused to Gal4-DBD (pDBT-hcM) were transformed into the same strain of opposite mating type (PJ69–4a). Mating was performed to make the diploid combinations indicated in the figure. These were subjected to X-gal overlay assay to reveal activation of the LacZ reporter gene as blue color. B, yeast cells were transformed and mated as in A, as indicated in the figure. The activity of the LacZ reporter was measured by a liquidβ-galactosidase assay. The results are shown as mean values ± S.E. of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mapping of the Mi-2α-interacting Domain of c-Myb—To map the Mi-2α-interacting domain in c-Myb, we performed GST pulldown experiments. From partial clones and gene synthesis, we assembled a cDNA encoding full-length Mi-2α (Fig. 2A; “Experimental Procedures”). Lysates from COS-1 cells expressing 3FLAG-Mi-2α were then analyzed for binding to a series of different GST-Myb fusion proteins (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). Strong binding was detected to GST-DBD and weaker interaction was seen with GST-FAETL, GST-TAC, and GST-FAC, the latter having in common the leucine-rich c-Myb FAETL-domain (Fig. 2B). Only background binding was observed to GST, GST-TAD, GST-TP, GST-EVES, and GST-TPC. This indicates that Mi-2α interacts both with the DNA binding domain and the FAETL region of c-Myb.To further investigate which part(s) of Mi-2α that binds to c-Myb, we used the C-terminal c-Myb-interacting domain of Mi-2α (amino acid residues 1655–2000), identified in the two-hybrid screening and an N-terminal clone, used in the full-length assembly (amino acid residues 1–315), and compared those to full-length Mi-2α. All three constructs were FLAG-tagged and lysates from COS-1 cells were analyzed for binding to a subset of GST-Myb fusion proteins (Fig. 2C). Comparison of the three Mi-2α constructs showed that the N-terminal domain of Mi-2α bound GST-DBD, while the C-terminal domain mainly bound to GST-FAETL. Hence, c-Myb and Mi-2α seem to have two interaction surfaces; one linking c-Myb DBD and the N-terminal region of Mi-2α, and another linking the C-terminal region of Mi-2α with the FAETL region of c-Myb, with the former interaction being the strongest.c-Myb and Mi-2α Interact in Vivo—Association between human c-Myb and Mi-2α was then tested by co-immunoprecipitation in lysates from transfected COS-1 cells. A band of 75 kDa corresponding to c-Myb was detected with a Myb specific monoclonal antibody (5e11) after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies (reactive toward 3FLAG-Mi-2α). Only background levels of c-Myb were detected when Mi-2α was not present, or when immunoprecipitating with irrelevant antibodies (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3c-Myb and Mi-2α interact in vivo. A, lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with empty vector or plasmids encoding human c-Myb and FLAG-tagged full-length Mi-2α, were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody or an irrelevant antibody (anti-GST), and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies for detection. 10% of the input (total cell extract) used for immunoprecipitation was loaded as reference. ProtG, protein G-Sepharose beads only. B, CV-1 cells were transfected with Gal4-DBD-fused full-length Mi-2α (0.4 μg) either alone or in combination with c-Myb-2KR fused to VP-16 (0.05 μg). The interaction was measured as luciferase activity expressed from the SNRPN-driven Gal4-responsive reporter plasmid (0.2 μg). The results are presented as relative luciferase units (RLU). The results represent the mean RLU ± S.E. of at least three independent assays performed in triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The interaction between full-length Mi-2α and full-length c-Myb was further validated in a functional context by performing mammalian two-hybrid analysis in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3B). Gal4-DBD-fused Mi-2α repressed the transcription of luciferase about 30% from an SNRPN-driven Gal4-responsive reporter construct, but activated the reporter to 215% upon co-transfection with c-Myb fused to VP-16 transactivation domain (Fig. 3B). We preferred to use the more active SUMO-conjugation negative mutant of c-Myb (designated 2KR, harboring the K503R and K527R mutations) in these experiments to get a stronger readout. The two mutated amino acid residues lie outside the interaction surface determined above. These experiments verify that c-Myb interacts with Mi-2α in vivo.To study the interaction at the endogenous level, we searched extensively for antibodies specific to Mi-2α. Seven different commercially available antibodies were tested, but unfortunately, five of them did not pick up any Mi-2 at all, one detected only Mi-2β, and one did not discriminate between Mi-2α and Mi-2β. This left us without the necessary tools to perform endogenous CoIP and ChIP.Co-expression of Mi-2α Enhances c-Myb-dependent Reporter Activation in a Helicase-independent Fashion—We expected the Mi-2α protein to exert its function as part of the NuRD complex, which possesses both chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase activity and is involved in repression of gene expression (17Bowen N.J.

https://openalex.org/W2079842211,"We have identified YkbA from Bacillus subtilis as a novel member of the l-amino acid transporter (LAT) family of amino acid transporters. The protein is ∼30% identical in amino acid sequence to the light subunits of human heteromeric amino acid transporters. Purified His-tagged YkbA from Escherichia coli membranes reconstituted in proteoliposomes exhibited sodium-independent, obligatory exchange activity for l-serine and l-threonine and also for aromatic amino acids, albeit with less activity. Thus, we propose that YkbA be renamed SteT (Ser/Thr exchanger transporter). Kinetic analysis supports a sequential mechanism of exchange for SteT. Freeze-fracture analysis of purified, functionally active SteT in proteoliposomes, together with blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy of detergent-solubilized purified SteT, suggest that the transporter exists in a monomeric form. Freeze-fracture analysis showed spherical particles with a diameter of 7.4 nm. Transmission electron microscopy revealed elliptical particles (diameters 6 × 7 nm) with a distinct central depression. To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of a prokaryotic member of the LAT family and the first structural data on an APC (amino acids, polyamines, and choline for organocations) transporter.

SteT represents an excellent model to study the molecular architecture of the light subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters and other APC transporters. The APC (amino acids, polyamines, and choline for organocations) superfamily of transport proteins includes nearly 250 members that function as solute-cation symporters and solute-solute antiporters (1Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). They occur in all phyla from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes and vary in length between 350 and 850 amino acid residues. The smaller proteins are generally of prokaryotic origin, whereas the larger ones are of eukaryotic origin and have N- and C-terminal hydrophilic extensions. Most APC members are predicted to possess 12 transmembrane (TM) 10The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; BN-PAGE, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; DM, n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; PL, proteoliposome; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; LAT, l-amino acid transporter; HAT, heteromeric amino acid transporter; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. α-helical domains. The l-amino acid transporter (LAT) family belongs to the APC superfamily. LAT family members correspond to the light subunits of the heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs), also called glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters (2Palacin M. Kanai Y. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y.

Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HATs are composed of two subunits, a polytopic membrane protein (the light subunit) and a disulfide-linked N-glycosylated type II membrane glycoprotein (the heavy subunit). The light subunit is the catalytic component of the transporter, whereas the heavy subunit appears to be essential only for trafficking to the plasma membrane. Two types of heavy subunit (4F2hc and rBAT) and 10 types of light subunit have so far been identified. A number of human pathologies have highlighted the physiological roles of HATs. For example, two transporters of this family are responsible for inherited aminoacidurias; mutations in either of the two genes coding for the subunits of system b0,+ (b0,+AT and rBAT) lead to cystinuria (MIM 220100) (5Calonge M.J.

In addition, xCT, a LAT transporter that in association with 4F2hc mediates cystine uptake and glutamate efflux (9Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol.

Berger E.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1921-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In vivo, this transport system is involved in cocaine relapse through the control of the basal levels of extrasynaptic glutamate (12Baker D.A. McFarland K. Lake R.W. Shen H. Tang X.C. Toda S.

Despite the important roles attributed to HATs, only a few studies have addressed the structure-function relationships of these transporters: (i) most HATs are obligate antiporters with a 1:1 stoichiometry (14Chillaron J. Roca R. Valencia A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F995-F1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a sequential mode of exchange has been proposed for system b0,+ (15Torras-Llort M.

Similarly, structure-function studies on the APC superfamily as a whole have been very limited and primarily related to membrane topology studies and the identification of relevant residues for substrate interaction (19Kashiwagi K.

The recent elucidation of atomic structures for several prokaryotic transporters has given key insights into the molecular dynamics of fundamental transport processes. Toward a similar increase in our understanding of amino acid transport, we describe here the identification and characterization, at the functional and structural levels, of the first example of a prokaryotic member of the LAT family: the orphan transporter YkbA (from here on referred to as SteT; see below) from Bacillus subtilis. SteT shows significant similarity to the light subunits of eukaryotic HATs not only in amino acid sequence and putative membrane topology, but also in the characteristic sequential mode of obligatory exchange. Structural analyses of SteT revealed a monomeric structure with a “donut-like shape” of 7 × 6 nm in diameters and a distinct central depression. SteT represents an excellent model for structural studies of the LAT family and of APC transporters in general. Identification and Sequence Analysis of SteT—Initial sequence analysis that led to the identification of prokaryotic homologs of LAT family transporters was performed by using the BLAST algorithm (default settings) (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) to compare all known members of the LAT family against a nonredundant protein sequence data base (nonredundant GenBank™ CDS translations + RefSeq proteins + Protein Data Bank + SwissProt + PIR + PRF). In order to study the phylogenetic relationship of SteT and PotE relative to the APC superfamily of transporters (23Chang A.B. Lin R. Keith Studley W. Tran C.V. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we first constructed a multiple protein sequence alignment of all known APC members (listed on the World Wide Web at www.tcdb.org/tcdb/superfamily.php–>) with test sequences using ProbCons (24Do C.B. Mahabhashyam M.S. Brudno M. Batzoglou S. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) in combination with manual refinements. All APC members that appeared to be too distant to provide information (i.e. that could not be properly aligned) were not further considered. The resulting alignment was further evaluated with G-BLOCKS (25Castresana J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (7408) Google Scholar) in order to select the most conserved and hence most informative regions of the multiple alignment. The latter were subsequently processed with Clustal (26Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar) to obtain a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree (1000 bootstraps with 111 random seeds). Cloning of Prokaryotic APC Transporters—Genomic DNA from Escherichia coli strain DH5α and from B. subtilis strain 168t+ was prepared from cells collected after an overnight liquid culture. Cell pellets were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.5% SDS with 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K. Three extractions with the same volume of phenol were performed with centrifugations at 5,000 × g. Next, a chloroform/ethanol precipitation gave final pellets that were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The following primers (5′-3′) were used to amplify open reading frames encoding the indicated proteins from genomic DNA by PCR: ATCTGAATTCTGATGCGCAAAGCACCCTGTT and CATTCTCGAGAGAAAGGGCGATCATTCAATC for PotE and ATCTGAATTCTCCTCCACATTACATAACATCA and CATTCTCGAGAGTCCACGGTGCTTTTATCAAT for YhfM from E. coli and ATCAGAATTCGAAGCTTCAACATCATAGGAG and CTATCTCGAGTCCTGTCAACTTTTATCTTCTG for SteT and ATGTGAATTCCAATATAATACAACAAGAACTGC and TCTACTCGAGTATCGCTTCATCTGTGTGTC for YfnA from B. subtilis. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into a pBlueScript vector (Stratagene). Another PCR with the following primers (5′-3′) was performed to subclone each transporter open reading frame into the EcoRI and PstI sites of a modified version of the vector pTTQ18 (27Xie H. Patching S.G. Gallagher M.P. Litherland G.J. Brough A.R. Venter H. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Young J.D. Herbert R.B. Henderson P.J. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thereby placing its expression under the control of the tac promoter: TGATGAATTCGATGAGTCAGGCTAAATC and ACCGCCTGCAGAACCGTGTTTATTTTTCAGT for PotE, TGATGAATTCGATGACTGCAAACTCTCCCCTA and ACCGCCTGCAGACGACAAAGCGTTGAGCTGGC for YhfM, TGATGAATTCGATGCATACTGAAGACAACGG and ACCGCCTGCAGAGCTTGCTTTTCGTTTTTTCA for SteT, and CGATGAATTCGATGAGTTCATTATTTAGA and ACCGCCTGCAGATTTGTTTAATAAGCTGTGTT for YfnA. All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression of Prokaryotic APC Transporters in E. coli—Expression experiments were carried out with freshly transformed cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Initially, the expression of the four APC transporters (PotE, YhfM, SteT, and YfnA) was investigated in 50-ml samples cultured in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 had reached 0.5, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Roche Applied Science). To estimate protein expression, cells were harvested after incubation for different time periods (1, 2, 3, and 4 h and overnight) at 30 or 37 °C. For biochemical or functional analyses of SteT and PotE, either 6 × 0.8 liters of medium in flasks or 10 liters of medium in a fermentor were inoculated with E. coli cultures harboring pTTQ18-His6-YkbA or pTTQ18-His6-PotE. Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at an A600 of 0.5 and harvested after 3 h growth at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. In all cases, the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA) and stored frozen at –20 °C. Preparation of E. coli Membranes—Cell pellets were thawed and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell (20,000 p.s.i., three times). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended and homogenized (30-ml glass homogenizer for 2 min) in lysis buffer and ultracentrifuged again. Peripheral membrane proteins were removed by homogenization in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and ultracentrifugation. Finally, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl at a protein concentration between 13 and 25 mg/ml. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Purification of APC Transporters—To estimate protein expression and functional reconstitution of SteT and PotE, frozen membranes were thawed and solubilized in 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl on a roller shaker (1 h, 4 °C) at a protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. The supernatant after ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with equilibrated Ni2+-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen) with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM, 10 mm imidazole). The supernatant fraction (slurry) was removed by centrifugation (1 min at ∼160 × g). Protein-bound beads were washed three times with 10 ml of washing buffer and centrifuged as before. Then columns were packed with 5 ml of protein-bound beads each. Two more washes were performed with 15 ml of washing buffer before elution with 10 ml of elution buffer (washing buffer supplemented with 500 mm imidazole). The purified protein was concentrated by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra (10,000 molecular weight cut-off; Millipore) at 3,220 × g down to a volume of 1 ml. Imidazole was removed by the addition of 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM and reconcentration to the desired final volume. For negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, frozen SteT-containing membranes were thawed and solubilized for 1 h at 4°C in 1% n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DM; Anatrace), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3. The protein concentration during solubilization was between 2 and 3 mg/ml. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.3% DM, 3 mm histidine, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3 (washing buffer) and bound for 2 h at 4°C to Ni2+-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen). The beads were then loaded onto a spin column (Promega), washed with washing buffer, and eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm histidine. Reconstitution into Proteoliposomes—E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) solubilized in chloroform (50 mg/ml) was dried under a stream of nitrogen to remove the solvent and to obtain a thin layer of dry lipids in a glass tube. The dried lipids were resuspended in dialysis buffer (120 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm TrisSO4, 1% glycerol, and a 4 mm concentration of the desired amino acid, unless otherwise indicated) to yield a final lipid concentration of 40 mg/ml. After four 30-s sonication and vortexing cycles, the liposomes were extruded in a LiposoFast-Pneumatic Actuator (Avestin) through a 400-nm polycarbonate filter (Avestin) to obtain unilamellar vesicles of homogeneous size. Liposomes were mixed with purified protein at a 1:100 (occasionally 1:40) protein/lipid ratio (w/w). To destabilize the liposomes, 1.25% β-d-octyl glucoside (Roche Applied Science) was added and incubated in ice with occasional agitation for 5 min. DDM and β-d-octyl glucoside were removed by dialysis for 40 h at 4 °C against 100 volumes of dialysis buffer. Finally, proteoliposomes were ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in one-third of the initial volume of dialysis buffer without amino acids. Transport Measurements—Influx measurements in proteoliposomes were made as described (16Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor changes. Cold proteoliposomes (10 μl) were mixed with 180 μl of transport buffer (150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 μCi of radiolabeled l-amino acid, and unlabeled amino acid to the desired final concentration) and incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. To test the effect of an imposed membrane potential, 2.8 μm valinomycin (Sigma) was added to the transport buffer. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 850 μl of ice-cold stop buffer (150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, and 5 mm l-serine or putrescine for SteT- and PotE-containing proteoliposomes, respectively) and filtration through membrane filters (Sartorius; 0.45-μm pore size). Filters were then washed three times with 2 ml of stop buffer and dried, and the trapped radioactivity was counted. All experimental values were corrected by subtracting zero time values obtained by adding the stop solution before the proteoliposomes into the transport buffer. The following radiolabeled compounds (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were used in this study: l-[3H]serine, [3H]putrescine, l-[3H]ornithine, l-[3H]arginine, l-[3H]lysine, [3H]glycine, l-[3H]proline, l-[3H]leucine, l-[3H]isoleucine, l-[3H]methionine, l-[3H]glutamate, and l-[3H]alanine. For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes (400 μl) were mixed with 200 μl of 3-fold concentrated transport buffer (450 mm choline chloride, 30 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 35 μCi of l-[3H]serine at a final concentration of 10 μm) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Then the proteoliposome suspensions were divided into two halves (295 μl each), and these were diluted 13-fold with transport buffer (without l-[3H]serine) with or without 7 mm l-serine. At the indicated times, aliquots (195 μl) were mixed with ice-cold stop buffer (850 μl), vortexed, and filtered (0.45-μm pore size; Sartorius). Filters were then washed three times with 2 ml of stop buffer and dried, and the trapped radioactivity was counted. Simulation of SteT Exchange Activity—Simulation of the time course of transport of radiolabeled l-serine into proteoliposomes containing purified SteT (SteT-PLs) was performed using a model based on the following premises: (i) the induced amino acid transport activity is an obligatory exchange process with a 1:1 stoichiometry; (ii) an additional diffusive, protein-independent flux is necessary to explain transport observed in the absence of transporter (i.e. in proteoliposomes containing no SteT) or in the absence of exchangeable amino acids (SteT-PLs containing l-arginine instead of l-serine). The computer program, previously designed to simulate transport in oocytes (28Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and membrane vesicles (15Torras-Llort M. Torrents D. Soriano-Garcia J.F. Gelpi J.L. Estevez R. Ferrer R. Palacin M. Moreto M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was adapted to model amino acid exchange and simulated the experimental influx and efflux rates governed by a concerted (i.e. sequential) mechanism of exchange, as described in a previous study for system b0,+ (15Torras-Llort M. Torrents D. Soriano-Garcia J.F. Gelpi J.L. Estevez R. Ferrer R. Palacin M. Moreto M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Different types of mechanisms (e.g. ping-pong), however, would produce similar results (data not shown). The computer program is available upon request. The simulations were set up using the following rules. (i) Characteristics of the simulated system were as follows. The experimental setup was reproduced as two separate compartments. The outside compartment volume was set to 86 μl (taking 1 μg of protein as a reference). The inside volume, 62 nl, together with the Fick parameter, was deduced from extrapolation to infinity of nonspecific influx measurements (SteT-PLs containing l-arginine), fitted to the Fick law by standard nonlinear regression. (ii) Kinetic parameters were as follows. Experimental parameters were used when available. Best values for the unknown parameters and transporter concentration were determined after a systematic search of the appropriate range of values. (iii) The simulation procedure was as follows. Transport rates were evaluated from the relative concentrations of transporter complexes. Transport rates were estimated on the assumption that the limiting step is the translocation of the transporter bound to the substrate, as described for system y+L (29Eleno N. Deves R. Boyd C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 291-300Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and therefore all binding steps were considered as being at equilibrium. Possible inactivation of the transporter was included as an exponential first order law with the appropriate parameters. During simulation, amino acid concentrations were calculated by numerical integration of the transport rates. Integration was performed with a constant time step of 0.02 min during the desired period. Freeze-Fracture and Electron Microscopy of Proteoliposomes—A freeze-fracture electron microscopy study was performed as described (30Lopez O. de la Maza A. Coderch L. Lopez-Iglesias C. Wehrli E. Parra J.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The suspension was sandwiched between two copper platelets using a 400-mesh gold grid as spacer. The samples were frozen by liquid propane immersion, at –189 °C and fractured at –150 °C and 10–8 millibars in a BAL-TEC BAF 060 freeze-etching system (BAL-TEC). The replicas were obtained by unidirectional shadowing at 45° with 2 nm of Pt/C and at 90° with 20 nm of C and subsequently floated on distilled water for 5 min. Electron micrographs (at ×50,000) were recorded in a Jeol 1010 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Measurement of Freeze-Fracture Particles—Particle diameters were measured from scanned electron micrographs using AnalySIS software. The diameter was obtained by measuring the width of the particle edge-to-edge in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the shadow. Duplicate measurements of individual particles of SteT and PotE revealed a ±0.2-nm error of measurement. The accuracy of the diameter measurements was tested by measuring the diameter of 10-nm gold particles (Chemicon) placed directly on Formvar-coated copper grids (9.94 ± 0.04 nm; n = 125). All values are reported as means ± S.E. of the mean. Negative Stain TEM—DM-solubilized SteT protein as eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column was adsorbed for 10 s to parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Grids were washed with four drops of double-distilled water and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. This washing step is to effectively remove the buffer solution and not adsorbed protein. The former, if not removed, can lead to precipitation of the uranyl salts with buffer components. Electron micrographs were recorded at a magnification of ×50,000 and an underfocus of ∼400 nm on Eastman Kodak Co. S0-163 sheet films with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Linear 5–12% gradient gels for blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) were prepared and run as previously described (31Schagger H. Aquila H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as standard proteins. Screening for an Appropriate Prokaryotic Homolog Candidate of LAT Transporters—In order to identify appropriate prokaryotic homolog candidates for studying the structure-function relationships of the light subunits of HATs, an exhaustive search was made on several available protein sequence data bases. Among the most significant matches, four candidates were selected for further investigation: PotE and YhfM from E. coli and YkbA (SteT) and YfnA from B. subtilis. These proteins had amino acid sequence identities to the light subunits of HATs ranging from 17 to 29%. All of these candidates were hypothetical proteins (32Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I.

https://openalex.org/W2034703630,"PHOX2A is a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor that participates in specifying the autonomic nervous system. It is also involved in the transcriptional control of the noradrenergic neurotransmitter phenotype as it regulates the gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-β-hydroxylase. The results of this study show that the human orthologue of PHOX2A is also capable of regulating the transcription of the human α3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene, which encodes the ligand-binding subunit of the ganglionic type nicotinic receptor. In particular, we demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA pulldown assays that PHOX2A assembles on the SacI-NcoI region of α3 promoter and, by co-transfection experiments, that it exerts its transcriptional effects by acting through the 60-bp minimal promoter. PHOX2A does not seem to bind to DNA directly, and its DNA binding domain seems to be partially dispensable for the regulation of α3 gene transcription. However, as suggested by the findings of our co-immunoprecipitation assays, it may establish direct or indirect protein-protein interactions with Sp1, thus regulating the expression of α3 through a DNA-independent mechanism. As the α3 subunit is expressed in every terminally differentiated ganglionic cell, this is the first example of a “pan-autonomic” gene whose expression is regulated by PHOX2 proteins.

As the α3 subunit is expressed in every terminally differentiated ganglionic cell, this is the first example of a “pan-autonomic” gene whose expression is regulated by PHOX2 proteins. The high degree of cellular heterogeneity of the mammalian nervous system is because of distinct specification and differentiation processes that mainly rely on transcriptional control mechanisms mediated by transcription factors having discrete temporal patterns of region-specific and cell type-specific expression. PHOX2A and PHOX2B are paired-like homeodomain proteins that have been shown to play a pivotal role in the development of the three peripheral divisions of the autonomic nervous system (1Howard M.J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 277: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They are also expressed in all of the noradrenergic neurons of the brainstem, in some cranial sensory ganglia that participate in autonomic reflexes, and in a subset of cranial motor neurons (2Brunet J.F. Pattyn A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). None of the components of the autonomic nervous system develop properly in Phox2b knock-out mice (3Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J. Nature. 1999; 399: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), whereas Phox2a null mutants show an apparently less severe phenotype that only involves the agenesis of the Locus coeruleus and atrophy of the cranial sensory ganglia (4Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); nevertheless, they do not feed and die on the day of birth. The different phenotypes of Phox2 knock-out mutants along with their asynchronous onset of expression during development underscore that the two factors are not functionally equivalent. This has been more directly demonstrated by reciprocal gene replacement experiments (5Coppola E. Pattyn A. Guthrie C.S. Goridis C. Studer M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4392-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that led to the conclusion that biochemical differences may be responsible for the specific function of each paralogue. It is worth noting that PHOX2 proteins are also involved in the transcriptional control of the neurotransmitter phenotype (6Goridis C. Rohrer H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); they play a fundamental role in the terminal differentiation of the orthosympathetic system as they regulate the gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), 4The abbreviations used are: DBH, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; EMSA, electromobility gel shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; TK, thymidine kinase. 4The abbreviations used are: DBH, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; EMSA, electromobility gel shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; TK, thymidine kinase. two limiting enzymes in catecholamine synthesis. In particular, it has been shown that PHOX2A can synergize with dHAND in the regulation of the DBH promoter (7Xu H. Firulli A.B. Zhang X. Howard M.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Rychlik J.L. Gerbasi V. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49652-49660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because of their function in the development of the entire autonomic nervous system, it might be expected that PHOX2 proteins also control the expression of specific genes of the parasympathetic and enteric branches or pan-autonomic genes common to all three autonomic divisions. As no information is yet available concerning this fundamental issue, we tested this hypothesis using the human α3 nicotinic receptor subunit gene as a possible target of PHOX2A regulation. All post-ganglionic neurons respond to preganglionic stimulation by a fast excitatory post-synaptic potential, which triggers the initiation of the post-synaptic spike. The fast excitatory post-synaptic potential is because of the activation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) whose pharmacological blockade abolishes all autonomic nervous system activity (9Taylor P. Brunton L.L. Lazo J.S. Parker K.L. Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 11th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2006: 217-236Google Scholar). Neuronal nAChRs form a family of acetylcholine-gated cation channels that are expressed in the autonomic and sensory ganglia, the adrenal medulla, and distinct areas of the central nervous system and have a quaternary structure consisting of five transmembrane subunits assembled around a central channel. Twelve distinct neuronal nicotinic subunits have been cloned so far and classified into two subfamilies of nine α subunits (α2–α10) and three β subunits (β2–β4) (10Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 6: 363-396Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The α3 subunit appears precociously during neural crest cell differentiation (11Howard M.J. Gershon M.D. Margiotta J.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and its expression becomes very abundant in all of the ganglionic neurons of the autonomic nervous system, where it assembles with β4 or β2 (and, in some receptor molecules, also with α5) to form the ganglionic type nAChR. Many knock-out mice lacking the α3 subunit succumb early after birth, and most of the remaining die during the next 6–8 weeks because of the severe abnormalities of autonomic functions (12Wang N. Orr-Urtreger A. Korczyn A.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 68: 341-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the α3 subunit is a very typical pan-autonomic gene responsible for relevant functions of terminally differentiated ganglionic neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PHOX2A regulates the expression of the human α3 nAChR subunit gene, and the possible molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Cell Lines and Cultures—The SH-SY5Y and IMR32 human neuroblastoma cell lines and the DAOY human medulloblastoma cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (CAMBREX Bio Science, Inc., Rockland, ME), 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone Life Science Division, Milan, Italy), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma). The HeLa cell line was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma), 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Plasmid Construction—The 4.3 KN, the 1 KN, and the BglII-NcoI human α3 promoter reporter plasmids have been described previously by Fornasari et al. (13Fornasari D. Battaglioli E. Flora A. Terzano S. Clementi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The BsiWI-AccIII (60) α3 minimal promoter construct as well as the plasmids, BglII-NcoI mutA, BglII-NcoI mutB, and BglII-NcoI mutAB bearing mutations either in the A or B or both Sp1-binding sites have been described by Terzano et al. (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The SacI-NcoI construct was obtained by digesting 0.35 BN plasmid (13Fornasari D. Battaglioli E. Flora A. Terzano S. Clementi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with SacI, followed by re-ligation. The α5 –240/+180 construct has been described by Flora et al. (15Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The human PHOX2A cDNA was cloned by means of reverse transcription-PCR, using RNA purified from SH-SY5Y cells; polymerase Superscript II (Invitrogen) was used for reverse transcription, and Pfx proofreading polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for amplification. The oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of the sequence deposited at the NCBI with accession number NM_005169; the upper primer corresponded to nucleotides 1–25 (5′-CTT GCG TTG CAC CCG GGC TGA GTG C-3′); the lower primer was complementary to nucleotides 997–1027 (5′-GAT TGG TCT TCA GGG CGG GGC CGG GCT TC-3′). The PCR product was subcloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and completely sequenced on both strands. The cDNA was excised by means of EcoRI digestion and cloned into pcDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen), and the construct was named PHOX2A/pcDNA3. Recombinant PCR was used to introduce point mutations into the homeodomain of PHOX2A (16Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to generate the mutations were Ph2aR53W-UP, 5′-CCA GAA CCG CTG GGC CAA GTT CC-3′; Ph2aR53W-LOW, 5′-GGA ACT TGG CCC AGC GGT TCT GG-3′; Ph2aN51H-UP, 5′-TTC CAG CAC CGC CGG GCC AAG-3′; Ph2aN51H-LOW, 5′-CCC GGC GGT GCT GGA ACC AG-3′; the external primers were N-ATG-UP, 5′-GGG CCG ATG GAC TAC TCC TAC C-3′ and Ph2aCT-LOW, 5′-TTG CGG CCG CCT AGA AGA GAT TGG TCT TCA GGG C-3′ (the changed codons are in boldface and underlined). The resulting DNA was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced on both strands. The cDNA was excised by means of EcoRI digestion and cloned into pcDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen), and the constructs were named PHOX2A-R53W/pcDNA3 and PHOX2A-N51H/pcDNA3. The 4xTK-luc construct was obtained by cloning into the pGL3-basic vector a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (see Fig. 6A for the sequence) containing four copies (three in the right orientation and one in the opposite orientation) of domain II of the DBH promoter, bearing a well described PHOX2A-binding site (17Kim H.S. Seo H. Yang C. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of the TK promoter. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—The transfection and co-transfection experiments were performed by means of lipofection, as described by Flora et al. (18Flora A. Lucchetti H. Benfante R. Goridis C. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 4 × 104 HeLa cells, 5 × 104 DAOY cells, or 2 × 105 IMR32 cells. The luciferase assays were carried out using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (18Flora A. Lucchetti H. Benfante R. Goridis C. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Battaglioli E. Gotti C. Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of the transfections were performed in duplicate, and each construct was tested in at least three independent experiments using different batches of the plasmid preparation. Preparation of Synthetic Peptide and Antibody Production—A peptide corresponding to the human PHOX2A sequence, CKPGPALKTNLF, located in the C terminus of the protein was synthesized as described in Cargnin et al. (20Cargnin F. Flora A. Di Lascio S. Battaglioli E. Longhi R. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37439-37448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from chicken egg yolk were produced by Davids Biotechnologie (Ragensburg, Germany). In Vitro Protein Expression—The in vitro expression of PHOX2A-wild type and PHOX2A-R53W was obtained by means of a commercial rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system, Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (20Cargnin F.

Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analyses—Ten micrograms of nuclear extract, prepared as described in Terzano et al. (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or 2 μl of in vitro expressed proteins were separated by means of 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were preincubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), after which the primary antibodies were added at an appropriate dilution and incubated for 2 h before the secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Davids Biotechnologie) were added and incubated for 1 h. After appropriate washes, the bands were revealed using Super Signal West Dura (Pierce). Standard molecular weights (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) were loaded in parallel, and the relative mass of PHOX2A was calculated by means of computer-assisted analysis. Competition experiments were carried out using PHOX2A peptide in a 10:1 mass ratio with the corresponding antibodies. Immunofluorescence—DAOY cells plated on 1.7 × 1.7-cm2 glass coverslips were grown to 50% confluency and transfected with PHOX2A/pcDNA3, PHOX2A-R53W/pcDNA3, and PHOX2A-N51H/pcDNA3 plasmids or mock-transfected with the empty vector. Immunofluorescence was performed as described in Cargnin et al. (20Cargnin F. Flora A. Di Lascio S. Battaglioli E. Longhi R. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37439-37448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:400 and revealed by means of an anti-chicken Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Competition assays using the specific peptide were performed as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The EMSAs were performed as described by Terzano et al. (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and Cargnin et al. (20Cargnin F. Flora A. Di Lascio S.

The oligonucleotide PRS1 has been described by Kim et al. (17Kim H.S. Seo H. Yang C. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (20Cargnin F. Flora A. Di Lascio S. Battaglioli E. Longhi R. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37439-37448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Chromatin was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μgof each antibody (anti-PHOX2A (Davids Biotechnologie, Germany), anti-human Sp1, and anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), and chicken preimmune IgY (Davids Biotechnologie)), and the immunocomplexes were collected on monoclonal anti-chicken IgY-agarose beads or protein G/agarose bead slurry (Invitrogen), preadsorbed with 20 μg/μl tRNA and 10 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). After washings and elution, the cross-linking was reversed by heating to 65 °C overnight, and the samples were purified on columns (High Pure PCR product purification kit, Roche Diagnostics). For the PCR detection of the immunoprecipitated chromatin, 5% of the purified DNA was used as a template with the following primers: ChIP[α3prom]UP, 5′-CTC CTT CCT GGT GGT GGT GAC-3′, and ChIP[α3prom]LOW, 5′-GGG CTC CTC TCC GCT TGC-3′ to amplify the –386/–127 region of the nAChR α3 subunit promoter (numbering according to Ref. 14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); and ChIP[α5prom]UP, 5′-CTC TGC TCC AGG GTC GCA C -3′, and ChIP[α5prom]LOW, 5′-GAG TGT GAG TCG TGA GAC AAA ACG-3′, to amplify the α5 promoter. The DNA samples were heated to 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 47 cycles of heating at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 64 (α3 promoter) or 61 °C (α5 promoter) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Transient chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described in Wells and Farnham (21Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, IMR32 cells were transfected with 5 μg of different α3 promoter plasmids (BglII-NcoI, BglII-NcoI mutA, BglII-NcoI mutB, or BglII-NcoI mutAB constructs). After 24 h, chromatin was prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above. For the PCR detection of the immunoprecipitated chromatin, specific primers designed on plasmid backbone sequences were used as follows: GL2 primer, 5′-CTT TAT GTT TTT GGC GTC TTC C-3′, and RV3 primer, 5′-CTA GCA AAA TAG GCT GTC CC-3′. The DNA samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 38 cycles of heating at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. DNA Pulldown Assays—Five picomoles of the SacI-NcoI or –240/+180 DNA fragments of the α3 and α5 regulatory regions were biotinylated by filling in and incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Roche Diagnostics); 250 μg of IMR32 nuclear extracts were added and incubated on ice for 40 min in binding buffer (4% Ficoll, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), 100 mm final salt concentration (NaCl + KCl), and 25 μg of poly[d(I-C)] as the competitor. After magnetic separation, the beads were extensively washed with a binding buffer containing 25% glycerol instead of Ficoll and resuspended in protein loading buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously. In Vitro DNase I Footprinting Assays—The 376-bp probe, containing the SacI-NcoI region of the α3 promoter, was obtained as described in Terzano et al. (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To generate the probe corresponding to the multimerized domain II of the DBH promoter, we subcloned the double-stranded oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 6A into the KpnI-BglII sites of pSP73 vector (Promega). The plasmid was then digested with HindIII to label the bottom strand. In each footprinting reaction, 2 fmol of probes (corresponding to 20,000–30,000 cpm) were incubated with 50 μgof nuclear extract, prepared as described previously (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the reactions were performed using a previously described procedure (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNase I (DNase I-RNase free; Roche Diagnostics) was used at concentrations of 0.05 units/μg DNA without extract and 1.0 unit/μg DNA in the presence of extract, and the samples were processed as described previously (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—IMR32 cells were grown to 70% confluency and harvested after 24 h, when the nuclear extract was prepared for immunoprecipitation. The nuclei were obtained as described previously (14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted in lysis buffer containing non-ionic detergent (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma protease inhibitors mixture) and precleared using protein G/agarose bead slurry (Invitrogen) and rabbit preimmune IgG or chicken preimmune IgY (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precleared extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of each primary antibody (polyclonal chicken anti-PHOX2A antibody (Davids Biotechnologie), polyclonal rabbit anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and preimmune rabbit IgG or preimmune chicken IgY (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)), and the immunocomplexes were captured by protein G/agarose bead slurry (Invitrogen). Because of the poor binding of chicken antibodies to protein G, a bridging antibody (rabbit anti-chicken IgG, Upstate) was added to enhance immunocomplexes capture. The beads were collected by centrifugation and gently washed and resuspended in sample loading buffer. The immunocomplexes were dissociated from the beads by boiling the samples, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed as described previously using the primary anti-PHOX2A, anti-Sp1, and anti-CREB-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transcriptional Effects of PHOX2A on the Activity of the α3 Promoter—To evaluate whether PHOX2A plays a role in α3 expression, we performed co-transfection experiments in which a vector expressing PHOX2A was introduced into DAOY and HeLa cells (not shown), together with different reporter constructs bearing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of different parts of the α35′-regulatory region or different promoters used as positive and negative controls (Fig. 1A). The 4.3 KN construct containing the whole intergenic region between β4 and α3 (13Fornasari D. Battaglioli E. Flora A. Terzano S. Clementi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1992; 12: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was stimulated by ∼3-fold (Fig. 1B), to the same extent as the 4xTK plasmid (Fig. 1B), and in a range of transactivation that was comparable with that observed using the native DBH promoter (23Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Progressive deletions at the 5′ end of the α3 regulatory region caused fluctuations in the response to PHOX2A (Fig. 1B, see constructs 1 KN and SacI-NcoI) but did not prevent the transcription factor from exerting its regulatory functions. Furthermore and to our surprise, the BsiWI-AccIII construct containing the 60-bp α3 minimal promoter was the most responsive to PHOX2A (Fig. 1B). As expected, the SV40 promoter was not transactivated by PHOX2A, thus indicating the specific nature of the transcriptional effects on the α3 promoter (Fig. 1B), and the α5 promoter construct (corresponding to the –1011/+180 plasmid described in Ref. 15Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed a negligible and not statistically significant transcriptional response to PHOX2A (Fig. 1B). This lack of effect paralleled our previous finding that PHOX2B is unable to transactivate this nAChR subunit gene (18Flora A. Lucchetti H. Benfante R. Goridis C. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As these data suggested that PHOX2A could regulate α3 transcription by acting through its minimal gene promoter, we decided to carry out biochemical experiments to ascertain whether PHOX2A could actually assemble on the α3 promoter. Characterization of a Polyclonal Antibody Directed against the Human PHOX2A Protein—To follow the expression of the human PHOX2A protein, we produced an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody in chicken eggs and then verified its specificity by means of various criteria and techniques. We first made a Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts prepared from IMR32 or HeLa cells in parallel with the PHOX2A protein obtained by means of in vitro transcription/translation. The in vitro expressed PHOX2A protein was recognized by the antibody as a doublet with apparent molecular masses of 38.1 and 35.7 kDa, whereas no signal was detectable using the unprogrammed lysate (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). The same doublet was also detected in the IMR32 and SH-SY5Y nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, A, lane 2, and B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas no band was observed in the HeLa cells, as expected (Fig. 2, A, lane 4, and B, lane 3). To corroborate these data, we carried out competition experiments involving the addition of an excess of the PHOX2A peptide used for immunization. As shown in Fig. 2A, the specific PHOX2A bands disappeared from the lanes containing the IMR32 nuclear extracts or the in vitro expressed PHOX2A protein (lanes 5 and 6). The antibody was also tested against nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector bearing mouse (Fig. 2B, lane 5) or human PHOX2A cDNA (Fig. 2B, lane 6); in both cases, the antibody recognized two bands with apparent molecular masses of 35.7 and 38.1 kDa, whereas no bands were detectable in the mock-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lane 4). The difference in the apparent molecular weights of the two forms of PHOX2A is compatible with the alternative use of two in-frame methionine residues surrounded by perfect Kozak sequences (24Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), which are conserved in both human and mouse orthologues (18Flora A. Lucchetti H. Benfante R. Goridis C. Clementi F.

Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 881-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was used to confirm that the examined antibody recognized PHOX2A in its native state. DAOY cells (which do not endogenously express the antigen) were transfected with PHOX2A/pcDNA3 and probed with the antibody. Fig. 2C shows the nuclei of transfected DAOY cells stained with DAPI (panel c) or revealed by the anti-PHOX2A antibody (panel d). The antibody labeled the nuclei of a few cells, as may be expected in a transient transfection experiment, but did not produce any signal when mock-transfected cells were probed (Fig. 2C, panels a and b). Similarly, no signal was detectable in the PHOX2A/pcDNA3-transfected cells if the antibody was previously incubated with an excess of the PHOX2A peptide (Fig. 2C, panels e and f). It is well known that DBH is a PHOX2A target gene, and so we used the PRS1 oligonucleotide to verify whether the examined antibody was capable of supershifting complexes containing PHOX2A. PRS1 corresponds to a region of 22 nucleotides within domain IV of the DBH promoter (26Yang C. Kim H. Seo H. Kim C. Brunet J. Kim K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1813-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), contains two ATTA core motifs for homeodomain proteins, and has been shown to bind PHOX2A (17Kim H.S. Seo H. Yang C.

https://openalex.org/W2079948256,"To investigate conformations of C-cadherin associated with functional activity and physiological regulation, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind differentially to monomeric or dimeric forms. These mAbs recognize conformational epitopes at multiple sites along the C-cadherin ectodomain aside from the well known Trp-2-mediated dimer interface in the N-terminal EC1 domain. Group 1 mAbs, which bind monomer better than dimer and the Trp-2-mutated protein (W2A) better than wild type, recognize epitopes in EC4 or EC5. Dimerization of the W2A mutant protein via a C-terminal immunoglobulin Fc domain restored the dimeric mAb-binding properties to EC4-5 and partial homophilic binding activity but did not restore full cell adhesion activity. Group 2 and Group 3 mAbs, which bind dimer better than monomer and wild type better than W2A, recognize epitopes in EC1 and the interface between EC1 and EC2, respectively. None of the mAbs could distinguish between different physiological states of C-cadherin at the cell surface of either Xenopus embryonic cells or Colo 205 cultured cells, demonstrating that changes in dimerization do not underlie regulation of adhesion activity. On the cell surface the EC3-EC5 domains are much less accessible to mAb binding than EC1-EC2, suggesting that they are masked by the state of cadherin organization or by other molecules. Thus, the EC2-EC5 domains either reflect, or are involved in, cadherin dimerization and organization at the cell surface.

Cadherins comprise a family of adhesion molecules that are important both for maintaining stable cell-cell adhesion and for regulating tissue morphogenesis during development (1Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Cadherins mediate cell sorting (2Godt D. Tepass U. Nature. 1998; 395: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Steinberg M.S. Takeichi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and the pattern of expression of different cadherins often contributes to tissue morphogenesis (2Godt D. Tepass U. Nature. 1998; 395: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the level of expression of individual cadherins is regulated during developmental process as well as tumorigenesis (e.g. the epithelial and mesenchymal transition) (5Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adhesive activities of cadherin are also rapidly regulated during morphogenesis (6Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of dynamic regulation is not well understood. Classic cadherins are homophilic adhesion molecules and comprise five repeats of extracellular cadherin domains (EC), 2The abbreviations used are: EC, extracellular cadherin domain; mAb; monoclonal antibody; EGS, ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; C-CHO, CHO/C-cadherin cells. a transmembrane domain and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Classic cadherins are regulated by proteins associated with its cytoplasmic tail, including β-catenin and p120, which are directly associated with cytoplasmic tail of cadherins, and α-catenin which is associated with β-catenin and thought to associate in some way with the actin cytoskeleton. Association with the cytoskeleton and clustering of cadherins is important to form strong adhesive interactions. To understand how the adhesion activity of cadherins is regulated dynamically, it is necessary to understand the molecular nature of the homophilic adhesive bond. NMR and x-ray crystallographic and biophysical studies have provided evidence for the structure of the cadherin adhesive bond (9Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M.

Eng. 2006; 8: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but many different models have been proposed (1Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 16Koch A.W. Manzur K.L. Shan W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1884-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A key feature in all models is the role of the Trp-2 residue, located in the N-terminal EC1 domain, in the formation of a cadherin homodimer. Mutation of the Trp-2 has been shown to disrupt dimer formation and to abrogate adhesion (17Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 18Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In some models Trp-2 has been proposed to mediate cis dimerization of two cadherin subunits on the cell surface, and there is good cell biological and biochemical evidence for the presence of a cis dimer on cells (17Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 18Chitaev N.A. Troyanovsky S.M. J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7965-7972Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Trp-2 has also been proposed to be the basis of the trans homophilic bond between cadherins on two different cells (9Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and in one model there is thought to be an exchange between cis and trans dimer forms (20Troyanovsky R.B. Sokolov E. Troyanovsky S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7965-7972Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that control of cis dimerization mediated, at least in part, by the Trp-2 could underlie the regulation of cadherin-adhesive function (17Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 21Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but so far changes in cis dimerization of the surface of cells has not been observed. However, no detailed analysis of cadherin structure at the cell surface of cells undergoing rapid, dynamic, physiological regulation of adhesive activity has yet been undertaken. In some conditions, cadherin-mediated adhesion is regulated rapidly, sometimes in response to the action of growth factors (1Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Also, there is some evidence for the inside-out signaling and outside-in signaling of cadherins in vitro and in vivo (1Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 23Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that cadherins undergo conformational changes in response to regulation of cadherin accompanied with inside-out signaling. The phenomenon of inside-out regulation activated by signaling events is very well established for integrins, and integrins undergo well described conformational changes (25Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 26Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6890) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the active or inactive state of integrins have provided powerful tools to understand the molecular mechanism underlying their structure and activation (26Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6890) Google Scholar, 27Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

We therefore decided to take a similar approach and to generate mAbs that recognize different forms of C-cadherin that could provide insights in the structure and regulation of the homophilic bond. In the present study, we developed mAbs that recognize conformational differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of C-cadherin. We tested whether dimer status changes during two good models of cadherin physiological regulation. A decrease in C-cadherin adhesion activity in Xenopus embryonic cells stimulated by growth factors and necessary for morphogenetic cell movements (6Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Zhong Y. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the dramatic activation of cell adhesion in the Colo 205 colorectal cell line (29Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We also determined how the Trp-2-mediated dimer reflects the overall conformation and whether other parts of protein are affected by dimerization status. A series of mAbs recognizing each of the EC domains was also used to probe accessibility at the cell surface. Proteins and ELISA—The histidine-tagged ectodomain of C-cadherin (CEC1-5) was purified, and monomeric and dimeric forms of CEC1-5 were then separated by using a Superose 12 column as describe before (21Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The C-cadherin ectodomain fused with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin at the C terminus (CEC1-5-Fc) was purified as described before (30Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The tryptophan at the second residue was replaced with alanine (W2A) in EC1 of C-cadherin ectodomain using a Quick Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both cDNAs for the 6 His-tagged and Fc-tagged proteins were cloned into a pEE14 vector. After confirming that the sequence did not contain any other mutation, the plasmids were stably introduced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC), and proteins were purified from a conditioned medium in the same way as wild type. For ELISA, histidine-tagged C-cadherin proteins, at the solution concentrations indicated, were bound via Ni2+ to the wells of 96-well nickel plates (BD Biosciences, MA) overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and nonspecific binding sites were block with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST. In the case of monomeric forms of CEC1-5, proteins were bound to nickel plates immediately after the purification by the Superose 12 column to prevent reformation of dimers. Supernatants from hybridomas or purified mAbs were applied to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBST, and the signal was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Bio-Rad) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma). ELISA for the Fc-tagged protein was conducted in the same way except using a standard ELISA plate (Nunc, New York, NY). Screening of Hybridomas—Immunization, fusion, and growth of hybridomas were done by the Lymphocyte Culture Center of the University of Virginia School of Medicine. A female Balb/c and a male AJ mouse were immunized with CEC1-5 and CEC1-5-Fc three times. Spleens were removed, and splenocytes were fused with myeloma and plated in 96-well plates, and hybridomas were selected with HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) medium. Supernatants of hybridomas were screened for the binding preferentially to ectodomains of C-cadherin using ELISA described above, and hybridomas of interest were subcloned three times by limiting dilution. To obtain purified mAbs, hybridomas were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% Ultra-low IgG fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and mAbs were purified using Protein G column (HiTrapG, Amersham Biosciences) from the culture supernatant. Isotypes of all mAbs were determined using the IsoStrip Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit (Roche Applied Science). CCD1, CCD3, CCD5, and CCD23 are IgG1(k); CCD11, CCD19, and CCD21 are IgG1(l); and CCD25, CCD28, and CCD30 are IgG2b(k). Chemical Cross-linking and Western Blotting—Purified CEC1-5 in Hepes buffer was incubated in 1 mm ethyleneglycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS, Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature to cross-link proteins. After being quenched by incubation with glycine to a final concentration of 50 mm for 30 min, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected with 6B6 anti C-cadherin antibody and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Bio-Rad) by a standard immunoblotting method. To cross-link proteins at the cell surface, Colo 205 cells, which were treated with or without 5 nm staurosporine overnight, were washed and then incubated with 2 mm Sulfo-EGS in Hepes buffer for 30 min. Then samples were quenched with Tris to a final concentration of 50 mm for 30 min before lysing the cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 SDS in TBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete #11897100, Roche Applied Science) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the proteins in the supernatant were analyzed by Western blot analysis as describe above. In the case of blastomeres, animal caps were dissected from embryos at stage 8, and one half were incubated with 5 ng/ml activin A for 2.5 h. Proteins were analyzed in the same way as Colo 205 cells, except that a lysis buffer without SDS was used. Bead Aggregation Assay—The bead aggregation assay for Fc-tagged ectodomains of C-cadherin was conducted as described before (30Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, Protein A-coated microspheres with 1.04-mm diameter (Bangs Laboratories Inc., Fishers, IN) were incubated with 1 mg/ml proteins for 90 min at room temperature. Beads were then washed and sonicated to obtain single beads determined by microscopy, divided, and supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. The number of super-thresh-old-sized particles (set for size of large aggregates) as a function of time was determined using a Coulter counter, and the amount of protein coupled to beads was determined as described above. Cell Aggregation Assay and Laminar Flow Cell Adhesion Assay—To obtain CHO-W2A cells, a W2A mutation was introduced to C-cadherin in pEE14 using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit. After the sequence was confirmed to be correct, the plasmid was stably transfected in CHO cells. The stable clones were subcloned three times, and the CHO-W2A cells were confirmed to express a similar amount of C-cadherin as the wild type. Cell aggregation assays were done with a standard method (31Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, trypsinized in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, washed again, resuspended in Hanks' buffer (Invitrogen) with 2 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA at 1 × 105 cells/ml, and rotated at 100 rpm for the indicated time. The number of cells was counted, and the aggregation index was calculated as follows: adhesion index = (N0 - Nt)/N0 (where Nt is number at certain time and N0 is the number at 0 min). The laminar flow cell adhesion assay was conducted as described in a previous report (30Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were trypsinized in the presence of 1 mm calcium, allowed to attach to glass tubes coated with a protein for 10 min, and washed away for 30 s at an indicated flow rate. The number of cells remaining after the wash was counted, and the adhesion percentage was calculated. Cellular ELISA—Colo 205 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham' F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, cells were incubated 20 nm staurosporine for 2 h, or washed once and incubated with 0.002% Trypsin in serum-free medium for 15 min (29Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For cellular ELISA, cells were grown in 96-well plates pre-coated with 4 mg/ml collagen type IV, and incubated with purified mAbs for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed three times with the medium and two times with Hanks' buffer. The signals were detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as described above. Blastomere ELISA—Animal cap explants from stage-8 embryo of Xenopus laevis were dissected and dissociated in calcium magnesium-free medium (7.5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl). Dissociated blastomere cells were incubated with or without 5 nm activin for 90 min when necessary, 50 μl of cell suspension containing blastomeres from 10 animal caps was transferred to a 96-well ELISA plate pre-coated with poly-l-lysine, and cells were allowed to attach during the last 30 min of activin treatment. 150 μl of fetal bovine serum in Marc's modified Ringer's medium, pH 7.4, was added to final 10% to block nonspecific binding sites and supply calcium, following by incubation for 15 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 15 min at room temperature. A special method was developed to wash the blastomeres, which are much larger than tissue culture cells and lyse easily if exposed to air when medium is removed. The plate was submerged into 1 liter of wash buffer (Marc's modified Ringer's medium, pH 7.4, containing 1% glucose), and excess antibodies were washed away by very gentle removal of the buffer with a multiple tip pipette for 12 times. Then the plate was transferred to a bucket containing 1.7 liters of wash buffer, and then flipped and rotated several times. A set of washes in a tray and a bucket was repeated for a total of three times. After the last wash, most buffer was removed using a multiple tip pipette leaving ∼50 μl, and another 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, which was diluted at 1:100 in 20% fetal bovine serum/Marc's modified Ringer's medium, pH 7.4, was added to a well, and the mixture was bound for 30 min at room temperature. Excess secondary antibodies were washed away in the same way. Blastomeres were then transferred to a fresh well to minimize the nonspecific background from the well. Then 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) substrate was added to quantify the amount of antibody bound, following incubation for ∼2 h to allow sufficient signal to develop. Supernatant without cells was transferred to a fresh well, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Generation of Monomer- and Dimer-specific Monoclonal Antibodies—To explore the potential conformational change in C-cadherin that accompanies its regulation during Xenopus gastrulation, we wanted to generate mAbs that distinguish states of C-cadherin. We previously reported that the ectodomain of C-cadherin (CEC1-5) forms monomeric or dimeric forms, and only the dimeric form had adhesive activity (21Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used these protein species to screen mAbs. The purified histidine-tagged ectodomain of C-cadherin, CEC1-5, was separated by gel filtration to obtain monomeric and dimeric forms of CEC1-5 (Fig. 1A). CEC1-5 eluted from a Superose 12 column in earlier fractions was confirmed to form dimer by chemical cross-linking with EGS (Fig. 1B). The later fractions contained mainly monomeric forms. Fractions 10-13 or fractions 18-23 were combined and used as monomer or dimer forms, respectively. Monomeric or dimeric species can be trapped by binding to nickel-coated substrates (21Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, monomer or dimer fractions were bound to wells of nickel-coated 96-well plates, and mAbs were screened for preferential binding to either form using standard ELISA procedures (Fig. 1C). ∼2,250 hybridoma supernatants from 2 fusions were screened, and we obtained mAbs CCD1, CCD3, CCD11, CCD19, and CCD21 that bound to monomer better than dimer (Fig. 1D). Also, mAbs CCD5 and CCD23 were found to bind dimer better than monomer (Fig. 1D). As shown in Table 1, we classify five mAbs that bind monomer better than dimer as Group 1, and the other 2 mAbs as Group 2 (see below for Group 3).TABLE 1Specificity of monoclonal antibodiesGroupNameBinding activityaD = dimer; M = monomer.Epitope inWestern blotHis-taggedFc-taggedGroup 1CCD1M > D, W2A > WtWt-Fc = W2A-FcEC4-5−CCD3M > D, W2A > WtWt-Fc = W2A-FcEC4-5−CCD11M > D, W2A > WtWt-Fc = W2A-FcEC4-5−CCD19M > D, W2A > WtWt-Fc = W2A-FcEC4-5−CCD21M > D, W2A > WtWt-Fc = W2A-FcEC4-5−Group 2CCD5D > M, Wt > W2AWt-Fc > W2A-FcEC1+CCD23D > M, Wt > W2AWt-Fc > W2A-FcEC1+Group 3CCD25D > M, WtWt-FcEC1-2+CCD28D > M, WtWt-FcEC1-2+CCD30D > M, WtWt-FcEC1-2+a D = dimer; M = monomer. Open table in a new tab Because it has been shown that the tryptophan residue at the second position in EC1 has a critical role in E-, N-, and R-cadherin dimerization and cell adhesion (17Tamura K.

Commun. 2000; 271: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the Trp-2 in C-cadherin is involved in cis dimerization. Wild-type and CEC1-5,W2A, the ectodomains of C-cadherin with Ala at the second residue instead of Trp, were chemically cross-linked with 2 mm EGS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. About one-fourth of wild-type CEC1-5 was cross-linked into dimers in these conditions, and cross-linking decreased significantly for CEC1-5,W2A (Fig. 2A). Loss of dimerization was further confirmed by gel filtration. Dimeric forms eluting in fractions 12-14 were not observed with CEC1-5,W2A (Fig. 2B). The binding of the state-specific mAbs described above to CEC1-5,W2A were analyzed. All mAbs in Group 1, those that recognized monomer better than dimer, bound to CEC1-5,W2A better than wild-type CEC1-5 (Fig. 2C). Group 2 mAbs, which bound dimer better than monomer, bound to wild type better than the W2A mutant (Fig. 2C). The binding differences between W2A and wild type were more striking than the difference between monomer and dimer. mAbs were also screened for their abilities to distinguish between wild-type CEC1-5 and CEC1-5,W2A. Three mAbs, CCD25, CCD28, and CCD30, bound to wild type but not to CEC1-5,W2A (Fig. 2C). Moreover, for the wild-type protein, these mAbs bound dimer better than monomer (Fig. 1D), consistent with the finding that CEC1-5,W2A does not dimerized significantly. We classified these three mAbs as Group 3, and all results are summarized in Table 1. Because monomer and dimer have the same amino acid sequences, all of these mAbs that differentially bind to dimer and monomer must recognize different conformations of CEC1-5. We wished to map the epitopes on C-cadherin recognized by these monomer- or dimer-specific mAbs. Because the Group 2 and 3 mAbs showed striking reductions in their binding to the W2A mutant protein, we first tested whether the Trp-2 itself is a part of the epitope. A polypeptide of 15 amino acids from the C-cadherin N terminus and the one with W2A mutation were obtained from the University of Virginia Biomolecular core facility and coated on a 96-well ELSIA plate to test the binding of mAbs. None of the mAbs exhibited any binding to the peptides (data not shown). The peptides also failed to inhibit the binding of mAbs to full-length Wt or W2A mutant CEC1-5 (data not shown), indicating that the epitopes recognized by these mAbs probably do not include the Trp-2 or N-terminal 15 amino acids of C-cadherin. We also mapped the epitopes recognized by the mAbs to specific EC domains in the C-cadherin protein. An ELISA binding assay using a series of different cadherin ectodomains constructs containing various combinations of EC domains fused at their C termini to the IgG Fc domain was performed for each of these mAbs (Fig. 3). Importantly, all of the mAbs within a group exhibited virtually the same EC domain binding profile, suggesting that each group recognizes a similar or related set of epitopes. The Group 2 mAbs, which prefer the dimer form and bind poorly to the W2A mutant protein, clearly recognize the EC1 domain (Fig. 3B). They all bind the minimal EC1-Fc construct and all EC1-containing constructs, but they fail to bind any construct lacking the EC1 domain, including EC2-5-Fc. Because these mAbs do not recognize the N-terminal Trp-2-containing peptide, they likely recognize a conformational epitope in EC1 that depends strongly on the formation of the Trp-2-dependent dimer. The Group 3 mAbs, which prefer the dimer form and do not bind to the W2A mutant protein, recognize a more complex epitope requiring both EC1 and EC2 domains (Fig. 3B). They fail to bind EC1-Fc alone, but do bind well to EC1-2-Fc, suggesting that they might recognize EC2. However, they do not bind to EC2-5-Fc, indicating that they require EC1 for binding. Three explanations are possible: the Group 3 mAbs could bind a combined epitope at the interface of EC1 and EC2; they could recognize a conformational epitope in EC1 that requires the presence of adjacent EC2 domain to maintain the normal conformation of EC1; or they could recognize a conformational epitope in EC2 that requires the presence of adjacent EC1 domain to maintain the normal conformation of EC2. Because these mAbs prefer the dimer form and fa"

One member of this family, conantokin-G (con-G), undergoes Ca2+-mediated self-assembly to form an antiparallel helical dimer. Subunit interactions in this complex are incumbent upon intermolecular Ca2+ bridging of Gla residues spaced at i, i + 4, i + 7, i + 11 intervals within the monomer. Herein, we further probe the molecular determinants governing such helix-helix interactions. Select variants were synthesized to evaluate the contributions of non-Gla residues to conantokin self-association. Con-G dimerization was shown to be exothermic and accompanied by positive heat capacity changes. Using positional Gla variants of conantokin-R (con-R), a non-dimerizing conantokin, i, i + 4, i + 7, i + 11 Gla spacing alone was shown to be insufficient for self-assembly. The Ca2+-dependent antiparallel heterodimerization of con-G and con-T(K7γ), two peptides that harbor optimal Gla spacing, was established. Last, the effects of covalently constrained con-G dipeptides on NMDA-evoked current in HEK293 cells expressing combinations of NR1a, NR1b, NR2A, and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor were investigated. The antiparallel dipeptide was unique in its ability to potentiate current at NR1a/2A receptors and, like monomeric con-G, was inhibitory at NR1a/2B and NR1b/2B combinations. In contrast, the parallel species was completely inactive at all subunit combinations tested. These results suggest that, under physiological Ca2+ concentrations, equilibrium levels of con-G dimer most likely exist in an antiparallel orientation and exert effects on NMDA receptor activity that differ from the monomer.

The predatory snails of genus Conus are abundant sources of pharmacologically diverse peptides (“conotoxins”) that target numerous neuronal and neuromuscular ion channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Buczek O. Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3067-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is estimated that the Conus venom library may contain as many as 100,000 different peptides distributed among 500–700 species. Hundreds of conotoxins have been identified to date, the majority of which are relatively short (10–30 amino acids) peptides containing 1–4 intramolecular disulfide bonds that conform to a limited array of bridging frameworks. Conus snails also possess the enzymatic machinery to effect numerous post- and co-translational peptide modifications, including C-terminal amidation, epimerization, O-glycosylation, hydroxylation of proline, lysine, and valine, and γ-carboxylation of glutamate. The latter modification occurs to a high degree in a small family of conotoxins known as the conantokins. To date, four conantokins have been identified: conantokin (con) 3The abbreviations used are: con, conantokin; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; RU, resonance unit; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 3The abbreviations used are: con, conantokin; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; RU, resonance unit; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.-G, con-T, con-R, and con-L (2McIntosh J.

These possess γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) and total amino acid content ratios of 5:17, 4:21, 4:27, and 4:19, respectively, and are unusual in the conotoxin realm because of their lack of disulfide bonds (excepting con-R, which has a single heptapeptide disulfide loop). Although γ-glutamyl carboxylase activity has been detected in Drosophila (6Li T. Yang C.T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Leptospira (7Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W. Yakubenko A.V. Zuerner R.L. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. J.

In the conantokins, the Gla residues fulfill both structural and functional roles. In the former category, a high degree of conformational rigidity is imposed through intramolecular metal ion bridging among the malonate head groups of Gla side chains. Specifically, metal ion binding to optimally spaced (i, i + 3, and/or i, i + 4) Gla residues promotes the formation of end-to-end helices (8Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Functionally, the conantokins are specific and potent antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a ligand-operated ion channel with high Ca2+ permeability that, in its overactivated state, has been implicated in a host of chronic and acute neuropathophysiologies (9Lipton S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Studies with synthetic peptide variants have ascribed high functional importance to the conserved Gla residues at conantokin sequence positions 3 and 4 (8Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Gla residues located in the C-terminal segment tend to maximize the metal cation-mediated helix content of the conantokins, but are not crucial to the NMDAR activity of the peptides.In addition to the contribution of conantokin Gla residues to NMDAR antagonism and secondary structure, we have recently established that Gla residues, as arranged in con-G, allow for the adoption of helical dimers in the presence of Ca2+ (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This conclusion, based on sedimentation equilibrium studies with con-G and con-G derivatives, and thiol-disulfide rearrangement assays with Cys-containing versions of con-G, suggested a model for the dimer in which helix-helix interactions are primarily maintained through interhelical Gla-Ca2+ coordination between peptide strands aligned in antiparallel fashion. Because it appears driven solely by electrostatic contacts, independent of any hydrophobic contributions, our dimerization model is unique in the realm of helix-helix interactions in both naturally occurring and designed peptide/protein supersecondary structural contexts. These assumptions have now found definitive support from x-ray crystallographic studies on Ca2+-complexed con-G and Ca2+-complexed con-T[K7γ], peptides that share the i, i + 4, i + 7, i + 11 format of Gla spacing upon which self-assembly is contingent (11Dai Q. Castellino F.J. Prorok M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Cnudde S.E. Prorok M. Dai Q. Castellino F.J. Geiger J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 1586-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, because con-T[K7γ] dimerizes to a greater extent than con-G, it is apparent that amino acids other than Gla must contribute to Ca2+-triggered self-association. These previous studies also raise the possibility that heterodimer formation between appropriately designed conantokin-based monomers may be viable. Furthermore, because the dimeric form of con-G exists under physiological Ca2+ concentrations, the biological relevance of this species is of interest. The current study addresses these questions and, whereas confirming that optimal Gla spacing is the principal molecular feature driving dimerization, reveals that non-Gla residues impart subtle effects on helix-helix interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—The peptides employed in this study, which will be referred to by the numbers designated in Fig. 1, were synthesized as previously described (13Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), on a model 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at 0.1 mmol scale using PAL resin (Applied Biosystems). All Fmoc-derivatized amino acids were obtained from either Sigma or Novabiochem (San Diego, CA) with the exception of Fmoc-γ,γ′-di-o-tBu-l-Gla, which was synthesized as reported earlier (14Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1993; 41: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purification of non-Cys and Cys-containing peptides has been described previously, as has the oxidation of the Cys-containing variants to provide the disulfide-linked species (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC and delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA).Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded between 195 and 260 nm on an AVIV model 202SF spectrometer using either 1- or 0.2-cm path length cells. Each spectrum represents the average of three scans collected at 1.0-nm intervals using a 1.0-nm bandwidth. Corrections for non-peptidic contributions to the ellipticity were made by subtracting the averaged spectrum of the peptide-free sample. The α-helical content of peptides in solution was determined from the mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm using the empirical relationship, % helix = (-(Θ)222-2,340)/30,300) × 100 (15Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar).Sedimentation Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in an An-60 Ti rotor equipped with a standard two-channel cell (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The initial peptide concentration for all runs was 150 μm. The buffer consisted of 10 mm sodium borate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. The apparent molecular weight (Mr(app)) was obtained by fitting the data to a single ideal species using the sedimentation analysis software supplied by Beckman. The partial specific volumes of the peptides analyzed were calculated from the mass average of the partial specific volumes of the individual amino acids (16Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of Gla was assigned that of Glu. The fractional dimer content (fdi) was calculated using the equation, fdi = (Mr(app) - Mr(mono) - nMr(metal))/Mr(mono) + nMr(metal) (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The stoichiometries (n) of Ca2+ binding to peptides 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 were determined from titration calorimetry (17Castellino F.J. Prorok M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19573-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All other peptides were assigned a Ca2+ stoichiometry of 3, based on the values empirically determined for 1 and 6.Calorimetrically Monitored Peptide Dimer Dissociation—The enthalpies attending the dissociation of the dimeric form of 1 were monitored at 15, 25, and 35 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Peptide was introduced into the syringe at a concentration of 2.4 mm in buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. At 3-min intervals, 8 μl of this solution was diluted into the sample cell containing 1.4 ml of buffer alone, and the enthalpy changes were recorded. The dilution of con-G[γ7P], a non-associating conantokin variant, was used to assess the contribution of heats of peptide dilution to the combined enthalpies of dilution and dimer dissociation observed with 1.Determination of the Heterodimerization Tendency of 1 and 6— The capacity of 1 and 6 to form heterodimers was determined through previously employed thiol-disulfide oxidation and rearrangement experiments using Cys-containing variants of 1 and 6 (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The progress of oxidation or rearrangement was monitored by analytical reverse-phase HPLC as follows. Reaction samples (20 μl) were injected onto an HPLC equipped with a Vydac C18 column (218TP, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) equilibrated in 95% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. At a time of 3 min post-injection, a 40-min gradient of 5–45% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN was implemented to elute the peptides. Absorbance detection was performed at 220 nm. Individual peaks were collected, lyophilized, and characterized by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight.Surface Plasmon Resonance-monitored Heterodimerization— Real time analysis of Ca2+-dependent heterodimerization between 1 and 6 was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (18De Crescenzo G. Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using a Biacore instrument, model 3000 (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The Cys-containing peptides were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips using the standard ligand thiol coupling protocol outlined by the manufacturer (18De Crescenzo G. Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The carboxymethylated dextran surface was activated by the injection of 45 μl of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, and modified by injection of 40 μl of 80 mm 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.5. Either 13 or 14 was dissolved in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 2.8 (280 μg/ml), and injected under manual control until the desired amount of peptide was coupled (500 to 2000 RUs). The thiol-reactive surface was subsequently quenched with 50 mm cysteine, 1 m NaCl. Sensorgrams were obtained at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and were corrected using double referencing. The running buffer was 10 mm NaBO3, 100 mm NaCl with or without 20 mm CaCl2. The dissociation constant (Kd) for each peptide was determined by plotting the RU at the extrapolated plateau of the binding curve versus the peptide concentration using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package (Biacore).Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were conducted on HEK293 cells transiently expressing combinations of NR1 (a or b) and NR2 (A or B) NMDARs as detailed in a prior study (19Klein R.C. Prorok M. Galdzicki Z. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26860-26867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at a holding potential of -70 mV. The extracellular solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes, and 20 mm dextrose, pH 7.35. Recording pipettes contained 140 mm CsF, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Cs-Hepes, 2 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 4 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.35. Currents were evoked with the application of extracellular solution containing 100 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine. The peptides were applied at a concentration of 40 μm. Solutions were applied using a nine-barrel rapid solution changer (Biologic, Calix, France) positioned 200–300 μm from the cell being perfused. Data were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized, and acquired on a personal computer using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).RESULTSEffects of Non-Gla Residues and Gla Arrangement on Self-assembly in the Conantokins—The primary sequences of the peptides synthesized for this study, as well as their putative α-helical heptad repeat assignments are shown in Fig. 1. The helix content and fractional dimer distribution of the nominal monomers, in the absence or presence of Ca2+, are summarized in Table 1. Several peptides were designed to evaluate the role of e, g and e′, g′ residues in the stabilization of the dimeric form of 1. These include the replacement of Arg13 with Ala, of Leu11 with Lys, and a triple variant (peptides 4, 2, and 3, respectively). Whereas all of the con-G variants displayed a diminution of helix content in the presence of saturating Ca2+, only 4 showed significantly reduced dimer content. In contrast, the truncation variant, 15, displayed a reduction in helicity comparable with that of 4, yet could dimerize to nearly the same extent as 1, the full-length parent. In 2, the presence of a Lys in heptad position e was predicted to increase dimer stability through electrostatic interactions with Gla4 in position e′ of the antiparallel partner helix. A similar strategy was invoked in the case of 3, wherein a Glu6 was predicted to promote g-g′ contacts with Arg13 in addition to the aforementioned e-e′ contacts between Lys11 and Gla4. The replacement of Glu2 with Lys was designed to decrease the negative i, i + 4 intrahelix repulsion between residues 2 and 6. The small increase in dimer content associated with the L11K replacement (2, fdi = 0.53) was further increased in 3, the E2K,Q6E,L11K variant (fdi = 0.62), suggesting that amino acids peripheral to the Ca2+-bridged helix-helix interface can influence the stability of the dimeric species.TABLE 1Ca2+ effects on the secondary structure and Mr(app) of conantokins and variantsPeptideMetal ionaFor both CD and ultracentrifugation experiments, the metal ion concentrations were 20 mm for Ca2+ and Mg2+.

Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab In the case of con-T, peptide 7 was used to confirm the contribution of Gla3 to the Ca2+-mediated self-association. Within con-G, this position was found to be crucial to the dimerization event (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The large decrease in fractional dimer content observed with 7 points toward a similar role for Gla3 within the context of the con-T peptide.Like 5, peptide 8 contains four Gla residues and fails to undergo self-association in the presence of Ca2+ (Table 1). However, unlike 5 and 1, the two C-terminal Gla residues of 8 occupy sequence positions 11 and 15, rather than positions 10 and 14 as occurs in the other conantokins. The Met8 → Gla variant, 9, was synthesized to determine whether an intervening Gla residue between Gla4 and Gla11 would be sufficient to permit Ca2+-mediated dimerization in a manner homologous to 6. Whereas 9 displayed a tendency to dimerize, the fractional dimer content was modest (fdi = 0.08) compared with the amount of dimer present in 1 and 6 under identical solution conditions. However, in 9 the ith residue in the i, i + 4, i + 7, i + 11 sequence is assumed by Gla4 rather than Gla3. Hence the ith residue in the con-R17 variant is flanked by its neighboring Gla on the N-terminal rather than C-terminal side (as occurs in 1 and 6). To provide for a con-R analog that more fully mimics the Gla pattern in 1 and 6, peptide 10 was synthesized. This variant contains five Gla residues that are arrayed identically to those within 1 and 6. These sequence alterations yielded a con-R17-based peptide with a 3-fold greater tendency to dimerize than 9.Heat Changes Accompanying Con-G Dimer Dissociation—The Ca2+-triggered dimerization of the conantokins appears to rely heavily on the electrostatic interactions that underlie interstrand metal ion bridging (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Dai Q. Castellino F.J. Prorok M.

Soc. 2007; 129: 1586-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To investigate the thermodynamics involved in the monomer-dimer equilibrium, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to monitor heat changes accompanying small injections of a high concentration (2.4 mm) of Ca2+-complexed 1 into a large volume of matching buffer at 15, 25, and 35 °C. Assuming a Kd of 170 μm for the monomer-dimer equilibrium (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a concentration of 2.4 mm would provide for a fractional dimer content of 0.82 in the syringe at 25 °C. Dilution of 8 μl of syringe sample into 1.4 ml of buffer results in a solution with substantially less dimer content (fdi = 0.12). Hence, the heat changes accompanying these dilution injections correspond to the dissociation process (as well as small heat changes stemming from sample dilution). Examples of the raw calorimetric data from the injection schedule are shown in Fig. 2. At each temperature examined, the dilutions gave rise to a series of endothermic peaks. Because dimer dissociation is endothermic, this requires the association process to be exothermic. In a parallel experiment, a non-dimerizing con-G variant, con-G[γ7P], was subjected to the identical dilution series. The con-G[γ7P] injections resulted in endothermic pulses much reduced in comparison to those deriving from the dilution profile of 1 and were attributed solely to heats of dilution. Despite the quality of the raw data, after subtracting these background heats from the data for 1, the integrated heats could not be fit to a simple model of monomer-dimer equilibrium (20Burrows S.D. Doyle M.L. Murphy K.P. Franklin S.G. White J.R. Brooks I. McNulty D.E. Scott M.O. Knutson J.R. Porter D. Young P.R. Hensley P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12741-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Raw calorimetric profile for the dilution of 1 at various temperatures. Each peak represents the heat changes accompanying the introduction of 8μl of 2.4 mm con-G (in buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) into 1.4 ml of buffer alone. The solid traces from bottom to top correspond to experiments conducted at 15, 25, and 35 °C. The dotted trace corresponds to a parallel experiment conducted with con-G(γ7P), a non-associating control peptide. Conditions employed for dilution of this species were identical to those employed for the dilution of con-G at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Qualitatively, it is clear that an inverse relationship exists between the magnitude of the first several enthalpies and the temperature at which the experiments were conducted. This corresponds to a negative heat capacity change for dimer dissociation and a positive change for subunit association. Because negative heat capacity changes are diagnostic of the displacement of solvent-exposed hydrophobic groups to more hydrophobic environments, the calorimetric data suggest that the formation of the con-G dimer complex is driven by electrostatic, not hydrophobic, interactions (21Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).Heterodimerization between Conantokin Peptides—It has been amply demonstrated that conantokin-based peptides undergo Ca2+-mediated self-association, provided that an optimal arrangement of Gla residues is present. This phenomenon raises the additional question of whether two different conantokins can associate to form a heterodimer. This possibility is not readily amenable to examination by sedimentation equilibrium approaches, because hetero-versus homomeric interactions are difficult to distinguish using this technique. As an alternative to sedimentation equilibrium analysis, we employed HPLC-monitored oxidative folding of thiol-containing peptides (10Dai Q. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Dai Q. Castellino F.J. Prorok M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Monera O.D. Zhou N.E.

Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) to assess the likelihood of strand alignment between heteromeric species. The two peptides recruited for this study were 11 and 14 that, if able to reversibly associate in a manner similar to 1 and 6, would allow for the positioning of Cys thiol groups at positions a and d′ in the antiparallel helix-helix interface (Fig. 1). The distribution of folding products obtained from a 1-h incubation of a 1:1 molar ratio of 11 and 14 under a variety of oxidizing conditions are shown in Fig. 3. In the presence of Ca2+, the heterodimeric disulfide product, 21, was the predominant species formed. A chromatogram obtained after 4 h of incubation was unchanged, reflecting the stability of the heterodimeric product initially formed (data not shown). However, in the presence of Mg2+, or in buffer alone, a mixture of homodimers, heterodimer, and reduced monomeric peptides were observed after 1 h of incubation. After 4 h of incubation, the chromatograms of the Mg2+-containing sample and buffer alone were similar and reflected the preferential formation of 21. Whereas random collision predicts a distribution of peptides 16, 19, and 21 of 1:1:2, respectively, the ratios obtained in Mg2+-containing and metal-free buffer were 1:1.1:3 (as shown for buffer, bottom trace of Fig. 3). These data indicate that whereas Ca2+ directs heterodimer formation consi"
https://openalex.org/W2048118095,"GGAs, a class of monomeric clathrin adaptors, are involved in the sorting of cargo at the trans-Golgi network of eukaryotic cells. They are modular structures consisting of the VHS, the GAT, hinge, and GAE domains, which have been shown to interact directly with cargo, ARF, clathrin, and accessory proteins, respectively. Previous studies have shown that GGAs interact with clathrin both in solution and in the cell, but it has yet been shown whether they assemble clathrin. We find that GGA1 promoted assembly of clathrin with complete assembly achieved when one GGA1 molecule is bound per heavy chain. In the presence of excess GGA1, we obtained the unusual stoichiometry of five GGA1s per heavy chain, and even at this stoichiometry the binding was not saturated. The assembled structures were mostly baskets, but ∼10% of the structures were tubular with an average length of 180 ± 40 nm and width of ∼50 nm. The truncated GGA1 fragment consisting of the hinge+GAE domains bound to clathrin with similar affinity as the full-length molecule and polymerized clathrin into baskets. Unlike the full-length molecule, this fragment saturated the lattices at one molecule per heavy chain and assembled clathrin only into baskets. The separated hinge and GAE domains bound much weaker to clathrin than the intact molecule, and these domains do not significantly polymerize clathrin into baskets. We conclude that clathrin adaptor GGA1 is a clathrin assembly protein, but it is unique in its ability to polymerize clathrin into tubules.

The family of GGA proteins are ubiquitously expressed monomeric clathrin adaptor proteins that function in the sorting and trafficking of cargo. Humans have three members of this family, whereas yeast has two. The GGAs have four domains, the N-terminal VHS domain that binds to proteins containing the DXXLL sorting sequence such as the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, the GAT domain that binds ARF1-GTP, the hinge domain that binds clathrin, and the C-terminal GAE 3The abbreviations used are: GAE, γ-adaptin ear homology domain of GGA; TGN, trans-Golgi network; AP1, assembly protein 1; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicles; CHC, clathrin heavy chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: GAE, γ-adaptin ear homology domain of GGA; TGN, trans-Golgi network; AP1, assembly protein 1; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicles; CHC, clathrin heavy chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. domain that binds accessory protein such as rabaptin-5 and γ-synergin (1Robinson M.S.

In addition, GGAs are present on transport intermediates emanating from the TGN and endosomes (7Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol.

Similarly, in yeast, GGAs are important in the trafficking of carboxypeptidase Y and carboxypeptidase S from the TGN to the vacuole (5Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S.

GGA uses this motif to sort epidermal growth factor receptor from the early endosome to the multivesicular body in mammalian cells and the GAP1 amino acid permease from the late Golgi to the vacuole in yeast (13Puertollano R.

The association of GGA with clathrin on the TGN and transport vesicles has been demonstrated by electron microscopy using immunogold labeling (5Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N.

Biochemical studies have established the direct interaction between GGAs and clathrin. GST-tagged fragments of the hinge and GAE domains from GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 bound to clathrin in GST-pulldown assays. In addition, recombinant full-length GGA1 mediated the GTP-dependent binding of clathrin to liposomes containing ARF1 (15Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). GGA1 and GGA2 were also found on microsomes but not on CCVs purified from rat liver (5Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Aside from genetic evidence suggesting interaction between GGA proteins and clathrin in yeast, direct physical association of GGA proteins and clathrin has been demonstrated for yeast proteins (12Costaguta G. Stefan C.J. Bensen E.S. Emr S.D. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1885-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This direct binding of yeast clathrin to yeast GGAs was demonstrated using GST-pulldown experiments, immunoprecipitation experiments, and chromatography of a high speed pellet enriched in yeast CCVs. Members of the family of monomeric clathrin adaptors include AP180 and β-arrestin, in addition to GGA proteins. In vitro experiments have shown that AP180 and β-arrestin have very different clathrin-binding properties. Specifically, AP180 binds with high affinity to clathrin and polymerizes clathrin with a stoichiometry of one AP180 per clathrin triskelion (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although β-arrestin binds to clathrin with high affinity, it does not polymerize clathrin into baskets (17Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As for the monomeric GGAs, although biochemical studies have established they bind to clathrin, there are contradictory observations regarding their strength of interaction with clathrin. In vivo studies have established that overexpression of GGA increases clathrin recruitment to the TGN ∼3-fold suggesting strong binding of GGA to clathrin (15Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when cells are permeabilized, GGAs readily dissociate from the TGN suggesting weak binding of GGAs to clathrin (18Hirst J. Lindsay M.R. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3573-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A biochemical study of the interaction of GGA with clathrin should help clarify these observations. In the present study we examined the ability of GGA1 and the domains of GGA1 to assemble clathrin and to bind to preassembled baskets. These studies show that, although GGA1 is able to assemble clathrin, it binds more weakly to clathrin than the multimeric clathrin adaptors AP1 and AP2 and the monomeric clathrin adaptor AP180. GGA1 also has a very unusual stoichiometry of binding to clathrin baskets with as many as five GGA1 molecules bound per CHC. Finally, we found that, unlike other adaptors, GGA1 polymerizes clathrin both into long tubules as well as into baskets. Unlike the full-length molecule, a fragment of GGA1 consisting of just the hinge and GAE domains bind with a stoichiometry of one molecule per CHC and only polymerizes clathrin into clathrin baskets. Protein Constructs and Purification—We used a bacterial expression system to purify full-length human GGA1 and the following domains of GGA1, hinge+GAE domain (amino acids 315–639), hinge domain (amino acids 315–514), and GAE domain (amino acids 515–639) (15Puertollano R.

VHS plus GAT (amino acids 1–314) was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector, and the human GGA2 (clone number: MGC-1002, ATCC, Manassas, VA) was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Bacteria were grown for 2 h before expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for another 4–5 h at 25 °C. The full-length His6-GGA1 was purified on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). GST fusion proteins were purified on Glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Protease inhibitor tablets (BD Biosciences) were added in the initial extraction step when preparing the GGA1 proteins. The GGA1 (hinge+GAE) construct and GGA2 in the pGEX-6P-1 vector were used to obtain the fusion protein in which we cleaved the GST moiety. To cleave GST from these constructs, we washed the matrix with cleavage buffer, added PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) to cleave the GST from the fusion protein-bound Glutathione-Sepharose matrix, and then incubated the mixture at 4 °C overnight. On the next day, the eluate was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. His6-AP180(C58) plasmid, comprising the 58-kDa C-terminal domain of AP180, was constructed and prepared as described previously (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Preparation of Hsc70, Clathrin, CCVs, Clathrin Triskelia, and Clathrin Baskets—Hsc70 was prepared from bovine brains, and clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from either fresh bovine brains or frozen rat livers (Pel-Freeze Biologicals, Rogers, AK) as described previously (19Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clathrin was extracted from brain CCVs using 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, and the high speed supernatant containing clathrin and APs was concentrated and loaded onto a preparative Superose 6 filtration column (2.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated in 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, at 25 °C to purify the clathrin. Pure clathrin baskets, and clathrin baskets assembled using APs were made as described previously (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The AP180(C58)-clathrin baskets had a composition of one AP180(C58) per clathrin triskelion (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentrations of clathrin, Hsc70, and GGA proteins were determined from their molar extinction coefficient and absorbance at 280 nm or from the Coomassie Blue intensity of these proteins on SDS gels using Hsc70 as a standard. Clathrin Binding and Clathrin Assembly Assays—The binding of full-length GGA and its domains to assembled clathrin baskets or CCVs was performed by incubating the proteins at 25 °C for 30 min in 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and either 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) or 20 mm MES (pH 6.0). The assembly of clathrin was performed by adding various concentrations of GGA to a fixed concentration of clathrin, followed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against polymerization buffer, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (16Ma Y. Greener T. Pacold M.E. Kaushal S. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The clathrin and GGA1 solutions were centrifuged in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge at 400,000 × g × for 6 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then run on SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis on 4–12% gels (Invitrogen). Varying dilutions of the supernatants were used in running the SDS gels to ensure that the proteins were always in the linear range of the Coomassie Blue scale. The clathrin and GGA in the supernatant were quantified from the Coomassie Blue intensity measured using the ChemiImager densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Electron Microscopy—For negatively stained images, 5-μl samples were applied to Formvar/carbon-coated grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Preparations of proteins were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 1% tannic acid before embedding in Epon. The thin sections were stained further with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate solution. Micrographs were taken by using a JEOL EX II electron microscope at 80 kV. The clathrin adaptor GGA1 and its domains were made as recombinant proteins in E. coli. The full-length GGA1 protein was expressed with a 6-histidine tag, whereas the hinge-GAE region, the hinge region alone, and the GAE region alone were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Fig. 1 shows an SDS-PAGE gel of the proteins after purification by column chromatography. Full-length GGA1 (lane 1) has two bands; the lower molecular weight band is a proteolytic fragment of the full-length protein. To minimize degradation, the full-length GGA1 was always used within 24 h of preparation. The GST fusion constructs of the hinge+GAE region, the hinge region alone, and the GAE region alone yielded single bands (lanes 2–4). The hinge+GAE domain construct without the GST tag (lane 5) was prepared by cleaving the GST fusion protein with PreScission Protease. We first examined the interaction of the full-length GGA1 with clathrin by determining whether GGA1 assembles clathrin into clathrin baskets. After overnight dialysis of GGA1 and clathrin against polymerization buffer, the clathrin-GGA1 solution was centrifuged to sediment the polymerized clathrin. The amount of free clathrin remaining in the supernatant was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis. In the absence of GGA1, there was no significant sedimentation of clathrin under this condition (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). When 6 μm GGA1 was added to 0.4 μm clathrin triskelia (1.2 μm CHC), most of the clathrin sedimented, leaving only a small amount of the total clathrin in the supernatant (lanes 3 and 4). These results show that GGA1 induces sedimentation of the clathrin, presumably due to polymerization of clathrin. Fig. 2B shows the concentration dependence of clathrin polymerization by GGA1. When 1 μm GGA1 was added to 0.3 μm clathrin triskelia, 50% of the GGA1 bound to the clathrin and correspondingly ∼50% of the clathrin polymerized. To completely polymerize 0.3 μm clathrin triskelia, it was necessary to add ∼2 μm GGA1. Under these conditions, one GGA1 molecule was bound per CHC (Fig. 2B). These results also indicate that GGA1 binds relatively weakly to clathrin with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range. From the intensities of the unbound GGA1 bands in the SDS gel, the amount of GGA1 bound to the polymerized clathrin was calculated at each concentration of added GGA1. When the clathrin was completely polymerized, the stoichiometry of binding was one GGA1 per CHC. Surprisingly, however, as more GGA1 was added, it continued to bind to the polymerized clathrin reaching an unusually high stoichiometry of binding. For example, when 0.4 μm clathrin triskelia were polymerized by 6 μm GGA1, there was negligible GGA1 left in the supernatant, and this was not due to sedimentation of the GGA1 alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Rather, the intensities of the bands on the SDS gel showed that ∼5 GGA1 molecules bound per CHC. Furthermore, there was no indication that the GGA1 binding was approaching saturation as the GGA1 concentration was increased. We also examined the binding of GGA1 to preformed clathrin lattices. In particular, we examined whether this binding also shows much more than one GGA1 molecule bound per CHC. The concentration dependence of GGA1 binding was measured using the following substrates: pure clathrin baskets at pH6.0, AP180(C58)-clathrin baskets at pH 7.0, or rat liver CCVs at pH 7.0. Rat liver CCVs are enriched in lipid and AP1 and are therefore the most physiological substrate for GGA1, a clathrin adaptor found at the TGN. As shown in Fig. 2C, essentially the same binding isotherms were obtained with the different substrates. Specifically, as the GGA1 concentration was increased, more than five GGA1 molecules bound per CHC with no indication of the binding reaching saturation. Therefore, we observed the same unusual binding properties of GGA1 to preassembled clathrin lattices as to clathrin assembled into lattices by the GGA1 itself. Furthermore, the GGA1 binding to clathrin did not appear to be affected by varying conditions such as pH, the presence of other clathrin adaptors, or the presence of membrane. We next examined whether GGA2 shows the same unusual stoichiometry of binding to clathrin as GGA1. First, the ability of GGA2 to polymerize clathrin into clathrin baskets was measured using 6 μm GGA2 and 0.3 μm clathrin triskelia. As expected, GGA2 polymerized clathrin just like GGA1, but with a very different stoichiometry of binding as indicated by all the free GGA2 in the supernatant (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The stoichiometry of binding, calculated from the total and free concentrations of GGA2, was 1.0 molecule of GGA2 bound per molecule of CHC in the polymerized baskets. Similar results were obtained for the binding of GGA2 to pure clathrin baskets measured using 6 μm GGA2 and 0.3 μm pure clathrin baskets at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3B). The stoichiometry of binding was calculated to be 0.6 molecule GGA2 per CHC, again very different from that obtained with GGA1. To verify the unusual stoichiometry of GGA1 binding, we measured the stoichiometry directly by resuspending the GGA1-clathrin pellets obtained from both the assembly and binding experiments. After SDS electrophoresis of the resuspended pellets, the clathrin and GGA1 concentrations were then calculated from the Coomassie Blue intensities. In the assembly experiment, when 5 μm GGA1 was used to assemble 0.3 μm clathrin triskelia, the clathrin and GGA1 bands have similar intensities in both the original sample and resuspended pellet (Fig. 4A). From the staining intensities, the pellet had a ratio of 3.8 GGA1 molecules per CHC. In the binding experiment, when 4 μm GGA1 was added to 0.3 μm pure clathrin baskets, the resuspended pellet had a ratio of 3.2 GGA1 molecules bound per CHC. These results are in agreement with the stoichiometry of binding calculated from measuring the free GGA1 in the supernatant. To examine whether GGA1 either self-assembles or assembles on soluble clathrin triskelia, we performed column chromatography experiments. Fig. 4B shows the elution profile from the Superose 12 column obtained from incubating 10 μm GGA1 with 1 μm clathrin triskelia. The monomeric clathrin, which eluted in the void volume, showed no interaction with GGA1. The GGA1 eluted in the same fraction in the presence and absence of clathrin (data not shown). Moreover, GGA1 alone was not self-assembling, because it eluted in the same position as the 70-kDA protein, Hsc70. Therefore, the unusual binding stoichiometry of GGA1 to clathrin only occurs with polymerized clathrin. Given the unusual binding properties of GGA1 to polymerized clathrin, we examined by electron microscopy whether clathrin polymerized by GGA1 formed clathrin baskets. The dialysate obtained after overnight dialysis of 0.3 μm clathrin with 10 μm GGA was imaged using negative staining. As shown in Fig. 5, GGA1 clearly polymerized the clathrin into baskets, but in addition to baskets, we obtained an unusual tubule-shaped clathrin lattice. These structures, which were 10% of the population in 230 images, had an average length of 180 ± 40 nm and a width of ∼50 nm. As shown in Fig. 5B, some of the clathrin tubules had a very ordered appearance and frequently we could detect rows of hexagons in these tubules. The clathrin baskets polymerized by GGA1 had a denser appearance and a less well defined edge than baskets polymerized in the absence of GGA1. This is evident by comparing baskets polymerized by AP180 (C58) to the identical baskets incubated with 10 μm GGA1 (Fig. 5, C and D). Similar dense appearance of baskets was obtained from incubating pure clathrin baskets with 10 μm GGA1 (Fig. 5, E and F). In addition, we found that there was a reduction in the diameter of AP180 (C58) baskets in the presence of GGA1. In the absence of GGA1, the baskets had a diameter of 99 ± 11 nm (n = 100), whereas the diameter was reduced to 73 ± 8nm(n = 100) in the presence of GGA1. This suggests that the baskets are more rigid in the presence of GGA1 and do not flatten on the grid when they are processed for negative staining. Polymerization of clathrin by GGA2 produced baskets (data not shown). Tubules were only observed when clathrin was polymerized in the presence of excess GGA1. They were not found when clathrin was polymerized by excess GGA2 or when GGA1 was added to preformed baskets. We next investigated whether the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct shows the same high stoichiometry of binding to clathrin as full-length GGA1. The graph in Fig. 6A shows that the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct polymerized clathrin with a stoichiometry of one hinge+GAE molecule bound per CHC, the same binding stoichiometry as occurs with full-length GGA1. Unlike the intact molecule, the binding was saturated as evident by the constant stoichiometry with increasing concentrations of the hinge+GAE construct. Electron microscopy verified that the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct assembled clathrin into baskets, but interestingly no tubule formation was observed (data not shown). We also measured the binding of a GST-(hinge+GAE) construct to pure clathrin baskets. As shown in Fig. 6B, the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct bound to clathrin with a stoichiometry of one hinge+GAE construct per CHC, and again this binding saturated at one hinge+GAE construct per CHC. To verify the stoichiometry of binding of the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct to clathrin, we resuspended and analyzed the pellets from both the assembly experiment and the binding experiments (Fig. 6C). After overnight dialysis of 0.35 μm clathrin triskelia and 8 μm GST-(hinge+GAE) construct, the resuspended pellet showed 1.2 GST-(hinge+GAE) construct bound per CHC. Similarly, in the binding experiment to preformed baskets using 0.35 μm clathrin triskelia and 10 μm GST-(hinge+GAE) construct, the pellet had 1.1 GST-(hinge+GAE) construct bound per CHC. Therefore, the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct does not show the high stoichiometry of binding observed with full-length GGA1, nor does it induce formation of clathrin tubules. Because GST fusion proteins dimerize we were concerned that the stoichiometry of binding might be affected by the presence of GST. Therefore, to ensure that the GST-(hinge+GAE) construct bound with a stoichiometry of one molecule per CHC, the GST tag was cleaved using PreScission Protease. Baskets were then assembled by overnight dialysis of 0.3 μm clathrin triskelia and 5 μm hinge+GAE construct against polymerization buffer, and the resuspended pellet was analyzed by SDS gel. The results showed a binding stoichiometry of 1.35 hinge+GAE construct bound per CHC. Similarly, when 5 μm hinge+GAE construct was added to 0.3 μm pure clathrin baskets at pH 6.0, the resuspended pellet showed a stoichiometry of 0.9 hinge+GAE construct domain bound per CHC. Therefore, in contrast to full-length GGA1, which bound with an unusually high stoichiometry to clathrin, we obtained a stoichiometry of binding of one hinge+GAE construct per CHC. Next, because the hinge domain of GGA1 contains the clathrin-binding motif, LLDDE, we measured the ability of the GST-hinge domain of GGA1 without the adjacent GAE region to bind to and polymerize clathrin. As shown in Fig. 7A, the hinge domain alone was much less effective than the full-length molecule or hinge+GAE construct in polymerizing clathrin. Even at a concentration of 10 μm hinge, only one-third of the added clathrin sedimented. Electron microscopy of this preparation showed that there were some clathrin baskets that formed in the midst of the free hinge and clathrin triskelia (data not shown). We also measured the binding of the GST-hinge domain to preformed clathrin baskets at pH 6.0. In this experiment we raised the clathrin concentration to 1 μm so that we could detect the weak binding of the hinge domain to the baskets. Although 50% of the hinge-GAE domain bound to clathrin when 1 μm hinge-GAE domain was added to 0.3 μm clathrin baskets, 4.5 μm hinge domain alone had to be added to 1.5 μm clathrin baskets to obtain 50% hinge domain binding (Fig. 7B). Therefore, the hinge domain without the adjacent GAE binds clathrin weakly, which accounts for the poor polymerizing properties of the hinge domain. These results indicate that the GAE domain contributes to the binding of the hinge domain to clathrin. We also examined the ability of the GST-GAE domain of GGA1 to assemble clathrin and to bind to perform clathrin baskets. As shown in Fig. 7C, there was neither detectable polymerization of clathrin by 10 μm GST-GAE. Likewise, there was no binding of GST-GAE to 1.0 μm pure clathrin baskets (Fig. 7D). Therefore, although the GAE domain alone did not bind to clathrin, the presence of this domain significantly strengthened the binding of the hinge domain, which contained the clathrin binding site. The last construct we examined was the GST-VHS-GAT domain of GGA1, which has no known clathrin-binding motif. As expected, there was no significant binding of this construct to clathrin baskets (data not shown). This study has shown that, although the clathrin adaptor GGA1 acts as a clathrin assembly protein, it differs in its properties from other common adaptor proteins such as the multimeric adaptors, AP1 and AP2, and the monomeric adaptor, AP180. Based on the biochemical properties of GGA1 that we observed, several apparently contradictory findings can now be explained. First, although GGA1 is localized to the TGN of cells, it is not found in isolated rat liver CCVs (5Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Hirst J. Lindsay M.R. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3573-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, it readily dissociates from the Golgi as soon as the cell is permeabilized (18Hirst J. Lindsay M.R. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3573-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that GGA1 did not polymerize clathrin stoichiometrically, but rather it bound relatively weakly with the addition of 1 μm GGA1 polymerizing only 50% of the 0.3 μm clathrin present. This indicated that the dissociation constant of GGA1 is ∼0.5 μm, a relatively weak dissociation constant that could explain why GGA1 readily dissociates from clathrin when the cell is permeabilized. The affinity of GGA1 for clathrin was not affected by the presence of other clathrin adaptors or the presence of lipid in the CCVs. Our biochemical studies may also explain other in vivo observations made on GGA1. Puertollano et al. (15Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) observed that excess GGA1 recruits 3-fold more clathrin to the Golgi. In addition, in vivo studies have shown that the transport carriers containing GGA1, clathrin, and AP1 that emanate from the TGN are much larger than coated vesicles and are often tubular (13Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These tubules are even observed in the absence of overexpressed GGAs (20Waguri S. Dewitte F. Le B.R. Rouille Y. Uchiyama Y. Dubremetz J.F. Hoflack B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 142-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ability of GGA1 to tubulate clathrin in vitro may promote the initiation of the long tubules observed emanating from the TGN in vivo. To obtain long tubules of clathrin, the clathrin in the tubes would be organized predominantly in a hexagonal array, because pentagons induce the clathrin to form closed vesicles. Using correlative light electron microscopy technique, transport carriers emanating from the Golgi ranged from the typical CCVs to larger, convoluted tubular-vesicular structures displaying several coated buds. As expected, clathrin was found associated with buds and on vesicles, whereas in addition to these structures, GGA1 was also found to decorate tubules (21Polishchuk R.S. San P.E. Di P.A. Tete S. Bonifacino J.S. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1092-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of other monomeric clathrin adaptors produces a very different phenotype. When AP180 or its homolog, CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein), is overexpressed in the cell, there is a loss of clathrin from the TGN (22Tebar F. Bohlander S.K. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of auxilin or GAK, the clathrin binding Hsc70 cochaperones, results in a loss of clathrin from the TGN (23Zhao X. Greener T. Al-Hasani H. Cushman S.W. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 353-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these adaptors sequestered clathrin in granules in the cytosol. Interestingly, GGA2 does not show the same clathrin-binding properties as GGA1 in that, unlike GGA1, it binds with a stoichiometry of one GGA2 per clathrin heavy chain. The structure of GGA2 is known to differ from that of GGA1. First, unlike GGA1 and GGA3, the clathrin hinge of GGA2 does not bind to its own VHS domain to create a closed conformation (24Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report from the Brodsky laboratory (25Knuehl C.Y. Chen C.Y. Manalo V. Hwang P.K. Ota Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has identified two other motifs that interact with clathrin in addition to the LLDDE canonical clathrin-binding motif in the hinge region of GGA1 (6Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One of these clathrin-binding sites is also located in the hinge region and binds to the N-terminal domain just like the canonical motif. Based on sequence homology, it does not appear to be in GGA2. The other binding site, which is located in the GAE domain of GGA1, binds to the clathrin ankle and not the clathrin N-terminal domain (25Knuehl C.Y. Chen C.Y. Manalo V. Hwang P.K. Ota Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this site exists in the GAE domain of GGA2, because the interface between clathrin and the GAE domain is not a linear motif (25Knuehl C.Y. Chen C.Y. Manalo V. Hwang P.K. Ota Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unlike the full-length molecule, the hinge+GAE construct of GGA1 did not induce the formation of long tubules. Moreover, it bound with a stoichiometry of one hinge+GAE domain per CHC. This suggests that there is another region in GGA1 not present in the full-length GGA2 that must account for the unusual properties of the full-length molecule. GGA1 can fold back on itself and bind to its own VHS domain (24Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); it thus creates a closed conformation that can be reopened by dephosphorylation of a serine adjacent to the clathrin binding site in the hinge region. Because the hinge region is known to interact with the VHS domain in GGA1, the high stoichiometry of GGA1 binding to clathrin may be due to a domain-swapping mechanism in which the hinge domain of one molecule binds to the VHS domain of an adjacent molecule (26Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), thereby causing formation of an interlocking GGA1 oligomer. This oligomerization would only occur after a GGA1 monomer binds to a clathrin basket provided that the binding produces the open conformation necessary for the binding of additional GGA1 molecules. This could explain why GGA1 does not form oligomeric structures in the absence of clathrin baskets even when monomeric clathrin is present. Because the results of this study show that GGA1, unlike GGA2, binds with a high stoichiometry of clathrin and forms tubules, this suggests that the effects of GGA1 are specific and therefore are likely to be physiological. In the cell, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation produces the open form of GGA1 that binds to cargo (27Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The results of this study show that this conformation also promotes tubule formation. Therefore, GGA1 may be having a dual function when dephosphorylated in the cell in initiating the tubules observed emanating from the TGN containing GGA1 and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (21Polishchuk R.S. San P.E. Di P.A. Tete S. Bonifacino J.S. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1092-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and binding to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The hinge domain alone bound much more weakly to clathrin than the hinge+GAE construct showing that, even though the hinge domain has the clathrin binding site, the GAE domain contributes to the binding. This is in agreement with previous studies also observed that the hinge+GAE domain interacted with clathrin in the cytosol better than the hinge domain (15Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results agree with the recent observation from the Brodsky laboratory (25Knuehl C.Y. Chen C.Y. Manalo V. Hwang P.K. Ota Brodsky F.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the GAE domain actually contributes to the pocket where clathrin binds. Although we have obtained insight into the biochemical interactions of GGA1 and clathrin, the interaction of GGA1 with the many other proteins in the cell would no doubt affect its interaction with clathrin. GGAs are recruited to the plasma membrane by activated ARF1. In addition, GGAs not only bind to clathrin but also to the multimeric assembly protein, AP1 (27Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The AP1 binding site of GGA1 has been localized to the WNSF sequence in the GGA1 hinge region (28Bai H. Doray B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of cargo and other proteins such as γ-synergin and rabaptin may also alter the interaction of GGA with clathrin. Sorting out these interactions and how they are regulated will ultimately provide an understanding of how GGAs interact with clathrin and the role of GGAs in the budding of clathrin-coated transport carriers from the TGN.

https://openalex.org/W2012964046,"N6-Adenine methylation is an important epigenetic signal, which regulates various processes, such as DNA replication and repair and transcription. In gamma-proteobacteria, Dam is a stand-alone enzyme that methylates GATC sites, which are non-randomly distributed in the genome. Some of these overlap with transcription factor binding sites. This work describes a global computational analysis of a published Dam knockout microarray alongside other publicly available data to throw insights into the extent to which Dam regulates transcription by interfering with protein binding. The results indicate that DNA methylation by DAM may not globally affect gene transcription by physically blocking access of transcription factors to binding sites. Down-regulation of Dam during stationary phase correlates with the activity of TFs whose binding sites are enriched for GATC sites."

The leucine-rich NES is recognized by the export receptor Crm1 to mediate export via interaction with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here, we show that certain mutant Nmd3 proteins that are impaired for binding to the 60S subunit accumulate at the nuclear envelope. These mutant proteins also show enhanced binding to Crm1, both in vivo and in vitro. Although their interaction with the NPC is dependent on recognition of the NES by Crm1, their interaction with Crm1 is not strictly dependent on RanGTP. Using a collection of GFP-tagged nucleoporin mutants, we identified several nucleoporins, including components of the Nup82 complex that copurified with the mutant Nmd3. The Nup82 complex is on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and has previously been shown to be important as a terminal binding site for Crm1-mediated export. Mutations in the Nup82 complex led to accumulation of wild-type Nmd3 in the nucleoplasm, suggesting that the interaction of mutant Nmd3 with the Nup82 complex reflects a defect in the bona fide export pathway for the 60S subunit. These results suggest that in the absence of the ribosome, Nmd3 is not efficiently released from Crm1 at the NPC.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). 14 karyopherins have been identified thus far in yeast (6Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and they all share a common structural organization, including an N-terminal Ran-binding loop, a central nucleoporin-binding domain, and a C-terminal cargo-binding motif (2Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Karyopherins can be subcategorized as either importins or exportins (3Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar, 7Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F.

The binding of exportins to their substrates in the nucleus depends on the formation of a ternary complex with RanGTP that enhances the exportin-cargo interaction (8Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Rush M. D'Eustachio P. The Small GTPase Ran. 2001: 59-77Google Scholar). Upon translocation to the cytoplasm, hydrolysis of GTP on Ran, stimulated by a cytoplasmic GTPase-activating protein (GAP), results in a conformational change that disassembles the export complex (9Petosa C. Schoehn G. Askjaer P. Bauer U. Moulin M. Steuerwald U. Soler-Lopez M. Baudin F. Mattaj I.W. Muller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 761-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The directionality of export is controlled by the high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus versus cytoplasm and the requirement for RanGTP to stabilize the interaction of exportins with their cargo in the nucleus. Among exportins, Crm1 recognizes the greatest diversity of substrates, ranging from ribosomes to cell cycle regulators (10la Cour T. Kiemer L. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 11Fornerod M. Ohno M. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2002; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Crm1 binds cargo molecules that possess leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NESs) (12Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Upon formation of an export complex with RanGTP, Crm1 transports its cargo through the NPC. In yeast, NPCs are composed of ∼30 proteins that are arranged in hierarchical subcomplexes (15Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y.M. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). One such subcomplex composed of Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1 (the “Nup82 complex”) is located on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. Conditional mutations in this complex cause accumulation of ribosomal subunits in the nucleoplasm (17Gleizes P.E. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Leger-Silvestre I. Teulieres F. Dauxois J.Y. Pommet D. Azum-Gelade M.C. Gas N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells Crm1 shows particularly strong binding to Nup214, the homologue of yeast Nup159 (14Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, Nup214 acts as a terminal-binding site for Crm1 prior to export complex disassembly at the NPC (19Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). While the Nup82 complex has also been implicated in the export of mRNPs, this function is physically separable from that of ribosome export (17Gleizes P.E. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Leger-Silvestre I. Teulieres F. Dauxois J.Y. Pommet D. Azum-Gelade M.C. Gas N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nmd3 is the export adapter for the 60S ribosomal subunit, bridging the interaction between the subunit and Crm1 (20Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J.

Kahan L. Johnson A.W. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Nmd3 is driven by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a NES, both of which are located in the C terminus of the protein. The leucine-rich NES (amino acids 496–505) is predicted to form an amphipathic helix with the hydrophobic residues critical for Crm1 interaction aligned on one surface (reviewed in Refs. 11Fornerod M. Ohno M. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2002; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 24la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of this NES results in the nuclear accumulation of both Nmd3 and nascent 60S ribosomal subunits (20Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Ho J.H.N. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W. J.

Trends Biol. Sci. 2002; 11: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the molecular details of how the subunit is recruited to the NPC are lacking. Here, we identify a class of Nmd3 mutants that fail to bind to 60S subunits and accumulate at the NPC in a Crm1-dependent fashion. The localization of these mutant Nmd3 proteins at the NPC implies that the ribosome contributes to disassembly of Crm1 from the pre-60S subunit at the NPC.

The product was digested with BglII and PacI and cloned into the sames sites of pAJ582 and pAJ1406 to give pAJ1599 and pAJ1600, respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy—Overnight cultures of AJY1539, AJY1848, or AJY1849 expressing GFP-tagged Nmd3 alleles were diluted to A600 ∼ 0.15 in fresh glucose-containing drop-out media, cultured at 30 °C and visualized as described (28Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—Overnight cultures were diluted to A600 ∼ 0.15 in 150 ml of fresh drop-out medium (with glucose) and cultured at 30 °C to A600 ∼ 0.4. Cells collected, washed once in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors) and resuspended in one volume of lysis buffer. Extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis (5 × 50 s cycles of vortexing with 1-min intervals on ice) and clarified by centrifugation. 1.5 μl of anti-c-Myc (9E10; Covance) antibody was added to equal A260 units of sample supernatants, and extracts were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A-agarose bead slurry (Invitrogen) were added to each sample, followed by rocking for an additional 1 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted by heating in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Purification of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—The GST-Nmd3 fusion proteins were expressed and purified from yeast strain BJ5464 containing pAJ690 or pAJ693. Briefly, cultures were diluted to A600 ∼ 0.15 in SC-ura (raffinose) media, incubated for 6 h at 30°C, and induced for 6 h with 1% galactose. Cells were washed once in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer and lysed as described above. Following clarification, 1/10 bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the extract, and the suspension was rocked for 1 h. The suspension was then loaded into column, washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 50 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing GST-Nmd3 were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). GST-(PKI)NES was purified in the following manner. A culture of Stratagene codon+ (RIL) containing pAJ1538 was diluted to an A600 ∼ 0.1 in Luria broth containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and cultured at 37 °C to an A600 ∼ 0.4. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 30°C. Cells were washed once in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), resuspended in ten volumes of lysis buffer and sonicated. Subsequent purification steps were as described for the GST-Nmd3. Purification of Crm1-His6 was as follows. A culture of Stratagene codon+ (RIL) containing pAJ1541 (CRM1-His6) was diluted to A600 ∼ 0.1 in Luria broth containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and cultured at 37 °C to an A600 ∼ 0.4. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 25°C. Cells were washed once in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 15 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors), resuspended in ten volumes of lysis buffer and sonicated. Following clarification, Ni-NTA resin was added, and the suspension was rocked for 1 h. The suspension was loaded into a column, washed with lysis buffer and bound protein was eluted in lysis buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Crm1-His6 were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2). His6-Ran was purified from Escherichia coli containing pKW581 and charged with GTP as described (43Maurer P. Redd M. Solsbacher J. Bischoff F.R. Greiner M. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Stade K. Weis K. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All protein purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C, and concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay. Export Complex Assays—Purified GST-(PKI)NES, GST-Nmd3, or GST-Nmd3ΔN167 (∼75 pmol) were combined with ∼75 pmol of Crm-His6 in the presence or absence of 125 pmol of RanGTP in a volume of 200 μl in 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min before diluting 2-fold with fresh binding buffer and adding 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by heating in Laemmli buffer. One-fourth of the eluate from each reaction was used for SDS-PAGE. Identification of Mutant Nmd3 Proteins That Accumulate at the Nuclear Pore Complex—In a screen for nmd3 loss-of-function mutants (25Hedges J. Chen Y.I. West M. Bussiere C. Johnson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36579-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we identified three mutants that exhibited unusual localization (Fig. 1A). In contrast to wild-type Nmd3-GFP, which was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, the Nmd3(I139T,L259S,L296P)-GFP, Nmd3(L263P,F318I)-GFP, and Nmd3(V340D)-GFP mutant proteins accumulated in a striking ring-like pattern around the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Mutant c-Myc-tagged Nmd3 proteins behaved similarly (data not shown). To determine whether these nmd3 mutants were accumulating at the nuclear envelope, we co-expressed the GFP-tagged mutant proteins with Nic96-mRFP, a marker for nuclear pore complexes. Indeed, the mutant Nmd3-GFP proteins co-localized with Nic96-mRFP, with one mutant, Nmd3(I139T, L259S, L296P)-GFP, showing particularly strong envelope enrichment (Fig. 1B). To facilitate detection of Crm1 in subsequent experiments described below we used a strain expressing the crm1T539C allele, which was also epitope-tagged with HA (27Neville M. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3746-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This allele of CRM1 renders yeast sensitive to leptomycin B but is not reported to alter CRM1 function otherwise. However, we found that the nuclear envelope accumulation of the mutant Nmd3 proteins described here was enhanced in this allele of CRM1, possibly because of the HA tag rather than the T539C mutation. Nevertheless, the NPC localization of Nmd3(I139T, L259S, L296P)-GFP could be observed in wild-type cells, where the fluorescence around the nuclear rim typically formed only a partial ring (Fig. 1C). Enhancing the affinity of the NES of mutant Nmd3 for CRM1 (Nmd3(I139T, L259S, L296P-supraNES, see below), led to a significant increase in the NPC localization of mutant Nmd3 in CRM1 wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). These three NPC-localizing nmd3 mutants contained point mutations within two regions of Nmd3 implicated in 60S binding (25Hedges J. Chen Y.I. West M. Bussiere C. Johnson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36579-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). nmd3(V340D) was initially characterized as a strong loss of function mutant that was significantly impaired for binding to 60S subunits and could not support growth when expressed as the only copy of Nmd3 (25Hedges J. Chen Y.I. West M. Bussiere C. Johnson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36579-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To examine whether the other NPC localized mutants were also defective for 60S binding, we performed immunoprecipitations (IPs) from cells expressing c-Myc-tagged versions of the mutants, monitoring Rpl8 as a reporter for 60S subunits. The NPC-localized mutants exhibited a dramatic deficit in 60S binding relative to wild-type Nmd3 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that mutant Nmd3 proteins that cannot bind to 60S subunits accumulate at NPCs. Accumulation of Mutant Nmd3 Proteins at the NPC Is Crm1-dependent—As the dissociation of export cargo from Crm1 and RanGTP at the nuclear envelope is typically very rapid, cargo is generally not observed at the NPC using standard microscopic techniques. However, Engelsma et al. (29Engelsma D. Bernad R. Calafat J. Fornerod M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3643-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) identified NES-like peptides from a pool of randomly generated synthetic peptides, that exhibited a marked nuclear envelope accumulation in permeabilized HeLa cells. These synthetic NESs showed unusually strong interaction with Crm1, leading to their description as “supraphysiological” (29Engelsma D. Bernad R. Calafat J. Fornerod M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3643-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results led us to consider tha"
https://openalex.org/W2014404483,"CD2 is a T cell surface molecule that enhances T and natural killer cell function by binding its ligands CD58 (humans) and CD48 (rodents) on antigen-presenting or target cells. Here we show that the CD2/CD58 interaction is enthalpically driven and accompanied by unfavorable entropic changes. Taken together with structural studies, this indicates that binding is accompanied by energetically significant conformational adjustments. Despite having a highly charged binding interface, neither the affinity nor the rate constants of the CD2/CD58 interaction were affected by changes in ionic strength, indicating that long-range electrostatic forces make no net contribution to binding."
