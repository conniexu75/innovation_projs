https://openalex.org/W2033386838,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains much of the body's serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), but mechanisms controlling the metabolism of gut-derived 5-HT remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota plays a critical role in regulating host 5-HT. Indigenous spore-forming bacteria (Sp) from the mouse and human microbiota promote 5-HT biosynthesis from colonic enterochromaffin cells (ECs), which supply 5-HT to the mucosa, lumen, and circulating platelets. Importantly, microbiota-dependent effects on gut 5-HT significantly impact host physiology, modulating GI motility and platelet function. We identify select fecal metabolites that are increased by Sp and that elevate 5-HT in chromaffin cell cultures, suggesting direct metabolic signaling of gut microbes to ECs. Furthermore, elevating luminal concentrations of particular microbial metabolites increases colonic and blood 5-HT in germ-free mice. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that Sp are important modulators of host 5-HT and further highlight a key role for host-microbiota interactions in regulating fundamental 5-HT-related biological processes."

As a neurogenic niche, the hippocampus supports pronounced L1 activity. However, the basal parameters and biological impact of L1-driven mosaicism remain unclear. Here, we performed single-cell retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq) on individual human hippocampal neurons and glia, as well as cortical neurons. An estimated 13.7 somatic L1 insertions occurred per hippocampal neuron and carried the sequence hallmarks of target-primed reverse transcription. Notably, hippocampal neuron L1 insertions were specifically enriched in transcribed neuronal stem cell enhancers and hippocampus genes, increasing their probability of functional relevance. In addition, bias against intronic L1 insertions sense oriented relative to their host gene was observed, perhaps indicating moderate selection against this configuration in vivo. These experiments demonstrate pervasive L1 mosaicism at genomic loci expressed in hippocampal neurons."

By studying regeneration of hair follicles in response to patterned hair plucking, we demonstrate that organ-level quorum sensing allows coordinated responses to skin injury. Plucking hair at different densities leads to a regeneration of up to five times more neighboring, unplucked resting hairs, indicating activation of a collective decision-making process. Through data modeling, the range of the quorum signal was estimated to be on the order of 1 mm, greater than expected for a diffusible molecular cue. Molecular and genetic analysis uncovered a two-step mechanism, where release of CCL2 from injured hairs leads to recruitment of TNF-α-secreting macrophages, which accumulate and signal to both plucked and unplucked follicles. By coupling immune response with regeneration, this mechanism allows skin to respond predictively to distress, disregarding mild injury, while meeting stronger injury with full-scale cooperative activation of stem cells.

The effective coordination of organ behavior, either under physiological conditions or as a response to injury, is essential for survival. Integration at the level of large-scale organ systems has been extensively studied, but the role of shorter range, local coordination has not. For example, is the regeneration of repeated tissue units within an organ (e.g., hair follicles [HFs] in skin, villi in intestine) coordinated so as to achieve collective decision-making? If so, what are the mechanisms of communication, and how is information integrated? In particular, if injury or malfunction affects only a subset of tissue units in an organ, how is such a collective decision made whether to mount a response that is local (e.g., local repair) or global (e.g., tissue level regeneration)? Mammalian skin offers an excellent platform to address such questions, because its numerous HFs behave as discrete, repeating, semi-autonomous tissue units (Jahoda and Christiano, 2011Jahoda C.A.

HFs undergo cyclic regeneration (Paus et al., 1998Paus R. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Kopp T. Hagen E. Müller-Röver S. Hofmann U.

The experimental accessibility of HFs makes them an ideal model to study collective decision making in an organ population in vivo. Classical studies show that hair plucking produces a micro-injury that can potentially lead to hair regeneration (Collins, 1918Collins H.H.

DNA synthesis in the adult hair germ during dormancy (telogen) and activation (early anagen).Dev. Biol. 1970; 21: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This process is thought to be mediated by an autonomous mechanism in each follicle, in which early apoptosis in the bulge leads to activation of hair germ progenitors (Ito et al., 2002Ito M. Kizawa K. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Label-retaining cells in the bulge region are directed to cell death after plucking, followed by healing from the surviving hair germ.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we uncover evidence that the decision of hair stem cells to be activated or remain quiescent also depends on information coming from neighboring follicles. This possibility was first suggested by our earlier study in which plucking fewer than 50 refractory telogen hairs did not induce hair regeneration, while plucking more than 200 hairs did (Plikus et al., 2008Plikus M.V. Mayer J.A. de la Cruz D. Baker R.E. Maini P.K. Maxson R. Chuong C.M. Cyclic dermal BMP signalling regulates stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Nature. 2008; 451: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Here, by varying the spacing, arrangement, and shapes of plucked regions, we unexpectedly found that plucking 200 hairs, with a proper topological distribution can cause up to 1,200 hairs to regenerate. These results demonstrate marked non-autonomy in HF regeneration and a distinctly non-linear quantitative relationship between plucking and regeneration. As discussed below, the collective HF response to injury may be seen as an example of quorum sensing, a form of social behavior in which population decisions depend on the density of signaling individuals within a given spatial territory (Bassler, 2002Bassler B.L. Small talk. Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria.Cell. 2002; 109: 421-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, Pratt, 2005Pratt S.C. Quorum sensing by encounter rates in the ant Temnothorax albipennis.Behav. Ecol. 2005; 16: 488-496Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In order to gain insights into the possible mechanisms underlying this behavior, we first used mathematical modeling to identify the characteristic spatial range over which quorums are sensed, which led us to suspect that the signaling mechanism consists of more than just a diffusible molecule. The time course of molecular changes after plucking, together with the results of genetic and pharmacological manipulation, implicated a two-stage mechanism, involving the release of diffusible signals that recruit immune cells (M1 macrophages) which then actively spread among follicles, where they locally induce regeneration through the release of substances such as Tnf-α. This work identifies a mechanism for quorum sensing that operates on the millimeter scale to coordinate the behaviors of semi-autonomous tissue units within an organ. Such coordination enables the skin to condition its responses to the spatial extent of injuries, launching a full scale regenerative response only when a sufficient threshold is reached. To gain insight into the mechanisms leading to hair renewal following follicle injury, the relationship between hair plucking density and regeneration were examined in the mouse. To standardize the experiments, we synchronized all the dorsal pelage HFs into refractory telogen before plucking (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Normal hair density in adult C57BL/6 mouse dorsal skin is ∼45–60 hairs/mm2, corresponding to a distance between each follicle of ∼0.15 mm (Figure S1E). In the first set of experiments, 200 evenly distributed refractory telogen hairs were plucked within a circular skin area (the “injury field”; Figures 1B and 1C , red circle). By plucking a constant number of hairs but altering the size of the injury field (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1), plucking densities from 2–50 hairs/mm2 were obtained (Figures 1 and S1; Extended Experimental Procedures). We then studied the regenerative behavior of the HFs.Figure 1Plucking-Induced Hair Regeneration Is a Population-Based Behavior that Depends on the Density and Distribution of Plucked-Hair Follicles within the Unplucked Follicle PopulationShow full caption(A and B) Plucking 200 hairs from a circular 2.4 mm in diameter area (100% plucking) leads to hair regeneration 12 days later.

A regenerative response is observed when 200 hairs are plucked at a density above a threshold (10 hairs/mm2), which corresponds to plucking 200 hairs from a 5-mm diameter circular surface area (red line). Three responses represented by different colors (gray, tan, green), are observed (please see text for explanation). The quorum sensing zone is highlighted in orange. See also Figures S1 and S2. We observe three types of responses (Figure 1F). First, if 200 hairs were plucked in a large area (>6 mm diameter, 28.3 mm2, plucking density <10 hairs/mm2) (Figures 1B and S1), no regeneration of plucked or unplucked follicles occurs even after 30 days (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1). This is because the plucking density is too low and does not generate accumulated signals above the threshold level (Figure 1F, zone of very low density plucking, gray area). Second, when 200 hairs are plucked from 3-, 4-, or 5-mm diameter circular areas (plucking density >10 hairs/mm2, the threshold density), we induce a simultaneous regeneration of the whole region (including the plucked and surrounding unplucked follicles) (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, by plucking only 200 hairs, the eventual regeneration of approximately 450, 780, or 1,300 hairs are obtained (with 200 hairs plucked in injury field sizes of 3, 4, and 5 mm in diameter, or 7.1, 12.6, and 19.6 mm2, respectively) (Figures 1C–1F, S1, and S2). As an example, we can induce regeneration of up to 600 unplucked hairs within a 5-mm plucked region (zone of quorum sensing-dependent hair regeneration, orange/light green area in Figure 1F) and 400 hairs outside of the plucked region, resulting from propagation. Third, when 200 hairs are plucked from a 2.4-mm diameter region (high density, 100% plucking), every follicle in the field is plucked (Figure 1A). In this case, all follicles re-entered anagen ∼12 days (12.3 ± 3.37, n = 13) after plucking, and the number of regenerating follicles equals the number of plucked follicles (zone of all follicles plucked, dark green). Plucking-dependent regeneration from refractory telogen requires the plucking of at least 50 follicles to reach the basal threshold (Plikus et al., 2008Plikus M.V. Mayer J.A. de la Cruz D. Baker R.E. Maini P.K. Maxson R. Chuong C.M. Cyclic dermal BMP signalling regulates stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Nature. 2008; 451: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This zone is equivalent to the frequently used wax stripping procedure (Müller-Röver et al., 2001Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. A comprehensive guide for the accurate classification of murine hair follicles in distinct hair cycle stages.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which melted wax was used to strip away all follicles in a large region, usually centimeters in diameter or bigger. This method involves thousands of HFs which will regenerate in synchrony without using quorum sensing. The density-dependence of regeneration, together with the simultaneous regeneration of both plucked and unplucked follicles within the injury field, suggests that plucked follicles produce a signal that (1) spreads to neighboring follicles, (2) accumulates to a level that depends upon the density and position of other plucked follicles, and (3) when present above some threshold level will trigger any follicle—plucked or unplucked—to re-enter anagen. The idea that HFs produce signals that affect other HFs can be inferred from the coordinated waves of hair cycling that travel across the skin of mice and rabbits (Plikus et al., 2008Plikus M.V. Mayer J.A. de la Cruz D. Baker R.E. Maini P.K. Maxson R. Chuong C.M. Cyclic dermal BMP signalling regulates stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Nature. 2008; 451: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, Plikus et al., 2011Plikus M.V. Baker R.E. Chen C.C. Fare C. de la Cruz D. Andl T. Maini P.K. Millar S.E. Widelitz R. Chuong C.M. Self-organizing and stochastic behaviors during the regeneration of hair stem cells.Science. 2011; 332: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Yet the signals that coordinate such “hair waves” cannot explain the collective regenerative responses seen here, at least not those within the injury field itself. This is because hair waves reflect the ability of follicles in anagen to accelerate the progression of neighboring telogen follicles into anagen, whereas plucking causes injured and uninjured follicles to progress from refractory telogen to regenerate collectively and simultaneously (i.e., regeneration is not driven by neighboring anagen follicles). Just outside the plucked injury fields (e.g., Figure 1C, outside of the red circle), however, the ring of delayed regeneration likely reflects the “hair wave” phenomenon, since follicles in this zone enter anagen only after regeneration in neighboring follicles is well underway. To avoid confusion between initial, collective regeneration and later hair wave spreading, the present study focuses exclusively on early regenerative events. One way to gain insight into the nature of the quorum signal—that we shall initially call the “distressor”—that coordinates collective regeneration is to characterize its decay length, i.e., the characteristic spatial scale over which the strength of the signal decays. Decay lengths quantify the balance between the rate at which a signal spreads and the rate at which it is destroyed or removed. Diffusible molecules that are captured by high-affinity, cell surface receptors (e.g., morphogens, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines) tend to have relatively short decay lengths, typically on the order of no more than 100 μm (Teleman and Cohen, 2000Teleman A.A.

Visualization of an endogenous retinoic acid gradient across embryonic development.Nature. 2013; 496: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), approximately the same scale as the inter-follicular distance in mouse skin. In contrast, as we show in the next section, the decay length of the putative distressor induced by plucking appears to be substantially larger—on the order of 1 mm, or four to six inter-follicular distances. Regardless of the physical nature of a signal (i.e., if it spreads from cell to cell via an undirected random walk), its spread can usually be modeled as a diffusion process, and it will display a decay length, λ, equal to the square root of the ratio between its diffusivity (an intrinsic measure of how fast it moves) and the rate constant that characterizes its removal or destruction in the tissue through which it spreads (Lander, 2007Lander A.D. Morpheus unbound: reimagining the morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 128: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (a physical interpretation of λ is the distance over which the steady-state signal from a point source falls by a factor of 1-1/e, or ∼63%). The results of modeling plucked hairs as an array of point sources of a diffusible distressor in a 2D medium (Figure 2A; see also Extended Experimental Procedures) tell us that the expected steady-state distressor concentration should be a function not only of plucking density, but also of injury field size, shape, and λ. For example, with a constant plucking density, concentrations of distressor should rise as a function of field size/λ, leveling off as that ratio gets large (Figure 2A). Assuming that regeneration is triggered when the distressor concentration around an HF exceeds a certain threshold, these results suggest that one could estimate the value of λ from a series of experiments in which plucking density and injury size/shape are both varied. For example, in Figure 2B, data on whether regeneration in circular injury fields occurred (green dots) or failed (red dots) was tabulated as a function of field radius and plucking density (plotted, in this case, as the inverse of the plucked fraction). Fitting the boundary between positive and negative data to the predictions of the steady-state diffusion model yields estimates of λ between 0.6 and 1.6 mm (Extended Experimental Procedures). The same model also predicts that, for sufficiently large plucked fields and/or sufficiently high plucking densities, immediate regenerative responses should not be limited to the precise boundaries of the injury field, but should extend a small distance beyond those boundaries (here we refer only to regeneration that occurs at the same time as that within the injury field and not what is triggered significantly later by hair wave propagation). Careful examination of experimental data showed that a small rim of early regeneration indeed occurred just outside of some injury fields. Fitting the sizes of these rims to the model (Figure 2C) yields an independent estimate for λ = 1 mm. Finally, the same diffusion model suggests that λ can also be estimated by holding both plucking density and injury field area constant, but varying the shape of the injury field. To test this prediction, experiments were carried out in which 50 hairs were plucked evenly at a density of every other hair, either in a straight line (Figure 2D), a narrow rectangle (6:1 aspect ratio; Figure 2E) or a square (Figure 2F). Under these distinct topological conditions, plucked single rows never regenerated, while squares always regenerated robustly. Rectangles occasionally exhibited modest regeneration, suggesting a distressor concentration very close to threshold under these circumstances. Fitting these three behaviors requires a value of λ between 0.7 and 1.2 mm. The good agreement among these three methods supports the validity of the steady-state diffusion model for describing distressor spreading and places the value of λ at ∼1 mm. Fitting to the model does not imply, however, that the distressor is a single substance, or even a diffusible molecule, but simply that it spreads according to the same rules. In fact, the observed magnitude of λ suggests that the distressor is not simply a diffusible receptor-binding molecule, since these typically display decay lengths of one tenth this magnitude or less (Teleman and Cohen, 2000Teleman A.A.

As described below, further investigation of the molecular nature of the distressor signal supports the idea that it consists of both diffusible molecules and recruited cells that migrate actively between follicles. Results from wax-stripping experiments indicate that HF keratinocytes undergo apoptosis ∼4 hr after injury (Ito et al., 2002Ito M. Kizawa K. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Label-retaining cells in the bulge region are directed to cell death after plucking, followed by healing from the surviving hair germ.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; see also Figure 3A). To identify molecules and mechanisms that might be involved in plucking-induced regeneration, we carried out microarray analysis of plucked fields at 12, 24, 48, and 96 hr after injury. Among the notable, time-dependent changes in gene expression, we observed:(1)Transient increase in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Immune, inflammatory and wound healing response genes constitute the major portion of early transcriptional activity following plucking. Analyzing the most altered genes by RT-PCR, we found that immune cytokines, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), and interleukin 1, beta (IL-1β) were upregulated soon after plucking (i.e., 12 hr), although expression of these genes peaked at different times (Figure 3B). For example, CCL2 expression peaked around 12 hr (Figure 3B).(2)Reduced refractory telogen inhibitor expression. During refractory telogen, the extra-follicular macro-environment expresses high levels of inhibitors, including Bmp2, Dickkopf (Dkk1), and soluble frizzled related protein (Sfrp4) that block anagen re-entry and hair wave propagation (Plikus et al., 2008Plikus M.V.

Expression of Sfrp4, a representative gene, decreased markedly at day 1 but rebounded by days 2 and 4 (Figure 3B).(3)Increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-α) expression. Tnf-α increases between 1–2 days after plucking and reached a plateau at ∼day 2 (Figures 3B and 3C). The plateau of Tnf-α expression corresponds to a time when activated hairs are in early anagen phase (Figure 3C). We also observe changes of other molecular pathways. For example, platelet derived growth factor A (Pdgf-α) increased at later stages after plucking (day 4), compatible with published results (Festa et al., 2011Festa E. Fretz J. Berry R. Schmidt B.

Our findings suggest that horizontal transmission of cancer cells is more widespread in nature than previously supposed. Cancers most often arise as a result of mutations accumulated in somatic cells during the lifetime of an organism and constitute a clonal expansion of a transformed cell with a genotype derived from the host. Tumors are generally not contagious or transmitted to other individuals, being subject to immune recognition and rejection based on polymorphic surface proteins, notably the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates. Some tumors are induced by infectious agents such as viruses, and though these agents can be contagious, each tumor still arises in the infected individual by transformation of somatic cells. Two cases are known in which a tumor cell itself naturally spreads among individuals as a contagious cell line. These are the canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) (Murgia et al., 2006Murgia C. Pritchard J.K. Kim S.Y. Fassati A. Weiss R.A. Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer.Cell. 2006; 126: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), transmitted by sexual contact, and the Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), transmitted between individuals by bites. In these two cases, the tumors exhibit a genotype that does not match that of their host. Instead, the tumor cells found in all of the affected animals are a single clone with a unique genotype that reflects that of its original, primordial host. Disseminated, or hemic, neoplasia is a leukemia-like cancer occurring in many marine bivalves, including clams, mussels, cockles, and oysters, and is characterized by amplification of cells in the hemolymph, the circulatory fluid of molluscs (Barber, 2004Barber B.J. Neoplastic diseases of commercially important marine bivalves.Aquat. Living Resour. 2004; 17: 449-466Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The disease affects soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) along the east coast of North America and was first documented in the species in the 1970s (Brown et al., 1978Brown R.S. Wolke R.E. Saila S.B.

Most bivalve disseminated neoplasias are aneuploid, with higher than normal DNA content, and the neoplastic cells of M. arenaria are roughly tetraploid based on flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, although there is variation between individuals (Reno et al., 1994Reno P.W.

Bull. 2009; 216: 23-39PubMed Google Scholar). The disease is ultimately fatal in the majority of affected clams and is contributing to depletion of the species in many areas along the east coast of North America (Barber, 2004Barber B.J.

The detection of reverse transcriptase activity in neoplastic cells (House et al., 1998House M.L. Kim C.H. Reno P.W. Soft shell clams Mya arenaria with disseminated neoplasia demonstrate reverse transcriptase activity.Dis. Aquat. Organ. 1998; 34: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility of retroelement involvement, and we used high-throughput sequencing of clam cDNA to identify a previously unknown LTR-retrotransposon in soft-shell clams, Steamer, whose expression was found to be strongly associated with disease (Arriagada et al., 2014Arriagada G. Metzger M.J. Muttray A.F. Sherry J. Reinisch C. Street C. Lipkin W.I. Goff S.P. Activation of transcription and retrotransposition of a novel retroelement, Steamer, in neoplastic hemocytes of the mollusk Mya arenaria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14175-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In normal clams, the genome contains 2–10 endogenous copies of the retrotransposon Steamer (normalized to a single copy gene), but in neoplastic hemocytes, the Steamer DNA copy number is massively amplified to 150–300 copies. The finding of several common Steamer integration sites in the neoplastic cells of multiple leukemic animals prompted further investigation of the genetics of this cancer. Here, we first extend the observation that neoplastic cells contain common Steamer integration sites that are not present in normal animals or in normal tissues of diseased animals. These results have two possible explanations: either Steamer retrotransposons exhibit unprecedented selectivity for specific integration sites in these multiple neoplasms, or these neoplasms did not arise independently but are descendants of a primordial leukemic cell carrying these common Steamer integrations, similar to the contagious cancers observed in dogs and Tasmanian devils. We therefore analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and polymorphic microsatellite repeat loci and found that the genotypes of the neoplastic cells do not match those of their hosts. Furthermore, all neoplastic genotypes are nearly identical to each other, strongly arguing that soft-shell clam leukemia across the Atlantic coast is horizontally transmitted as a contagious cancer cell derived from a single clonal origin. Neoplastic cells of leukemic animals have a high copy number of the Steamer retrotransposon, but this high copy number is not present in normal cells. Analysis of DNA from different tissues of diseased animals showed that Steamer copy number was low in solid tissues and highest in hemocytes though with increases in Steamer copy number in some solid tissues, probably due to dissemination of neoplastic hemocytes (Figure 2). Preliminary sequence analysis of a small number of Steamer integration sites showed that neoplastic DNA contains new integration sites not present in normal clam DNA, and surprisingly, these new copies were often found at identical locations in different leukemic animals (Arriagada et al., 2014Arriagada G. Metzger M.J. Muttray A.F. Sherry J. Reinisch C. Street C. Lipkin W.I. Goff S.P. Activation of transcription and retrotransposition of a novel retroelement, Steamer, in neoplastic hemocytes of the mollusk Mya arenaria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14175-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We now extended this analysis to leukemic animals from independent populations in New York, Maine, and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. Steamer integration sites were cloned from multiple leukemic animals by inverse PCR, and diagnostic primers were designed to amplify each specific integration site. PCR tests using these primers then allowed us to score for the presence of each insertion in neoplastic and tissue DNA (Figure 3A). Of 12 integration sites tested, 7 were present in neoplastic DNA samples collected from all geographic locations, 4 more were common to the Maine and New York neoplasms, but not those from Canada, and 1 site was unique to neoplasms from Canada (Figure 3B). These cancer-specific integration sites were not found in any healthy animals and were only weakly detected in tissue DNA from leukemic animals, likely due to infiltration of the neoplastic cells into normal tissue.Figure 3Clonal Steamer Integration Sites in Neoplastic CellsShow full caption(A) To determine the presence of specific integration sites in different animals, inverse PCR products were cloned and sequenced from clams from three locations (two integration sites per animal). For each integration site, a reverse primer was designed to match the flanking genomic sequence.

USA. 2014; 111: 14175-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar]). None of the 12 sites were present in any normal animal tested. The observation of common integration sites raises the possibility of a clonal origin for all of the tumors. To test the hypothesis that soft-shell clam leukemia is horizontally transmitted between animals as a clonal transmissible cancer cell, we examined DNA from leukemic and normal clams for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sequences of mitochondrial genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) (Folmer et al., 1994Folmer O. Black M. Hoeh W. Lutz R. Vrijenhoek R. DNA primers for amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I from diverse metazoan invertebrates.Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1994; 3: 294-299PubMed Google Scholar) and cytochrome b (CYTB) (Table 1, Figure S1). DNA of all healthy animals (n = 11) and the tissue DNA of all of the leukemic animals contained a common allele (C685) in the CYTB gene, while the neoplastic hemocyte DNA of all leukemic animals (n = 9) carried a distinctive SNP (C685T). This observation supports the hypothesis that the neoplastic cells are transferred between animals as an allograft that contains this unique SNP. Another SNP (G649A in COI) was identified in the hemocyte DNA of all four leukemic animals from PEI, but not in those from other locations and not in any of the 27 previously identified M. arenaria COI alleles (Strasser and Barber, 2009Strasser C.A. Barber P.H. Limited genetic variation and structure in softshell clams (Mya arenaria) across their native and introduced range.Conserv. Genet. 2009; 10: 803-814Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutation occurred during the evolution of the transmissible cells in this population. Additionally, seven low-frequency SNPs were identified in the mitochondrial DNA of normal animals and in the tissue of leukemic animals. In the four informative positions where rare SNPs were detected in tissue DNA of leukemic animals, the neoplastic hemocyte DNA did not contain that matching tissue allele but, rather, contained an allele common to all neoplastic cells (Table 1). These data indicate that the leukemias did not arise from their hosts and are consistent with clonal transmission of the cancer.Table 1Leukemia-Associated SNPs in M. arenaria COI and CYTBLocationClam IDDiagnosisCOICYTB649807450462567685G217SD269P150V154F189P229STHTHTHTHTHTHPEIPEI-Dfar484normal–G–T–T–T–C–CPEIPEI-Dfar490normal–G–T–T–T–C–CPEIPEI-Dnear430normal–G–T–T–T–C–CPEIPEI-Dnear432normal–G–T–T–T–C–CPEIPEI-Dnear440normal–G–T–T–T–C–CPEIPEI-Dnear446normal–G–T–T–T–C–CMaineMELC-A4normalGGTTTTTTCCCCMaineMELC-A9normalGGTTTTTTCCCCMaineMELC-C4normalGGTTTTCCCCCCNew YorkNYTC-2D2normalGGTTTTTTCCCCNew YorkNYTC-C6normalGGTTTTTTCCCCPEIPEI-Dfar488leukemic–A–T–T–T–C–TPEIPEI-DnearHL03leukemic–A–T–T–T–C–TPEIPEI-Dnear07leukemicGaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.ATTCaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.TTTCCCaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.TPEIPEI-Dnear08leukemicGaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.ATTTTTTCCCaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.TMaineMELC-A11leukemicGGCTTTTTCCCTMaineMELC-A10leukemicGGTTTTTTCCCTMaineMELC-C8leukemicGGTTTTTTCCCTMaineMEHL01leukemicGGTTTTTTTCCTNew YorkNYTC-C9leukemicGGTTTTCaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.TCCCaHemocyte allele can also be observed in tissue DNA; see sequencing traces in Figures S1A and S1B.TNucleotide numbers based on the complete COI and CYTB genes in M. arenaria mtDNA genome (KJ755996).

To characterize the genotype of the neoplastic cells in greater detail, we analyzed ten microsatellite loci in nuclear DNA, previously identified as polymorphic in M. arenaria (Krapal et al., 2012Krapal A.M.

Biol. 2013; 160: 1065-1081Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), by PCR. The sizes of these loci were highly polymorphic among individuals, and in many cases the animals were heterozygous at the loci, with PCR products of two sizes (Figure 4). In normal animals, the alleles present in hemocyte DNA always matched the alleles in the host tissue DNA. In contrast, in all leukemic animals, the microsatellite genotypes in the neoplastic hemocytes were distinct from those in the tissue of the host animal. Furthermore, at nearly every locus, the microsatellite alleles were of the same lengths in the neoplastic hemocytes of all leukemic animals. That is, the genotypes of all of the tumors were nearly identical to each other. Next, fluorescently labeled primers were used to distinguish microsatellite PCR product sizes with single-base resolution. While all normal animals have one allele (homozygous) or two alleles (heterozygous) for each locus, microsatellite size analysis of the leukemic DNA revealed up to four separate alleles at some of the loci. Many of the leukemic alleles were identical between independent neoplasms, but there were some small variations in repeat size and several cases of allele loss or gain in some leukemic individuals. The model-based clustering program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000Pritchard J.K. Stephens M. Donnelly P. Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data.Genetics. 2000; 155: 945-959PubMed Google Scholar) was used to analyze the microsatellite allele sizes, and regardless of the number of clusters (K) used, the neoplastic hemocyte genotypes clearly grouped separately from the normal animal genotypes, while the tissue of the leukemic animals clustered with normal animals (Figure 5A). A neighbor-joining tree based on the genetic distances between individuals (Bruvo et al., 2004Bruvo R. Michiels N.K. D’Souza T.G. Schulenburg H. A simple method for the calculation of microsatellite genotype distances irrespective of ploidy level.Mol. Ecol. 2004; 13: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Kamvar et al., 2014Kamvar Z.N. Tabima J.F. Grünwald N.J. Poppr: an R package for genetic analysis of populations with clonal, partially clonal, and/or sexual reproduction.PeerJ. 2014; 2: e281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that the neoplastic hemocyte genotypes cluster as a separate group, distinct from all of the normal genotypes and from the genotypes of the host tissue. Two branches were apparent within the neoplastic lineage, suggesting that the extant leukemias arose from a common ancestor that diverged into the PEI and USA cancer subgroups (Figure 5B). Three data sets (Steamer integration sites, mtDNA SNPs, and microsatellite alleles) show that the genotypes of the neoplastic cells all differ from the genotype of their host animals and are identical or very closely related to each other. We conclude that the individual leukemias are not derived by independent oncogenic transformation of cells within each host but instead come from a single genetically unrelated parent. The data strongly argue that disseminated neoplasia is naturally spreading between animals as a transmissible cancer cell. Horizontal clonal transmission of cancer has only been observed in two other contagious cancers of mammals in the wild, the DFTD in Tasmanian devils (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and CTVT in dogs (Murgia et al., 2006Murgia C. Pritchard J.K. Kim S.Y. Fassati A. Weiss R.A. Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer.Cell. 2006; 126: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that neoplastic cells from clam beds separated by hundreds of miles were found to be genetically nearly identical or very closely related. The mechanism by which the soft-shell leukemic cell line could be transferred from animal to animal in the wild is not clear. In the two previously known cases of natural cancer cell transfer (DFTD and CTVT) (Murchison, 2008Murchison E.P. Clonally transmissible cancers in dogs and Tasmanian devils.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S19-S30Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), physical contact is required for transmission of cancer cells to naive individuals (through biting or sexual contact, respectively), but adult clams are sessile and do not normally come in contact with one another. Clams do filter feed, however, raising the possibility that leukemia engraftment occurs through filtration of seawater contaminated with neoplastic cells. Each animal can filter several liters of seawater per hour, so very low concentrations of cells in seawater could be sufficient for transmission. One early study showed that hemocytes from a leukemic clam could survive in natural seawater conditions for >6 hr with minimal cell death, suggesting a plausible route for cancer cell transmission from one clam to another (Sunila and Farley, 1989Sunila I. Farley C.A. Environmental Limits for Survival of Sarcoma-Cells from the Soft-Shell Clam Mya-Arenaria.Dis. Aquat. Organ. 1989; 7: 111-115Crossref Google Scholar). Direct surveys of seawater at the affected clam beds for tumor cells could provide support for this idea. It is currently unknown how neoplastic cells would be released by leukemic animals. Cells may be shed naturally during disease, expelled during spawning, or released after physical trauma, during predation, or at death of the leukemic individual. The stage of development when transmission might occur in nature is unknown, though experimental transmission of disease was found to be most efficient with mature animals of intermediate size (Taraska and Anne Böttger, 2013Taraska N.G. Anne Böttger S. Selective initiation and transmission of disseminated neoplasia in the soft shell clam Mya arenaria dependent on natural disease prevalence and animal size.J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2013; 112: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is possible that its transmission has been facilitated or accelerated by human intervention, as seed stocks have been transplanted between sites along the coast at several times in recent decades (Beal and Kraus, 2002Beal B.F. Kraus M.G. Interactive effects of initial size, stocking density, and type of predator deterrent netting on survival and growth of cultured juveniles of the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria L., in eastern Maine.Aquaculture. 2002; 208: 81-111Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The length of time since the original formation of the primordial soft-shell neoplasia is not yet clear. The disease has been documented in soft-shell clams since the 1970s (Brown et al., 1978Brown R.S. Wolke R.E. Saila S.B. Brown C.W. Prevalence of neoplasia in 10 New England populations of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria).Ann. N Y Acad.

Neoplasia in soft-shell clams (My a arenaria) collected from oil-impacted sites.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1978; 298: 409-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it is likely that all cases derive from the same clone, suggesting that it may be at least 40 years old and possibly much older. Its appearance must have been sufficiently far in the past to allow for its spread widely along the North Atlantic coast. Significant divergence was observed in cancer cell subgroups specific to the USA and Canada clam populations. Several small microsatellite expansions and deletions and at least one mtDNA SNP appear to have developed separately in the PEI subgroup of cancer cells. Further analysis of the origin and continued evolution of these cancer cell lineages may allow for estimation of the time of appearance of the original leukemia. The two other examples of transmissible tumors are of very different ages: the dog tumor is thought to have arisen 10,000–13,000 years ago (Murchiso"
https://openalex.org/W2121188788,"In vitro modeling of human disease has recently become feasible with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. Here, we established patient-derived iPSCs from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) family and investigated the role of mutant p53 in the development of osteosarcoma (OS). LFS iPSC-derived osteoblasts (OBs) recapitulated OS features including defective osteoblastic differentiation as well as tumorigenic ability. Systematic analyses revealed that the expression of genes enriched in LFS-derived OBs strongly correlated with decreased time to tumor recurrence and poor patient survival. Furthermore, LFS OBs exhibited impaired upregulation of the imprinted gene H19 during osteogenesis. Restoration of H19 expression in LFS OBs facilitated osteoblastic differentiation and repressed tumorigenic potential. By integrating human imprinted gene network (IGN) into functional genomic analyses, we found that H19 mediates suppression of LFS-associated OS through the IGN component DECORIN (DCN). In summary, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying inherited human cancer syndromes with iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1980011876,"Sequencing microRNA, reduced representation sequencing, Hi-C technology and any method requiring the use of in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to the limitations of the Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e.g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent than the manufacturer’s, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long Template Protocol to increase accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2035592354,"NF-κB is a key transcriptional regulator involved in inflammation and cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. Several key steps in its activation are mediated by the ubiquitin (Ub) system. One uncharacterized step is limited proteasomal processing of the NF-κB1 precursor p105 to the p50 active subunit. Here, we identify KPC1 as the Ub ligase (E3) that binds to the ankyrin repeats domain of p105, ubiquitinates it, and mediates its processing both under basal conditions and following signaling. Overexpression of KPC1 inhibits tumor growth likely mediated via excessive generation of p50. Also, overabundance of p50 downregulates p65, suggesting that a p50-p50 homodimer may modulate transcription in place of the tumorigenic p50-p65. Transcript analysis reveals increased expression of genes associated with tumor-suppressive signals. Overall, KPC1 regulation of NF-κB1 processing appears to constitute an important balancing step among the stimulatory and inhibitory activities of the transcription factor in cell growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1998523743,"Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei are bacterial pathogens that cause melioidosis and glanders, whereas their close relative B. thailandensis is non-pathogenic. All use the trimeric autotransporter BimA to facilitate actin-based motility, host cell fusion, and dissemination. Here, we show that BimA orthologs mimic different host actin-polymerizing proteins. B. thailandensis BimA activates the host Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, B. pseudomallei and B. mallei BimA mimic host Ena/VASP actin polymerases in their ability to nucleate, elongate, and bundle filaments by associating with barbed ends, as well as in their use of WH2 motifs and oligomerization for activity. Mechanistic differences among BimA orthologs resulted in distinct actin filament organization and motility parameters, which affected the efficiency of cell fusion during infection. Our results identify bacterial Ena/VASP mimics and reveal that pathogens imitate the full spectrum of host actin-polymerizing pathways, suggesting that mimicry of different polymerization mechanisms influences key parameters of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2059062883,"Background Despite the marked increase of diverticulosis, its risk factors have not been adequately elucidated. We therefore aim to identify significantly associated factors with diverticulosis. We also aim to investigate the present state of diverticulosis in Japan. Methods We reviewed the medical records from 1990 to 2010 that included the data of consecutive 62,503 asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population in Japan. Most recent 3,327 examinees were analyzed with 16 background factors. Results Among the 62,503 subjects (47,325 men and 15,178 women; 52.1 ± 9.2 years old), diverticulosis was detected in 11,771 subjects (18.8%; 10,023 men and 1,748 women). The incidences of diverticulosis in 1990-2000 and 2001-2010 were respectively 13.0% (3,771 of 29,071) and 23.9% (8,000 of 33,432): the latter was much higher than the former in all age groups and for both genders. Considering the anatomical locations of colorectal diverticula, left-sided ones have markedly increased with age but not significantly changed with times. Univariate analyses of the 3,327 subjects showed significant association of diverticulosis with four basic factors (age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure), three life style-related factor (smoking, drinking, severe weight increase in adulthood), and two blood test values (triglyceride, HbA1c). The multiple logistic analysis calculating standardized coefficients (β) and odds ratio (OR) demonstrated that age (β = 0.217-0.674, OR = 1.24-1.96), male gender (β = 0.185, OR = 1.20), smoking (β = 0.142-0.200, OR = 1.15-1.22), severe weight increase in adulthood (β = 0.153, OR = 1.17), HbA1c (β = 0.136, OR = 1.15), drinking (β = 0.109, OR = 1.11), and serum triglyceride (β = 0.098, OR = 1.10) showed significantly positive association with diverticulosis whereas body mass index and blood pressure did not. Conclusions The large-scale data of asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population from 1990 to 2010 indicated that the prevalence of diverticulosis is still increasing in Japan. Age, male gender, smoking, severe weight increase in adulthood, serum HbA1c, drinking, and serum triglyceride showed significant positive association with diverticulosis."
https://openalex.org/W2042530286,"Fluorescence superresolution (SR) microscopy, or fluorescence nanoscopy, provides nanometer scale detail of cellular structures and allows for imaging of biological processes at the molecular level. Specific SR imaging methods, such as localization-based imaging, rely on stochastic transitions between on (fluorescent) and off (dark) states of fluorophores. Imaging multiple cellular structures using multi-color imaging is complicated and limited by the differing properties of various organic dyes including their fluorescent state duty cycle, photons per switching event, number of fluorescent cycles before irreversible photobleaching, and overall sensitivity to buffer conditions. In addition, multiple color imaging requires consideration of multiple optical paths or chromatic aberration that can lead to differential aberrations that are important at the nanometer scale. Here, we report a method for sequential labeling and imaging that allows for SR imaging of multiple targets using a single fluorophore with negligible cross-talk between images. Using brightfield image correlation to register and overlay multiple image acquisitions with ~10 nm overlay precision in the x-y imaging plane, we have exploited the optimal properties of AlexaFluor647 for dSTORM to image four distinct cellular proteins. We also visualize the changes in co-localization of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and clathrin upon EGF addition that are consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results are the first to demonstrate sequential SR (s-SR) imaging using direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), and this method for sequential imaging can be applied to any superresolution technique."
https://openalex.org/W2131045209,"Annona muricata has been used in folk medicine for the treatment of cancer and tumors. This study evaluated the chemopreventive properties of an ethyl acetate extract of A. muricata leaves (EEAML) on azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats. Moreover, the cytotoxic compound of EEAML (Annomuricin E) was isolated, and its apoptosis-inducing effect was investigated against HT-29 colon cancer cell line using a bioassay-guided approach. This experiment was performed on five groups of rats: negative control, cancer control, EEAML (250 mg/kg), EEAML (500 mg/kg) and positive control (5-fluorouracil). Methylene blue staining of colorectal specimens showed that application of EEAML at both doses significantly reduced the colonic ACF formation compared with the cancer control group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the down-regulation of PCNA and Bcl-2 proteins and the up-regulation of Bax protein after administration of EEAML compared with the cancer control group. In addition, an increase in the levels of enzymatic antioxidants and a decrease in the malondialdehyde level of the colon tissue homogenates were observed, suggesting the suppression of lipid peroxidation. Annomuricin E inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells with an IC50 value of 1.62 ± 0.24 μg/ml after 48 h. The cytotoxic effect of annomuricin E was further substantiated by G1 cell cycle arrest and early apoptosis induction in HT-29 cells. Annomuricin E triggered mitochondria-initiated events, including the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Prior to these events, annomuricin E activated caspase 3/7 and caspase 9. Upstream, annomuricin E induced a time-dependent upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 at the mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, these findings substantiate the usage of A. muricata leaves in ethnomedicine against cancer and highlight annomuricin E as one of the contributing compounds in the anticancer activity of A. muricata leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2068378646,"Background Previous studies have demonstrated that a number of HOX genes, a family of transcription factors with key roles in early development, are up-regulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers. The loci of several Homeobox (HOX) genes also contain microRNAs (miRs), including miR-196a. Methods Global miR expression and expression of all 39 HOX genes in normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs), oral pre-malignant (OPM) and HNSCC cells was assessed by expression microarray and qPCR and in tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qPCR of laser microdissected (LCM) tissues. Expression of miR196a and HOXB9 was reduced using anti-miR-196a and siRNA, respectively. Expression microarray profiles of anti-miR196a and pre-miR196a transfected cells were compared to parental cells in order to identify novel targets of miR-196a. Putative miR196a targets were validated by qPCR and were confirmed as binding to the 3’UTR of miR196a by a dual luciferase reporter assay combined with mutational analysis of the miR-196a binding site. Results miR-196a and HOXB9 are highly expressed in HNSCC compared to NOKs, a pattern also seen in HNSCC tissues by HOXB9 IHC and qPCR of miR-196a in LCM tissue. Knock-down of miR-196a expression decreased HNSCC cell migration, invasion and adhesion to fibronectin, but had no effect on proliferation. Furthermore, knock-down of HOXB9 expression decreased migration, invasion and proliferation but did not alter adhesion. We identified a novel primary mRNA transcript containing HOXB9 and miR196a-1 as predicted from in-silico analysis. Expression array analysis identified a number of miR196a targets, including MAMDC2 and HOXC8. We confirmed that MAMDC2 is a novel miR-196a target using a dual luciferase reporter assay with the effect abolished on mutation of the binding site. Conclusions These results show that miR-196a and HOXB9 are overexpressed, perhaps co-ordinately, as HNSCC develops and exert a pro-tumourigenic phenotype in HNSCC and OPM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017942098,"Action recognition has become a hot topic within computer vision. However, the action recognition community has focused mainly on relatively simple actions like clapping, walking, jogging, etc. The detection of specific events with direct practical use such as fights or in general aggressive behavior has been comparatively less studied. Such capability may be extremely useful in some video surveillance scenarios like prisons, psychiatric centers or even embedded in camera phones. As a consequence, there is growing interest in developing violence detection algorithms. Recent work considered the well-known Bag-of-Words framework for the specific problem of fight detection. Under this framework, spatio-temporal features are extracted from the video sequences and used for classification. Despite encouraging results in which high accuracy rates were achieved, the computational cost of extracting such features is prohibitive for practical applications. This work proposes a novel method to detect violence sequences. Features extracted from motion blobs are used to discriminate fight and non-fight sequences. Although the method is outperformed in accuracy by state of the art, it has a significantly faster computation time thus making it amenable for real-time applications."
https://openalex.org/W1993678762,"Betaine is reported to regulate hepatic cholesterol metabolism in mammals. Chicken eggs contain considerable amount of betaine, yet it remains unknown whether and how betaine in the egg affects hepatic cholesterol metabolism in chicks. In this study, eggs were injected with betaine at 2.5 mg/egg and the hepatic cholesterol metabolism was investigated in newly hatched chicks. Betaine did not affect body weight or liver weight, but significantly increased the serum concentration (P < 0.05) and the hepatic content (P < 0.01) of cholesterol. Accordingly, the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMGCR was up-regulated (P < 0.05 for both mRNA and protein), while CYP7A1 which converts cholesterol to bile acids was down-regulated (P < 0.05 for mRNA and P = 0.07 for protein). Moreover, hepatic protein content of the sterol-regulatory element binding protein 1 which regulates cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis, and the mRNA abundance of ATP binding cassette sub-family A member 1 (ABCA1) which mediates cholesterol counter transport were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in betaine-treated chicks. Meanwhile, hepatic protein contents of DNA methyltransferases 1 and adenosylhomocysteinase-like 1 were increased (P < 0.05), which was associated with global genomic DNA hypermethylation (P < 0.05) and diminished gene repression mark histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CpG methylation level on gene promoters was found to be increased (P < 0.05) for CYP7A1 yet decreased (P < 0.05) for ABCA1. These results indicate that in ovo betaine injection regulates hepatic cholesterol metabolism in chicks through epigenetic mechanisms including DNA and histone methylations."
https://openalex.org/W2023546934,"α-Actinins (ACTNs) are known to crosslink actin filaments at focal adhesions in migrating cells. Among the four isoforms of mammalian ACTNs, ACTN1 and ACTN4 are ubiquitously expressed. Recently, ACTN4 was reported to enhance cancer cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which ACTN4 drives these malignant phenotypes remains unclear. Here, we show that ACTN4, but not ACTN1, induces the formation of immature focal adhesions in DLD-1 cells, leading to the rapid turnover of focal adhesions. Interestingly, zyxin (ZYX) assembly to focal adhesions was markedly decreased in ACTN4-expressing DLD-1 cells, while the recruitment of paxillin (PAX) occurred normally. On the other hand, in ACTN1-expressing DLD-1 cells, PAX and ZYX were normally recruited to focal adhesions, suggesting that ACTN4 specifically impairs focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting the recruitment of ZYX to focal complexes. Using purified recombinant proteins, we found that ZYX binding to ACTN4 was defective under conditions where ZYX binding to ACTN1 was observed. Furthermore, Matrigel invasion of SW480 cells that express high endogenous levels of ACTN4 protein was inhibited by ectopic expression of ACTN1. Altogether, our results suggest that ZYX defective binding to ACTN4, which occupies focal adhesions instead of ACTN1, induces the formation of immature focal adhesions, resulting in the enhancement of cell motility and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2045183370,"Cilia formation and function require a special set of trafficking machinery termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), consisting mainly of protein complexes IFT-A, IFT-B, BBSome, and microtubule-dependent molecular motors. Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing (TTC) proteins are widely involved in protein complex formation. Nine of them are known to serve as components of the IFT or BBSome complexes. How many TTC proteins are cilia-related and how they function, however, remain unclear. Here we show that twenty TTC genes were upregulated by at least 2-fold during the differentiation of cultured mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) into multiciliated cells. Our systematic screen in zebrafish identified four novel TTC genes, ttc4, -9c, -36, and -39c, that are critical for cilia formation and motility. Accordingly, their zebrafish morphants displayed typical ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including curved body, abnormal otolith, hydrocephalus, and defective left-right patterning. The morphants of ttc4 and ttc25, a known cilia-related gene, additionally showed pronephric cyst formation. Immunoprecipitation indicated associations of TTC4, -9c, -25, -36, and -39c with components or entire complexes of IFT-A, IFT-B, or BBSome, implying their participations in IFT or IFT-related activities. Our results provide a global view for the relationship between TTC proteins and cilia."
https://openalex.org/W1967888158,"Background Peanut allergy is one of the most severe class I food allergies with increasing prevalence. Especially lipophilic allergens, such as oleosins, were found to be associated with severe symptoms, but are usually underrepresented in diagnostic extracts. Therefore, this study focused on isolation, molecular characterization and assessment of the allergenicity of peanut oleosins. Methods and Results A comprehensive method adapted for the isolation of peanut oil bodies of high purity was developed comprising a stepwise removal of seed storage proteins from oil bodies. Further separation of the oil body constituents, including the allergens Ara h 10, Ara h 11, the presumed allergen oleosin 3 and additional oleosin variants was achieved by a single run on a preparative electrophoresis cell. Protein identification realized by N-terminal sequencing, peptide mass fingerprinting and homology search revealed the presence of oleosins, steroleosins and a caleosin. Immunoblot analysis with sera of peanut-allergic individuals illustrated the IgE-binding capacity of peanut-derived oleosins. Conclusion Our method is a novel way to isolate all known immunologically distinct peanut oleosins simultaneously. Moreover, we were able to provide evidence for the allergenicity of oleosins and thus identified peanut oleosins as probable candidates for component-resolved allergy diagnosis."

The role of jasmonate (JA) in AM colonization has been investigated in the dicotyledons Medicago truncatula, tomato and Nicotiana attenuata and contradicting results have been obtained with respect to a neutral, promotive or inhibitory effect of JA on AM colonization. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether JA plays a role in AM colonization of monocotyledonous roots. Therefore we examined whether JA biosynthesis is required for AM colonization of the monocot rice. To this end we employed the rice mutant constitutive photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2), which is deficient in JA biosynthesis. Through a time course experiment the amount and morphology of fungal colonization did not differ between wild-type and cpm2 roots. Furthermore, no significant difference in the expression of AM marker genes was detected between wild type and cpm2. However, treatment of wild-type roots with 50 μM JA lead to a decrease of AM colonization and this was correlated with induction of the defense gene PR4. These results indicate that JA is not required for AM colonization of rice but high levels of JA in the roots suppress AM development likely through the induction of defense."

Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the relationship between the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and blood pressure (BP) in China. Methods A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted in China using a stratified random cluster sampling method. Sex-specific VAI quartile cut-off points were used as follows: 0.88, 1.41, 2.45 in males and 0.85, 1.33, 2.22 in females. Prehypertension and hypertension were each defined according to The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines. A multivariate logistic analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship among VAI, prehypertension and hypertension. Results The ORs for prehypertension and hypertension in the upper quartiles of the VAI were 1.514 (1.074-2.133), P=0.018 and 1.660 (1.084-2.542), P=0.020, in males, after adjusting for age, education, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, serum creatinine, fasting glucose, and plasma insulin. Following further adjustments for the above confounders, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, the ORs for prehypertension and hypertension in the upper quartile of the VAI were 1.660 1.533 (1.086-2.165), P=0.015, and 1.743 (1.133-2.680), P=0.011, in males. The ORs for prehypertension and hypertension in the upper quartile of the VAI were 1.691 (1.223-2.338), P=0.001, and 1.682 (1.162-2.435), P=0.006, in females, after adjusting for age, education, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, serum creatinine, fasting glucose, and plasma insulin. Following further adjustments for the above confounders, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, the ORs for prehypertension and hypertension in the upper quartile of the VAI were 1.688 (1.220-2.334), P=0.002, and 1.657 (1.141-2.406), P=0.008, in females. Conclusions A higher VAI was positively associated with both prehypertension and hypertension in both males and females.

https://openalex.org/W1969224687,"Background Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease with 5-year survival of less than 5%. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a principal first-line therapy, but treatment only extends survival modestly and is seldom curative. Drug resistance and disease recurrence is typical and there is a pressing need to overcome this. To investigate acquired 5-FU resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we established chemoresistant monoclonal cell lines from the Panc 03.27 cell line by long-term exposure to increasing doses of 5-FU. Results 5-FU-resistant cell lines exhibited increased expression of markers associated with multidrug resistance explaining their reduced sensitivity to 5-FU. In addition, 5-FU-resistant cell lines showed alterations typical for an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including upregulation of mesenchymal markers and increased invasiveness. Microarray analysis revealed the L1CAM pathway as one of the most upregulated pathways in the chemoresistant clones, and a significant upregulation of L1CAM was seen on the RNA and protein level. In pancreatic cancer, expression of L1CAM is associated with a chemoresistant and migratory phenotype. Using esiRNA targeting L1CAM, or by blocking the extracellular part of L1CAM with antibodies, we show that the increased invasiveness observed in the chemoresistant cells functionally depends on L1CAM. Using esiRNA targeting β-catenin and/or Slug, we demonstrate that in the chemoresistant cell lines, L1CAM expression depends on Slug rather than β-catenin. Conclusion Our findings establish Slug-induced L1CAM expression as a mediator of a chemoresistant and migratory phenotype in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells."

The development of an abbreviated, reliable and valid instrument for measuring inpatients’ experience would reflect the key aspect of inpatient care from patients’ perspective as well as facilitate quality improvement by cultivating patient engagement and allow the trends in patient satisfaction and experience to be measured regularly. The study developed a short-form inpatient instrument and tested its ability to capture a core set of inpatients’ experiences. The Hong Kong Inpatient Experience Questionnaire (HKIEQ) was established in 2010; it is an adaptation of the General Inpatient Questionnaire of the Care Quality Commission created by the Picker Institute in United Kingdom. This study used a consensus conference and a cross-sectional validation survey to create and validate a short-form of the Hong Kong Inpatient Experience Questionnaire (SF-HKIEQ). The short-form, the SF-HKIEQ, consisted of 18 items derived from the HKIEQ. The 18 items mainly covered relational aspects of care under four dimensions of the patient’s journey: hospital staff, patient care and treatment, information on leaving the hospital, and overall impression. The SF-HKIEQ had a high degree of face validity, construct validity and internal reliability. The validated SF-HKIEQ reflects the relevant core aspects of inpatients’ experience in a hospital setting.

https://openalex.org/W2043032007,"Bombyx mori cocoon has a multi-layer structure that provides optimal protection for silkworm pupa. Research on the mechanical properties of the multi-layer structure revealed structure-property relationships of the cocoon. Here, we investigated the protein components of the B. mori cocoon in terms of its multi-layer structure. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 286 proteins from the multiple cocoon layers. In addition to fibroins and sericins, we identified abundant protease inhibitors, seroins and proteins of unknown function. By comparing protein abundance across layers, we found that the outermost layer contained more sericin1 and protease inhibitors and the innermost layer had more seroin1. As many as 36 protease inhibitors were identified in cocoons, showing efficient inhibitory activities against a fungal protease. Thus, we propose that more abundant protease inhibitors in the outer cocoon layers may provide better protection for the cocoon. This study increases our understanding of the multi-layer mechanism of cocoons, and helps clarify the biological characteristics of cocoons.

We hypothesized that the interference of TLR4/NF-κB can ameliorate CUMS-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice.ApoE-/- mice were exposed to 12 weeks CUMS. Ad-siRNA TLR4 was given by tail vein injection (10 μl/mouse, every 5 days), and PDTC (an inhibitor of NF-κB) was given by intraperitoneal injection (60 mg/kg, once a day). Plasma corticosterone concentrations were determined by solid-phase 125I radioimmunoassay. Atherosclerosis lesions in aortic sinuses were evaluated and quantified by IMAGEPRO PLUS. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of TLR4, NF-κB, and IL-1β in aortas of the mice. Plasma lipid profiles, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 were measured by ELISA.Our results indicated that CUMS apoE-/- mice treatment with siRNA TLR4 significantly decreased atherosclerosis and down-regulated TLR4, NF-κB, and inflammatory cytokines. PDTC also remarkably reduced atherosclerosis and the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 in plasma. However, Treatment with siRNA TLR4 or PDTC had no effect on plasma corticosterone levels, and lipid profiles.TLR4/NF-κB pathway may participate in CUMS-induced atherosclerosis through activation of proinflammatory cytokines in apoE-/- mice. Our data may provide a new potential therapeutic target for prevention of CUMS -induced atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1980663822,"The timely identification and characterization of foodborne bacteria for risk assessment purposes is a key operation in outbreak investigations. Current methods require several days and/or provide low-resolution characterization. Here we describe a whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) approach (GeneSippr) enabling same-day identification of colony isolates recovered from investigative food samples. The identification of colonies of priority Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) (i.e., serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145 and O157) served as a proof of concept. Genomic DNA was isolated from single colonies and sequencing was conducted on the Illumina MiSeq instrument with raw data sampling from the instrument following 4.5 hrs of sequencing. Modeling experiments indicated that datasets comprised of 21-nt reads representing approximately 4-fold coverage of the genome were sufficient to avoid significant gaps in sequence data. A novel bioinformatic pipeline was used to identify the presence of specific marker genes based on mapping of the short reads to reference sequence libraries, along with the detection of dispersed conserved genomic markers as a quality control metric to assure the validity of the analysis. STEC virulence markers were correctly identified in all isolates tested, and single colonies were identified within 9 hrs. This method has the potential to produce high-resolution characterization of STEC isolates, and whole-genome sequence data generated following the GeneSippr analysis could be used for isolate identification in place of lengthy biochemical characterization and typing methodologies. Significant advantages of this procedure include ease of adaptation to the detection of any gene marker of interest, as well as to the identification of other foodborne pathogens for which genomic markers have been defined."

The mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of 11 new nymphalid species were reported and a comparative mitogenomic analysis was conducted together with other 22 available nymphalid mitogenomes. A phylogenetic analysis of the 33 species from all 13 currently recognized nymphalid subfamilies was done based on the mitogenomic data set with three Lycaenidae species as the outgroups. The mitogenome comparison showed that the eleven new mitogenomes were similar with those of other butterflies in gene content and order. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees reveal that the nymphalids are made up of five major clades (the nymphaline, heliconiine, satyrine, danaine and libytheine clades), with sister relationship between subfamilies Cyrestinae and Biblidinae, and most likely between subfamilies Morphinae and Satyrinae. This whole mitogenome-based phylogeny is generally congruent with those of former studies based on nuclear-gene and mitogenomic analyses, but differs considerably from the result of morphological cladistic analysis, such as the basal position of Libytheinae in morpho-phylogeny is not confirmed in molecular studies. However, we found that the mitogenomic phylogeny established herein is compatible with selected morphological characters (including developmental and adult morpho-characters)."
https://openalex.org/W2058684883,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling pathway that is activated when the workload of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is surpassed. IRE1 is a sensor involved in triggering the UPR and plays a key role in the unconventional splicing of an mRNA leading to the formation of a transcription factor that up-regulates the transcription of genes that play a role in restoring the homeostasis in the ER. In plants, bZIP60 is the substrate for IRE1; however, questions such as what is the dynamics of the splicing of bZIP60 and the fate of the proteins encoded by the spliced and unspliced forms of the mRNA, remain unanswered. In the present work, we analyzed the processing of bZIP60 by determining the levels of the spliced form mRNA in plants exposed to different conditions that trigger UPR. The results show that induction of ER stress increases the content of the spliced form of bZIP60 (bZIP60s) reaching a maximum, that depending on the stimuli, varied between 30 min or 2 hrs. In most cases, this was followed by a decrease in the content. In contrast to other eukaryotes, the splicing never occurred to full extent. The content of bZIP60s changed among different organs upon induction of the UPR suggesting that splicing is regulated differentially throughout the plant. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of a GFP-tagged version of bZIP60 when UPR was activated. A good correlation between splicing of bZIP60 and localization of the protein in the nucleus was observed. No fluorescence was observed under basal conditions, but interestingly, the fluorescence was recovered and found to co-localize with an ER marker upon treatment with an inhibitor of the proteasome. Our results indicate that the dynamics of bZIP60, both the mRNA and the protein, are highly dynamic processes which are tissue-specific and stimulus-dependent."

In this study, different fermentation states of A. cinnamomea (wild-type fruiting bodies and liquid cultured mycelium) were sequenced using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. A 45.58 Mb genome encoding 6,522 predicted genes was obtained. High quality reads were assembled into a total of 13,109 unigenes. Using a previously constructed pipeline to search for microRNAs (miRNAs), we then identified 4 predicted conserved miRNA and 63 novel predicted miRNA-like small RNA (milRNA) candidates. Target prediction revealed several interesting proteins involved in tri-terpenoid synthesis, mating type recognition, chemical or physical sensory protein and transporters predicted to be regulated by the miRNAs and milRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2052096541,"Cerebral blood flow autoregulation (CA) shifts to higher blood pressures in chronic hypertensive patients, which increases their risk for brain damage. Although cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells express the potent vasodilatatory peptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM) and their receptors (calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calclr), receptor-modifying proteins (RAMP) 1 and 2), their contribution to CA during chronic hypertension is poorly understood. Here we report that chronic (10 weeks) hypertensive (one-kidney-one-clip-method) mice overexpressing the Calclr in smooth muscle cells (CLR-tg), which increases the natural sensitivity of the brain vasculature to CGRP and AM show significantly better blood pressure drop-induced cerebrovascular reactivity than wt controls. Compared to sham mice, this was paralleled by increased cerebral CGRP-binding sites (receptor autoradiography), significantly in CLR-tg but not wt mice. AM-binding sites remained unchanged. Whereas hypertension did not alter RAMP-1 expression (droplet digital (dd) PCR) in either mouse line, RAMP-2 expression dropped significantly in both mouse lines by about 65%. Moreover, in wt only Calclr expression was reduced by about 70% parallel to an increase of smooth muscle actin (Acta2) expression. Thus, chronic hypertension induces a stoichiometric shift between CGRP and AM receptors in favor of the CGRP receptor. However, the parallel reduction of Calclr expression observed in wt mice but not CLR-tg mice appears to be a key mechanism in chronic hypertension impairing cerebrovascular reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1997652013,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold and cost billions of USD annually in medical visits and missed school and work. An assessment was made of the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of paeonol (PA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (PGG) from Paeonia lactiflora root toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in MRC5 cells using a tetrazolium method and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 μM) and HRV-4 (17.33 μM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin. The constituents had relatively high selective index values (3.3->8.5). The 100 μg/mL PA and 20 μg/mL PGG did not interact with the HRV-4 particles. These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1β), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV. Global efforts to reduce the level of synthetic drugs justify further studies on P. lactiflora root-derived materials as potential anti-HRV products or lead molecules for the prevention or treatment of HRV."
https://openalex.org/W2006447108,"Purpose Epigenetic modifications critically regulate the expression of immune-related genes in response to inflammatory stimuli. It has been extensively reported that a high concentrate (HC) diet can trigger systemic inflammation in dairy cows, yet it is unclear whether epigenetic regulation is involved in the expression of immune genes in the livers of dairy cows. This study aimed to investigate the impact of epigenetic modifications on the expression of immune-related genes. Experimental Design In eight mid-lactating cows, we installed a rumen cannula and catheters of the portal and hepatic veins. Cows were randomly assigned to either the treatment group fed a high concentrate (HC) diet (60% concentrate + 40% forage, n = 4) or a control group fed a low concentrate (LC) diet (40% concentrate + 60% forage, n = 4). Results After 10 weeks of feeding, the rumen pH was reduced, and levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the rumen, and portal and hepatic veins were notably increased in the HC group compared with the LC group. The expression levels of detected immune response-related genes, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins, were significantly up-regulated in the livers of cows fed a HC diet. Chromatin loosening at the promoter region of four candidate immune-related genes (TLR4, LPS-binding protein, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A3) was elicited, and was strongly correlated with enhanced expression of these genes in the HC group. Demethylation at the promoter region of all four candidate immune-related genes was accompanied by chromatin decompaction. Conclusion After HC diet feeding, LPS derived from the digestive tract translocated to the liver via the portal vein, enhancing hepatic immune gene expression. The up-regulation of these immune genes was mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, which involve chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that modulating epigenetic mechanisms could provide novel ways to treat systemic inflammatory responses elicited by the feeding of a HC diet."
https://openalex.org/W1969295305,"Radiation caries have been reported to be correlated with radiotherapy-induced destruction of salivary function and changes in oral microbiota. There have been no published reports detailing patients who have remained radiation caries-free following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between salivary function, oral microbiota and the absence of radiation caries. Twelve radiation caries-free patients and nine patients exhibiting radiation caries following irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma were selected. V40, the dose at which the volume of the contralateral parotid gland receives more than 40 Gy, was recorded. Stimulated saliva flow rate, pH values and buffering capacity were examined to assess salivary function. Stimulated saliva was used for molecular profiling by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. Mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli in saliva were also cultivated. There were no significant differences in V40 between radiation caries-free individuals and those with radiation caries. Compared with normal values, the radiation caries-free group had significantly decreased simulated saliva flow rate, while there were no significant differences in the saliva pH value and buffering capacity. Similar results were observed in the radiation caries group. There was no statistical difference in microbial diversity, composition and log CFU counts in cultivation from the radiation caries-free group and the radiation caries group. Eleven genera were detected in these two groups, among which Streptococcus spp. and Neisseria spp. had the highest distribution. Our results suggest that changes in salivary function and in salivary microbiota do not explain the absence of radiation caries in radiation caries-free individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2076074732,"The Class II histone deacetylase, HDAC6, has been shown to be involved in cell motility, aggresome formation and mitochondria transport. HDAC6 deacetylase activity regulates α-tubulin acetylation levels and thus plays a critical role in these processes. In turn, HDAC6 activity can be regulated by interaction with various proteins including multiple kinases. Kinase mediated phosphorylation of HDAC6 can lead to either increased or reduced activity. Our previous research has shown that sequestosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) interacts with HDAC6 and regulates its activity. As SQSTM1/p62 is a scaffolding protein known to interact directly with the zeta isoform of Protein Kinase C (PKCζ), we sought to examine if HDAC6 could be a substrate for PKCζ phosphorylation and if so, how its activity might be regulated. Our data demonstrate that HDAC6 is not only present in a protein complex with PKCζ but can also be phosphorylated by PKCζ. We also show that specific phosphorylation of HDAC6 by PKCζ increases HDAC6 deacetylase activity resulting in reduced acetylated tubulin levels. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which HDAC6, PKCζ and SQSTM1/p62 function together in protein aggregate clearance. These results also highlight a new research direction which may prove fruitful for understanding the underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2119720472,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a hyperproliferative malignant tumor that requires a high vascular density to maintain its large volume. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and acts as a paracrine and autocrine agent affecting both endothelial and tumor cells. The alpha-Ca2+/Calmodulin kinase two (α-CaMKII) protein is an important regulator of OS growth. Here, we investigate the role of α-CaMKII-induced VEGF in the growth and tumorigenicity of OS. We show that the pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of α-CaMKII results in decreases in VEGF gene expression (50%) and protein secretion (55%), while α- CaMKII overexpression increases VEGF gene expression (250%) and protein secretion (1,200%). We show that aggressive OS cells (143B) express high levels of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and respond to exogenous VEGF (100nm) by increasing intracellular calcium (30%). This response is ameliorated by the VEGFR inhibitor CBO-P11, suggesting that secreted VEGF results in autocrine stimulated α-CaMKII activation. Furthermore, we show that VEGF and α-CaMKII inhibition decreases the transactivation of the HIF-1α and AP-1 reporter constructs. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows significantly decreased binding of HIF-1α and AP-1 to their responsive elements in the VEGF promoter. These data suggest that α-CaMKII regulates VEGF transcription by controlling HIF-1α and AP-1 transcriptional activities. Finally, CBO-P11, KN-93 (CaMKII inhibitor) and combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden in vivo. Our results suggest that VEGF-induced OS tumor growth is controlled by CaMKII and dual therapy by CaMKII and VEGF inhibitors could be a promising therapy against this devastating adolescent disease."
https://openalex.org/W1986369116,"The Lundehund is an old dog breed with remarkable anatomical features including polydactyly in all four limbs and extraordinary flexibility of the spine. We genotyped 28 Lundehund using the canine Illumina high density beadchip to estimate the effective population size (Ne) and inbreeding coefficients as well as to identify potential regions of positive selection. The decay of linkage disequilibrium was slow with r2 = 0.95 in 50 kb distance. The last 7-200 generations ago, Ne was at 10-13. An increase of Ne was noted in the very recent generations with a peak value of 19 for Ne at generation 4. The FROH estimated for 50-, 65- and 358-SNP windows were 0.87, 087 and 0.81, respectively. The most likely estimates for FROH after removing identical-by-state segments due to linkage disequilibria were at 0.80-0.81. The extreme loss of heterozygosity has been accumulated through continued inbreeding over 200 generations within a probably closed population with a small effective population size. The mean inbreeding coefficient based on pedigree data for the last 11 generations (FPed = 0.10) was strongly biased downwards due to the unknown coancestry of the founders in this pedigree data. The long-range haplotype test identified regions with genes involved in processes of immunity, olfaction, woundhealing and neuronal development as potential targets of selection. The genes QSOX2, BMPR1B and PRRX2 as well as MYOM1 are candidates for selection on the Lundehund characteristics small body size, increased number of digits per paw and extraordinary mobility, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2049223396,"In this study, we showed that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) promoted erythroblast differentiation and increased the enucleation ratio of erythroblasts. Because ACTH was contained in hematopoietic medium as contamination, the ratio decreased by the addition of anti-ACTH antibody (Ab). Addition of neutralizing Abs (nAbs) for melanocortin receptors (MCRs) caused erythroblast accumulation at specific stages, i.e., the addition of anti-MC2R nAb led to erythroblast accumulation at the basophilic stage (baso-E), the addition of anti-MC1R nAb caused accumulation at the polychromatic stage (poly-E), and the addition of anti-MC5R nAb caused accumulation at the orthochromatic stage (ortho-E). During erythroblast differentiation, ERK, STAT5, and AKT were consecutively phosphorylated by erythropoietin (EPO). ERK, STAT5, and AKT phosphorylation was inhibited by blocking MC2R, MC1R, and MC5R, respectively. Finally, the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2, which is essential for the formation of contractile actomyosin rings, was inhibited by anti-MC5R nAb. Taken together, our study suggests that MC2R and MC1R signals are consecutively required for the regulation of EPO signal transduction in erythroblast differentiation, and that MC5R signal transduction is required to induce enucleation. Thus, melanocortin induces proliferation and differentiation at baso-E, and polarization and formation of an actomyosin contractile ring at ortho-E are required for enucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2119584324,"Ectopic calcification (EC), which is the pathological deposition of calcium and phosphate in extra-skeletal tissues, may be associated with hypercalcaemic and hyperphosphataemic disorders, or it may occur in the absence of metabolic abnormalities. In addition, EC may be inherited as part of several monogenic disorders and studies of these have provided valuable insights into the metabolic pathways regulating mineral metabolism. For example, studies of tumoural calcinosis, a disorder characterised by hyperphosphataemia and progressive EC, have revealed mutations of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), polypeptide N-acetyl galactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3) and klotho (KL), which are all part of a phosphate-regulating pathway. However, such studies in humans are limited by the lack of available large families with EC, and to facilitate such studies we assessed the progeny of mice treated with the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) for EC. This identified two mutants with autosomal recessive forms of EC, and reduced lifespan, designated Ecalc1 and Ecalc2. Genetic mapping localized the Ecalc1 and Ecalc2 loci to a 11.0 Mb region on chromosome 5 that contained the klotho gene (Kl), and DNA sequence analysis identified nonsense (Gln203Stop) and missense (Ile604Asn) Kl mutations in Ecalc1 and Ecalc2 mice, respectively. The Gln203Stop mutation, located in KL1 domain, was severely hypomorphic and led to a 17-fold reduction of renal Kl expression. The Ile604Asn mutation, located in KL2 domain, was predicted to impair klotho protein stability and in vitro expression studies in COS-7 cells revealed endoplasmic reticulum retention of the Ile604Asn mutant. Further phenotype studies undertaken in Ecalc1 (kl203X/203X) mice demonstrated elevations in plasma concentrations of phosphate, FGF23 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, two allelic variants of Kl that develop EC and represent mouse models for tumoural calcinosis have been established."
https://openalex.org/W2001040966,"The Dlg1 gene encodes a member of the MAGUK protein family involved in the polarization of epithelial cells. Null mutant mice for the Dlg1 gene (Dlg1-/- mice) exhibit respiratory failure and cyanosis, and die soon after birth. However, the cause of this neonatal lethality has not been determined. In the present study, we further examined Dlg1-/- mice and found severe defects in the cardiovascular system, including ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, and double outlet right ventricle, which would cause the neonatal lethality. These cardiovascular phenotypes resemble those of mutant mice lacking planar cell polarity (PCP) genes and support a recent notion that DLG1 is involved in the PCP pathway. We assessed the degree of involvement of DLG1 in the development of other organs, as the cochlea, intestine, and skeleton, in which PCP signaling has been suggested to play a role. In the organ of Corti, tissue elongation was inhibited accompanied by disorganized arrangement of the hair cell rows, while the orientation of the stereocilia bundle was normal. In the sternum, cleft sternum, abnormal calcification pattern of cartilage, and disorganization of chondrocytes were observed. Furthermore, shortening of the intestine, sternum, and long bones of the limbs was observed. These phenotypes of Dlg1-/- mice involving cellular disorganization and insufficient tissue elongation strongly suggest a defect in the convergent extension movements in these mice. Thus, our present results provide a possibility that DLG1 is particularly required for convergent extension among PCP signaling-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W1964545707,"Since temperament affects the development of social behaviours and interpersonal relations, the possible links between autistic traits and temperament are of particular interest. The purpose of the study was to explore the relationships between autistic traits and temperamental characteristics in the framework of the Regulative Temperament Theory by Strelau, and the Emotionality, Activity and Sociability theory by Buss and Plomin, with particular emphasis on gender differences. The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Formal Characteristics of Behaviour – Temperament Inventory and Temperament Survey for Adults were administered. The participants were 593 university students, including 364 females and 229 males. Results showed positive correlations between autistic traits and Emotional Reactivity, Perseveration, Distress, Fear and Anger, and negative correlations with Activity, Briskness, Endurance and Sociability. The results of multiple regression analyses involving the Autism Spectrum Quotient score as a dependent measure were different for females and males. Results of exploratory PCA analysis showed that AQ score, Sociability and Activity loaded one factor (with AQ loading being opposite to two others). High AQ scorers demonstrated higher Emotional Reactivity, Perseveration, Distress and Anger, and lower Briskness, Endurance, Activity and Sociability as compared to norms for the general population. In this study we showed that temperament measures were able to identify items that correlated in parts with autistic traits, while other items were obverse. The relationships between temperament and autistic traits differ slightly between genders. We assume that with regard to the broader autism phenotype, temperaments might be helpful in characterizing healthy control samples."

This study identified functionally relevant differentially expressed genes using the transcription factors and miRNA-co-regulated network analysis for gastric cancer. The TF-miRNA co-regulatory network was constructed based on data obtained from cDNA microarray and miRNA expression profiling of gastric cancer tissues. The network along with their co-regulated genes was analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED). We found eighteen (17 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes were part of the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and focal adhesion signaling pathways. In addition, qRT- PCR and Western blot data showed an increase in COL1A1 and decrease in NCAM1 mRNA and protein levels in gastric cancer tissues. Thus, these data provided the first evidence to illustrate that altered gene network was associated with gastric cancer invasion. Further study with a large sample size and more functional experiments is needed to confirm these data and contribute to diagnostic and treatment strategies for gastric cancer."

In 2012 nine pediatric cases of LAC occurred in eastern Tennessee, including one fatal case. In an attempt to identify sites near an active LACv infection and describe the abundance and distribution of potential LACv vectors near a fatal LAC case in the Appalachian region, we initiated an end of season study using a combination of questing and oviposition mosquito traps placed at forty-nine sites consisting of cemeteries and houses within 16 radial kilometers of two pediatric infections. LACv was isolated from three Aedes triseriatus pools collected from cemeteries and spatial clustering analysis identified clusters of Ae. triseriatus and Ae. albopictus populations that overlapped in the same area as the 2012 LACv cases. Results indicate cemeteries are effective sites for monitoring LACv. The role of cemeteries and specific environmental features will be the focus of future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2086412653,"Chorioamnionitis (inflammation of the fetal membranes) is strongly associated with preterm birth and in utero exposure to inflammation significantly impairs contractile function in the preterm lamb diaphragm. The fetal inflammatory response to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is orchestrated via interleukin 1 (IL-1). We aimed to determine if LPS induced contractile dysfunction in the preterm diaphragm is mediated via the IL-1 pathway. Pregnant ewes received IA injections of recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra) (Anakinra; 100 mg) or saline (Sal) 3 h prior to second IA injections of LPS (4 mg) or Sal at 119d gestational age (GA). Preterm lambs were killed after delivery at 121d GA (term = 150 d). Muscle fibres dissected from the right hemi-diaphragm were mounted in an in vitro muscle test system for assessment of contractile function. The left hemi-diaphragm was snap frozen for molecular and biochemical analyses. Maximum specific force in lambs exposed to IA LPS (Sal/LPS group) was 25% lower than in control lambs (Sal/Sal group; p=0.025). LPS-induced diaphragm weakness was associated with higher plasma IL-6 protein, diaphragm IL-1β mRNA and oxidised glutathione levels. Pre-treatment with rhIL-1ra (rhIL-1ra/LPS) ameliorated the LPS-induced diaphragm weakness and blocked systemic and local inflammatory responses, but did not prevent the rise in oxidised glutathione. These findings indicate that LPS induced diaphragm dysfunction is mediated via IL-1 and occurs independently of oxidative stress. Therefore, the IL-1 pathway represents a potential therapeutic target in the management of impaired diaphragm function in preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W1982558015,"This study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bacterioplankton community composition in the Gulf of Finland (easternmost sub-basin of the Baltic Sea) based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences acquired from community samples via pyrosequencing. Investigations of bacterioplankton in hydrographically complex systems provide good insight into the strategies by which microbes deal with spatiotemporal hydrographic gradients, as demonstrated by our research. Many ribotypes were closely affiliated with sequences isolated from environments with similar steep physiochemical gradients and/or seasonal changes, including seasonally anoxic estuaries. Hence, one of the main conclusions of this study is that marine ecosystems where oxygen and salinity gradients co-occur can be considered a habitat for a cosmopolitan metacommunity consisting of specialized groups occupying niches universal to such environments throughout the world. These niches revolve around functional capabilities to utilize different electron receptors and donors (including trace metal and single carbon compounds). On the other hand, temporal shifts in the bacterioplankton community composition at the surface layer were mainly connected to the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and the inflow of freshwater species. We also conclude that many relatively abundant populations are indigenous and well-established in the area."
https://openalex.org/W1983366693,"PknD is one of the eleven eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In vitro phosphorylation assays with the active recombinant PknD showed that the intracellular protein NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is a substrate of this kinase. MDH, an energy-supplying enzyme, catalyzes the interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate and plays crucial roles in several metabolic pathways including the citric acid cycle. The phosphorylation site was identified on threonine residues and the phosphorylation inhibited the MDH activity. In vitro, the recombinant MDH could also be phosphorylated by at least five other STPKs, PknA, PknE, PknH, PknJ, and PknG. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MDH was hyperphosphorylated in the bacteria at the beginning of the stationary and under oxygen-limited conditions by STPKs other than PknD. On the contrary, when PknD-deficient mutant mycobacteria were grown in a phosphate-depleted medium, MDH was not detectably phosphorylated. These results suggest that although the MDH is a substrate of several mycobacterial STPKs, the activity of these kinases can depend on the environment, as we identified PknD as a key element in the MDH phosphorylation assay under phosphate-poor conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2048074676,"Speculation exists whether dance provides physiological stimuli adequate to promote health and fitness benefits. Unfortunately, research to date has not addressed the affective and exertional responses to dance. These responses are of interest as positive affective and exertional responses experienced during physical activity may play an important role in predicting adherence. The present study aims to examine the psychophysiological responses of different Salsa dance styles. Ten pairs of dancers performed two different structured lessons of Salsa dance, including Typical Salsa and Rueda de Casino lessons, and a non-structured Salsa dance at a night club. Physiological responses (i.e., percent of heart rate reserve; %HRR) were continuously assessed and perceived exertion and affective valence were rated every 15 min throughout the trials. %HRR responses differed between the Salsa dance styles (%HRR from 41.3 to 51.9%), and participants were dancing at intensities near their ventilatory threshold. Specifically, Typical Salsa lesson elicited lower %HRR responses than Rueda de Casino lesson (p < 0.05), but similar %HRR responses to Salsa dance at a night club condition (p > 0.05). Surprisingly, exertional (from 8 to 11) and affective (from +3 to +5) responses were unaffected by Salsa dance styles (p > 0.05). These data support that different Salsa dance styles provide physiological stimuli adequate to promote health and fitness benefits, and perhaps more importantly, produce pleasurable experiences, which in turn might lead to an increase in adherence to Salsa dancing which likely provides exercise-like health benefits."
https://openalex.org/W1984528583,"The glycerophosphoinositols constitute a class of biologically active lipid-derived mediators whose intracellular levels are modulated during physiological and pathological cell processes. Comprehensive assessment of the role of these compounds expands beyond the cellular biology of lipids and includes rapid and unambiguous measurement in cells and tissues. Here we describe a sensitive and simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of the most abundant among these phosphoinositide derivatives in mammalian cells, the glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns). The method has been developed in mouse Raw 264.7 macrophages with limits of quantitation at 3 ng/ml. Validation on the same cell line showed excellent response in terms of linear dynamic range (from 3 to 3,000 ng/ml), intra-day and inter-day precision (coefficient of variation ≤ 7.10%) and accuracy (between 98.1 and 109.0%) in the range 10-320 ng/ml. As proof of concept, a simplified analytical platform based on this method and external calibration was also tested on four stimulated and unstimulated cell lines, including Raw 264.7 macrophages, Jurkat T-cells, A375MM melanoma cells and rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The results indicate a wide variation in GroPIns levels among different cell lines and stimulation conditions, although the measurements were always in line with the literature. No significant matrix effects were observed thus indicating that the here proposed method can be of general use for similar determinations in cells of different origin."
https://openalex.org/W2088594066,"Aim The present study aimed to analyse the autonomic nervous system activity using heart rate variability (HRV) to detect sleep disordered breathing (SDB) patients with and without excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) before sleep onset. Methods Two groups of 20 patients with different levels of daytime sleepiness -sleepy group, SG; alert group, AG- were selected consecutively from a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) research protocol. The first waking 3-min window of RR signal at the beginning of each nap test was considered for the analysis. HRV was measured with traditional linear measures and with time-frequency representations. Non-linear measures -correntropy, CORR; auto-mutual-information function, AMIF- were used to describe the regularity of the RR rhythm. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests. Results Non-linear dynamic of the RR rhythm was more regular in the SG than in the AG during the first wakefulness period of MSLT, but not during MWT. AMIF (in high-frequency and in Total band) and CORR (in Total band) yielded sensitivity > 70%, specificity >75% and an area under ROC curve > 0.80 in classifying SG and AG patients. Conclusion The regularity of the RR rhythm measured at the beginning of the MSLT could be used to detect SDB patients with and without EDS before the appearance of sleep onset."
https://openalex.org/W2071406325,"Converting single-stranded viral RNA into double stranded DNA for integration is an essential step in HIV-1 replication. Initial polymerization of minus-strand DNA is primed from a host derived tRNA, whereas subsequent plus-strand synthesis requires viral primers derived from the 3′ and central polypurine tracts (3′ and cPPTs). The 5′ and 3′ termini of these conserved RNA sequence elements are precisely cleaved by RT-associated RNase H to generate specific primers that are used to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis. In this study, siRNA wad used to produce a replicative HIV-1 variant contained G(-1)A and T(-16)A substitutions within/adjacent to the 3′PPT sequence. Introducing either or both mutations into the 3′PPT region or only the G(-1)A substitution in the cPPT region of NL4-3 produced infectious virus with decreased fitness relative to the wild-type virus. In contrast, introducing the T(-16)A or both mutations into the cPPT rendered the virus(es) incapable of replication, most likely due to the F185L integrase mutation produced by this nucleotide substitution. Finally, the effects of G(-1)A and T(-16)A mutations on cleavage of the 3′PPT were examined using an in vitro RNase H cleavage assay. Substrate containing both mutations was mis-cleaved to a greater extent than either wild-type substrate or substrate containing the T(-16)A mutation alone, which is consistent with the observed effects of the equivalent nucleotide substitutions on the replication fitness of NL4-3 virus. In conclusion, siRNA targeting of the HIV-1 3′PPT region can substantially suppress virus replication, and this selective pressure can be used to generate infectious virus containing mutations within or near the HIV-1 PPT. Moreover, in-depth analysis of the resistance mutations demonstrates that although virus containing a G(-1)A mutation within the 3′PPT is capable of replication, this nucleotide substitution shifts the 3′-terminal cleavage site in the 3′PPT by one nucleotide (nt) and significantly reduces viral fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2071671731,"Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (INS) is one of the leading causes of significant vision loss in children and affects about 1 in 1000 to 6000 births. In the present study, we are the first to investigate the structural pathways of patients and controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Specifically, three female INS patients from the same family were scanned, two sisters and a mother. Six regions of interest (ROIs) were created manually to analyze the number of tracks. Additionally, three ROI masks were analyzed using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics). The number of fiber tracks was reduced in INS subjects, compared to normal subjects, by 15.9%, 13.9%, 9.2%, 18.6%, 5.3%, and 2.5% for the pons, cerebellum (right and left), brainstem, cerebrum, and thalamus. Furthermore, TBSS results indicated that the fractional anisotropy (FA) values for the patients were lower in the superior ventral aspects of the pons of the brainstem than in those of the controls. We have identified some brain regions that may be actively involved in INS. These novel findings would be beneficial to the neuroimaging clinical and research community as they will give them new direction in further pursuing neurological studies related to oculomotor function and provide a rational approach to studying INS."
