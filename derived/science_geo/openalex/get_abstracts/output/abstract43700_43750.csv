https://openalex.org/W1593869902,"The antiviral antibiotic brefeldin A (BFA) strongly inhibits the protein secretion in cultured rat hepatocytes (Misumi, Y., Misumi, Y., Miki, K., Takatsuki, A., Tamura, G., and Ikehara, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11398-11403). We have further examined the inhibitory effect of the drug on intracellular transport of albumin by an immunocytochemical technique with peroxidase-conjugated Fab fragments of anti-rat albumin IgG. In hepatocytes treated with BFA (2.5 micrograms/ml) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, no characteristic structures of the Golgi complex could be observed, and albumin was diffusely distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclear envelope, and small vesicles around, in contrast to its condensed localization in the Golgi complex in the control cells. Such an unusual distribution of the secretory protein, however, was rearranged to the normal localization in the Golgi complex after 4 h even in the presence of the drug, possibly due to a metabolism of the drug to an inert form. Exposure of the cells to BFA with constant renewals (2.5 micrograms/ml at 1-h intervals) or at a higher concentration (10 micrograms/ml) caused a prolonged accumulation of albumin in the ER, resulting in its dilation. These results indicate that BFA primarily blocks the protein transport from the ER to the Golgi complex, consistent with the biochemical data previously reported."

https://openalex.org/W1979005514,"A rat kidney messenger RNA that induces a slowly activating, voltage-dependent potassium current on its expression in Xenopus oocytes was identified by combining molecular cloning with an electrophysiological assay. The cloned complementary DNA encodes a novel membrane protein that consists of 130 amino acids with a single putative transmembrane domain. This protein differs from the known ion channel proteins but is involved in the induction of selective permeation of potassium ions by membrane depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1556929642,"To study the functional differences between human ferritin H- and L-chains and the role of the protein shell in the formation and growth of the ferritin iron core, we have compared the kinetics of iron oxidation and uptake of ferritin purified from human liver (90% L) and of the H-chain homopolymer overproduced in Escherichia coli (100% H). As a control for iron autocatalytic activity, we analyzed the effect of Fe(III) on the iron uptake reaction. The results show that the H-chain homopolymer has faster rates of iron uptake and iron oxidation than liver ferritin in all the conditions analyzed and that the difference is reduced in the conditions in which iron autocatalysis in high: i.e. at pH 7 and in presence of iron core. We have also analyzed the properties of two engineered H-chains, one lacking the last 22 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus and the other missing the first 13 residues at the amino terminus. These mutant proteins assemble in ferritin-like proteins and maintain the ability to catalyze iron oxidation. The deletion at the carboxyl terminus, however, prevents the formation of a stable iron core. It is concluded that the ferritin H-chain has an iron oxidation site which is separated from the sites of iron transfer and hydrolysis and that either the integrity of the molecule or the presence of the amino acid sequences forming the hydrophobic channel is necessary for iron core formation."

https://openalex.org/W1988489403,"The sense of taste permits animals to discriminate between foods that are safe and those that are toxic. Because most poisonous plant alkaloids are intensely bitter, bitter taste warns animals of potentially hazardous foods. To investigate the mechanism of bitter taste transduction, a preparation of dissociated rat taste cells was developed that can be studied with techniques designed for single-cell measurements. Denatonium, a very bitter substance, caused a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration due to release from internal stores in a small subpopulation of taste cells. Thus, the transduction of bitter taste may occur via a receptor-second messenger mechanism leading to neurotransmitter release and may not involve depolarization-mediated calcium entry."
https://openalex.org/W1582424095,"La is an autoimmune RNA-binding protein of 47 kDa that plays a role in the transcription of RNA polymerase III. Both genomic and complementary DNAs were isolated that encompass the coding sequence of the human La molecule. The genomic clones encompass 11 exons and a putative G/C-rich promoter upstream of the mRNA start site. The cDNA sequence encodes a protein of 408 amino acids and can be divided into two structural domains based upon amino acid content and protease sensitivity. An unusually long stretch of 130 amino acids, much of which was predicted to form a stable alpha-helix, was found near the middle of the protein between the two domains. A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) consensus sequence was found just NH2-terminal to the long alpha-helix. The RNP consensus sequence is split into two exons by the fifth intron. Expression of three separate fragments of the La protein in Escherichia coli showed that a strongly autoimmune-reactive portion resides in the fragment containing the RNP consensus sequence and most of the long alpha-helical core. Autoantibodies from La patients also reacted with the terminal regions of the protein, but the extent of reactivity varied among patients. Differences in reactivity of autoantibodies to each portion of La protein may reflect an evolution of recognition of different epitopes during the development of the autoimmune response. These findings support an antigen-driven mechanism for autoimmune reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1672199487,"Transcription of the uncoupling protein (UCP) gene in rat brown adipose tissue has been evaluated by a nuclear run-on transcription assay. Nuclei from euthyroid rats treated with norepinephrine (NE) exhibited a 3-4-fold increase in transcription 2 h after the injection, whereas the UCP mRNA abundance increased 2-3-fold during the same interval. In contrast, neither UCP mRNA nor the transcription rate increased in response to the same treatment in hypothyroid rats, but the transcriptional response was recovered 2 h after the injection of a receptor saturating dose of 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T3). When injected to rats given T3 4 h before, NE increased UCP gene transcription and mRNA abundance by 4-5 and 3-4-fold, respectively, by 2 h. Neither cycloheximide nor emetine prevented this effect of T3. In euthyroid rats, the UCP gene transcription rate increased within 15 min of exposure to 4 degrees C. In contrast, in hypothyroid rats exposed to 4 degrees C overnight the transcription rate remained unchanged, but it started to increase steeply 2 h after the intravenous injection of a receptor saturating dose of T3 with UCP mRNA lagging approximately 1 h behind. Unilateral denervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue in hypothyroid rats caused a 60-70% ipsilateral reduction in transcription rate and UCP mRNA. When T3 was given to these rats, it only stimulated UCP gene transcription and UCP mRNA accumulation in the intact side, but there was a symmetrical stimulation when NE was injected following the T3. We conclude that the UCP gene is under dual control by T3 and NE. The primary signal seems to be generated by NE. This signal increases UCP mRNA by stimulating the transcription rate of the UCP gene. From the denervation experiments and the lack of response of UCP to NE in hypothyroid rats, we estimate that T3 amplifies 4-5-fold the transcriptional response to NE. No stabilization of UCP mRNA needs to be invoked to explain the acute effect of T3. The T3-dependent signal amplifying the NE effect is consistent with being the T3-receptor complex or another T3-derived signal that is neither a newly synthesized protein nor a rapidly turned-over pre-existing protein, activated by T3."
https://openalex.org/W1544995067,"Activity of the bone/liver/kidney isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (AP) is known to be critical for mineralization in developing bone, although its role is unclear. The work now reported explores changes in the activity of this Zn2+-containing enzyme that occur during Ca2+ accumulation by matrix vesicles (MV). A marked loss (up to 65-70%) in AP activity was found to accompany Ca2+ accumulation by MV. These two events were highly correlated, both temporally and quantitatively. Investigation into possible causes revealed that the decline in AP activity during Ca2+ uptake was not due to action of proteases but rather resulted from interaction with the developing mineral phase, loss of metal ions (Zn2+ and Mg2+) from the active site of the enzyme, and concomitant irreversible denaturation of the enzyme. Protease inhibitors did not protect AP from loss of activity during mineralization; in contrast, protease treatments, which progressively destroyed the ability of MV to accumulate Ca2+ actually reduced loss of AP activity. These findings clearly demonstrate that AP is present at the site of MV mineralization and that its catalytic activity is profoundly reduced by the mineralization process."
https://openalex.org/W1526170069,"The role of the active site hydrogen bond of cytochrome P-450cam has been studied utilizing a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and substrate analogues with altered hydrogen bonding capabilities. Cytochrome P-450cam normally catalyzes the regiospecific hydroxylation of the monoterpene camphor. The x-ray crystal structure of this soluble bacterial cytochrome P-450 (Poulos, T. L., Finzel, B. C., Gunsalus, I. C., Wagner, G. C., and Kraut, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16122-16128) indicates a specific hydrogen bond between tyrosine 96 and the carbonyl moiety of the camphor substrate. The site-directed mutant in which tyrosine 96 has been changed to a phenylalanine and the substrate analogues thiocamphor and camphane have been used to probe this interaction in several aspects of catalysis. At room temperature, both the mutant enzyme with camphor and the wild type enzyme with thiocamphor bound result in 59 and 65% high-spin ferric enzyme as compared to the 95% high spin population obtained with native enzyme and camphor as substrate. The equilibrium dissociation constant is moderately increased, from 1.6 microM for the wild type protein to 3.0 and 3.3 microM for wild type-thiocamphor and mutant-camphor complexes, respectively. Camphane bound to cytochrome P-450cam exhibits a larger decrease in high spin fraction (45%) and a correspondingly larger KD (46 microM), suggesting that the carbonyl moiety of camphor plays an important steric role in addition to its interaction as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The absolute regioselectivity of the mutant enzyme, and of the wild type enzyme with thiocamphor, is lost resulting in production of several hydroxylated products in addition to the 5-exo-hydroxy isomer. Based on rates of NADH oxidation, comparison of the substrate specificity for these systems (kcat/KD) indicates a 5- and 7-fold decrease in specificity for the mutant enzyme and thiocamphor-wild type complex, respectively. The replacement of the cytochrome P-450cam active site tyrosine with phenylalanine does not affect the branching ratio of monooxygenase versus oxidase chemistry or peroxygenase activity (Atkins, W.M., and Sligar, S.G. (1987) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109, 3754-3760)."
https://openalex.org/W1573150919,"We have investigated the esterification by liver membranes of retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). When CRBP carrying [3H]retinol as its ligand was purified from rat liver cytosol and incubated with rat liver microsomes, a significant fraction of the [3H]retinol was converted to [3H]retinyl ester. Esterification of the CRBP-bound [3H]retinol, which was maximal at pH 6-7, did not require the addition of an exogenous fatty acyl group. Indeed, when additional palmitoyl-CoA or coenzyme A was provided, the rate of esterification increased either very slightly or not at all. The esterification reaction had a Km for [3H]retinol-CRBP of 4 +/- 0.6 microM and a maximum velocity of 145 +/- 52 pmol/min/mg of microsomal protein (n = 4). The major products were retinyl palmitate/oleate and retinyl stearate in a ratio of approximately 2 to 1 over a range of [3H]retinol-CRBP concentrations from 1 to 8 microM. The addition of progesterone, a known inhibitor of the acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase reaction, consistently increased the rate of retinyl ester formation when [3H]retinol was delivered bound to CRBP. These experiments indicate that retinol presented to liver microsomal membranes by CRBP can be converted to retinyl ester and that this process, in contrast to the esterification of dispersed retinol, is independent of the addition of an activated fatty acid and produces a pattern of retinyl ester species similar to that observed in intact liver. A possible role of phospholipids as endogenous acyl donors in the esterification of retinol bound to CRBP is supported by our observations that depletion of microsomal phospholipid with phospholipase A2 prior to addition of retinol-CRBP decreased the retinol-esterifying activity almost 50%. Conversely, incubating microsomes with a lipid-generating system containing choline, CDP-choline, glycerol 3-phosphate, and an acyl-CoA-generating system prior to addition of retinol-CRBP increased retinol esterification significantly as compared to buffer-treated controls."
https://openalex.org/W1998606811,"Low molecular weight material associated with affinity-purified class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of mouse (Ia) had the expected properties of peptides bound to the antigen binding site of Ia. Thus, the low molecular weight material derived from the I-Ad isotype was efficient in inhibiting the binding of 125I-labeled I-Ad-specific peptide to I-Ad, but did not significantly inhibit the binding of an I-Ed-specific peptide to I-Ed; the reciprocal isotype-specific inhibition was demonstrated with low molecular weight material derived from I-Ed. The inhibitory material was predominantly peptide in nature, as shown by its susceptibility to protease digestion. It was heterogeneous as measured by gel filtration (mean molecular weight approximately 3000), and when characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography, it eluted over a wide concentration of solvent. Such self peptide-MHC complexes may have broad significance in the biology of T cell responses, including generation of the T cell repertoire, the specificity of mixed lymphocyte responses, and the immune surveillance of self and nonself antigens in peripheral lymphoid tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1482127541,"The complete amino acid sequence of the triple-helical domain of human collagen VI was deduced from sequences of appropriate cDNA clones and confirmed to about 50% by Edman degradation of tryptic peptides. This domain consists of three different peptide segments containing some 335-336 amino acid residues originating from central portions of the alpha 1 (VI), alpha 2(VI), and alpha 3(VI) chains, respectively. Sequence identity in the X/Y positions of the Gly-X-Y repeats is rather low (10-15%) between the chains. Peculiar features of these sequences include 3 cysteine residues about 50 (alpha 3(VI)) and 89 (alpha 1(VI), alpha 2(VI)) residues away from the N-terminus and several Gly-X-Y interruptions clustered in the C-terminal two-thirds of the triple helix. These structures are presumably required for cross-linking collagen VI oligomers and for super-coiling of triple helices in the dimers. Other features include 11 Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, some of which are likely to be used as cell-binding sites, and four Asn-X-Thr sequences, allowing N-linked glycosylation along the triple helix. Junctional areas close to the helix contain short, cysteine-rich segments which may seal the triple-helical domain through disulfide bond formation, endowing it with high stability. These features, together with a low sequence homology to fiber-forming and basement-membrane collagens, document the unique character of collagen VI, whose triple helix is specifically adjusted for forming microfibrils in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1985640318,Rinderpest is a highly contagious ruminant viral disease manifested by a rapid course and greater than 90% mortality. Infectious vaccinia virus recombinants were constructed that express either the hemagglutinin or the fusion gene of rinderpest virus. All cattle vaccinated with either recombinant or with the combined recombinants produced neutralizing antibodies against rinderpest virus and were protected against the disease when challenged with more than 1000 times the lethal dose of the virus.
https://openalex.org/W1489312357,"We have investigated the physiochemical characteristics of trypsin-treated, molybdate-stabilized glucocorticoid-receptor complexes from rat liver in the presence of 10 mM sodium molybdate by high performance ion-exchange chromatography, high performance size-exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation analysis. Trypsin treatment was performed under conditions previously reported to degrade the monomeric Mr approximately 94,000 steroid-binding protein to an Mr approximately 27,000 ligand-binding entity (Wrange, O., and Gustafsson, J.-A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 856-865). Also in the presence of molybdate, an Mr approximately 27,000 steroid-binding fragment was obtained by limited trypsinization. However, no major differences in the tested physicochemical parameters were seen when trypsin-treated glucocorticoid-receptor complexes were compared with crude cytosolic complexes. Furthermore, the Mr approximately 27,000 steroid-binding fragment generated in the presence of molybdate could be immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific for the glucocorticoid receptor-associated Mr approximately 90,000 heat shock protein. These results provide direct evidence for an interaction of the Mr approximately 90,000 heat shock protein with the steroid-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor, known to correspond to the C-terminal third of the receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2122835190,"The anthraquinones, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin and rubidazone are shown to be potent stimulators of Ca2+ release from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles and to trigger transient contractions in chemically skinned psoas muscle fibers. These effects of anthraquinones are the direct consequence of their specific interaction with the [3H] ryanodine receptor complex, which constitutes the Ca2+ release channel from the triadic junction. In the presence of adenine nucleotides and physiological Mg2+ concentrations (approximately 1.0 mM), channel activation by doxorubicin and daunorubicin exhibits a sharp dependence on submicromolar Ca2+ which is accompanied by a selective, dose-dependent increase in the apparent affinity of the ryanodine binding sites for Ca2+, in a manner similar to that previously reported with caffeine. Unlike caffeine, however, anthraquinones increase [3H]ryanodine receptor occupancy to the level observed in the presence of adenine nucleotides. A strong interaction between the anthraquinone and the caffeine binding sites on the Ca2+ release channel is also observed when monitoring Ca2+ fluxes across the SR. Millimolar caffeine both inhibits anthraquinone-stimulated Ca2+ release, and reduces anthraquinone-stimulated [3H]ryanodine receptor occupancy, without changing the effective binding constant of the anthraquinone for its binding site. The degree of cooperativity for daunorubicin activation of Ca2+ release from SR also increases in the presence of caffeine. These results demonstrate that the mechanism by which anthraquinones stimulate Ca2+ release is caused by a direct interaction with the [3H]ryanodine receptor complex, and by sensitization of the Ca2+ activator site for Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1599525955,"Cytochrome P-450LA omega purified from clofibrate-induced rat liver oxidizes lauric acid to 11- and 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid in approximately a 1:17 ratio at a rate of 20 nmol/nmol P-450/min. In contrast, cytochrome P-450b oxidizes lauric acid much more slowly (0.5 nmol/nmol P-450/min) to an 8:1 mixture of the same metabolites. Western blot analysis indicates that P-450LA omega accounts for 1-2 and 16-30%, respectively, of the total cytochrome P-450 in uninduced and clofibrate-induced rat liver. Cytochrome b5 increases the efficiency of omega-hydroxylation but not the rate of catalytic turnover. Incubation of the enzyme with 10-undecynoic acid (10-UDYA) results in loss of approximately 45% of the enzymatic activity but none of the enzyme chromophore. Approximately 1 mol of 1,11-undecandioic acid is produced per mole of inactivated enzyme. This extraordinary inactivation efficiency is confirmed by NADPH consumption studies. Approximately 0.5 equivalents of label are covalently bound to the enzyme when it is incubated with 14C-labeled 10-UDYA. 11-Dodecenoic acid appears not to be a substrate for cytochrome P-450LA omega but is oxidized, presumably by a contaminating isozyme, to a 10:1 mixture of 11,12-epoxydodecanoic acid and 12-oxododecanoic acid. The results suggest the presence of two closely related P-450LA omega enzymes, only one of which is susceptible to inactivation by 10-UDYA. They also indicate that cytochrome P-450LA omega has a highly structured active site that sterically suppresses omega-1-hydroxylation in order to deliver the oxygen to the thermodynamically disfavored terminal carbon. Protein rather than heme alkylation follows from this reaction regiospecificity."
https://openalex.org/W2003184755,"A general chemical strategy has been developed whereby antibody combining sites can be selectively derivatized with natural or synthetic molecules, such as catalytic groups, drugs, metals, or reporter molecules. Cleavable affinity labels were used to selectively introduce a thiol into the combining site of the immunoglobulin A MOPC 315. This thiol acted both as a nucleophile to accelerate ester thiolysis 60,000-fold and as a handle for selectively derivatizing the antibody with additional functional groups. For example, derivatization of the antibody with a fluorophore made possible a direct spectroscopic assay of antibody-ligand complexation. This chemistry should not only extend our ability to exploit antibody specificity in chemical catalysis, diagnostics, and therapeutics, but may also prove generally applicable to the functional modification of other proteins for which detailed structural information is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W1909771459,"A collagen was isolated from Drosophila E85, Schneider line 2L and Kc cell cultures. The purified protein was characterized and antibodies were raised against it. Immunofluorescence microscopy locates this material to the regions of basement membranes of Drosophila embryos, larvae, and adults. The molecules are mostly, or entirely, homotrimers of one polypeptide chain linked by interchain disulfide bonds. The partial amino acid sequences of a cyanogen bromide cleavage product of this chain are identical with a part of the virtual translation product of the Drosophila pro alpha 1(IV) nucleotide sequence that is reported in the accompanying paper. This gene is at Drosophila chromosome location 25C and was identified by the high homology of one part of it with the noncollagenous carboxyl terminus (NC1) of vertebrate type IV basement membrane collagens (Blumberg, B., MacKrell, A. J., Olson, P. F., Kurkinen, M., Monson, J. M., Natzle, J. E., and Fessler, J. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5947-5950). In the electron microscope each molecule appears as a thread with a knob at one end, which contains the carboxyl peptide domains. The variation of flexibility of the thread was mapped along its length. Pulse-chase labeling of cell cultures showed that these molecules associate into disulfide-linked dimers and higher oligomers that can be partly separated by velocity sedimentation and are resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis. Dimers and higher oligomers formed by overlap of the amino ends of molecules were found. Mild pepsin digestion of Drosophila embryos and larvae solubilized the corresponding disulfide-linked collagen molecules, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease peptide maps showed the identity of the collagen derived from animals and from cell cultures. Individual, native molecules have a sedimentation coefficient s20,w = 4.1 S, the dichroic spectrum and amino acid composition of a collagen, and a Tm = 31 degrees C. Positive in situ hybridization with a specific probe for this collagen began 6-8 h after egg laying and showed message in the locations of embryos and larvae which reacted with the antibodies. This included some prominent individual cells in the hemolymph."
https://openalex.org/W1537538267,"In vitro reaction of phycocyanobilin (PCB) with apophycocyanin results in the specific addition of the bilin to two of the cysteinyl residues, alpha-Cys-84 and beta-Cys-82, which normally function in PCB attachment (Arciero, D. M., Bryant, D. A., and Glazer, A. N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18343-18349). These bilin binding sites are designated alpha-1 and beta-1, respectively. Tryptic digestion of the apophycocyanin-PCB adduct releases two major bilin peptides, alpha-1 mesobiliverdin (MBV) and beta-1 MBV, which encompass the two bilin-binding sites. These peptides were examined by 1H NMR and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopies. The NMR spectra show that the bilin is attached to each peptide through a thioether linkage identical to the linkage observed in the corresponding tryptic peptides, alpha-1 PCB and beta-1 PCB, derived from the natural product, C-phycocyanin. However, the NMR spectra of the adduct peptides lack the resonances corresponding to protons at positions C2 and C3 of ring A seen in the spectra of the alpha-1 PCB and beta-1 PCB peptides. Fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy shows the masses of the alpha-1 MBV and beta-1 MBV peptides to be 2 atomic mass units lower than those of the alpha-1 PCB and beta-1 PCB peptides, respectively. Comparison of the bilin portion of the NMR spectra of the alpha-1 MBV and beta-1 MBV peptides to the NMR spectra of PCB and mesobiliverdin confirms that the bilin of the two adduct peptides resembles mesobiliverdin in having an extra double bond in the C2-C3 position of ring A. These results show that the major bilin products arising from the reaction of PCB with apophycocyanin differ from the bilins present in C-phycocyanin. The relevance of these results to the biosynthetic pathway for the attachment of tetrapyrroles to phycobiliproteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1543087934,"Abstract cDNAs containing the complete coding sequences of four isoforms of troponin T derived from 1-week-old chick skeletal muscle have been isolated and sequenced. While the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and most of the coding sequence were identical for each, dramatic differences were observed in the NH2-terminal region corresponding to amino acid residues 10-37 of rabbit skeletal troponin T. These sequence differences correspond to the alternatively spliced but not mutually exclusive exons 4 to 8 of the rat skeletal muscle troponin T gene. In addition, we observe a sequence corresponding to an extra exon or exons (between 5 and 6) present in the chicken skeletal muscle gene and not previously detected in the rat skeletal or chicken cardiac genes. This sequence of 63 nucleotides consists of an almost perfect repeat of 30 and 33 nucleotides and has previously been shown to be represented as a protein variant in chicken skeletal muscle. A difference is also present in one cDNA clone corresponding to the alternatively spliced (mutually exclusive) exons 16 and 17 of the rat gene. In the protein, this corresponds to a region implicated in the interaction of troponin T with troponin C, tropomyosin, and perhaps troponin I and F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1498239088,"One of the responses to the administration of thyroid hormone is an increase in malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) mRNA in rat liver. We have previously shown that 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) causes a 3-4-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the malic enzyme gene as determined by in vitro run-off assays with the cDNA probe following T3 treatment for 10 days (Dozin, B., Magnuson, M.A., and Nikodem, V. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10290-10292). Since the level of cytoplasmic mRNA increases 10-15-fold, one or more additional mechanisms must be operative to produce the full effect. We have now analyzed the time course of the effect of T3 on the rate of transcription and the accumulation of malic enzyme RNA in the nucleus using malic enzyme cDNAs and intronic probes. There is an approximately 10-12-fold increase in the level of nuclear RNA accompanied by the same increase in cytoplasmic mRNA, showing a half-rise time of about 60 h. The 3-4-fold increase in the transcription rate occurred with a half-time of about 18 h. The relative values for either the increase in transcriptional activity or the increase in the level of malic enzyme RNA in the nucleus were identical irrespective of the probes used. As a control, we examined the effect of a high carbohydrate diet which is known to increase malic enzyme mRNA without affecting either transcriptional rate or nuclear RNA (Dozin, B., Rall, J. E., and Nikodem, V. M. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 4705-4709). As expected, no change in the level of malic enzyme RNA in the nucleus was found with the intronic probes. We conclude that T3 both activates transcription of the malic enzyme gene in rat liver and decreases the rate of degradation of pre-mRNA coding for malic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1536366657,"Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) carries 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinaldehyde as endogenous ligands and may be a functional component of the visual cycle. The complete amino acid sequence of CRALBP from bovine retina has been determined by direct microanalysis of the protein. Bovine CRALBP contains 316 residues in a single amino-terminal-blocked chain corresponding to a molecular weight of 36,421, inclusive of the blocking group. Overlapping peptides were generated by cleavage of lysyl, arginyl, methionyl, glutamyl, and one tryptophanyl bond and sequenced by gas-phase Edman degradation. Analysis of amino-terminal arginyl and methionyl peptides by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry identified the N alpha-blocking group as an acetyl moiety, and tandem mass spectrometry provided the sequence of the first 9 residues. Comparison of CRALBP with other known protein sequences reveals no significant structural relatedness. The present results provide a basis for relating CRALBP domains with physiological function and for the future development of a more detailed three-dimensional model of the interaction of 11-cis-retinaldehyde with protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596123405,"In bovine aortic endothelial cells, ATP (10-100 microM) and bradykinin (0.1-1.0 microM) enhanced the phosphorylation of two major protein substrates with apparent molecular masses of 95 and 28 kDa. The action of ATP involved P2y purinoceptors. The kinetics were distinct for the two phosphopeptides. The phosphorylation of the 95-kDa protein was rapid (within 30 s) but transient (maintained for only 2 min). This time course agrees with that observed for the increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ level induced by ATP in these cells. Ionophore A23187 (greater than or equal to 100 nM) induced this phosphorylation for a longer period (5-10 min), whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was completely inactive. The enhancement of the 28-kDa protein phosphorylation was detectable after a 5-min lag and was maintained for at least 20 min. PMA (50 nM) stimulated weakly the phosphorylation of the 28-kDa protein, whereas A23187 (100-300 nM) was even more effective than ATP and bradykinin. The 95-kDa phosphoprotein seems to be related to a 100-kDa substrate of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III recently identified as elongation factor-2. The 28-kDa protein, which was resolved as three variants in bidimensional gel electrophoresis, appears very similar to a slightly heavier phosphoprotein from thrombin-stimulated human platelets. In addition, bidimensional electrophoresis allowed the detection of at least 10 substrates (from 18 to 46 kDa) whose phosphorylation was enhanced equally well by ATP, bradykinin, and A23187 and only partially by PMA. In conclusion, protein phosphorylation induced by ATP and bradykinin in aortic endothelial cells seems to be catalyzed mostly by Ca2+-dependent kinases, distinct from protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1515572238,"Abstract Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago catalyzes the peroxidative chlorination of organic acceptor molecules. From a variety of spectroscopic data, it had long been thought that chloroperoxidase possessed an active site structure similar to that of cytochrome P-450cam. Resonance Raman studies conducted with isotopically substituted enzyme proved conclusively that the fifth axial ligand to the ferriprotoporphyrin IX moiety of chloroperoxidase is indeed a cysteine thiolate (Bangcharoenpaurpong, O., Champion, P. M., Hall, K. S., and Hager, L. P. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 2374-2378). In this study, Ellman's reagent, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), was used to ascertain which of the 3 cysteine residues in the primary structure of chloroperoxidase serves as the fifth axial heme ligand; two of the cysteine residues were earlier shown to be involved in a disulfide linkage. Apoprotein was labeled under denaturing conditions with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). A unique peptide, containing the thionitrobenzoate adduct, was isolated via reverse phase HPLC following digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C. Amino acid and Edman sequence analysis revealed the fifth axial ligand in chloroperoxidase to be cysteine 29. Under reducing and denaturing conditions, incubation of apochloroperoxidase with Ellman's reagent resulted in 3 labeled residues. Proteolysis and isolation of the labeled peptides using reverse phase HPLC and subsequent Edman sequence analysis detected and identified the thionitrobenzoate adducts of each of the three cysteinyl peptides of chloroperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1596598658,"Abstract The specificities of two human monoclonal antibodies (2-39M and 32-27M), produced by hybridomas derived from the lymphocytes of melanoma patients (Yamaguchi, H., Furukawa, K., Fortunato, S. R., Livingston, P. O., Lloyd, K. O., Oettgen, H. F., and Old, L. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2416-2420) have been elucidated. Using a large panel of glycolipids, it has been shown that the two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified a number of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing gangliosides. mAb 2-39M reacted with (NeuGc)GM3, (NeuGc)sialylparagloboside, and (NeuGc)sialylhexaglycosylceramide; no reactivity was observed with gangliosides containing only N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) or with disialogangliosides. These reactive species have the NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal- sequence in common. mAb 32-27M reacted strongly with (NeuGc)2 GD3 and (NeuGc)2disialylparagloboside, and moderately with (NeuAc-NeuGc-)GD3 and (NeuAc-NeuGc-)disialylparagloboside. The reactive species have sialic acid alpha 2----8NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal- sequences in common. These two antibodies were used to demonstrate the species-related presence of different NeuGc-containing gangliosides in various animal erythrocytes by thin layer chromatography immunostaining. No reactivity of either mAb was observed with gangliosides isolated from fresh human colon cancer, melanoma specimens, or some normal tissues, including brain. On the other hand, it was shown that mAb 32-27M reacted with gangliosides isolated from human melanoma and astrocytoma cells grown in fetal bovine serum but not from those grown in synthetic medium. Within the sensitivities of the methods used, these data, and related chemical analyses, do not support the presence of NeuGc-containing gangliosides in human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1491597935,"Three subspecies of RNA polymerase II, designated IIO, IIA, and IIB, have been described in calf thymus and shown to differ in the apparent molecular weight of their largest subunits, designated IIo, IIa, and IIb, respectively. The objective of this study was to develop a procedure for the purification of RNA polymerase IIO. This form of the enzyme predominates in vivo and is responsible for the transcription of most cellular genes. RNA polymerase II is solubilized from isolated calf thymus nuclei in the presence of high concentrations of chelators, precipitated with polyethyleneimine, extracted with salt, and precipitated with (NH4)2SO4. The solubilized enzyme is resolved from factors that destabilize RNA polymerase IIO by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-4B and DE52. RNA polymerase IIO is then partially resolved from RNA polymerases IIA and IIB by chromatography on DEAE-5PW and further purified by chromatography on Phenyl-Superose and Mono Q. RNA polymerase IIO was purified 1000-fold from the polyethyleneimine eluate resulting in about 130 micrograms of RNA polymerase IIO from 300 g of calf thymus. The specific activity of RNA polymerase IIO, in nonselective assays using calf thymus DNA as template, is 440 units/mg and not significantly different from that of RNA polymerases IIA and IIB. The similar transcriptional activities in nonselective assays suggest that the C-terminal domain of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit does not play a major role in the elongation phase of the reaction when deproteinized DNA serves as template. The small subunits of RNA polymerase IIO are indistinguishable from those of RNA polymerases IIA and IIB."
https://openalex.org/W1626592198,Addition of phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to apophycocyanin at pH 7.0 resulted in covalent adduct formation. The adduct showed absorbance maxima at 575 and 605 nm and fluorescence emission maxima at 582 and 619 nm. Analysis of bilin peptides obtained upon tryptic digestion of the adduct showed residues alpha-Cys-84 and beta-Cys-82 to be the sites of bilin addition. The product of PEB addition at the alpha-Cys-84 site was shown by 1H NMR analysis to be a dihydrobiliviolinoid peptide-linked pigment differing in structure from that of the naturally occurring PEB-adduct by the presence of a double bond in between C2 and C3 of ring A. At the beta-Cys-82 site both a dihydrobiliviolinoid and a PEB adduct were obtained. Biliverdin also formed a covalent adduct with apophycocyanin with a lambda max of 669 nm. These results show that the spontaneous in vitro addition of bilins to apophycocyanin does not exhibit the site selectivity of bilin addition observed in vivo. This offers the opportunity to form novel semisynthetic phycobiliproteins.
https://openalex.org/W1569087595,"Bovine serum albumin is generally employed as a substrate depot for the delivery of acyl units to lipid metabolizing enzymes in vitro. Here we test the possibility that albumin alters the availability of substrate to mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and thereby alters its apparent kinetics. Binding competition with palmitoyl-CoA indicates that albumin has 5-6 high affinity sites which avidly bind the substrate, while isolated mitochondria compete favorably for substrate only as the albumin sites become saturated. In contrast to albumin, artificial phospholipid vesicles bind palmitoyl-CoA uniformly. Palmitoyl-CoA distribution between vesicles and mitochondrial membranes appears simply to be a function of the relative size of the two lipid compartments. Both albumin and artificial vesicles reduce the effective concentration of substrate available to the enzyme and in this way reduce apparent affinity. Direct measurement of mitochondrially bound substrate removes this effect and brings the results into agreement with an affinity constant of 6-7 nmol/mg. Changes in gross mitochondrial structure, as indicated by decreased optical density and increased nonpelleting protein, do not begin occurring until levels of mitochondrially bound palmitoyl-CoA are 15 times greater than this. The highly sigmoidal activity profile of carnitine palmitoyltransferase with respect to palmitoyl-CoA (apparent Hill coefficient = 3.0 +/- 0.3) is lost when vesicles are substituted for albumin, suggesting that albumin binding sites contribute to the sigmoidal kinetics in the range of palmitoyl-CoA studied."
https://openalex.org/W1602996221,"Kinetics of CO binding to human hemoglobin (Hb) has been followed below neutrality. With respect to the behavior observed at pH 7.0, CO binding to deoxy-Hb at pH 2.3 displays a much faster second-order combination rate constant (1.2 x 10(-7) M-1 s-1) and loss of the autocatalytic character of the kinetic progress curve. The spectroscopic features of the transient deoxy-Hb at pH 2.75 indicate the phenomenon to be related to the cleavage of the proximal histidine N epsilon-Fe bond, as reported for monomeric hemoproteins (Coletta, M., Ascenzi, P., Traylor, T. G., and Brunori, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4151-4155). The faster CO binding rate constant, higher than that characteristic of the R state, cannot be attributed to either (i) an enhanced dimerization of deoxy-Hb at low pH, or (ii) a quaternary switch of the unliganded form to the R0 state. The data indicate that interaction(s) of the heme on the proximal side is crucial in accounting for the difference in the CO binding rate constant between the two quaternary conformations of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1574185308,"Abstract The extracellular hemoglobin of the polychaete Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus is a giant multisubunit protein consisting of two types of subunits: a monomeric chain (chain I) and a disulfide bonded of chains IIA, IIB, and IIC. We have reported the complete amino acid sequences of all four chains (Suzuki, T., and Gotoh, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9257-9267). The sites of disulfide bonds in the trimer have now been determined. In the trimer, there are two interchain disulfide bonds between chains IIA and IIC, and IIB and IIC, respectively. In addition, each of the four chains, I, IIA, IIB, IIC, has an intrachain disulfide bond. Thus, according to our 192-chain model (Suzuki, T., and Gotoh, T. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 190, 119-123), there are 288 disulfide bonds in Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin. Digital image processing of scanning transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin indicated dimensions of 28 x 18 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1495025933,"Abstract We have previously reported on carbohydrate structures of the major acidic glycosphingolipids from the liver of the English sole, Parophrys vetulus (Ostrander, G. K., Levery, S. B., Hakomori, S., and Holmes, E. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3103-3110). We have now isolated four major neutral glycosphingolipids from English sole liver. They have been characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. In addition to neutral glycosphingolipids with known structures (CMH, lactosylceramide, and Gg3), a major polar neutral glycosphingolipid was isolated and characterized as having the following novel structure: (formula; see text) The compound represents a novel hybrid of neolacto-, ganglio-, and iso-globo-series glycosphingolipid structures, a combination not previously encountered. Furthermore, the linkage Fuc alpha 1----3GalNac has not been previously reported for a glycosphingolipid. The relationship of these structural elements to known glycoconjugates is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515472205,"The reaction of protein amino groups with glucose leads to the formation of a stable Amadori product via a Schiff base adduct, which is further converted to advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) with color and unique fluorescence characteristics. 2-(2-Furoyl)-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (FFI) was recently identified as a major fluorescent compound (Ponger, S., Ulrich, P.C., Bencsath, F.A., and Cerami, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 2684-2688). Its in vivo and in situ presence was further demonstrated by radioimmunoassays (Chang, J.C.F., Ulrich, P.C., Bucala, R., and Cerami, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7970-7974). In the present study the occurrence of FFI in AGE-proteins was reassessed. The radioimmunoassay using anti-FFI antibody and high performance liquid chromatography failed to detect FFI in AGE samples obtained from bovine serum albumin, poly-L-lysine, oligo-L-lysine, and L-lysine. Even after acid hydrolysis or proteinase K digestion, FFI was undetectable. To our surprise, however, the addition of ammonia to these acid hydrolysate led to the production of FFI, suggesting the importance of acid hydrolysis and subsequent reaction with ammonia for the generation of FFI. This observation was fully supported by model experiments using AGE-samples prepared by incubating glucose with monoaminocarboxylic acids such as beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Thus, a nonfluorescent FFI precursor is produced by acid hydrolysis, and its conversion to fluorescent FFI occurs upon subsequent reaction with ammonia, the evidence against the presence of FFI in AGE-proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1489195524,"The crystal structure of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin has been determined using multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques at 5.0-A resolution. The electron density map shows striking similarity to a map of Peptococcus aerogenes ferredoxin computed at the same resolution from the atomic coordinates reported by Adman et al. (Adman, E. T., Sieker, L. C., and Jensen, L. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3987-3996). Such similarity is expected from the high degree of identity between amino acid sequences of the two proteins. The use of MAD methods has in the relatively recent past become a practical possibility due to instrumental advances enabling the collection of accurate data at several wavelengths at synchrotrons and due to theoretical and computational advances that facilitate the analysis of these data for the determination of phases. These methods hold great promise as an alternative to the multiple isomorphous replacement method in macromolecular structure determination. The present report represents one of the first applications of the MAD techniques to the determination of the structure of a protein which was previously unknown in detail."
https://openalex.org/W1492869604,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity is developmentally regulated in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Woodward, H. D., Allen, J. M. C., and Lennarz, W. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2513-2517). To study the structural and regulatory properties of this enzyme, we isolated and sequenced a 3-kb cDNA encoding the sea urchin embryo reductase. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA predicted a protein structure consisting of a hydrophobic N-terminal region containing seven potential membrane-spanning domains and a somewhat less hydrophobic C-terminal domain joined by a hydrophilic linker region. Comparison with reductase from mammalian sources revealed that the N-terminal membrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain exhibited high sequence similarity, whereas the domain that linked these two showed little or no sequence similarity. We investigated the possibility that sterols or sterol derivatives might be involved in the marked change that occurs in the level of reductase activity over development. Enzyme activity and reductase mRNA levels measured in extracts from embryos cultured in the presence of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, dolichol, or mevalonic acid were found to be virtually unchanged as compared to control embryos. Similar experiments with mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of reductase, failed to show a drug-induced change in enzyme or mRNA level. Thus, despite structural similarities the sea urchin embryo enzyme differs markedly from the mammalian enzyme with respect to regulation, since its level is neither repressed by sterols nor induced by mevinolin. Moreover, it appears unlikely that sterols or sterol derivatives play a role in the striking change in the level of this enzyme that occurs during development."
https://openalex.org/W1592910307,"Cells from patients with Bloom's syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder associated with an increased risk of cancer, exhibit genomic instability. Increased numbers of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE) and delayed DNA chain maturation are typically observed in BS cells. To elucidate the basis for the previously reported decreased DNA ligase I activity in BS cells, simultaneous immunoblot and activity assays for ligase-[32P]AMP adduct formation were performed on extracts from BS and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines. Immunoblot analysis using antibody to DNA ligase I indicate that the amount of the major reactive protein (98 kDa) in normal and BS cells is similar. However, a 50-90% decrease was observed in the ligase activity of the 98-kDa polypeptide in high-SCE BS cells (HG1514 and GM3403c). In contrast, the activity in low-SCE BS cells (HG1554) did not differ significantly from that in normal cells. The data, together with mixing experiments, indicate that the defect in BS ligase I is due at least in part to the loss of ATP binding and/or hydrolytic activity and not to differences in numbers of protein molecules or inhibitory substances. These results suggest that mutation of the DNA ligase I gene may account for the primary metabolic defect in BS."
https://openalex.org/W2124671470,"Effects of mutations around the phage SP6 transcription initiation site on SP6 RNA polymerase's selection of initiation site were studied. In the in vitro transcription reactions, the limiting concentration of a ribonucleotide causes the SP6 RNA polymerase to stall long enough only at the positions of the limited nucleotide and dissociate from the elongation complex. As a result, a series of RNA oligomers comprises a sequencing ladder, and abortive initiation cycling products up to 6-mer are made in high yield. Precise sizing of the product RNAs from the elongation pausings determined the initiation site of each mutant. When the wild-type +1 G is changed to C or A without change in the upstream sequence including TATA from -4 to -1, transcription still starts only at the +1 site. But, the mutant containing TATCC from -4 to +1 C. We propose that the phage SP6 RNA polymerase selects the initiation site precisely at a certain distance from a direct contact point in the upstream promoter sequence, regardless of the species of initiating nucleotide. It is also suggested that the sequence-dependent perturbations of DNA helical structure, for example D to B form, may shift the initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1636227348,"Abstract Deprivation of cultured BRL-3A rat liver cells for a single essential amino acid (leucine, methionine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine) under conditions in which the cells remain highly viable causes a decreased secretion of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) E-domain peptide into the culture medium. This decrease is observed within 8 h after shifting the cells into amino acid-deficient medium. The magnitude of this decrease is greatest in tryptophan-deprived cultures, in which there is a 66% decrease in IGF-II E-domain peptide secretion over a 24-h incubation as compared with E-domain peptide secretion in control cultures incubated in complete medium. Northern blot analysis has indicated that the decrease in IGF-II E-domain peptide secretion observed in amino acid-deprived cells is correlated with a decreased abundance of the major 3.6-kilobase (kb) species of IGF-II mRNA, as well as several minor species. In contrast, the level of a 1-kb species of IGF-II mRNA is not decreased in amino acid-limited cells. In addition, one other specific mRNA, that encoded by the alpha-tubulin gene, also is not significantly decreased in the leucine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan-limited cells. These results indicate that amino acid limitation specifically decreases the level of certain IGF-II mRNA species. The 3.6- and 1-kb IGF-II mRNA species differ only in the length of the 3'-untranslated region, suggesting the existence of a specific regulatory sequence in the long 3'-untranslated region of the 3.6-kb mRNA species that regulates levels of this mRNA species under conditions of amino acid limitation. IGF-II gene transcription is not decreased in the amino acid-limited cells. This indicates that the decrease in IGF-II mRNA and E-domain peptide secretion observed in the amino acid-deprived cells is caused primarily by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1508070921,"Studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrate the presence of an anion exchanger, which has some of the properties of the band 3 transporter in erythrocytes. 1) Extracellular chloride is a competitive inhibitor of sulfate influx and stimulates sulfate efflux, suggesting that the mechanism of uptake is SO2-(4)/Cl- exchange. 2) The anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid inhibits sulfate uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibition is achieved at 0.06 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. 3) Low extracellular pH markedly stimulates sulfate uptake. A 6-fold decrease in the apparent Km is observed at pHout 5.5 as compared to pHout 7.5. However, studies carried out over a broad range of extracellular SO2-(4) concentrations indicate the presence of three components of this transport activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells: two high affinity low capacity systems, one in the range 0.5 microM less than [SO2-(4)]out less than 50 microM and one in the range 50 microM less than [SO2-(4)]out less than 150 microM, and a low affinity, high capacity system (at [SO2-(4)]out greater than 150 microM). These properties have not been previously reported for the erythroid band 3 transporter. The availability of mutants deficient in these activities has enabled us to carry out studies which suggest that the high affinity systems are functionally independent of the low affinity system, but that all systems are dependent on the same anion exchange protein. Studies in a mutant which lacks all components of the transport activity indicates that the anion exchanger may be instrumental in the regulation of the intracellular pH in Chinese hamster ovary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606706906,"When link protein binds to hyaluronate in the absence of proteoglycan monomer a high molecular weight complex is formed. Two assay procedures have been developed to examine the formation of the complex and the rate and stoichiometry of binding of link protein to hyaluronate in the complex. In the first, the complex is isolated by differential centrifugation, and the stoichiometry of binding of link protein to hyaluronate in the sedimented complex is determined. In the second assay, which involves turbidimetry, the rate of complex formation (delta A420/min) is determined, and the amount of complex formed is determined in terms of the maximum turbidity (A420,max) attained. The effects of temperature, pH, initial total solute concentration, and the ratio by weight of link protein to hyaluronate on the amount of complex formed and on the rate of complex formation were examined. There is a linear correlation between the amount of complex formed as determined by turbidity and by differential centrifugation. Using these assays, we examined the specificity of the binding of link protein to hyaluronate and the capacity of hyaluronate oligosaccharides to competitively inhibit the binding of link protein to hyaluronate. Hyaluronate decasaccharide is the oligosaccharide of minimum size that strongly inhibits the binding of link protein to hyaluronate. Proteoglycan monomers dissociate from hyaluronate as the pH is decreased from pH 7 to pH 5. Turbidimetric studies show that the rate of binding of link protein to hyaluronate increases with decreasing pH. The binding affinity of proteoglycan monomers for hyaluronate is decreased at pH 5, whereas the binding affinity of link protein for hyaluronate is not. This difference in the effect of pH on the stability of binding of link protein to hyaluronate, compared with proteoglycan monomer, explains in part the capacity of link protein to stabilize the binding of proteoglycan monomer to hyaluronate at pH 5."
https://openalex.org/W2107953786,"Procedures are needed for the manipulation of enzymes to introduce improved catalytic efficiencies and substrate affinities, even in the absence of information on three-dimensional structure. We previously described a selection for amino acid replacements that compensate for a large polypeptide deletion in an enzyme. The rationale is that, because of the missing polypeptide sequence, compensatory replacements must create new enzyme-substrate contacts that are not present in the native protein. Here we introduce into an undeleted enzyme a mutation that compensates for a large deletion in the same enzyme. Binding and kinetic measurements show that this mutation has the same effect on the undeleted as on the deleted protein. The results suggest that a new enzyme-substrate interaction has been created by the mutation and that its contribution to the interaction energy is similar in both the deleted and undeleted molecules. Introduction of this class of mutations into enzymes may in general be useful for engineering them to have improved interactions with ligands and substrates."

We separated the serine protease (Mr approximately 30,000) activity found associated with apparently homogeneous preparations of C6 from the hemolytically active C6 protein. The protease was characterized as thrombin-like based on substrate specificity, inhibitor profile, and kinetic studies. Although the proteolytic activity of C6 preparations was inhibitable by several inhibitors of serine proteases, the C6 hemolytic activity remained unaffected. Acid-induced (C(5,6)a complex formation between C5 and C6 (protease-free) was demonstrated by ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and reactive cytolytic activity in the presence of C7, C8, and C9; but no cleavage of the alpha-chain of C5 was observed. Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate pretreatment of the components did not affect their ability to generate functionally active (C(5,6)a. Evidently, C6-associated thrombin is not required for formation of functional C(5,6)a. Thus, C6 does not function in the membrane attack pathway of complement as a serine protease.
