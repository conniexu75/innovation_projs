https://openalex.org/W2124614845,"Cellular senescence is an extremely stable form of cell cycle arrest that limits the proliferation of damaged cells and may act as a natural barrier to cancer progression. In this study, we describe a distinct heterochromatic structure that accumulates in senescent human fibroblasts, which we designated senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). SAHF formation coincides with the recruitment of heterochromatin proteins and the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor to E2F-responsive promoters and is associated with the stable repression of E2F target genes. Notably, both SAHF formation and the silencing of E2F target genes depend on the integrity of the Rb pathway and do not occur in reversibly arrested cells. These results provide a molecular explanation for the stability of the senescent state, as well as new insights into the action of Rb as a tumor suppressor."

https://openalex.org/W2014028088,"In the mammalian retina, besides the conventional rod-cone system, a melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists that conveys photic information for accessory visual functions such as pupillary light reflex and circadian photo-entrainment. On ablation of the melanopsin gene, retinal ganglion cells that normally express melanopsin are no longer intrinsically photosensitive. Furthermore, pupil reflex, light-induced phase delays of the circadian clock and period lengthening of the circadian rhythm in constant light are all partially impaired. Here, we investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate in these responses. Using mice lacking rods and cones, we measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the circadian rhythm of locomotor behaviour. This spectrum matches that for the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We have also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled with disabled rod and cone phototransduction mechanisms. These animals have an intact retina but fail to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus, the rod-cone and melanopsin systems together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory visual functions."
https://openalex.org/W2023035407,"High mutation frequency during reverse transcription has a principal role in the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations. It is the main driving force for the generation of drug resistance and the escape from immune surveillance. G to A hypermutation is one of the characteristics of primate lentiviruses, as well as other retroviruses, during replication in vivo and in cell culture. The molecular mechanisms of this process, however, remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that CEM15 (also known as apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G; APOBEC3G), an endogenous inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, is a cytidine deaminase and is able to induce G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. This effect can be counteracted by the HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). It seems that this viral DNA mutator is a viral defence mechanism in host cells that may induce either lethal hypermutation or instability of the incoming nascent viral reverse transcripts, which could account for the Vif-defective phenotype. Importantly, the accumulation of CEM15-mediated non-lethal hypermutation in the replicating viral genome could potently contribute to the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations."
https://openalex.org/W2159330173,"Efficient engulfment of the intact cell corpse is a critical end point of apoptosis, required to prevent secondary necrosis and inflammation. The presentation of “eat-me” signals on the dying cell is an important part of this process of recognition and engulfment by professional phagocytes. Here, we present evidence that apoptotic cells secrete chemotactic factor(s) that stimulate the attraction of monocytic cells and primary macrophages. The activation of caspase-3 in the apoptotic cell was found to be required for the release of this chemotactic factor(s). The putative chemoattractant was identified as the phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine. Further analysis showed that lysophosphatidylcholine was released from apoptotic cells due to the caspase-3 mediated activation of the calcium-independent phospholipase A2. These data suggest that in addition to eat-me signals, apoptotic cells display attraction signals to ensure the efficient removal of apoptotic cells and prevent postapoptotic necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068430855,"Dengue virus presents a growing threat to public health in the developing world. Four major serotypes of dengue virus have been characterized, and epidemiological evidence shows that dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the more serious manifestation of the disease, occurs more frequently upon reinfection with a second serotype. We have studied dengue virus–specific T-cell responses in Thai children. During acute infection, few dengue-responsive CD8+ T cells were recovered; most of those present showed an activated phenotype and were undergoing programmed cell death. Many dengue-specific T cells were of low affinity for the infecting virus and showed higher affinity for other, probably previously encountered strains. Profound T-cell activation and death may contribute to the systemic disturbances leading to DHF, and original antigenic sin in the T-cell responses may suppress or delay viral elimination, leading to higher viral loads and increased immunopathology."

https://openalex.org/W2023775321,"The ErbB-4 receptor protein-tyrosine kinase is proteolytically processed by membrane proteases in response to the ligand or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation resulting in the cytoplasmic fragment translocating to the cell nucleus. The WW domain-containing co-transcriptional activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) associates physically with the full-length ErbB-4 receptor and functionally with the ErbB-4 cytoplasmic fragment in the nucleus. The YAP·ErbB4 complex is mediated by the first WW domain of YAP and the most carboxyl-terminal PPXY motif of ErbB-4. In human tissues, we documented the expression of YAP1 with a single WW domain and YAP2 with two WW domains. It is known that the COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB4 does not have transcriptional activity by itself; however, we show here that in the presence of YAP its transcriptional activity is revealed. There is a difference in the extent of transactivation activity among YAP isoforms: YAP2 is the stronger activator compared with YAP1. This transactivation is abolished by mutations that abrogate the YAP·ErbB4 complex formation. The unphosphorylatable mutation that increases the nuclear localization of YAP increases transcription activity. The COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4 and full-length YAP2 overexpressed in cells partially co-localize to the nucleus. Our data indicate that YAP is a potential signaling partner of the full-length ErbB4 receptor at the membrane and of the COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4 that translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription.

Cells are continuously exposed to diverse stimuli ranging from soluble paracrine and endocrine factors to signaling molecules on neighboring cells. These extracellular signals are transduced to cell nuclei to achieve an appropriate developmental or proliferative response. Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases play pivotal roles in this process. Upon binding of their cognate ligands, the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor is significantly elevated and initiates a network of signaling pathways including the well characterized Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and the signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J.

Whereas many cell surface receptors transmit signals to the nucleus through complex protein cascades, several examples of membrane receptors translocating itself to the nucleus have been described (4Carpenter G.

In the case of ErbB-1, the epidermal growth factor receptor, addition of its cognate ligand causes translocation of the ligand-receptor complex to the nucleus and the complex binds to the cyclin D1 promoter activating its transcription (6Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). ErbB-3 (7Offterdinger M. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Grunt T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and fibroblast growth factor receptor I (8Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have been also reported to be present in nucleus. Recently, it has been suggested that ErbB-4, the newest member of the epidermal growth factor protein-tyrosine kinase receptor family, activates gene expression in a more direct manner (10Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 11Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol.

The binding of its ligand, heregulin, or activation of protein kinase C by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate provokes an ectodomain cleavage by a metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, followed by a subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase that release the ErbB-4 intracellular domain fragment from the membrane. The processing by γ-secretase facilitates the translocation of the COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4 (CTF) 1The abbreviations used are: CTF, COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; APP, amyloid precursor protein; WT, wild-type; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; YAP, Yes-associated protein. to the nucleus where it may affect the transcription of target genes. Similar mechanisms have been described for the proteolytic processing of the Notch receptor and the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) (12Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar, 13Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 14Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). This process is called regulated intramembrane proteolysis and it represents a relatively new paradigm of signal transduction (15Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Science. 2001; 294: 2111-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In Notch-1 signaling, the ligand binding causes intra-membrane cleavage of Notch-1 and generation of a transcriptionally active fragment. The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in the cell-fate specification process in multicellular organisms. The intracellular fragment of Notch is translocated to nucleus and binds directly to downstream transcription factors of the C promoter binding factor/suppressor of hairless/Lag-1 family, to control transcriptional repression and activation of Notch target genes (12Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). In the case of APP, its intracellular fragment is produced by γ-secretase and translocates to the nucleus to form a multimeric complex with the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. This multicomponent complex is able to activate transcription via Gal4 or LexA reporters (14Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In that experimental system, a robust transcriptional activation was observed only when the COOH-terminal fragment of APP was co-expressed with Fe65; the COOH-terminal fragment alone was not active. Fe65 is a typical adaptor protein composed of a WW domain and two PTB domains. The PTB1 domain binds to the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and the PTB2 domain interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of APP (14Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 17Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Isoforms of the ErbB-4 receptor generated by alternative splicing have been described (Ref. 3Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar and Fig. 1a) including the JM-a isoform that is sensitive to the cleavage, whereas the JM-b isoform is insensitive to the cleavage because of the sequence difference in the juxtamembrane region (18Elenius K.

The other isoform contains a sequence change in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binding region within the cytoplasmic domain (19Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Kainulainen V. Sundvall M. Maatta J.A. Santiestevan E. Klagsbrun M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8641-8649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This site is deleted in an isoform designated CYT-2 and the other isoform that contains PI3K site is designated as CYT-1 form. The ErbB4-CTF that was shown to translocate to the nucleus contains a protein-tyrosine kinase domain, autophosphorylation sites, and the PDZ domain recognition site (21Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W.

Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4561-4565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Within the ErbB-4 sequence we identified several proline-rich motifs that represent potential binding sites for WW domains. The WW domain is a protein-protein interaction module composed of 35–40 amino acids (23Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 24Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The domain binds ligands containing proline-rich sequences (25Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The largest class of WW domains binds ligands containing PPXY motif. The three PPXY sequences in the COOH-terminal region of ErbB-4 completely match the consensus motif that is recognized by the Class I WW domains. Here we report that the WW domain-containing proteins, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its isoforms associate with the cytoplasmic region of ErbB-4 and transactivate the COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4-dependent transcription in the Gal4 system. YAP has been characterized as a co-transactivator for several transcription factors including the Runx family proteins (26Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the TEAD/TEF family of transcription factors (27Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and p73 (28Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been reported that the localization of YAP in the nucleus is regulated by Akt kinase and subsequent binding to 14-3-3 protein (29Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 30Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, none of the upstream or membrane signals that communicate with YAP have been previously described. This is the first report showing the stimulation of transcription by ErbB-4 in complex with YAP. Plasmids—The BamHI-EcoRI fragments that include coding region of human YAP1 and YAP2 were excised from pcDNA3-YAP and cDNA clone HYAP5 (31Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), respectively, and ligated into pcDNA4HIS-MAX (Invitrogen). The KpnI-XbaI fragment was excised from the pcDNA4HIS-MAX and the fragments were ligated into the p2xFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) vector to prepare expression vectors, p2xFLAG-YAP1 and p2xFLAG-YAP2. The expression construct encoding full-length ErbB-4 with COOH-terminal HA epitope tag (11Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol.

Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To prepare expression vector for the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused with ErbB-4 CTF and CTF(ΔK), PCR amplification was performed using the primer sets: 5′-gggtcgacttagaaggaagagcatcaaaaag; cctctagacaccacagtattccggtg-3′ and 5′-ccgtcgacttcagggtgatgatcgtatg-3′; 5′-cctctagacaccacagtattccggtg-3′, respectively, and subcloned into SalI-XbaI site of pM vector (Clontech). The YAP (S127A, 1WW*, and 2WW*) and ErbB-4 point mutants were constructed by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The reporter plasmid pG5luc that expresses firefly luciferase and pRL-SV40 that expresses Renilla luciferase as an internal control were purchased from Clontech and Promega, respectively. Cell Culture and Antibodies—Human embryo kidney 293T cells, COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. The polyclonal antibody that recognizes the COOH-terminal region of ErbB-4 (C-18) was purchased from Santa Cruz. The M2-antibody and the HA antibody were purchased from Sigma and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For analysis of the interaction between YAP and ErbB-4, 293T cells transfected with p2xFLAG-YAP1 or -YAP2 and pcDNA3.1-ErbB-4 or pEF6ΔE2ErbB-4 using FuGENE 6 (Roche) were lysed with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) 36–48 h after transfection and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed with the RIPA buffer and bound proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by HA antibody. Luciferase Assay—Cells in 12-well dishes were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) harvested 36–48 h later. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) and firefly luciferase activity normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase activity. All experiments were performed at least three times. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells on glass coverslips were transfected with p2xFLAG-YAP2 and/or pcDNA3-ErbB-4 (CTF-(676–1292)) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 36–48 h, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 10% goat serum. For the colocalization study of exogenously expressed YAP and the COOH-terminal fragment of ErbB-4, transfected cells were stained with FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and ErbB-4 antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Images were acquired using Nikkon microscope Eclipse TE2000-S equipped with a CCD camera. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues obtained from FVBN mice (8 weeks old) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I (Amp grade, Invitrogen) to eliminate residual contamination of DNA. The DNase-treated RNA was subsequently transcribed to cDNA with Superscript II enzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) using oligo-(dT)18 primer. The cDNA was subjected to PCR analysis and primers were designed to be able to distinguish mouse YAP1 and YAP2 isoforms with primer pairs to sandwich both WW domains: 5′-ccctgatgatgtaccactgcc-3′ (nucleotides 654–674 of mouse YAP2) and 5′-ccactgttaagaaagggatcgg-3′ (nucleotides 1271–1251 of mouse YAP2). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified as a positive control with primers: 5′-accacagtccatgccatcac-3′ and 5′-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Human YAP1 and YAP2—It has been reported that human YAP contains a single WW domain and mouse YAP contains two WW domains. We found a splicing variant that encodes human YAP with two WW domains. YAP with a single WW domain, known previously as human YAP (31Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), is designated here as YAP1 and the new YAP with two WW domains is designated as YAP2. The difference in the nucleotide sequence between YAP1 and YAP2 is an insertion of the additional WW domain encoding region, its flanking sequence, and the deletion of the four amino acid sequence “QVRP” in YAP2 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that YAP2 is a splicing variant. The second WW domain of human YAP2 differs from the second WW domain of mouse YAP by one amino acid in the aromatic triplet located in the second β-strand of the domain. The amino acid sequence of human YAP2 shares 90.2% sequence homology with the mouse YAP, indicating that YAP2 is most likely the human homologue of mouse YAP. YAP1 and YAP2 Associate with ErbB-4 through the WW Domain—To assess interaction between human YAPs and ErbB-4, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Both the HA-tagged CYT-2 isoform of the full-length ErbB-4 and FLAG-tagged YAP1 or YAP2 were transiently expressed in 293T cells, and the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The immunoprecipitant was probed with HA antibody to detect the coprecipitation of ErbB-4. In the presence of YAP1 or YAP2, ErbB-4 was pulled-down (Fig. 2b, lanes 2 and 5) indicating that YAP1 or YAP2 associates with ErbB-4 in cells. YAP2 seemed consistently more efficient in co-precipitation of ErbB-4 than YAP1 (Fig. 2a, lane 2 and 5), suggesting that YAP2 associates with ErbB-4 stronger than YAP1 does. Next, to determine whether this association is mediated by the WW domain of YAP1, a WW domain mutant was created in which the second conserved tryptophan and the conserved proline were each substituted to alanine (Fig. 2a). Based on our previous studies (32Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and on the understanding of the WW domain molecular structure (34Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) such mutants should render the domain inactive in terms of ligand binding. The WW domain mutation in YAP1 completely abolished the binding to ErbB-4 (Fig. 2b, lane 4). Interestingly, the analogous mutation of the second WW domain in YAP2 did not have any effect on binding to ErbB-4 (Fig. 2c, lane 3). These results indicate that the first WW domain of YAPs is primarily responsible for the interaction with ErbB-4 but not the second WW domain in YAP2. A Mutation of the 14-3-3-binding/Akt Phosphorylation Site in YAP Affects the Binding to ErbB-4 —It has been reported that the serine 127 residue in YAP is phosphorylated by a protein kinase, Akt, and it is recognized by the 14-3-3 protein (29Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The binding by 14-3-3 causes translocation of YAP from the cytoplasm from the nucleus. To determine the importance of this site for the binding to ErbB-4, the serine residue at position 127 was substituted to alanine (Fig. 2a) and binding was examined by co-precipitation experiments. The mutation of serine residues at position 127 in both YAP1 and YAP2 attenuated the binding to ErbB-4 (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 6). YAPs Associate with ErbB-4 through the PPXY Motif Located in the Cytoplasmic Region—To make sure that YAPs bind to PPXY motifs in ErbB4, the tyrosine residues in the PPXY motifs were substituted to alanines. There are two PPXY motifs in the cytoplamic region of ErbB-4 at positions 1031–1040 (NIPPPIYTSR) and 1280–1288 (LPPPPYRHR). Two mutants were created, the first PPXY mutant was designated as PY1 and the second mutant was designated as PY3 (Fig. 3a). The co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the substitution of tyrosine residue in the most COOH-terminal PPXY region (PY3) completely abolished the binding to both YAP isoforms (Fig. 3b, lanes 6 and 9). On the contrary, the binding to YAPs was not affected by the mutation of the first PPXY sequence (Fig. 3b, lanes 5 and 8). All the above co-precipitation experiments indicated that the association between both YAPs and ErbB-4 is through the WW domain (the first WW domain in YAP2) in YAP and the most COOH-terminal PPXY sequence in ErbB-4. These data are in full agreement with the results of the optimal binding of PPXY-containing 10-mer peptides selected for YAP1 WW domain from phage display and SPOT membrane peptide repertoires (35Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The CTF Requires YAP for Stimulation of Transcription via the Gal4 Transactivation System—To make sure that the CTF is localized in the nucleus, the CTF was expressed in COS-7 cells and stained with ErbB-4 polyclonal antibody. Overexpression of the CTF showed prominent nuclear localization and weak cytosolic/membrane localization in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4a, right panel). The localization is distinct compared with the control, although this antibody showed low background of nuclear staining in non-transfected cells (Fig. 4a, left panel). This data confirms a previous result from the Carpenter laboratory obtained with the CTF-GFP fusion and cell fractionation study (10Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the CTF with the deleted kinase domain has an ability to transactivate transcription in the Gal4 system in contrast to the intact CTF. Here we have used the same Gal4 transactivation system (10Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), however, in the presence of YAP1 or YAP2. The Gal4 DNA binding domain (1–147) fused with the entire COOH-terminal fragment or with the deletion of the kinase domain of ErbB-4 was coexpressed with the Gal4-luciferase reporter in COS-7 cells and the luciferase activity was measured. As shown previously, only the COOH-terminal fragment with the kinase domain deletion could stimulate transcription 3–5-fold over the Gal4 control but the intact CTF fragment or the vector control were negative in the assay (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). As we expected, coexpression of YAP1 or YAP2 significantly transactivated both the intact and kinase-deleted versions of CTF-mediated transcription: YAP1-CTF, 3-fold, and YAP1-CTF δ kinase: 17-fold; YAP2-CTF, 10-fold, and YAP2-CTF δ kinase, 78-fold over the Gal4 control. These results indicate that both YAPs co-activate transcription and that YAP2 is a stronger co-activator of transcription than YAP1. The Association of YAP with the ErbB-4 Cytoplasmic Fragment Is Essential for Transactivation—In the subsequent experiments, we mainly used the intact version of CTF in the Gal4 assay, because the kinase-deleted fragment has not been detected under physiological conditions. To confirm that the transactivation by YAP is because of the direct association with the CTF-ErbB-4 fragment, we used YAP2 with a mutation in the WW domain that does not associate with ErbB-4 in the Gal4 assay. Although YAP2 with the mutation in the second WW domain activated less than the wild type (WT) YAP2, YAP2 with the mutation in the first WW domain did not activate transcription at all (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, mutation of the PPXY sequence (PY3) of the CTF that is essential for binding to YAP also abolished the stimulation of transcription either on the entire COOH-terminal fragment or the δ kinase domain CTF mutant. As expected the PY1 mutant did not have any effect in the assay (Fig. 5, b and c). These data indicate that the transactivation is caused by the YAP·CTF complex mediated by the WW domain of YAP and the most COOH-terminal PPXY sequence of the ErbB-4CTF. It has been reported that YAP is mostly localized in the cytoplasm and its nuclear localization is inhibited by the binding of 14-3-3 upon Akt phosphorylation (29Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). It has also been known that the mutation of serine 127 to alanine increases transactivation activity of YAP because of a greater nuclear localization of YAP and therefore decided to assess the nonphosphorylatable mutant (YAP-S127A) in the same Gal4 assay. Although, in the immunoprecipitation experiments using the full-length ErbB-4, the mutation attenuated the binding of YAP, this mutation caused a transactivation increase about 1.9-fold compared with the WT (Fig. 5a) in agreement with the previously reported data in the slightly different “read-out,” the p73 mediated transcription assay (29Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The attenuation of YAP association described here may be because of the change in localization of YAP to the nucleus and its inaccessibility to the membrane localized full-length receptor. The CTF Co-localizes Partially with YAP in Cells—To determine whether the CTF produced by the γ-secretase cleavage co-localizes with YAP in cells, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3HA-ErbB-4 CTF-(676–1292) and p2xFLAG-YAP2. The CTF showed prominent localization in the nucleus and FLAG-YAP2 showed mostly cytoplasmic distribution. In a clearly discernible population of cells, FLAG-YAP2 showed the co-localization with the CTF in the cell nuclei (Fig. 6), suggesting that YAP sublocalized in the nucleus cooperates with the native CTF derived from γ-secretase cleavage. Expression of YAP Transcripts in Several Tissues—Because the human YAP1 and YAP2 isoforms were described here for the first time, and the differences in their transcriptional activity was documented, we decided to investigate the expression pattern of each YAP transcript in various tissues. Because of the difficulties in obtaining normal human tissues, freshly dissected mouse tissues were used instead. Accordingly, we designed the mouse RT-PCR primers so that mouse YAP1 and YAP2 transcripts could be unequivocally amplified and distinguished. The sequence of the mouse YAP2 homologue and the topology of human YAP1 and YAP2 sequences were considered in the RT-PCR strategy (Fig. 7a). As we expected, doublet bands derived from two isoforms were observed, but the expected size of 500 bp for the mouse YAP1 homologue transcript was not detected (Fig. 7b). Instead, the slower migrating band with 700 bp was amplified in most mouse tissues together with the 600-bp band expected to be the mouse YAP2 homologue transcript. We confirmed the PCR product by direct sequence analysis and identified the 600-bp band as previously known YAP (mouse YAP2 homologue). The 700-bp band turned out to represent a new isoform with an insertion of 48 nucleotides; we designated this isoform as YAP2L. This sequence has been already submitted to the NCBI data base with the accession number of BC014"

https://openalex.org/W1976998737,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates multiple aspects of cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and β-oxidation of fatty acids. PGC-1α mRNA levels are increased in both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and may contribute to elevated hepatic glucose production in diabetic states. We have recently described PGC-1β, a novel transcriptional coactivator that is a homolog of PGC-1α. Although PGC-1β shares significant sequence similarity and tissue distribution with PGC-1α, the biological activities of PGC-1β in the regulation of cellular metabolism is unknown. In this study, we used an adenoviral-mediated expression system to study the function of PGC-1β both in cultured hepatocytes and in the liver of rats. PGC-1β, like PGC-1α, potently induces the expression of an array of mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative metabolism. However, in contrast to PGC-1α, PGC-1β poorly activates the expression of gluconeogenic genes in hepatocytes or liver <i>in vivo</i>, illustrating that these two coactivators play distinct roles in hepatic glucose metabolism. The reduced ability of PGC-1β to induce gluconeogenic genes is due, at least in part, to its inability to physically associate with and coactivate hepatic nuclear receptor 4α (HNF4α) and forkhead transcription factor O1 (FOXO1), two critical transcription factors that mediate the activation of gluconeogenic gene expression by PGC-1α. These data illustrate that PGC-1β and PGC-1α have distinct arrays of activities in hepatic energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2134182205,"Ecdysteroid pulses trigger the major developmental transitions during the Drosophila life cycle. These hormonal responses are thought to be mediated by the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and its heterodimeric partner Ultraspiracle (USP). We provide evidence for a second ecdysteroid signaling pathway mediated by DHR38, the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian NGFI-B subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors. DHR38 also heterodimerizes with USP, and this complex responds to a distinct class of ecdysteroids in a manner that is independent of EcR. This response is unusual in that it does not involve direct binding of ecdysteroids to either DHR38 or USP. X-ray crystallographic analysis of DHR38 reveals the absence of both a classic ligand binding pocket and coactivator binding site, features that seem to be common to all NGFI-B subfamily members. Taken together, these data reveal the existence of a separate structural class of nuclear receptors that is conserved from fly to humans."

LAC is frequently caused by anti-β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) antibodies. Antibody-induced dimerization of β2GPI increases the affinity of β2GPI for phospholipids, explaining the observed prolonged clotting times. We constructed dimers of β2GPI that mimic effects of β2GPI-anti-β2GPI antibody complexes, and we studied their effects on platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in a flow system. Dimeric β2GPI increased platelet adhesion to collagen by 150% and increased the number of large aggregates. We also observed increased platelet adhesion to collagen when whole blood was spiked with patient-derived polyclonal anti-β2GPI or some, but not all, monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibodies with LAC activity. These effects could be abrogated by inhibition of thromboxane synthesis. A LAC-positive monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibody, which did not affect platelet adhesion, prevented the induced increase in platelet adhesion by β2GPI dimers. Furthermore, increased platelet adhesion disappeared after preincubation with receptor-associated protein, a universal inhibitor of interaction of ligands with members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Using co-immunoprecipitation, it was shown that dimeric β2GPI can interact with apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2′), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family present on platelets.

We showed that apple4-β2GPI and apple4-C321S-β2GPI bind with much higher affinity to phospholipid and to platelets adhered to collagen than plasma-derived β2GPI. It was also shown that these dimers have LAC activity.

(age 46) had primary antiphospholipid syndrome (multiple cerebral infarctions, chronic mild thrombocytopenia, and livedo reticularis). Plasma from both patient K. J. and R. were LAC-positive and contained anti-β2GPI (IgG isotype) and anti-prothrombin antibodies (IgG and IgM isotype). Plasma from patient R. was also positive for IgM class anti-β2GPI antibodies. Surfaces—Human fibronectin and fibrinogen (plasminogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin-free; Kordia Life Sciences, Leiden, The Netherlands) were coated on ThermanoxR coverslips (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Human placental collagen type III (Sigma) was solubilized overnight in 50 mmol/liter acetic acid and sprayed onto ThermanoxR coverslips at a density 30 μg/ml with a retouching airbrush (model 100, Badger Brush Co.). For the immunofluorescence studies glass coverslips (18 × 18 mm; Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) were used. After coating and spraying, the coverslips were blocked for at least 30 min at room temperature with 1% human serum albumin (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS). Blood Collection—Freshly drawn venous blood was collected from healthy donors (with informed consent) into 1/10 of volume of 3.2% tri-sodium citrate (w/v). These donors denied taking aspirin or other platelet function inhibitors during the previous 10 days. Perfusate—The chimeric apple-β2GPI proteins or plasma-derived β2GPI were added 5 min before the start of the perfusion at a concentration of 100 μg/ml to whole blood and incubated at 37 °C (5% of the total volume). As a control, buffer (TBS) was added to whole blood. Anti-β2GPI antibodies were added 5 min prior to the perfusion at a concentration of 50 μg/ml to whole blood and incubated at 37 °C. Indomethacin (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 30 μmol/liter and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of chimeric proteins, plasma-derived β2GPI, or anti-β2GPI antibodies. The TxA2 receptor antagonist and thromboxane receptor blocker SQ30741, a kind gift of Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., was added at a concentration of 10 μmol/liter and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of apple-β2GPI proteins, plasma-derived β2GPI. RAP, which inhibits the interaction of ligands with all members of the LDL receptor family, was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before addition of dimeric β2GPI or anti-β2GPI antibodies. Antibody IV.3, which blocks the Fcγ-receptor RII but does not activate the receptor, was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of anti-β2GPI antibodies. Perfusion Studies—Perfusions were performed in a single-pass perfusion chamber under nonpulsatile flow conditions using a modified parallel plate perfusion with a slit width of 2 mm and a slit height of 0.1 mm (40van Zanten H.G. Saelman E.U.M. Schut Hese K.M. Wu Y.P. Slootweg P.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 3862-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with collagen type III as a surface were done with a perfusion time of 90 s, at a shear rate of 800 s–1, which is representing the flow rate in small arteries (41Sixma J.J. De Groot P.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Experiments with fibronectin as a surface were done with a perfusion time of 90 s and a shear rate of 300 s–1, which is representing the flow rate in the aorta and large arteries (41Sixma J.J. De Groot P.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The prewarmed blood (1.5 ml for triplicates and 1 ml for duplicates) was drawn through the perfusion chamber by an infusion pump (pump 22, model 2400-004; Harvard, Natrick, MA). Afterward, the coverslips were taken from the perfusion chamber and rinsed with Hepes-buffered saline (10 mmol/liter Hepes, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, pH 7.4), fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, dehydrated with methanol, and stained with May-Grünwald/Giemsa as described previously (37Houdijk W.P.M. Sakariassen K.S. Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Sixma J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Platelet deposition was evaluated with a light microscope equipped with a JAI-CCD camera (Copenhagen, Denmark) coupled to a Matrox frame grabber (Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Quebec, Canada) using Optimas 6.2 software (Optimas Inc., Seattle, WA) for image analysis. Evaluation for platelet adhesion was performed on 30 fields, perpendicular to the flow direction. Platelet adhesion was expressed as the percentage of the surface covered with platelets relative to adhesion in the presence of buffer. Thrombus size was evaluated using the watershed program provided by the Optimas software package. Evaluation for thrombus size was performed on 20 fields perpendicular to the flow direction. Results are expressed as the percentage of total surface coverage present in a certain thrombus size category. Determination of LAC Activity—Coagulation assays were performed in a KC-10 coagulometer (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). To detect LAC activity, three different coagulation assays were used: an activated partial thromboplastin time-based assay sensitized to detect LAC activity (PTT-LA; Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France), a tissue factor-based assay using innovin (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany), and a dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT; Gradipore Ltd., North Ryde, Australia). All were measured as described previously (36Lutters B.C.H. Meijers J.C.M. Derksen R.H.W.M. Arnout J. De Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3060-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-β2GPI antibodies were added at a concentration of 100 μg/ml to the plasma. This concentration is comparable to 50 μg/ml used in whole blood perfusions. Clotting time ratios were calculated by dividing the clotting time in the presence of antibody by the clotting time in the absence of antibody. Ratios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive. An anti-β2GPI antibody was considered LAC-positive when at least one of the coagulation assays was positive. As shown in Table I, all, but one (1F12), monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibodies we used had LAC activity. Two of the monoclonal antibodies, 2B2 and 22A11, were LAC-positive in three assays, and 27G7 was positive using the tissue factor-based assay and the dRVVT. The other monoclonal anti-β2GPI antibodies, 23H9, 19H9, and 4F3, were only positive in the tissue factor-based assay. The purified patient anti-β2GPI antibodies M. B. and R. were LAC-positive in the PTT-LA and dRVVT, respectively. Anti-β2GPI antibodies from patient K. J. were LAC-negative.Table IEffect of anti-β 2GPI antibodies on coagulation assaysAntibodyInnovinPTT-LAdRVVTLACMB1.071.53aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.04+R1.061.001.72aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.+KJ1.041.061.00-23H91.88aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.191.11+27G71.32aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.161.56aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.+19H91.29aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.191.10+22A111.71aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.33aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.26aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.+2B21.56aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.43aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.45aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.+4F31.50aRatios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive.1.191.12+1F121.001.161.11-a Ratios ≥1.2 were considered to be positive. Open table in a new tab Immunofluoresence Studies—Whole anticoagulated blood was perfused over collagen type III in the presence of different anti-β2GPI antibodies. Binding of these antibodies to platelets was determined as follows. After perfusion, coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.005% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and blocked for 10 min with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4. Afterward coverslips were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:20 in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% glycine, pH 7.4, for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by washing three times with PBS. Finally, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and 0.1% para-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Platelet Isolation—Citrated blood was centrifuged (150 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and the platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with prostaglandin I2 (10 ng/ml; kindly provided by Schering AB, Berlin, Germany) and ACD (2.5 g of tri-sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of d-glucose in 100 ml of distilled water) for acidification to pH 6.5 and centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C). Platelets were resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode (HT) buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, 0.1% (w/v) glucose), pH 6.5. Afterward platelets were centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C) and resuspended in HT buffer, pH 7.4. Platelet count was adjusted to 300,000 platelets/μl, and platelets were used for co-immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitation—500-μl aliquots of washed platelets were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with buffer or 100 μg/ml β2GPI or dimer apple4-C321S-β2GPI. Platelets were incubated with proteins in the presence of 3 mm CaCl2 and 40 μm of the RGD-containing peptide d-arginyl-glycyl-l-aspartyl-l-tryptophan (dRGDW), which was kindly provided by Dr. J. Bouchaudon (Rhône Poulenc Rorer, Chemistry Department, Centre de Recherche de Vitry, Vitry sur Seine, France). Afterward, platelets were stirred (900 rpm) and activated with the ionophore A23187 (10 μm; Roche Applied Science), collagen (Horm, 4 μg/ml; Nycomed Pharma, München, Germany) for 10 min at 37 °C (activated) and lysed with lysis buffer (1:10 (v/v); 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 30 mmol/liter CaCl2 in TBS). Also, non-activated sample platelets were lysed after incubation with dimeric β2GPI. Proteins were precipitated with 0.5 μg/ml of a polyclonal anti-apoER2′ antibody (sc-10112, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitations were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C in a top-over-top rotor, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer (0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8), and boiled for 5 min. As a negative control, lysates of platelets activated with dimeric β2GPI and ionophore A23187 were immunoprecipitated with anti-glycoprotein IIbIIIa antibody 4A7 (1 μg/ml) (42Van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with the antibody for 18 h at 4 °C in a top-over-top rotor, subsequently incubated for 45 min at 22 °C with protein G Sepharose, and washed three times with lysis buffer. Afterward, samples were resuspended in non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The supernatants were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were blocked with TBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) containing 2% (w/v) non-fat dried milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with anti-β2GPI antibody 2B2 (3 μg/ml) was performed overnight in TBST supplemented with 1% protifar. The membranes were washed three times and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:2500; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in the same buffer. Bands on blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. This experiment was performed with three different donors. Statistical Analysis—Perfusions were performed three times in triplicate for each condition when the effects of the chimeric constructs were determined and performed three times in duplicate for each condition when the effects of the anti-β2GPI antibodies were examined. The effect of RAP in the presence of dimeric β2GPI was also performed three times in duplicate. The results are presented as mean ± S.D. from experiments with blood from three different healthy donors. The difference between the various conditions was tested by analysis of variance, and Bonferroni was used as post-test. The results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Effect of Dimers of β 2GPI on Platelet Adhesion to Collagen and Fibronectin—To determine whether apple-β2GPI dimers have an effect on platelet adhesion, we used a flow system with collagen and fibronectin as surfaces at shear rates of 800 and 300 s–1, respectively. Whole blood was incubated with buffer or with 100 μg/ml of plasma-derived β2GPI or apple-β2GPI constructs prior to perfusion. Using collagen as a surface, platelet coverage after 90 s in the presence of buffer was 9.8 ± 2.0%, which was set at 100% (Fig. 1). Addition of plasma-derived β2GPI, monomer apple2-β2GPI, or the non-phospholipid binding dimer apple4-C321S-β2GPI-W316S did not affect coverage. In contrast, in the presence of the LAC-inducing dimers apple4-β2GPI or apple4-C321S-β2GPI, platelet adhesion levels increased to 157 ± 14% (p < 0.001) and 148 ± 25% (p < 0.01), respectively. The morphology of the platelet aggregates on collagen in the presence of apple4-β2GPI and apple4-C321S-β2GPI was different from that with plasma-derived β2GPI (Fig. 2). Analysis of the thrombus size showed that 17 and 28% of the aggregates were larger than 300 μm2 in the presence of apple4-β2GPI and apple4-C321S-β2GPI, respectively. In the presence of plasma-derived β2GPI no increase in thrombus size was found compared with thrombus size found in the presence of buffe"
https://openalex.org/W1980213937,"Fibrillins are the major glycoprotein components of microfibrils that form a template for tropoelastin during elastic fibrillogenesis. We have examined cell adhesion to assembled purified microfibrils, and its molecular basis. Human dermal fibroblasts exhibited Arg-Gly-Asp and cation-dependent adhesion to microfibrils and recombinant fibrillin-1 protein fragments. Strong integrin α5β1 interactions with fibrillin ligands were identified, but integrin αvβ3 also contributed to cell adhesion. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed the presence of abundant α5β1 and some αvβ3 receptors on these cells. Adhesion to microfibrils and to Arg-Gly-Aspcontaining fibrillin-1 protein fragments induced signaling events that led to cell spreading, altered cytoskeletal organization, and enhanced extracellular fibrillin-1 deposition. Differences in cell shape when plated on fibrillin or fibronectin implied substrate-specific α5β1-mediated cellular responses. An Arg-Gly-Asp-independent cell adhesion sequence was also identified within fibrillin-1. Adhesion and spreading of smooth muscle cells on fibrillin ligands was enhanced by antibody-induced β1 integrin activation. A375-SM melanoma cells bound Arg-Gly-Asp-containing fibrillin-1 protein fragments mainly through αvβ3, whereas HT1080 cells used mainly α5β1. This study has shown that fibrillin microfibrils mediate cell adhesion, that α5β1 and αvβ3 are both important but cell-specific fibrillin-1 receptors, and that cellular interactions with fibrillin-1 influence cell behavior.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are multidomain molecules, containing 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and 8-cysteine (TB) modules. Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are both expressed during fetal development, but fibrillin-1 isoform is by far the most abundant isoform in adult tissues (3Quondamatteo F. Reinhardt D.P. Charbonneau N.L. Pophal G. Sakai L.Y. Herken R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The possibility that fibrillins interact with cell receptors was suggested by electron microscopy of vascular and other tissues showing juxtaposition of extracellular microfibrils and cellular dense plaques (5Davis E.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and by the discovery that fibrillins contain the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) putative cell attachment motif (6Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Integrins are αβ heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the ECM, usually through the characteristic RGD motif, and have widespread essential functions in development, tissue organization, and the immune system (7Humphries M.J. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S69-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated cell interactions regulate cell adhesion and migration and initiate signaling pathways that lead to reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and cellular proliferative and secretory responses. Fibrillin-1 contains one RGD sequence in the fourth TB module (6Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Fibrillin-2 contains two RGD sequences, one in the same position as the fibrillin-1 RGD sequence in the fourth TB module and the other in the third TB module where it is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids (8Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Fibrillin-3 also has two RGD sequences, one in the 19th cbEGF repeat and a second in the fourth TB module (9Nagase T. Nakayama M. Nakajima D. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The RGD motifs located in the fourth TB modules are surrounded by polar and charged amino acid residues, suggesting that the motif is solvent-exposed. This RGD tripeptide is located in the middle of a 13- to 20-amino acid sequence that is flanked on both ends by cysteine residues. By analogy with the homologous sixth TB module of fibrillin-1 (10Yuan X. Downing A.K. Knott V. Handford P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6659-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disulfide bonding of these cysteines in the fourth module would produce a finger-like loop structure with the RGD near the end of the loop and available for cellular interactions. The RGD in the third TB motif in fibrillin-2 does not mediate cell adhesion, probably due to its inaccessibility (11Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A cell adhesion role for the RGD motif in the fourth TB module of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 has been described using recombinant fibrillin-1 peptides (12Pfaff M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13D'Arrigo C. Burl S. Withers A.P. Dobson H. Black C. Boxer M. Connect Tissue Res. 1998; 37: 29-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or synthetic fibrillin-1 RGD peptides and fibrillin molecules purified from tissues using a reductive denaturing protocol (11Sakamoto H.

These studies identified the integrin receptor αvβ3 as the major receptor mediating adhesion to these molecular fibrillin-1 ligands. One group found that purified α5β1 integrins, when immobilized to wells, did not bind recombinant fibrillin-1 peptides (12Pfaff M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The β1 integrin subunit bound a recombinant fibrillin-1 TB4 module expressed in bacteria (13D'Arrigo C. Burl S. Withers A.P. Dobson H. Black C. Boxer M. Connect Tissue Res. 1998; 37: 29-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fetal bovine chondrocytes were stimulated to bind fibrillin-1 using α5β1 after antibody activation (11Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In early studies, we showed that isolated fibrillin-rich microfibrils support attachment of vascular smooth muscle cells (14Kielty C.M. Whittaker S.P. Grant M.E. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 445-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the molecular basis of integrin-mediated adhesion to fibrillin microfibrils and molecules using human dermal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and A375-SM melanoma cells. We have demonstrated that α5β1 and αvβ3 are both important receptors for fibrillin ligands, and that RGD-dependent cell adhesion to fibrillin-1 influences cell shape and migration, focal complex formation, signaling, and ECM deposition. We have also identified a cell adhesion site within fibrillin-1 exons 41–52 that mediates cell adhesion in a non-RGD, non-cation, and nonheparan sulfate-dependent manner. These studies have provided new insights into the molecular basis of fibrillin interactions with cells and suggest a key role for microfibrils in regulating cell behavior in connective tissues.

Recombinant Fibrillin-1 Protein Fragments—Recombinant human fibrillin-1 protein fragments PF9 (amino acids 1528–1807), PF10 (amino acids 1689–2126), and PF11 (amino acids 1528–2126) (6Pereira L.

Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified using the mammalian episomal expression system pCEP-pu/AC7 (obtained from Dr. R. Timpl, Munich, Germany) and 293-EBNA cells (Fig. 1A). The pCEP-pu/AC7 vector had been modified by incorporation of N-terminal His6 following the signal peptide, which facilitated rapid peptide purification by nickel chromatography. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to mutate the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in PF9 to RDG. Following sequencing, this mutant (designated RDG PF9) was expressed and purified. The protein fragments were all N-glycosylated, had the correct molecular mass as judged by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, size fractionation on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 columns, and laser light scattering, and they bound calcium, because electrophoretic shifts were apparent following EDTA treatment, as previously shown (19Ashworth J.L.

Fibrillin-1 protein fragments expressed in a similar system are correctly folded (20Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

Microfibril Purification—Native microfibrils to be used as ligands in cell adhesion assays were isolated and purified from aortae of second trimester fetal calves obtained from a local abattoir, using a modification of a well defined methodology (Fig. 1B) (23Kielty C.M. Cummings C. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kielty C.M. Hanssen E. Shuttleworth C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, microfibrils were isolated in the void volume of a Sepharose CL-2B column or a Sephadex G-25 column and then purified using a CsCl density gradient protocol. Fractions were extensively dialyzed into buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm Ca2+) at 4 °C for 18 h. Western slot blots of CsCl fractions, prepared as previously described (24Kielty C.M. Hanssen E. Shuttleworth C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), showed that fibrillin-1 was present in the CsCl density gradient fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 1C). Microfibril purity of these fractions was, in all preparations, confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1D) or by tapping mode atomic force microscopy in air using a Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope IIIa controller at a resonant frequency of 250–300 kHz. Cell Attachment and Spreading Assays—Standard cell attachment assays and cell attachment inhibition assays were performed using microtiter plates (Costar Corp.) according to well defined methodologies (25Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purified microfibrils, recombinant fibrillin-1 protein fragments, and fibronectin adhesion ligands were diluted in column buffer (0.4 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm Ca2+), adsorbed to wells of 96 well microtiter plates, then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The buffer and unbound ligand were aspirated from wells, and nonspecific binding was blocked by the addition of 200 μl/well of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA diluted in 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h. Cell suspensions were prepared by washing the cell layers with trypsin-EDTA and incubating with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA/10-cm2 flask area at 37 °C for no more than 4 min. Resulting cell suspensions were neutralized with 5 volumes of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of warm DMEM/HEPES gassed with 5–10% (v/v) CO2, and cell numbers were calculated using a hemocytometer. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min, and the cell pellets were then resuspended in an appropriate volume of warm DMEM/HEPES (contains Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+) gassed with 5–10% (v/v) CO2 to give a final cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. The cell suspensions were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with the lid off in a 5% CO2 incubator. The BSA-blocking solution was aspirated from the ligand-coated wells, which were then washed with 200 μl of column buffer. To determine cell attachment to adhesion ligands, 100 μl of cells (mixed prior to use by gentle pipetting) was added to the appropriate wells. Alternatively, to examine the effects of an exogenous agent on attachment, 50 μlof2× exogenous agent (antibody, peptide, or heparan sulfate) followed by 50 μlof2× cells were added to the wells. As controls when examining the effect(s) of exogenous agents, 50 μl of column buffer followed by 50 μl of 2× cells were added to control wells. To estimate 100% attachment, cells were initially diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml then further diluted to 20, 50, and 100% of the working cell suspension using warm DMEM/HEPES gassed with 5–10% (v/v) CO2, and 100 μl of cells was added to uncoated, unblocked wells. The microtiter plates were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator with the lid removed. Cells in the wells to be used for determining 100, 50, and 20% cell attachment were fixed by adding 10 μl of 50% (w/v) glutaraldehyde. Non-adherent and loosely attached cells were removed from the other wells by gentle tapping of the plate and aspirating the solution. Attached cells were then fixed by adding 100 μl of 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde per well. The microtiter plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min then washed three times with 200 μl of dH2O. Cells were stained by adding 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in 0.2 m MES, pH 5.0 to each well and incubating the microtiter plates at room temperature for 1 h, then wells were washed once with 200 μl of dH2O, followed by three times with 400 μl of dH2O. The dye was solubilized in 100 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and the absorbance at 570 nm measured on a Dionex MRX II microtiter plate reader. Background crystal violet staining readings were subtracted from all experimental and 100% attachment results. Data from 20, 50, and 100% cell number standards were plotted (A 570 versus cell density) using Microsoft Excel. The slope of the graph was determined from a linear regression, which was then used to express data as percent attachment. In all experiments, triplicate or quadruplicate wells were prepared. To examine the effects of cations on attachment, 50 μl 2x EDTA or PBS containing cations followed by 50 μl 2 x cells resuspended in PBS minus cations (mixed prior to use by gentle pipetting) were added to ligand-coated and control wells after BSA-blocking. To determine cell spreading, the wells of microtiter plates were ligand-coated and BSA-blocked as for cell attachment assays. The cells were trypsinized, quenched, and counted as before, then adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml with warm DMEM/HEPES gassed with 5–10% (v/v) CO2. 100-μl aliquots of cells were added to the appropriate wells. As negative controls cells were added to uncoated, BSA-blocked wells. The plate was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator with the lid removed. The cells were immediately fixed with the addition of 10 μl of 37% formaldehyde directly to the well for 20 min. The formaldehyde was aspirated, and the wells were filled with PBS before layering a glass coverslip onto the plate. The level of cell spreading was determined by phase contrast microscopy. FACS Analysis—Cell suspensions were prepared by washing confluent cultured cell layers with PBS and incubating with 1 ml of 5 mm EDTA in Hanks' buffered saline solution/10-cm2 flask area at 37 °C for no more than 30 min. The resulting cell suspensions were neutralized with 5 volumes of DMEM-5 (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, including 25 mm Hepes, 500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mg/liter pyridoxine) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of supplemented DMEM/HEPES, and the cell density was calculated using a Neubauer hemocytometer. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in an appropriate volume of supplemented DMEM/HEPES to give a final cell density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Cells (50 μl) were added to FACS tubes followed by 50 μl of primary antibody (K20, JBS5, JA218, 12G10, LM609, or mouse IgG control) diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS-2 containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell-antibody mixtures were centrifuged at 800 × g for 4 min, and the cell pellets were washed three times in PBS-2 (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+)) containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-2 containing FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) and 10% (v/v) human serum and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The antibody-cell mixtures were centrifuged at 800 × g for 4 min, and the cell pellets were washed twice in PBS with cations containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum and once with PBS with cations. Cells were fixed by the addition of 100 μl of 2% (v/v) formaldehyde followed by 400 μl of PBS with cations and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells from each sample (20,000 in total) were counted using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) at a flow rate of less than 200 events/s. Immunofluorescence—Double antibody staining was performed on HDF cells plated on fibrillin or fibronectin ligands for up to 6 h. Coated wells were prepared and blocked as outlined under “Cell Attachment and Spreading Assays.” Primary antibodies were a rabbit polyclonal antibody (PF2) to a pepsin fragment of fibrillin-1 kindly supplied by Dr. R. Glanville (Portland, OR) (26Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal antibody to human serum fibronectin (15T4) obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Dorset, UK). Secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated FITC (1:100 dilution) and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated rhodamine (1:100 dilution) was used. Cell cultures were then visualized using a Leica DM RXA microscope fitted with a UV lamp and appropriate filters. Basic image acquisition and analysis were performed using IP Lab version 3.2. Advanced image analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop version 6.0. HDF Attachment and Spreading on Microfibrils—To determine whether assembled native fibrillin-rich microfibrils support HDF adhesion and spreading, microfibrils were immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates and used as ligands in cell attachment and spreading assays (Fig. 2). Linear coating efficiencies within the concentration range 0–20 μg/ml were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and microscopy analysis confirmed that microfibrils readily adhered to the wells. Highest percentage of cell attachment was obtained using a ligand coating concentration of 2 μg/ml, which was then used in all subsequent assays. Fibronectin was used as a positive control and BSA as a negative control. HDF attached strongly to microfibrils (Fig. 2A) and spread well on microfibrils and on fibronectin (Fig. 2, B and C). HDF Attachment and Spreading on Recombinant Fibrillin-1 Protein Fragments—To compare HDF attachment to microfibrils and to molecular fibrillin-1, cell adhesion to three overlapping fibrillin-1 recombinant protein fragments (Fig. 1A), two of which contained the RGD sequence, was examined (Fig. 2). The RGD-containing fibrillin-1 recombinant protein fragments PF9 and PF11 supported strong cell attachment, although slightly lower than microfibrils (Fig. 2A). The non-RGD-containing fragment PF10 also supported some cell adhesion, but this was much lower than PF9 and PF11. The RGD-containing protein fragment PF11 had the highest cell adhesion activity, followed by the RGD-containing protein fragment PF9 and then by peptide PF10. HDF spread rapidly on fibrillin-1 fragments PF9 and PF11 but very little on fragment PF10 (Fig. 2, B and C). HDF Attachment to Fibrillin-1 Ligands Is Divalent Cation- and RGD-dependent—Divalent cations are known to regulate integrin-ligand interactions (25Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To establish whether integrin receptors mediate cell adhesion to fibrillin-1 molecules and microfibrils, divalent cation dependence was assessed. For HDF attachment to microfibrils and RGD-containing protein fragments PF9 and PF11, calcium was unable to support attachment, whereas magnesium and especially manganese strongly enhanced binding (Fig. 3A). Addition of cations had no effect on HDF attachment to PF10 (data not shown). RGD dependence of cell attachment was then examined directly using synthetic peptides to the fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 RGD sequences, and antibodies raised to these peptides. Immunoblotting demonstrated high immunoreactivity of each fibrillin isoform antibody for its own peptide but not for the other fibrillin peptide. HDF attachment to microfibrils was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 RGD antibodies (Fig. 3B) and by synthetic peptides (not shown). HDF attachment to the RGD-containing recombinant fibrillin-1 protein fragments PF9 and PF11 was strongly inhibited by the fibrillin-1 RGD antibody and synthetic peptide but not the corresponding fibrillin-2 RGD reagents (Fig. 3B). The low level of HDF attachment to fibrillin-1 protein fragment PF10 was unaffected by addition of either peptides or antibodies. These studies confirmed that HDF attachment to fibrillin-1 fragments PF9 and PF11 is RGD-dependent and showed that ∼45% of attachment to microfibrils is RGD-dependent with contributions from both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. Integrin Receptors Mediating HDF Attachment to Fibrillin-1 Ligands—TheintegrinreceptorsresponsibleformediatingRGD-dependent cell attachment to microfibrils were identified in cell attachment-inhibition studies (Fig. 4A). Microfibrils immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates were used as ligands in inhibition assays of HDF cell attachment, with antibodies to integrin receptors at final concentrations of 20 μg/ml (αvβ3 (LM609), α5 (JBS5 and mAb16), α2 (JA218), and β1 (mAb13 and K20)). Antibodies JBS5 and mAb 16 (block α5 integrin subunit) both strongly inhibited cell attachment, suggesting that α5β1 integrin mediates HDF attachment to microfibrils. Addition of JBS5 resulted in 84% inhibition of attachment and of mAb16 led to 97% inhibition. mAb 13, which inhibits β1 integrins, inhibited cell attachment by 78%. No inhibition was observed using the K20 anti-β1 antibody, as expected, because this antibody does not block integrin function. A contribution to cell attachment was also shown for αvβ3, because antibody LM609 inhibited cell attachment by 41%. Integrin α2β1 was not involved, because antibody JA218 did not inhibit cell attachment. Antibody dose-response curves confirmed the specific antibody effects and that α5β1 and αvβ3 integrin receptors are responsible for the RGD-mediated HDF attachment to microfibrils (Fig. 4B). Similar cell attachment-inhibition assays using anti-integrin antibodies were conducted with HDF plated on recombinant fibrillin-1 RGD fragments PF9, PF10, and PF11 (Fig. 4, A and B) to establish whether the same integrin receptors bind fibrillin-1 molecules and microfibrils. Neither JA218 nor K20 inhibited attachment to these protein fragments, as shown using microfibril ligands. mAb 16 ca"

We speculated that the small size of these DNA nanoparticles may facilitate gene transfer in postmitotic cells, permitting nuclear uptake across the 25-nm nuclear membrane pore. To determine whether DNA nanoparticles can transfect nondividing cells, growth-arrested neuroblastoma and hepatoma cells were transfected with DNA/liposome mixtures encoding luciferase. In both models, growth-arrested cells were robustly transfected by compacted DNA (6,900–360-fold more than naked DNA). To evaluate mechanisms responsible for enhanced transfection, HuH-7 cells were microinjected with naked or compacted plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cytoplasmic microinjection of DNA nanoparticles generated a ∼10-fold improvement in transgene expression as compared with naked DNA; this enhancement was reversed by the nuclear pore inhibitor, wheat germ agglutinin. To determine the upper size limit for gene transfer, DNA nanoparticles of various sizes were microinjected into the cytoplasm. A marked decrease in transgene expression was observed as the minor ellipsoidal diameter approached 25 nm.

The relative inefficiency of naked DNA, liposome-DNA complexes, and protein- and polymer-based DNA conjugates to transfect nondividing cells productively remains a significant barrier for in vivo gene therapy.Electrostatic interactions between polycationic polymers and DNA can result in conjugates consisting of one or more molecules of DNA and a sufficient number of polycations to produce a nearly charge-neutral complex (29Shapiro J.T.

Based on specific formulation methods, we have developed compacted DNA nanoparticles that consist of one molecule of DNA and 30-mer lysine polymers substituted with polyethylene glycol (PEG); these particles have the minimum possible size for a DNA/polycation conjugate based on the partial specific volumes of the constituent components (33Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 550-554Google Scholar). Due to their small size and neutral charge density, we speculated that DNA nanoparticles might cross the nuclear pore, thereby facilitating gene transfer in nondividing cells.To test this hypothesis, we transferred naked or compacted DNA into cells having intact nuclear membranes. Our results demonstrate that compacted DNA nanoparticles effectively transfect nondividing human cells by traversing the nuclear membrane pore. Since an overwhelming majority of target cells in patients have intact nuclear membranes during the time course of in vivo gene transfer, compacted DNA nanoparticles provide an effective platform for optimizing nonviral gene therapy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—High performance liquid chromatography grade water (W5SK-4) was used to prepare all solutions (Fisher). Most chemicals and reagents, including trypsin type I and TRITC-dextran (average molecular mass 155 kDa), were obtained from Sigma. Femtop tips and etched glass coverslips were obtained from Eppendorf Scientific. Polylysine (CK30) was prepared using an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Polypeptide Laboratories). Trifluoroacetate was the counterion of the polycation. Methoxy-PEG-maleimide (10 kDa) was purchased from Shearwater Polymers. SigmaScan® software was purchased from SPSS. Polystyrene nanosphere size standards were purchased from Duke Scientific Corp.Cell Lines—SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Mark Israel, and HuH-7 human hepatoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. SY5Y and HuH-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium and RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 90 μg/ml penicillin, 90 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly.Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pCESlucSV (6,452 bp) encodes the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene transcriptionally controlled by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early enhancer and elongation factor 1-α promoter and contains the elongation factor 1-α first intron, the RU5 translational enhancer from HTLV I, the SV40 late polyadenylation signal, and the ampicillin resistance gene. Plasmid pKCERegfpSV (4,981 bp) encodes the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene transcriptionally controlled by the CMV immediate early enhancer and elongation factor 1-α promoter and contains the CMV intron A, the RU5 translational enhancer, the SV40 late polyadenylation signal, and the kanamycin resistance gene. pZEGFP2.9 (2,884 bp) was prepared by inserting a blunt-ended 1,636-bp AseI/AflII fragment from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) containing the CMV promoter/enhancer, EGFP, and late SV40 polyadenylation signal into the EcoRV site of pZeo (1,248 bp), which contains the zeomycin resistance gene and the Co1 E1 bacterial DNA replication origin. pZeo was prepared by digesting pEM7/Zeo (Invitrogen) with BspHI and XbaI, followed by treatment with Klenow and self-ligation. pZEGFP5.1 (5,147 bp) and pZEGFP9.9 (9,879 bp) were constructed by inserting the 2,263-bp ScaI fragment or the 6,995-bp StuI fragment of λ DNA into the PmlI site of pZEGFP2.9, respectively. pACYC184EGFPMDV (28 kbp) was prepared by ligating the 1,640-bp AseI/AflII fragment (AflII site filled in with Klenow) from pEGFP-N1 (internal BamHI site previously destroyed by Klenow fill-in) to the 3,970-bp EcoRV/AseI fragment of pACYC184 (New England Biolabs), followed by ligation of a ∼22-kbp BamHI fragment from Marek's disease virus (34Tulman E.R. Afonso C.L. Lu Z. Zsak L. Rock D.L. Kutish G.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7980-7988Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF24348).Preparation of Condensing Peptides—The purity and identity of CK30 peptide was evaluated by high pressure liquid chromatography (>95% pure), mass spectroscopy, and quantitative amino acid analysis. The peptide also was shown to be >90% in monomeric form based on fast protein liquid chromatography Resource S profile as well as a quantitative 4,4′-dithiodipyridine release assay (35Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of 10-kDa methoxy-PEG-maleimide was confirmed by gel filtration analysis, which also indicated a low polydispersity (1.01). Approximately 88% of the PEG molecules contained functional maleimide groups, and impurities as assayed by 1H NMR were 0.30 weight %. CK30PEG10k was prepared by mixing equal molar ratios of CK30 (trifluoroacetate salt at 20–50 mg/ml in 15 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 5 mm EDTA) and M r 10,000 methoxy-PEG-maleimide (based on maleimide reactivity) (in 15 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide) at room temperature overnight. The methoxy-PEG-maleimide was added dropwise over ∼5 min to the CK30 solution mixing on a Vibrax shaker. At pH 7, the reaction of maleimide with sulfhydryls proceeds at a rate 1000 times greater than its reaction with amines (36Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 148Google Scholar). Performance of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine release assays before and after conjugation indicated that essentially 100% of CK30 became PEG-substituted. The reaction mixture was then fractionated on a Sephadex G15 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractions containing peptides based on absorbance at 220 nm were pooled and lyophilized.Formulation of Compacted DNA Nanoparticles—0.9 ml of DNA at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in water was added in 100-μl aliquots to a vortexing solution of 0.1 ml of CK30PEG10k (7.1 mg/ml) in water at room temperature over ∼2 min. The DNA concentration in the final solution was 0.18 mg/ml, and the end point ratio of positive to negative charges (NH3+/PO4- ) was 2:1. The compacted DNA sample was dialyzed in either 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl to remove free CK30PEG10k and unreacted PEG and stored at 4 °C. For liposome transfection experiments, DNA was compacted using the identical protocol but substituting CK30PEG10k with CK30 at a concentration of 3.0 mg/ml. Compacted DNA used in this analysis met or exceeded a series of qualification parameters, including size and shape characteristics as determined from transmission electron micrographs (EMs) and other attributes determined from light scattering, gel, serum stability, and salt stability analyses. EM and static light scattering analysis demonstrated unaggregated electron-dense, ellipsoidal DNA nanoparticles. Gel analysis indicated no detectable free or degraded DNA. Resistance of CK30PEG10k-compacted DNA to nuclease digestion was assayed by incubating complexes in 75% mouse serum (37 °C for 2 h) followed by trypsin digestion (2.5% for 40 min at room temperature) to uncomplex the DNA. Comparison of band intensities of treated and nontreated DNA on gel analysis generates a stability index ratio; >95% of compacted DNA remained intact. Whereas the initial plasmid was >90% supercoiled, DNA released from compacted nanoparticles following trypsin digestion was primarily nicked; control studies indicated that trypsin was not contaminated with residual nuclease activity. Stability of CK30PEG10k-compacted DNA in physiologic saline was assayed by the rapid addition of 5 m NaCl to achieve a final concentration of 150 mm followed by sedimentation of the DNA at 3,400 × g for 1 min at room temperature; the ratio of A 260 of the supernatant divided by the A 260 value of the starting material was 100 ± 10%. For CK30-compacted DNA, liposomes at the indicated concentration below provide stability in saline without precipitation.Dynamic Light Scattering and ζ Potential Analysis—Compacted DNA nanoparticles at a concentration of 1.2–2.1 mg/ml were evaluated using a dynamic light scattering instrument from Particle Sizing Systems, model NICOMP 380 ZLS, using a run time of 30 min. The size was calculated assuming solid particles, and the number-weighted distribution was fit to a Gaussian curve. If the χ2 error determination was >3, then a NICOMP algorithm was employed. The dynamic light scattering measurements were validated using a panel of 50- and 96-nm NIST-traceable latex particles from Duke Scientific. ζ potential measurements were run using the same instrument at a DNA concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for 10 min. Carboxylated latex microspheres from Bangs Laboratories were used to validate the ζ potential measurements.Transmission Electron Microscopy and SigmaScan® Analysis—DNA samples (10 μl) were applied for 2 min to the carbon surface of 400-mesh copper electron microscope grids covered with Formvar and carbon films (Ted Pella) and then inverted over 100-μl water droplets on parafilm for 1 min. The samples were stained with uranyl acetate (0.04% in methanol) for 2 min, and then the grids were dipped in ethanol, blotted, and air-dried. Grids were examined using a JEOL-100C transmission electron microscope, and film plates were exposed to the image at a magnification of × 20,000–40,000. The microscope was calibrated to 87.5 Å using catalase crystals. The major and minor diameters of ellipsoidal condensed DNA particles (n ≅ 100–200 particles/sample) on EM images were automatically collected using SigmaScan® software. Images were calibrated (2.36 nm/pixel) using polystyrene nanosphere size standards (41, 50, 73, and 96 nm). Data are presented as scatter plots of the log of the major versus minor diameters.Lysine Quantitation Using a Fluorescamine Assay and DNA Nano-particle Stoichiometric Analysis—Amino groups in CK30PEG10k were assayed using a fluorometric assay (37Stocks S.J. Jones A.J.M. Ramey C.W. Brooks D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). CK30PEG10k and DNA were mixed at molar positive to negative (NH3+/PO4- ) charge ratios (r) of 0.2–3.0, and free amino groups were assayed in the presence of excess fluorescamine (Sigma). Binding isotherms were evaluated by plotting bound r versus input r. A biphasic process was observed corresponding to polymer association at input r < 1, whereas for r > 1, increments of CK30PEG10k resulted in no additional increase in bound r. The plateau phase of bound r in this binding isotherm was used to determine the stoichiometry of positive to negative charges in fully compacted nanoparticles.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Samples of naked and compacted EGFP plasmids (2.9, 5.1, and 28 kbp) at concentrations of 0.39–0.62 mg/ml as well as polylysine at 0.64 mg/ml were analyzed using a CD spectrophotometer, model 202, from AVIV Instruments, Inc. All measurements were performed at 4 °C in a 0.1-cm cuvette.Growth Arrest Models—SY5Y cells at a concentration of 7 × 105 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 32 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (ICN Pharmaceuticals). Medium was changed once on day 3, at which time neurite development was evident. By days 4–5, the cells were terminally differentiated and had stopped dividing, and these cells were transfected on day 7. Control log phase cells were plated at 1.4 × 106 cells/well on the day before gene transfer. Both growth arrest and log phase cultures were 60–80% confluent on the day of gene transfer. For HuH-7, cells at a concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish were plated on day 0. Cells reached 100% confluence on day 1. Culture medium was changed daily for 2 days, and cells were transfected on day 3. Control log phase cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well the day before gene transfer. At transfection, the cells were 20% confluent.Transfection—Cultured cells were transfected in triplicate with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and either naked or CK30-compacted DNA using the manufacturer's protocol. Each well of SY5Y cells was transfected with 10 μl of Lipofectin and 2 μg of DNA, whereas each well of HuH-7 cells was incubated with 8 μl of Lipofectin and 2 μg of DNA. Transfection reagents in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were applied to cells for 4 h (HuH-7) or 5 h (SY5Y) before changing the medium. For growth-arrested SY5Y cells, the Opti-MEM transfection mixture contained 32 μm all-trans-retinoic acid. Cells were harvested 1, 2, or 3 days after gene transfer for luciferase activity using a kit from Promega. Chemiluminescence was monitored for 10 s using a Wallac Berthold model LB 9507 luminometer. Protein content in cell lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad DC method. Data are expressed as relative light units/μg of protein.DNA Microinjection—All DNA samples were blinded prior to microinjection, cells were scored for EGFP expression, and the data were locked before releasing the blind. One day before microinjection, 400,000 HuH-7 cells were plated on an etched glass coverslip in a 35-mm tissue culture dish. Microinjections were performed using the Eppendorf Transjector 5246 and Micromanipulator 5171 Systems mounted on a Zeiss inverted microscope. Nuclear or cytoplasmic injections were performed using a Z (depth) limit option, a 0.3-s injection time, and an injection pressure of 60–100 hectopascals. The average injection volume was estimated to be 565 ± 86 (S.E.) fl based on transfer of purified luciferase enzyme into cell lysates from HuH-7 cells. Naked or CK30PEG10k-compacted DNA complexes were diluted at a final concentration ranging from 0.2 to 100 μg/ml in an injection solution composed of 5% glucose and 0.5% TRITC-dextran (average molecular mass of 155 kDa). High M r dextran was excluded from the nucleus following a cytoplasmic injection and was coinjected with DNA to identify those cells having an intact nuclear membrane over the time course of observation. After microinjection, cells were washed gently and placed in fresh culture medium. HuH-7 cells strongly attached to the dish, and ∼60–80% of cells survived microinjection. At variable times after microinjection, transmitted light and red/green fluorescent images were collected using a cooled CCD camera controlled by IPLab software. Registration, merge, and arrangement of cell images were automatically preformed by IPLab and Adobe Photoshop programs. For cytoplasmic microinjections, transgene expression was reported as the percentage of EGFP-positive (green) cells in the population of cells that had an exclusively cytoplasmic localization of TRITC-dextran; in this fashion, cells unintentionally microinjected into the nucleus and cells that divided were excluded from analysis. For nuclear microinjections, transgene expression was reported as the percentage of green cells in the population of cells that had nuclear localization of TRITC-dextran. All DNA microinjection studies were performed three times using newly formulated batches of compacted DNA for each experiment. For cytoplasmic or nuclear microinjections, typically 150–500 or 60–200 cells, respectively, were counted for each condition evaluated in a single experiment.Statistical Analysis—Transfection results are expressed as mean ± S.D. For microinjection studies, results are presented as mean ± S.E. An unpaired, two-tailed t test was used to evaluate differences in levels of gene expression following cellular microinjections. Prior to statistical analysis, microinjection data were transformed to a Gaussian distribution using the formula arcsin(√x), as is appropriate for primary data tabulated as a quotient (38Armitage P. Berry G. Mathews J.N.S. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. Blackwell Science Ltd., Oxford2002: 306-311Google Scholar). For Fig. 2, nontransformed data were fit to a modified exponential association curve, and the observed rate constants were compared using an unpaired, two-tailed t test.RESULTSTransfection of Growth-arrested Human CellsTo determine whether compacted DNA nanoparticles could transfect nondividing cells, we terminally differentiated human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells by exposing them to 32 μm all-trans-retinoic acid for 6 days. All-trans-retinoic acid induces neuronal differentiation of these cells (39Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar), and growth arrest occurs by day 4–5; at least 90% of the cells were in G1/G0 as monitored by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell scanning analysis (data not shown). Log phase and growth-arrested SY5Y cells were transfected with liposome mixtures of either naked or compacted DNA encoding luciferase, and transgene activity was monitored for 3 days after transfection. EM images of liposome/naked DNA mixtures yielded a typical matrix of thin fibers (Fig. 1A). Liposome/compacted DNA generated ellipsoidal electron-dense structures in a bimodal distribution (Fig. 1B); some were essentially identical in size to compacted DNA alone (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas others appeared to be small aggregates of compacted DNA. Log phase SY5Y cells were efficiently transfected by both DNA preparations, with compacted DNA generating a 6–9-fold improvement in luciferase activity on days 1–3 after gene transfer (Fig. 1E). However, liposome mixtures containing naked DNA were not able to productively transfect postmitotic SY5Y cells, with marginal activity noted on each day. In marked contrast, liposome/compacted DNA mixtures were able to robustly transfect growth-arrested SY5Y cells. The ratio of luciferase activities comparing compacted versus naked DNA preparations was 6,900-fold on day 1.Fig. 1Compacted DNA can robustly transfect nondividing cells. A, electron micrograph of preparation of Lipofectin and naked pCESlucSV DNA in Opti-MEM. Note the extended size and complex structure of this matrix of DNA and liposomes. Bar, 200 nm. B, electron micrograph of mixture of Lipofectin and CK30-compacted pCESlucSV DNA in Opti-MEM. Electron-dense particles are evident without the complex matrix of densities noted with naked DNA/liposome mixtures. A bimodal distribution of particle sizes is observed; unimolecularly condensed DNA nanoparticles are apparent (thin arrows), whereas larger particles may be aggregates of nanoparticles (thick arrows). Bar, 100 nm. C, electron micrograph of CK30-compacted pCESlucSV DNA in water. A homogeneous population of unimolecularly condensed ellipsoidal DNA nanoparticles is observed. Bar, 100 nm. D, electron micrograph of CK30PEG10k-compacted pKCERegfpSV DNA in 150 mm NaCl. Note the homogeneous population of unaggregated electron-dense nanoparticles comparable in volume with those shown in C, although PEG substitution of CK30 results in a higher proportion of rodlike forms. These PEG-substituted nanoparticles retain essentially identical size and shape regardless of whether they are resuspended in water, 5% glucose, saline, or Opti-MEM/Lipofectin mixtures. Bar, 100 nm. E, transfection of log phase and growth-arrested SY5Y cells. Cells were growth-arrested by cultivating them for 6 days in 32 μm all-trans-retinoic acid. Log phase and growth-arrested cells were transfected using Lipofectin mixtures consisting of 2 μg of either naked or CK30-compacted pCESlucSV DNA, and luciferase activity was monitored over the next 3 days. Data are presented as relative light units (RLU)/μg of protein and are representative of over 30 separate transfection studies performed using multiple batches of compacted DNA. F, transfection of log phase and contact-inhibited cultures of HuH-7 cells with mixtures of Lipofectin and either naked or CK30-compacted pCESlucSV DNA. Cells were harvested 1 day after gene transfer. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2109989065,"Experimental conditions that simulate the crowded bacterial cytoplasmic environment have been used to study the assembly of the essential cell division protein FtsZ from Escherichia coli. In solutions containing a suitable concentration of physiological osmolytes, macromolecular crowding promotes the GTP-dependent assembly of FtsZ into dynamic two-dimensional polymers that disassemble upon GTP depletion. Atomic force microscopy reveals that these FtsZ polymers adopt the shape of ribbons that are one subunit thick. When compared with the FtsZ filaments observed in vitro in the absence of crowding, the ribbons show a lag in the GTPase activity and a decrease in the GTPase rate and in the rate of GTP exchange within the polymer. We propose that, in the crowded bacterial cytoplasm under assembly-promoting conditions, the FtsZ filaments tend to align forming dynamic ribbon polymers. In vivo these ribbons would fit into the Z-ring even in the absence of other interactions. Therefore, the presence of mechanisms to prevent the spontaneous assembly of the Z-ring in non-dividing cells must be invoked.

Therefore, the presence of mechanisms to prevent the spontaneous assembly of the Z-ring in non-dividing cells must be invoked. The FtsZ protein is conserved in most of the prokaryotic organisms and several organelles and plays a central role in microbial and organelle division forming a ring at the division site (1Bi E.

It is assumed that FtsZ association and assembly reactions studied in vitro should play an important role in bacterial cell division in vivo, but the correlation between these in vivo and in vitro processes is not known. Moreover the assay conditions used in vitro differ substantially from the bacterial cytoplasm where FtsZ is located and functions. Most of the experimental work performed in vitro is done under solution conditions in which the total concentration of macromolecules is low (1 or less), whereas the estimated concentration of proteins and nucleic acids in the highly volume-occupied (“crowded”) bacterial interior is on the order of 300–400 g/liter (18Record Jr., T.M. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Excluded volume effects in macromolecular crowded environments have significant consequences on the energetics and dynamics of functional assembly processes (20Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 21Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Macromolecular crowding has been described to favor several assembly processes of actin and tubulin, such as the rate and extent of polymerization and their organization into more complex structures (22Herzog W. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki A. Yamazaki M. Ito T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6513-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Lindner R.A. Ralston G.B. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 66: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of FtsZ, it has been previously shown that crowding facilitates the formation of magnesium-dependent GDP-FtsZ oligomers (25Rivas G. Fernández J.A. Minton A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3150-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effects of macromolecular crowding upon the more complex and physiologically relevant FtsZ assembly processes taking place in the presence of GTP, which is the most abundant form of the nucleotide in the cell. By means of analytical centrifugation, light scattering, optical, electron, and atomic force microscopy and assays of biochemical activity performed in solutions containing a suitable content of the main physiological osmolytes (see “Materials and Methods” (18Record Jr., T.M. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)), we have found that high concentrations of unrelated macromolecules, resembling the crowded Escherichia coli cytoplasm, favor the formation of two-dimensional FtsZ polymer arrays (ribbons). This self-organization process, which is GTP-dependent, retards significantly the FtsZ GTPase activity, the polymer assembly/disassembly dynamics, and the nucleotide exchange within the polymer, when compared with the same parameters measured in the FtsZ filaments formed in dilute solutions. We conclude that in the bacterial interior FtsZ may tend to spontaneously arrange into one-subunit-thick ribbons and suggest, that in the non-dividing cell, their formation must be modulated by other mechanisms that regulate Z-ring assembly. Reagents—Guanine nucleotides, GDP and GTP, were from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The nucleotide analog GMPCPP, 1The abbreviations used are: GMPCPP, guanosine-5′-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate; AFM, atomic force microscopy; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. which hydrolyzes more slowly than GTP, was purchased from Jena Bioscience. Fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) was from Molecular Probes Inc. Other analytical grade chemicals were from Merck or Sigma. Macromolecular crowders (dextran T70 and Ficoll 70, both with average molar weights of 70,000) were obtained commercially from Amersham Biosciences. They were used without further purification after extensive dialysis against the corresponding working buffer. The final concentration of the equilibrated stock solutions of crowder was determined refractometrically using 0.134 and 0.140 ml g–1 as the specific refractive index increments at 620 nm of Ficoll and dextran, respectively (26Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 63rd ed. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982Google Scholar). Protein Purification—E. coli FtsZ was purified by the calcium-induced precipitation method following the procedure described previously (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce), with spectrophotometrically calibrated FtsZ standards (see Ref. 8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been carried out in chloride-containing buffers at potassium concentrations that are at the lower end or below the physiological range of this cation. Moreover, many of these studies have been done at slightly acidic pH (6.5). These buffers do not mimic the main intracellular ionic environment of the bacterial interior. For example, chloride is present only at very low concentration in the cytoplasm of E. coli. At moderate to high external osmolarities, potassium (ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 m) and glutamate (from 0.03 to 0.2 m) ions are concentrated in the cytoplasm of E. coli to prevent dehydration and maintain turgor pressure (18Record Jr., T.M. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been reported that several of these physiological osmolytes (i.e. glutamate) are modulators of non-covalent DNA-protein interactions in vitro (18Record Jr., T.M. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, most of the experiments described in this work were done in KGA buffer (25 mm Hepes/acetate, pH 7.4, plus 100 mm potassium glutamate, 300 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm magnesium acetate), which contains the major osmolyte species present in bacterial cytoplasm, supplemented with guanine nucleotides as noted. This buffer with a high potassium content, which increases the intrinsic GTPase activity of E. coli FtsZ and therefore the rate of disassembly of FtsZ filaments (for a recent review see Ref. 28Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 25254: 1-5Google Scholar), makes it difficult to get stable FtsZ polymers during the time-scale (>10 min) of most of the experiments performed in this work (mainly those done in the absence of crowding agents, see below). In these experiments the GTP was regenerated by adding to the solution an enzymatic regeneration system (1 unit/ml acetate kinase plus 15 mm acetyl phosphate, both from Sigma), as adapted from tubulin/microtubules studies (30Purich D.L. Terry B.J. MacNeal R.K. Karr T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Under these conditions FtsZ polymers were stable in solution during at least 1 h at 30 °C (at 1 g/liter FtsZ). Higher acetyl phosphate concentrations (>50 mm) interfered with FtsZ filament formation (three-dimensional polymer bundles are favored; see AFM results) and with negative staining electron microscopy. Alternatively, in some experiments GTP was replaced by GMPCPP, a GTP analog more slowly hydrolyzable (15Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). FITC Labeling of FtsZ—The labeling of FtsZ with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was carried out as follows. FtsZ (4–6 g/liter) was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 8.0, buffer with 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. To minimize perturbations on FtsZ association/assembly properties due to the labeling, the protein was previously polymerized at 30 °C upon addition of 20 mm calcium and 2 mm GTP (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To this preparation a 40-fold excess of FITC was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The precipitate was resuspended in cold in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, buffer with 100 mm KCl, and the free FITC was removed by gel filtration. The precipitation of FtsZ was reversible, and the degree of labeling was 0.9 ± 0.2 mol of FITC per mol of FtsZ. Analytical Centrifugation—The sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments in the presence of low concentrations of nucleotide (<0.1 mm) were performed in a Beckman XL-A (Beckman-Coulter) essentially as described in a previous study (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by least-squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the ls-g*(s) method (31Schuck P. Rosmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) as implemented in the SEDFIT program. FtsZ Assembly in the Absence of Macromolecular Crowders: 90° Scattering and High Speed Centrifugation Assays—The formation of FtsZ polymers in the absence of crowding agents was followed by light scattering at 90° (14Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm, with slit widths of 0.5 nm (excitation) and 1 nm (emission). All reactions were performed at 30 °C. FtsZ (0.1–1.0 g/liter) was incubated in KGA buffer (with or without an enzymatic GTP-regenerating system) in a fluorometer cuvette. After 5 min of equilibration, 1 mm GTP (or 0.1 mm GMPCPP) was added, and the reactions were monitored. The formation of FtsZ filaments was also followed by high speed centrifugation during 15 min at 240,000 × g and 30 °C using the TLA100 rotor in an Optima MAX tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.). FtsZ Assembly in the Presence of Macromolecular Crowders: Low Speed Centrifugation, 90° Scattering, and Turbidity Assays—The relatively low viscosity and density of Ficoll 70 (32Wenner J.R. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3234-3241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which reduces the apparent sedimentation coefficients of FtsZ species by a factor of five in 200 g/liter Ficoll 70 solutions, permits the use of a low speed sedimentation method to assay the formation of FtsZ ribbon polymers in the presence of this crowder agent. 100 μl of a given concentration of FtsZ were centrifuged at low speed (25,000 × g for 10 min at 30 °C) using the TLA100 rotor in an Optima MAX ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.). The entire supernatant and the pellet were carefully removed, and the protein content was measured in both fractions as well as in the original samples (controls). The supernatant fraction only contains soluble protein and filaments but no ribbons as judged by electron microscopy; the pellet contained mainly the FtsZ ribbons. Control assembly experiments in the absence of crowders showed that under these sedimentation conditions >95% of FtsZ filaments were recovered in the soluble fraction. Therefore this assay discriminates between filaments and ribbons in a quantitative manner. The crowding-induced FtsZ ribbons were also monitored by two scattering assays: 90° light scattering (as described above), which detected both the FtsZ filaments and ribbon polymers, and turbidity (33Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 47-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in an Ultrospec 3000pro UV-visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). The latter is also a specific method for monitoring FtsZ ribbons (because of their size) in the presence of macromolecular crowders, but it does not detect the assembly/disassembly of FtsZ filaments (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—The FtsZ polymers (protein concentration ranging from 0.05 to 1 g/liter), in the absence or in the presence of high concentrations of macromolecular crowders (dextran T70 or Ficoll 70), were visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate, using either a JEOL-1200 or a LEO 910 electron microscope. Atomic Force Microscopy—AFM images were taken with an Atomic Force Microscope (Nonatec Electrónica, Madrid, Spain) operated in the jump mode (34Moreno-Herrero F. de Pablo P.J. Fernández-Sánchez R. Colchero J. Gómez-Herrero A. Baró A. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 2620-2622Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The scanning piezo measurement was calibrated using silicon calibrating gratings. Silicon nitride tips (DI instruments) with constant force of 0.2 N7M were used. A drop of the solution with the FtsZ polymers (formed upon addition of 0.1 mm GMPCPP to the protein in KGA buffer with 100–200 g/liter Ficoll) was incubated over freshly cleaved circular pieces of mica glued onto a Teflon surface, and, after a few minutes, the samples were extensively washed with working buffer and allowed to dry for 15 min under a stream of air. Optical Microscopy—The FtsZ samples labeled with the fluorescent dye FITC were placed directly onto a glass slide, and the polymers were visualized using a Zeiss Axioscope epifluorescence microscope equipped with the FITC filter set and 40×/63×/100× oil immersion objectives. Images were captured with a Photometrics charge-coupled device camera. Other Analytical Procedures—The total nucleotide content of the protein preparations was measured spectrophotometrically after protein extraction with perchloric acid (8Rivas G. López A.

Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Specific nucleotides were measured by means of ionic-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (35Díaz J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The GTPase turnover rate was determined by measuring released inorganic phosphate using the malachite green-molybdate reagent (36Hoenig M. Lee R.J. Ferguson D.C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The incorporation of GTP into FtsZ polymers was measured by a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay using [γ-32P]GTP, as described in a previous study (13Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FtsZ in Its GDP-bound State in Physiological Buffer Has a Weak Tendency to Oligomerize—We have studied the influence of physiological concentrations of osmolytes present in the E. coli cytoplasm (KGA buffer; see “Materials and Methods”) on the magnesium-induced oligomerization of E. coli GDP-FtsZ. In a previous study, the behavior of GDP-FtsZ in a Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl buffer was best described by a Mg2+-linked indefinite self-association of FtsZ monomers, with a weakening of the monomer-monomer interaction upon increasing ionic strength (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (sedimentation equilibrium and velocity) were carried out in the presence of GDP. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the state of association of FtsZ in KGA buffer upon protein concentration. The results indicate that the predominant species over the concentration range studied (0.1–2.5 g/liter) has an average size corresponding to an FtsZ dimer, with a trend to form monomer and higher oligomers at, respectively, decreasing or increasing protein concentrations. In the inset of Fig. 1 the sedimentation velocity ls-g*(s) distribution of FtsZ (1 g/liter) in KGA buffer is plotted. This sedimentation coefficient distribution corresponds to a symmetrical peak with an average sedimentation coefficient of 5.2 S, which is compatible with an average FtsZ dimer (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with a previous report showing that, over a broad range of protein concentrations, increasing the ionic strength from 50 to 500 mm KCl lowers the average molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of GDP-FtsZ (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The weak dependence upon protein concentration of the FtsZ self-association in KGA buffer precludes a complete quantitative analysis. The isodesmic association that previously best described the formation of FtsZ oligomers from monomers (dashed line in Fig. 1; see Ref. 8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) may also apply in the present work (performed in KGA buffer) but with a much weaker association constant (dotted line in Fig. 1). We conclude that in solutions that reproduce the main intracellular osmolarity, FtsZ in its GDP-bound state has a weak tendency to form high order oligomers. FtsZ in the Presence of GTP in Physiological Buffer Assembles into Dynamic Filaments—At 30 °C in KGA buffer FtsZ polymers formed quickly upon addition of 1 mm GTP as monitored by 90° light scattering (Fig. 2A). Under the same conditions addition of GDP failed to induce polymerization (Fig. 2A). Given the high concentration of potassium ions in the buffer the GTPase activity of FtsZ is activated, causing the FtsZ polymers to rapidly disassemble following GTP consumption, as reported in other publications (8Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol.

To overcome the polymer instability, when needed, an enzymatic GTP-regenerating system was added to the preparations (see “Materials and Methods”). Under these conditions, the polymers at 1 g/liter protein were stable for 1 h (Fig. 2A) and could be visualized in electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations as filaments of variable length and curvature with a thickness of 5–6 nm (Fig. 3, top row, center). FtsZ filaments with a thickness of 6–8 nm were also found upon incubation of the protein with GMPCPP, an analog of GTP that is hydrolyzed by FtsZ much more slowly than GTP (not shown).Fig. 3Electron microscopy analysis of FtsZ assembly in the absence and in the presence of macromolecular crowders. Top row, left-hand side: electron micrograph of negative stained FtsZ (1.0 g/liter) samples in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer (which does not contain potassium and does not promote FtsZ assembly, see Ref. 13Mingorance J.

Filament formation depended on the concentration of FtsZ showing an apparent critical concentration for filament formation (C fil) of 0.05 ± 0.01 g/liter (1.25 μm, Fig. 2B). Similar samples were analyzed by 90° light scattering resulting in a very similar value for C fil (0.04 ± 0.01 g/liter; Fig. 2C, closed squares). Light scattering analysis were also performed in the absence of the GTP-regenerating system, and the C fil value determined using the initial scattering increments was practically identical to that obtained in the presence of the GTP-regenerating system (Fig. 2C, open squares). The experimental value found for C fil when GTP was replaced by GMPCPP was slightly lower (0.03 ± 0.01 g/liter; Fig. 2C, closed triangles). These results indicate that FtsZ filament formation occurs in a cooperative fashion (33Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 47-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The functioning of a cooperative mechanism of FtsZ polymerization has been proposed as well by others (14Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J.

In contrast, in the presence of GDP most of the FtsZ protein (over 98%) was recovered in the soluble fraction as would be expected if the dimer were the most abundant form of the GDP-bound FtsZ in solution (see above, Fig. 1). Macromolecular Crowding Favors the GTP-dependent Formation of Dynamic FtsZ Polymers—The bacterial cytoplasm is a highly crowded environment, a condition that has not been analyzed when studying the formation of FtsZ filaments. To approximate the intracellular conditions we have studied the polymerization of FtsZ in the presence of high concentrations of inert macromolecular crowders (Ficoll or dextran, both with an average molar weight of 70,000, see “Materials and Methods”), as has been used for the study of other systems (20Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-6"

Although ExoT RhoGAP stimulates actin reorganization through the inactivation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, the function of the ADP-ribosylation domain is unknown. The present study characterized the mammalian proteins that are ADP-ribosylated by ExoT, using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. ExoT ADP-ribosylated two cytosolic proteins in cell lysates upon type III delivery into cultured HeLa cells. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis identified the two proteins as Crk-I and Crk-II that are Src homology 2-3 domains containing adaptor proteins, which mediate signal pathways involving focal adhesion and phagocytosis. ExoT ADP-ribosylated recombinant Crk-I at a rate similar to the ADP-ribosylation of soybean trypsin inhibitor by ExoS. ExoS did not ADP-ribosylate Crk-I.

The reconstituted purified protein is highly active in ornithinecitrulline exchange and is somewhat less active in unidirectional transport of ornithine. It transports lysine and arginine also but does not transport histidine. The positive charges of ornithine and lysine are compensated by cotransport of a proton with citrulline in exchange. Its affinity for ornithine is lower than for other substrates, and under saturating internal concentrations it is not dependent on the nature of the counter-substrate. The exchange reaction operates by a simultaneous (sequential) mechanism, and the unidirectional transport of ornithine or lysine (but not of citrulline) is compensated by a proton. The exchange of cytosolic ornithine for matrix citrulline is part of the urea cycle (1Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Eur. J.

Genet. 1999; 22: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was identified by homology with the yeast sequence, and its function as an ORC was inferred from its ability to complement the defect of HHH fibroblasts by incorporating radioactive ornithine into cellular protein. The HHH phenotype is milder than those associated with a deficiency of an enzyme in the urea cycle, and it has been suggested that carriers with other functions can compensate for the defective protein by transporting ornithine (8Camacho J.A. Obie C. Biery B. Goodman B.K. Hu C.A. Almashanu S. Steel G. Casey R. Lambert M. Mitchell G.A. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As described below, the human and mouse genomes contain a spliced pseudogene that in man encodes a second isoform, ORC2 (9Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.-F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The isoforms are expressed differently in various human tissues. Both were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified proteins were reconstituted into liposomes, and their transport properties were characterized. The recombinant proteins have different substrate specificities, transport affinities (Km), and specific activities (V max). Five independent mutations associated with HHH were introduced singly into the isoform ORC1. They affected its transport properties severely. In the same patients with HHH, ORC2 is unaffected, and therefore, it is likely that it compensates for defective ORC1. Sequence Search and Analysis—Data bases were screened with the sequence of ORC1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF112968, gene name SLC25A15) with BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). Construction of Expression Plasmids—The coding sequences for ORC1 and -2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF332005, gene name SLC25A2) were amplified from human liver cDNA by PCR. Total RNA populations extracted from the fibroblasts of patients with HHH were reverse transcribed, and the coding sequences for ORC1 mutants were amplified by PCR with the aid of a GeneAmp® RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The cDNA for ORC2 was amplified from the same six samples. The mutant forms of ORC1 corresponded to 7 alleles from 6 HHH patients (10Salvi S. Santorelli F.M. Bertini E. Boldrini R. Meli C. Donati A. Burlina A.B. Rizzo C. Di Capua M. Fariello G. Dionisi-Vici C. Neurology. 2001; 57: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Salvi S. Dionisi-Vici C. Bertini E. Verardo M. Santorelli F.M. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 18: 460Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Five of them were homozygous for the mutations G27R, R275Q, R179X, C861insG, and IVS5+1g→a, and the other one was heterozygous for G190D and F188Δ. The recommended nomenclature for human gene mutations is that the adenosine of the first AUG codon of the mRNA from the SLC25A15 gene (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_014252) is taken as nucleotide 1, and the corresponding methionine is taken as residue 1 of the protein. The oligonucleotide primers corresponded to the extremities of the coding sequences of ORC1 and -2 with additional NdeI and HindIII sites. The amplified products were cloned into the pRUN expression vector, which is derived from pKN172 (12Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and the constructs were transformed into E. coli TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on 2× TY (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4) plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and were screened by direct colony PCR and restriction digestion of plasmids. Expression Analysis by Real Time PCR—Total RNAs from human tissues (Invitrogen) were reverse transcribed with the GeneAmp® RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers as primers. Primers and probes, based on the ORC1 and -2 cDNA sequences, were designed for real time PCRs with Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for ORC1 corresponded to nt 351–373 and 392–415, respectively, and those for ORC2 corresponded to nt 725–746 and 784–812, respectively. The ORC1 FAM/MGB- and the ORC2 VIC/MGB-Dark Quencher-labeled probes corresponded to nt 374–389 and 755–775 of the ORC1 and -2 cDNA sequences, respectively. Real time PCRs were performed in a MicroAmp® optical 96-well plate using the automated ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained template (reverse transcribed first-stranded cDNA, 5 μl), 1× TaqMan Universal Master mix (Applied Biosystems), 200 nm probe for ORC1 or -2, and 900 nm each primer. To correct for differences in the amount of starting first-stranded cDNAs, the human β-actin gene was amplified in parallel as a reference endogenous housekeeping gene. The relative quantification of the two isoforms was performed according to the comparative method (2–ΔΔCt) (Ref. 13Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar and Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2 P/N 4303859), with the heart ΔCt for ORC1 and the spleen ΔCt for ORC2 as the internal calibrator. 2–ΔΔCt equals 2–(ΔCt sample–ΔCt calibrator), where ΔCt sample is Ct sample – Ct reference gene and Ct is the threshold cycle, i.e. the PCR cycle number at which emitted fluorescence exceeds 10× standard deviation of baseline emissions. Bacterial Expression and Purification of ORC1, ORC2, and Mutated Forms of ORC1—ORC1 and its mutated forms as well as ORC2 were overexpressed as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli as described before (12Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), except that the host cells were E. coli CO214(DE3) (14Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V.

Control cultures with the empty vector were processed in parallel. Inclusion bodies were purified on a sucrose density gradient (12Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and were washed at 4 °C, first with TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5), then twice with a buffer containing Triton X-114 (3%, w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES pH 7.2, and finally with TE buffer. The proteins were solubilized in 1.8% sarkosyl (w/v). Small residues were removed by centrifugation (258,000 × g for 1 h). Reconstitution into Liposomes—Recombinant proteins in sarkosyl were reconstituted into liposomes in the presence or absence of substrates (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reconstitution mixture contained solubilized proteins (150 μl with 1–1.2 μg of protein), 10% Triton X-114 (70 μl), 10% phospholipids as sonicated liposomes (80 μl), 20 mm ornithine (except where indicated otherwise), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, cardiolipin (0.8 mg, Sigma), and water to a final volume of 700 μl. These components were mixed thoroughly, and the mixture was recycled 13 times through the same Amberlite column (Bio-Rad). Transport Assays—External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on columns of Sephadex G-75, which was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Transport at 25 °C was started by adding l-[3H] ornithine, l-[3H]lysine, l-[3H]arginine, l-[14C]histidine, or l-[14C]citrulline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (exchange) or to empty proteoliposomes (unidirectional transport). In both cases, transport was terminated by addition of 15 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (the “inhibitor-stop” method) (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In controls, the inhibitor was added at the beginning with the radioactive substrate. All transport measurements were carried out at the same internal and external pH value of 7.2. Finally, the external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values, and the transport activities were calculated by taking into account the efficiency of reconstitution (i.e. the yield of successfully incorporated protein). The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes in 2 min (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). Alternatively, the initial transport rate was calculated from the time course of isotope equilibration (16Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reconstituted proteins were assayed for other exchange activities by the inhibitor-stop method. Other Methods—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained ith Coomassie Blue dye. N-terminal sequencing was carried out as described before (17Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The amount of ORC1 and -2 was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples using carbonic anhydrase as the protein standard (17Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The amount of protein incorporated into liposomes was measured as described previously (17Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It varied between 24 and 32% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture. Identification of Human Isoform ORC2—By screening data bases with the sequence of ORC1, an intron-less gene interrupting the human protocadherin gene cluster (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF332005, Ref. 9Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.-F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) was found to encode a protein 301 amino acids long that is 87% identical in sequence to ORC1. This protein is isoform ORC2. Expression of the mRNAs for Human ORC1 and -2 in Various Tissues—The tissue distribution of mRNAs for isoforms ORC1 and -2 is summarized in Fig. 1. In all of these tissues, the ORC1 mRNA was expressed at higher levels than the ORC2 mRNA. The amount of the ORC1 mRNA in heart is about the same as that of the ORC2 mRNA in spleen, and as such this value served as an internal calibration in the relative quantification of the isoforms in various tissues. The ORC1 mRNA was expressed most strongly in liver, pancreas, testis, lung, and small intestine, and lower levels were detected in spleen, kidney, brain, and heart. The ORC2 mRNA was expressed in reasonable abundance in liver, testis, spleen, lung, pancreas, and small intestine and expressed poorly in other tissues. The ratio of ORC1 mRNA to ORC2 mRNA was 41 in brain, 93 in heart, 81 in kidney, 33 in liver, 65 in lung, 161 in pancreas, 38 in small intestine, 9.2 in spleen, and 18 in testis. However, because of the possibility of the operation of post-transcriptional mechanisms, these levels do not necessarily reflect the ratios of transport activities. Bacterial Overexpression of ORC1 and -2—Both isoforms were expressed at high levels in E. coli C0214(DE3) (see Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), and about 70 mg of purified proteins were obtained per liter of culture. The proteins were not detected either in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (lanes 1–3) or in control (with only vector) cells harvested after the induction (lane 4). Purified ORC1 and -2 (see Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8) had apparent molecular masses of 31.5 and 31.0 kDa, respectively. The calculated values, including the initiator methionine, are 32714 and 32558 Da, respectively. All of the purified ORC1 mutant proteins gave single bands on SDS-PAGE. Their apparent molecular masses were 31.5 kDa for mutants G27R (Fig. 2, lane 9), G190D, R275Q, and F188Δ (data not shown), 26.0 kDa for mutant IVS5+1g→a (Fig. 2, lane 10), 30.5 kDa for mutant c861insG (Fig. 2, lane 11), and 21.5 kDa for mutant R179X (Fig. 2, lane 12). The identities of all proteins were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Transport Properties of Recombinant ORC1 and -2—In homo-exchange assays (same substrate inside and outside at external and internal concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively), reconstituted ORC1 and -2 both catalyzed a [3H]ornithine-ornithine exchange that was inhibitable by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. They did not catalyze homo-exchanges for ADP, alanine, aspartate, ATP, carnitine, choline, citrate, glutamate, glutathione, malate, malonate, oxoglutarate, phosphate, proline, pyruvate, spermine, threonine, and valine. Control proteoliposomes made with boiled samples of ORC1 and -2 and with sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking expression vectors for ORC1 and -2 or harvested immediately before induction of expression had no [3H]ornithineornithine exchange activity. The kinetics of uptake into proteoliposomes of 1 mm [3H]ornithine measured in the presence (exchange) or absence (unidirectional transport) of 10 mm internal ornithine are compared in Fig. 3. In both modes, isotopic equilibrium was approached exponentially in accord with transport by first-order kinetics. The ratio of maximal substrate uptake by exchange and by unidirectional transport was 9.0 for ORC1 and 11.3 for ORC2, agreeing with the value of 10 expected from intraliposomal concentrations at equilibrium of 1 and 10 mm for unidirectional transport and exchange, respectively. The addition of 10 mm unlabeled ornithine after incubation for 30 min (ORC1) or 120 min (ORC2) when radioactive uptake by the proteoliposomes had almost approached equilibrium caused an extensive efflux of radiolabeled ornithine from both ornithine-loaded and -unloaded proteoliposomes (data not shown). This efflux shows that the [3H]ornithine taken up by unidirectional transport is released by exchange for externally added substrate. Therefore, ORC1 and -2 catalyze both the unidirectional transport of ornithine and ornithine-ornithine exchange, as reported also for the ornithine carrier from rat liver mitochondria and the recombinant yeast ortholog (1Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Stipani I. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Palmieri L. De Marco V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The substrate specificities of ORC1 and -2 were examined by measuring the uptake of [3H]ornithine into proteoliposomes pre-loaded with potential substrates (Fig. 4). With ORC1, the highest activities were observed in the presence of internal l-ornithine, l-lysine, l-arginine, and l-citrulline (see Fig. 4A). The d-isomers were much less effective. The activities detected in the presence of internal histidine, carnitine, cysteine, phenylalanine, and valine and (data not shown) alanine, γ-aminobutyrate, citrate, glutamine, leucine, proline, serine, and threonine were virtually the same as the activity observed without internal substrate. Virtually no activities were detected with internal spermine or spermidine, suggesting that they inhibit ornithine transport by ORC1. In contrast, with internal malate or phosphate, [3H]ornithine uptake was greater than in the absence of internal substrate. Isoform ORC2 behaved rather differently (see Fig. 4B), and high [3H]ornithine transport was observed with both l- and d-isomers of internal ornithine, lysine, arginine, and histidine. The rate of the unidirectional transport of ornithine by ORC2 was about 25% of the rate of ornithine-ornithine exchange. Furthermore, with internal citrulline the rate of [3H]ornithine uptake compared with that of ornithine uptake with no internal substrate was enhanced less with ORC2 than with ORC1. However, as observed with ORC1, the [3H]ornithine uptake by ORC2 was the same with no internal substrate as with internal carnitine, cysteine, phenylalanine, and valine and (data not shown) alanine, γ-aminobutyrate, glutamine, leucine, proline, and threonine; there was very low activity with internal spermine and spermidine and significant activity with internal malate and phosphate. As ORC1 and -2 did not catalyze either [32P]phosphate-phosphate or [14C]malate-malate homo-exchanges (see above), the effect of internal malate or phosphate on the uptake of [3H]ornithine was investigated further. As shown in Table I, [3H]ornithine uptake by ORC1 or -2 was enhanced not only with internal malate or phosphate but also with internal malonate, succinate, fumarate, aspartate, glutamate, and oxoglutarate in comparison with proteoliposomes with no internal substrate. In contrast, with asparagine, glutamine, and acetoacetate and (data not shown) propionate, butyrate, γ-aminobutyrate, and 2-oxoisocaproate, the transport of [3H]ornithine by both isoforms was virtually the same as in the absence of internal substrate. Results similar to those illustrated in Table I were found with [3H]lysine and, for ORC2, with [14C]histidine instead of [3H]ornithine. The ORC-mediated, increased transport of basic amino acids by phosphate, malate, and other dicarboxylates was concentration-dependent. Half-maximal stimulation of [3H]ornithine uptake required about 2.2 mm malate, 3.9 mm phosphate, and a concentration higher than 7.5 mm of other dicarboxylates. In the presence of internal ornithine, lysine, or arginine, both isoforms did not catalyze the uptake of labeled malate, phosphate, malonate, fumarate, aspartate, glutamate, and oxoglutarate into liposomes (data not shown), demonstrating that dicarboxylates and phosphate are not exchanged for basic amino acids. Furthermore, external phosphate, malate, and the other dicarboxylates neither induced efflux of internal [3H]ornithine nor stimulated uptake of [3H]ornithine. Only at high concentrations with a Ki higher than 10 mm did these compounds inhibit the carrier-mediated uptake of [3H]ornithine. Therefore, malate, phosphate, and other dicarboxylates may regulate the rate of ornithine uptake by reacting with ORC1 and -2 on the internal surface of the proteoliposomes.Table IStimulation of reconstituted ORC1 and -2 by phosphate, malate, and other dicarboxylatesInternal substrate[3H]Ornithine transportORC1ORC2μmol/min/g of proteinNone117150Malate295268Phosphate269284Malonate222199Succinate146188Fumarate221195Aspartate230207Glutamate2422462-Oxoglutarate213169Asparagine124137Glutamine117145Acetoacetate110153 Open table in a new tab The [3H]ornithine-ornithine exchange reactions catalyzed by ORC1 and -2 were inhibited strongly by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (an inhibitor of several mitochondrial carriers) as well as by mercurials (mersalyl, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, and mercuric chloride) and N-ethylmaleimide, which are powerful inhibitors of the ornithine carrier from rat liver (1Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both isoforms were inhibited strongly by spermine (Fig. 5), whereas carboxyatractyloside, bongkrekate, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, and bromocresol purple (inhibitors of other mitochondrial carriers) had little or no effect. Kinetic Characteristics—The kinetic constants of ORC1 and -2 were determined from the initial transport rate of homoexchanges at various external labeled substrate concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal substrate concentration of 20 mm. With both isoforms, linear functions were obtained in double reciprocal plots. For ORC1, the specific activities (V max) for homo-exchanges for ornithine, lysine, arginine, and citrulline were all about 3.0 ± 0.4 mmol/min/g of protein, and the transport affinities (Km) were 0.22 ± 0.02, 0.80 ± 0.06, 1.58 ± 0.18, and 2.52 ± 0.30 mm, respectively (in at least four experiments for each homo-exchange). For ORC2, the transport affinities were 0.40 ± 0.06, 0.32 ± 0.05, 0.71 ± 0.09, and 1.28 ± 0.14 mm, respectively, for l-isomers of ornithine, lysine, arginine, and histidine (in at least four experiments for each homo-exchange), and the V max values (1.2 ± 0.2 mmol/min/g of protein) were again independent of the substrate. Citrulline, lysine, spermine, and spermidine inhibited competitively [3H]ornithine uptake by both isoforms by increasing the apparent Km without changing the V max of ornithine uptake (data not shown). For ORC2, the inhibition constants (Ki) of citrulline, lysine, spermine, and spermidine were 8.1 ± 1.2, 0.37 ± 0.04, 0.30 ± 0.03, and 0.48 ± 0.06 mm, respectively (in at least three experiments for each inhibitor). For ORC1, the Ki values of citrulline, lysine, spermine, and spermidine were 2.2 ± 0.3, 0.87 ± 0.07, 0.98 ± 0.15, and 1.4 ± 0.2 mm, respectively (in at least three experiments for each inhibitor). Transport Properties of Mutant Forms of ORC1—The seven mutant forms of ORC1 were expressed in E. coli and reconstituted into liposomes just as well as the wild-type protein. Five of them, G27R, R275Q, R179X (residues 1–178 of ORC1), C861insG (residues 1–290), and IVS5+1g→a (ORC1 lacking transmembrane segments 5 and 6), were incapable of catalyzing homo-exchanges of ornithine, arginine, lysine, and citrulline (Fig. 6). Even after a 30-min incubation in the presence of external substrate concentrations 15-fold higher than the Km , no activity was detected (data not shown). It is likely that their inability to transport ornithine and citrulline leads to the HHH syndrome. The other two mutant forms of ORC1, i.e. G190D and F188Δ, maintained a residual transport activity of ∼35 and 10%, respectively. They occurred in different alleles of a patient who did not show a milder phenotype compared with that of the other patients studied in this work. He presented with neonatal onset hyperammonemia and developed spastic paraparesis in early adulthood (10Salvi S. Santorelli F.M. Bertini E. Boldrini R. Meli C. Donati A. Burlina A.B. Rizzo C. Di Capua M. Fariello G. Dionisi-Vici C. Neurology. 2001; 57: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is often lacking in human diseases. In all six patients, the sequence of ORC2 was unaltered, and, from semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments, it appeared that expression levels in cultured fibroblasts do not differ significantly from the levels found in control fibroblasts. Isoforms ORC1 and -2 have many transport properties in common. They both transport ornithine, lysine, arginine, and citrulline by exchange and unidirectionally, and they are inactivated by the same inhibitors. However, they also differ in a number of respects. First, ORC2 has a broader substrate specificity than ORC1. It transports l- and d-histidine, l-homoarginine, and d-isomers of ornithine, lysine, and arginine with the same efficiency as l-isomers. Second, the Km values of ORC2 for lysine and arginine are lower than for ORC1, and those for ornithine and citrulline are higher. Third, ORC2 is three times less active than ORC1. The transport properties of rat liver ORC (1Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Indiveri C. Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. De Palma A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are more similar to human ORC1 than to ORC2. Neither the native rat ORC nor the recombinant human ORC1 transports histidine; they both prefer to transport l-isomers of other amino acids, and their transport affinities for ornithine, lysine, arginine, and citrulline are very similar. Thus, as in human liver, ORC1 is probably the predominantly expressed isoform in rat liver. Because ORC1 transports citrulline better than ORC2 and because it is more abundant than ORC2 in liver, ORC1 is likely to carry out the important function of exchanging cytosolic ornithine and mitochondrial citrulline. Thus, it probably provides an essential link in the urea cycle between enzyme activities in the cytosol and others in the mitochondrial matrix. The lower activity of ORC1 in patients with HHH syndrome supports this interpretation. Moreover, the transport of lysine by ORC1 provides a means for inhibition of urea synthesis by lysine observed in isolated hepatocytes (18Krebs H.A. Lund P. Stubbs M. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis. Academic Press, New York1976: 269-292Google Scholar). The phenotype of HHH patients is generally milder than those associated with defects in any urea cycle enzyme. In HHH patients, inactive ORC1 is found alongside fully active ORC2 in liver mitochondria and can compensate partially for ORC1. However, because it has a lower affinity for ornithine and citrulline and is expressed at a lower level, it cannot replace completely the function of ORC1 in the urea cycle. Since in mouse the second gene for ORC is a pseudogene (for the presence of a single nt deletion near the 5′-end causing a frameshift) (9Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.-F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to delete the murine gene encoding for ORC1 and compare the resulting phenotype with that of a urea cycle enzyme knock-out mouse. Isoform ORC1 and especially isoform ORC2 are likely to play a variety of important roles in cell metabolism. The import of lysine, arginine, and histidine into mitochondria is required for mitochondrial protein synthesis, and import of ornithine is needed for the degradation of excess arginine. When the dietary content of arginine is high, the production of ornithine exceeds the requirement for citrulline formation. This excess is removed by ornithine aminotransferase (19Ip M.M. Chee P.Y. Swick R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 354: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McGivan J.D. Bradford N.M. Beavis A.D. Biochem.

In isolated rat liver mitochondria, ornithine aminotransferase catabolizes ornithine at a rate that is limited by transport of ornithine into the matrix (20McGivan J.D. Bradford N.M. Beavis A.D. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hepatic enzyme is found in pericentral hepatocytes that contain glutamine synthetase and not in the periportal hepatocytes containing the urea cycle enzymes (24Kuo F.C. Hwu W.L. Valle D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9468-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems possible that the ornithine-citrulline exchange activity of ORC1 and -2 occurs in mitochondria of periportal hepatocytes and that ornithine-H+ exchange is performed by the same transporters in mitochondria of the pericentral hepatocytes. Another possibility is that ORC2 is located mainly in mitochondria of pericentral hepatocytes and that ORC1 is in mitochondria of periportal hepatocytes. The efflux of ornithine from mitochondria is required for polyamine biosynthesis from ornithine in the cytosol. When the diet content of arginine is low and/or in the tissues where the activity of arginase is negligible (25Herzfeld A. Raper S.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), ornithine made from glutamate inside mitochondria (21Peraino C. Blake R.L. Pitot H.C. J. Biol.

Strecker H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 719-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has to be exported for polyamine biosynthesis. In intestinal mitochondria ornithine is made from glutamine and so could provide extra urea cycle intermediates for the liver (26Windmueller H.G. Spaeth A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ORC1 and -2 are expressed in various tissues at different levels, and both isoforms are inhibited by spermine and spermidine. Thus, polyamines in the cytosol could control their own synthesis by reducing the amount of ornithine exported from the mitochondria via the ornithine carrier. Another important observation is that the activities of ORC1 and -2 are stimulated by dicarboxylates, phosphate, and malate from the inside of the proteoliposomes, but as none of these compounds is transported by ORC1 and -2, the simplest explanation of this regulation is that malate and phosphate interact at a site distinct from the substrate-binding site. This site can bind C3-C5 dicarboxylates but not asparagine, glutamine, or monocarboxylates. Malate increases urea synthesis in isolated hepatocytes first by transporting into mitochondria reducing equivalents and the carbon skeleton of fumarate produced in the cytosol by argininosuccinate lyase and secondly by producing aspartate inside the mitochondria via the malate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase (27Meijer A.J. Gimpel J.A. Deleeuw G.A. Tager J.M. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7728-7738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As aspartate is a substrate of argininosuccinate synthetase, it is essential for the functioning of the urea cycle. If ORC1 and -2 are reconstituted into liposomes with the same orientation as in the mitochondria, malate could stimulate ureogenesis directly by activating ORC1 and -2 on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Because the intramitochondrial concentration of phosphate is high and the affinity of the ornithine carrier for dicarboxylates other than malate is low, the physiological effect of these dicarboxylates on the activity of the ORC may be minor."

Cofilin stimulates actin filament disassembly and is implicated in the regulation of contractile ring dynamics. However, little is known about the mechanism controlling cofilin activity during cytokinesis. Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation on Ser-3 by LIM-kinase-1 (LIMK1) and is reactivated by a protein phosphatase Slingshot-1 (SSH1). Here we show that the phosphatase activity of SSH1 decreases in the early stages of mitosis and is elevated in telophase and cytokinesis in HeLa cells, a time course correlating with that of cofilin dephosphorylation. SSH1 co-localizes with F-actin and accumulates onto the cleavage furrow and the midbody. Expression of a phosphatase-inactive SSH1 induces aberrant accumulation of F-actin and phospho-cofilin near the midbody in the final stage of cytokinesis and frequently leads to the regression of the cleavage furrow and the formation of multinucleate cells. Co-expression of cofilin rescued the inhibitory effect of phosphatase-inactive SSH1 on cytokinesis.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Decreases in cofilin expression or activity by gene mutation, RNA interference, or antibody injection caused frequent failures in cytokinesis, therefore indicating that cofilin plays a critical role in processes related to cytokinesis (8Abe H.

Cofilin activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 by LIM-kinase-1 (LIMK1) (11Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 12Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P.

Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We earlier reported that the level of the Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin (P-cofilin) periodically changes during the cell division cycle in HeLa cells; it increases in early stages of mitosis (prometaphase and metaphase), then is gradually dephosphorylated in telophase and cytokinesis (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As cofilin activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 (15Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 16Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), this means that cofilin is inactivated in the early stages of mitosis and reactivated in the later stages. The kinase activity of LIMK1 was shown to increase in the early stages of mitosis and then decline to the basal level in later stages (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, LIMK1 seems to be involved in changes in cofilin activity during the cell cycle. Dephosphorylation of cofilin could be caused by down-regulation of cofilin kinases, up-regulation of cofilin phosphatases, or both. SSH1 is a member of SSH family phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate P-cofilin in vitro and in vivo (13Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 18Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we examined changes in the phosphatase activity of SSH1 during the cell cycle, we found that this activity decreases in early stages of mitosis and increases in later stages, a time course correlating with that of the level of cofilin dephosphorylation. SSH1 co-localizes with F-actin and accumulates onto the cleavage furrow and the midbody during cytokinesis. We also found that expression of a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SSH1 increases the level of P-cofilin throughout the cell cycle, induces aberrant accumulation of F-actin near the midbody in the final stage of cytokinesis, and leads to frequent formation of multinucleate cells. We propose that SSH1 plays a critical role for cytokinesis in animal cells by dephosphorylating and reactivating cofilin. Plasmid Construction—To construct a plasmid for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged wild-type (WT) SSH1, hSSH1L cDNA in pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) vector (13Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) was cut and subcloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A plasmid for YFP-SSH1(CS) with a replacement of Cys-393 by serine was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. Plasmid for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged histone H2B was generated by subcloning the PCR-amplified mouse histone H2B cDNA into pECFP-C1 (Clontech). Plasmids coding for Myc-SSH1(WT), Myc-SSH1(CS), CFP-LIMK1, YFP-cofilin(WT), YFP-cofilin(S3A), and YFP-cofilin(S3E) were constructed as described previously (13Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M.

Anti-P-cofilin antibody specific to the Ser-3-phosphorylated form of cofilin was prepared as described previously (19Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Cell Culture Experiments—HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of the S phase by double thymidine block and released for 6–12 h as described previously (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were arrested at early mitotic phase by nocodazole, and mitotic and interphase cells were collected selectively by the mechanical shake-off procedure (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mitotic cells were released from nocodazole arrest for 0–180 min, and the cell cycle state was monitored by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and anti-tubulin staining; cells were in prometaphase (95%) at 0 min, in metaphase (70%), prometaphase (20%), and anaphase (10%) at 45 min, in telophase (90%) and anaphase (5%) at 90 min, and in G1 phase (95%) at 180 min (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For staining cells with phalloidin or anti-P-cofilin antibody, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids for YFP-fused protein with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), cultured in the thymidine-containing medium for 24 h, and released for 6 h. Nocodazole was added to the medium for another 6 h, and the cells were released for 2 h then fixed and stained (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. Cell lysates were normalized for the total amount of protein and SSH1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro phosphatase assay using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate as described previously (13Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SSH1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1 antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE on 5% gel, and immunoblotted with anti-SSH1 antibody. Treatment of SSH1 with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was done as described previously (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cell Staining—For P-cofilin staining, HeLa cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and permeabilized with absolute methanol for 10 min at –20 °C. In other cases, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, anti-P-cofilin, or anti-Myc antibody. DAPI was used for DNA staining. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (model DMLB, Leica, Nussloch, Germany). Time-lapse Fluorescence Analysis—For time-lapse imaging, HeLa cells were plated on a 35-mm glass-bottom dish and co-transfected with plasmids for YFP-fused protein and CFP-H2B. These cells were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (model DMIRBE, Leica), equipped with an Apochromat 63× oil objective (numerical aperture, 1.32) lens and a YFPor CFP-optimized filter set (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Time-lapse fluorescence images were captured every 3–10 min for 120–180 min with 50–100 ms exposures, using a Coolsnap HQ-cooled charge-coupled device camera (1024 × 1024 pixels, Roper Scientific, Wetziar, Germany) driven by a Q550FW Imaging Software (Leica). The room temperature was maintained at 37 °C. Cell Cycle-associated Changes in the Phosphatase Activity of SSH1—To investigate the role of SSH1 during the cell cycle, we measured the phosphatase activity of SSH1 in different stages of the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of the S phase by double thymidine block. At different times after release from thymidine block, endogenous SSH1 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro phosphatase assay and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Cells at 6, 9, and 12 h after release were mainly in the S, G2/M, and G1 phases, respectively, as assessed by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown and Ref. 14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of SSH1 decreased in cells at 6 and 9 h and then increased in cells at 12 h (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Thus, the phosphatase activity of SSH1 depends on the cell cycle, the activity being minimal in the G2/M phase. Immunoblot analysis revealed three separate anti-SSH1 immunoreactive bands of apparent molecular mass around 150–170 kDa (Fig. 1A, top panel). A slow-migrating band significantly increased in cells at 9 h, whereas two fast-migrating bands were prominent in cells arrested at the beginning of the S phase (at zero time) and in asynchronous cells, which suggests that the activity may be regulated by phosphorylation (see Fig. 1C). We next analyzed changes in the phosphatase activity of SSH1 during mitosis. HeLa cells were synchronized at the early mitotic phase by nocodazole and released for 0–180 min to allow for cell cycle progression. Cells at 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after release were mainly in prometaphase, metaphase, telophase, and G1 phase, respectively, as monitored by staining for tubulin and DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The activity of SSH1 in cells at 0 and 45 min was significantly decreased, compared with that in interphase (I) cells then gradually increased and almost reverted to the initial level at 180 min (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Immunoblot analysis revealed that a slow-migrating form of SSH1 was prominent in cells at 0, 45, and 90 min after release, although total amounts of SSH1 remained unchanged throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1B, top panel). Treatment of interphase and mitotic SSH1 with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase abolished the upper gel mobility shift (Fig. 1C), indicating that slow-migrating bands are the phosphorylated forms of SSH1. The upper mobility shift of SSH1 correlated well with decrease in the phosphatase activity (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that SSH1 is phosphorylated and inactivated in early stages of mitosis (prometaphase and metaphase) then dephosphorylated and reactivated in later stages (telophase and cytokinesis). Fig. 1D summarizes changes in the phosphatase activity of SSH1 during the cell cycle, compared with the previous data on changes in the level of P-cofilin and the kinase activity of LIMK1 (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of SSH1 and the kinase activity of LIMK1 are almost inversely regulated during the cell cycle. The level of P-cofilin correlates well with changes in LIMK1 and SSH1 activities. SSH1 Localizes onto the Cleavage Furrow, and Expression of SSH1(CS) Induces Aberrant Accumulation of F-actin—To determine the subcellular localization of SSH1 during mitosis, YFP-tagged wild-type SSH1 (YFP-SSH1(WT)) or its phosphatase-inactive mutant (YFP-SSH1(CS)), in which the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys-393) is replaced by serine, was expressed in HeLa cells, and the cells were synchronized and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for F-actin and DAPI for DNA (Fig. 2). Whereas control YFP was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm during mitosis (Fig. 2, a–d), both YFP-SSH1(WT) and YFP-SSH1(CS) co-localized with F-actin (Fig. 2, e–l), in accord with their potential to bind to F-actin in vitro (13Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar); they were uniformly distributed on the cortical actin in metaphase (Fig. 2, e and i) and concentrated onto the cleavage furrow in anaphase and telophase (Fig. 2, f, g, j, and k) and on the intercellular bridge (midbody) in late telophase (Fig. 2, h and l). In cells expressing YFP-SSH1(WT) or YFP-SSH1(CS), the cleavage furrow was normally formed and constricted during anaphase to telophase. In late telophase, however, expression of YFP-SSH1(CS) induced aberrant F-actin accumulation near the midbody (Fig. 2l), whereas no apparent effect was observed in cells expressing YFP-SSH1(WT) (Fig. 2h). YFP-SSH1(CS) co-localized with these aberrant F-actin aggregates (Fig. 2l). Thus, SSH1 localizes on the cleavage furrow and midbody during cytokinesis and seems to play a critical role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics in the terminal stage of cytokinesis. Expression of SSH1(CS) Increases the Level of P-cofilin—To further examine the role of SSH1 in the regulation of actin filament dynamics during mitosis and cytokinesis, we analyzed the P-cofilin level in cells expressing YFP-SSH1(WT) or YFP-SSH1(CS) by immunostaining using an anti-P-cofilin antibody that specifically recognizes P-cofilin (19Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Consistent with our previous observations (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in cells expressing control YFP, significant increases in the P-cofilin level were observed in metaphase (Fig. 3a) and anaphase (Fig. 3b) but not in telophase (Fig. 3c), compared with findings in surrounding interphase cells. Expression of YFP-SSH1(WT) lowered the P-cofilin level in metaphase and anaphase, perhaps because of its cofilin-phosphatase activity (Fig. 3, d–f). In cells expressing YFP-SSH1(CS), the high level of P-cofilin was retained from metaphase to telophase, and P-cofilin accumulated on the cleavage furrow and intercellular bridge, both being sites rich in F-actin and YFP-SSH1(CS) (Fig. 3, g–j). This is in contrast to the pattern seen in control YFP-expressing cells, in which P-cofilin is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, a–c). These results suggest that SSH1(CS) functions as a dominant-negative form and suppresses cofilin dephosphorylation in later stages of mitosis. Expression of SSH1(CS) Increases the Ratio of Multinucleate Cells—We next examined effects of overexpression of SSH1 or its CS mutant on cytokinesis. HeLa cells transfected with Myc-tagged SSH1(WT) or SSH1(CS) were cultured for 60 h (a period sufficient for one or two cycles of cell division) and stained with DAPI (Fig. 4A). About 38% of cells expressing Myc-SSH1(CS) became multinucleate, whereas only a small percentage (< 10%) of cells expressing Myc-SSH1(WT) or control YFP exhibited such multinucleate phenotypes (Fig. 4, A and B). No apparent effect on cytokinesis was observed in cells expressing cofilin(WT) or its S3A (non-phosphorylatable) or S3E (phosphorylation-mimic) mutant, in which Ser-3 was replaced by alanine or glutamic acid (Fig. 4B). Importantly, co-expression of cofilin(WT) with SSH1(CS) significantly reduced the ratio of multinucleate cells (Fig. 4, A and B), which suggests that SSH1(CS) induces multinucleate cells by suppressing dephosphorylation/activation of cofilin. As reported previously (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), expression of LIMK1(WT) induced the formation of multinucleate cells (Fig. 4, A and B). This effect was partially overcome by co-expression of non-phosphorylatable cofilin(S3A), but not with cofilin(WT) or cofilin(S3E) (Fig. 4, A and B), which suggests that LIMK1 induces multinucleate cells by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin. Co-expression of SSH1(WT) with LIMK1 significantly reduced the ratio of multinucleate cells induced by LIMK1, which further suggests that SSH1 plays a role in cytokinesis by dephosphorylating cofilin. Co-expression of SSH1(CS) with LIMK1 synergistically enhanced the ratio of multinucleate cells. Expression of SSH1(CS) Induces the Regression of the Cleavage Furrow—Appearance of multinucleate cells suggests a failure of cytokinesis in cells expressing SSH1(CS). To better understand how SSH1(CS) blocks cytokinesis, the processes of cytokinesis of HeLa cells expressing YFP, YFP-SSH1(WT), or YFP-SSH1(CS) were monitored, using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. CFP-fused histone H2B (CFP-H2B) was co-expressed to visualize chromosomes. Cells expressing control YFP or YFP-SSH1(WT) normally divided and separated into two daughter cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, in cells expressing YFP-SSH1(CS), the cleavage furrow was formed and ingressed normally, but at the final stage of cytokinesis the daughter cells could not separate, and the furrow gradually regressed to produce binucleate cells (Fig. 5C). Of seven YFP-SSH1(CS)-expressing cells observed by time-laps analysis, four exhibited the regression of the cleavage furrow. YFP-SSH1(WT) was concentrated on the intercellular bridge at the terminal stage of cytokinesis but diffusely distributed into the cortex of two daughter cells, as the cells spread after cell division (Fig. 5B). In contrast, YFP-SSH1(CS) remained localized on the position of intercellular bridge even after the furrow regressed and cells spread (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that SSH1(CS) blocks cytokinesis by suppressing cell abscission at the final stage of cytokinesis. In the present study, we found that the phosphatase activity of SSH1 changes significantly during the cell cycle; it decreases in early stages of mitosis (prometaphase and metaphase) and is elevated in later stages (telophase and cytokinesis). The kinase activity of LIMK1 is almost inversely regulated during the cell cycle; it increases in early stages of mitosis and decreases in later stages (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 1D, cell cycle-associated changes in the level of P-cofilin (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) correlate well with changes in LIMK1 and SSH1 activities, which suggests that cofilin activity is regulated during the cell cycle by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation through the changes in both LIMK1 and SSH1 activities. It is probable that activation of LIMK1 and inactivation of SSH1 are involved in phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin in early stages of mitosis, whereas activation of SSH1 and inactivation of LIMK1 are related to dephosphorylation and reactivation of cofilin in later stages of mitosis. Ectopic expression of LIMK1 (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or phosphatase-inactive SSH1(CS) (in this study) increased the level of cofilin phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle and induced the formation of multinucleate cells. Co-expression of cofilin(S3A) with LIMK1 or co-expression of cofilin(WT) with SSH1(CS) significantly reduced the ratio of multinucleate cells. Together with the observation that the P-cofilin level was retained at the high level throughout the cell cycle in cells expressing LIMK1 (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or SSH1(CS) (Fig. 3, g–j), these findings suggest that the production of multinucleate cells by LIMK1 or SSH1(CS) is caused by insufficient dephosphorylation/reactivation of cofilin in later stages of mitosis and that dephosphorylation and reactivation of cofilin in later stages of mitosis is critical for cytokinesis. Co-expression of SSH1(WT) reversed the effect of LIMK1 on multinucleate cell formation, which indicates that SSH1 has the potential to neutralize the inhibitory effect of LIMK1 on cytokinesis by dephosphorylating cofilin. SSH1(WT) and SSH1(CS) co-localize with F-actin and are concentrated onto the cleavage furrow and midbody during cytokinesis. SSH1(CS) probably suppresses cofilin dephosphorylation by competing with endogenous SSH1 for localization on the cleavage furrow and/or activation by upstream regulators in a dominant-negative manner. Co-expression of cofilin(WT) did not rescue the effect of LIMK1 overexpression, probably because ectopic LIMK1 phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin(WT) co-expressed. Expression of cofilin(S3E), which mimics P-cofilin, had no effect on cytokinesis, because it does not bind to either G- or F-actin and has no activity to depolymerize and sever actin filaments (15Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 16Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of expression of LIMK1 or SSH1(CS), expression of wild-type SSH1 significantly reduced the P-cofilin level in early stages of mitosis, compared with that in cells expressing control YFP (Fig. 3), but exhibited no apparent effect on cytokinesis, as assessed by counting the ratio of multinucleate cells (Fig. 4) and by time-lapse scanning with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). Similarly, expression of cofilin(WT) or cofilin(S3A) did not significantly affect the ratio of multinucleate cells (Fig. 4). Thus, when cells were treated to increase cofilin activity during the cell cycle, we observed no apparent effect on cytokinesis. In contrast, Abe et al. (8Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) reported that injection of glutathione S-transferase-coupled Xenopus ADF/cofilin (a non-phosphorylatable and constitutively active form of Xenopus ADF/cofilin) into Xenopus embryos significantly blocked cytokinesis. The apparent contradiction may be due to the differences in experimental systems (cultured mammalian cells versus Xenopus eggs, and plasmid transfection versus microinjection) and proteins overexpressed (S3A-cofilin versus glutathione S-transferase-coupled Xenopus ADF/cofilin). Further studies will be required to explain such contradictory results and to better understand the physiological importance of the increase in P-cofilin levels in early stages of mitosis. The contractile ring is a dynamic structure in which actin filaments continuously assemble and disassemble (1Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Straight A.F. Field C.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R760-R770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the Arp2/3 complex, formins and profilin are required for actin polymerization to maintain the contractile ring during cytokinesis as well as for initial ring formation (21Pelham R.J. Chang F. Nature. 2002; 419: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 22Narumiya S. Mabuchi I. Nature. 2002; 419: 27-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cofilin seems to play a critical role in regulating dynamics of the contractile ring by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments. Decreases in cofilin expression by gene mutation or RNA interference in Drosophila cells induced aberrant accumulation of actin filaments at the site of the contractile ring and frequent failure in cytokinesis (9Gunsalus K.C. Bonaccorsi S. Williams E. Verni F. Gatti M. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1243-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10Somma M.P. Fasulo B. Cenci G. Cundari E. Gatti M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2448-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which supports the notion that actin filaments continuously assemble and disassemble in the contractile ring and suggests that cofilin plays a critical role in cytokinesis by regulating actin filament dynamics in the contractile ring. We showed in this study that SSH1 localizes on the cleavage furrow and midbody and is activated in the later stages of mitosis. Expression of SSH1(CS) induced aberrant accumulation of F-actin and P-cofilin near the midbody at the final stage of cytokinesis and led to frequent production of multinucleate cells. Time-lapse fluorescence analysis revealed that in SSH1(CS)-expressing cells the cleavage furrow ingressed normally from anaphase to late telophase to form gourd-shaped cells, but at the final stage of cytokinesis the furrow did not absciss the cell into two daughter cells and gradually regressed to produce binucleate cells. Taken together these findings suggest that SSH1 plays a critical role in cytokinesis, especially in the completion of cytokinesis at the terminal stage of cytokinesis, by dephosphorylating and reactivating cofilin. Activation of cofilin at the terminal stage of cytokinesis is probably required for contractile ring disassembly to complete cytokinesis. We found that SSH1 is retarded on SDS-PAGE in early stages of mitosis, and this gel mobility shift was reversed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment. The upper gel mobility shift of SSH1 during the cell cycle correlated with decreases in the phosphatase activity, which suggests that SSH1 is inactivated in early stages of mitosis by phosphorylation and reactivated in later stages of mitosis by dephosphorylation. We previously showed that LIMK1 is phosphorylated and activated in early stages of mitosis and dephosphorylated and inactivated in later stages of mitosis (14Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and p21-activated kinase (PAK) phosphorylate and activate LIMK1 (23Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 24Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Identification of kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) responsible for the regulation of SSH1 and LIMK1 activities during the cell cycle will be important to understand the signaling mechanisms that link the activity of cell cycle regulators to contractile ring dynamics and to elucidate mechanisms governing how cell cleavage is temporally and spatially regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2156627055,"We have studied the assembly and GTPase of purified FtsZ from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, a structural homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, employing wild-type FtsZ, FtsZ-His6 (histidine-tagged FtsZ), and the new mutants FtsZ-W319Y and FtsZ-W319Y-His6, with light scattering, nucleotide analyses, electron microscopy, and image processing methods. This has revealed novel properties of FtsZ. The GTPase of archaeal FtsZ polymers is suppressed in Na+-containing buffer, generating stabilized structures that require GDP addition for disassembly. FtsZ assembly is polymorphic. Archaeal FtsZ(wt) assembles into associated and isolated filaments made of two parallel protofilaments with a 43 Å longitudinal spacing between monomers, and this structure is also observed in bacterial FtsZ from Escherichia coli. The His6 extension facilitates the artificial formation of helical tubes and sheets. FtsZ-W319Y-His6 is an inactivated GTPase whose assembly remains regulated by GTP and Mg2+. It forms two-dimensional crystals made of symmetrical pairs of tubulin-like protofilaments, which associate in an antiparallel array (similarly to the known Ca2+-induced sheets of FtsZ-His6). In contrast to the lateral interactions of microtubule protofilaments, we propose that the primary assembly product of FtsZ is the double-stranded filament, one or several of which might form the dynamic Z ring during prokaryotic cell division.

Bacterial cells place at their division site a Z-ring that assembles from FtsZ at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and recruits the other protein components of the septation machinery. The positioning of the Z-ring is in turn determined by the self-organizing Min system (1Lutkenhaus J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Buddelmeijer N. Beckwith J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 16-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Archaeal FtsZ from Methanococcus jannaschii and eukaryotic tubulin share the same structural framework and constitute a distinct family of protofilament-forming GTPases (4Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 5Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The structures of bacterial FtsZs are probably similar to the archaeal protein, based on FtsZ sequence conservation. The Escherichia coli Z-ring is very dynamic, with turnover in seconds, similar to or faster than a typical mitotic spindle (6Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson HP. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although the position of the Z ring was visualized by immunoelectron microscopy (7Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. Nature. 1991; 354: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), its structure is unknown. A number of studies have shown that purified bacterial FtsZ can assemble with GTP and divalent cations forming polymers that hydrolyze the nucleotide β–γ phosphate bond and disassemble upon GTP consumption (8Yu X.C.

Bioessays. 1998; 20: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) remains controversial (15Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

FtsZ polymers have the characteristic tubulin ∼40 Å axial spacing between consecutive monomers (18Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). At pH 6 and in the presence of high Ca2+ and GTP concentrations, a small proportion of archaeal FtsZ from M. jannaschii formed crystalline sheets made of symmetric protofilament pairs associated in an antiparallel arrangement, whereas most of the protein precipitated into aggregates of helical cable-like tubes.

Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). FtsZ folding, activation, and assembly have important differences with tubulins. Purified unfolded FtsZ polypeptide chains are capable of spontaneous refolding into their functional states (21Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in contrast to tubulin monomers, whose folding process includes binding and release from cytoplasmic chaperonin CCT (22Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the extensive tubulin loop insertions in the FtsZ/tubulin common core and its folding complexity coevolved with the lateral association interfaces responsible for the association of parallel protofilaments into microtubules, suggesting that tubulin and FtsZ share a similar axial interaction between monomers, but have different interactions between protofilaments (21Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Employing molecular dynamics it has been predicted that GTP binding controls the conformation of switch loop T3, which activates FtsZ for assembly possibly in a manner similar to tubulin (23Diaz J.F. Kralicek A. Mingorance J. Palacios J.M. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17307-17315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this work we have investigated the assembly of archaeal FtsZ from M. jannaschii. We started by defining the conditions for biochemically regulated assembly of this FtsZ, and show that the GTPase of FtsZ is activated by polymerization, and that GDP induces disassembly. Subsequently, results not found before with other FtsZ proteins have provided new insight into FtsZ assembly. Archaeal FtsZ assembles without hydrolyzing GTP in sodium-containing buffer. The mutation W319Y also suppresses the GTPase activity of the archaeal FtsZ, generating stabilized polymers and two-dimensional crystals. Archaeal FtsZ assemblies are made of symmetrical pairs of tubulin-like protofilaments, which associate in a manner different than that of tubulin. We propose that these double-stranded polymers constitute the primary assembly product of archaeal FtsZ and show that they are also formed in bacterial FtsZ from E. coli. FtsZ, FtsZ-His6, FtsZ-W319Y, and FtsZ-W319Y-His6 Proteins—FtsZ-His6 from M. jannaschii, which is wild-type FtsZ (FTSZ1) with a C-terminal Gly-Ser-His6 extension, and its mutant FtsZ-W319Y-His6, were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys transformed with the plasmid pHis17-mjFtsZ-H6 (19Löwe J.

The FtsZ-W319Y-His6 mutant had been originally constructed as an intermediate step to the double mutant FtsZ-W319Y-T92W-His6, whose single tryptophan fluorescence is sensitive to GDP or GTP binding (23Diaz J.F.

Plasmids coding for FtsZ and FtsZ-W319Y, both without the Gly-Ser-His6 extension, were respectively constructed using the plasmids pHis17-mjFtsZ-H6 or pAVK1(W319Y) as templates, by inverse PCR with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) in a GeneAmp PCR 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), employing the synthetic primers TAAAAGCTTCACCACCACCACCACCA and AATTTTTGGAATTCCTGTGAGTTC, which results in the loss of the sequence coding for the Gly-Ser-His6 extension and the BamH1 restriction site. The PCR parameters were 1 cycle of 5 s at 95 °C, 15 min at 50 °C, 4 min at 68 °C, followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C and 4 min at 68 °C, terminating with 20 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were purified with the Concert Rapid PCR purification system (Invitrogen), phosphorylated with phage T4 kinase (Promega), polished with DNA polymerase Pwo (Roche Applied Science), ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Promega), and the parental plasmid digested with DpnI (Promega). E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligated products, plasmid DNA was purified from individual transformants and employed to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys for overexpression. The mutant plasmids were identified by the loss of the BamH1 restriction site of the parental DNA and by sequencing their ftsZ gene, employing the sequencing primers mf3 (ACCATATCTGAATCTTG), mj1 (CGGCATATTTGGAAC), p319y (ATATATAATTGTAGCATTTGGGTCTAATCTTG) and mj3 (GAACAATGGAGGCTTAGCG) with an Applied Biosystems PRISM 3700 DNA analyzer. The absence of the histidine tags in FtsZ and FtsZ-W319Y was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody (Amersham Biosciences). FtsZ and FtsZ-W319Y were overexpressed as described above for the His tag-containing proteins, but they were precipitated from the high speed supernatants of the cell lysates with 33% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, pH 8.0, clarified, and chromatographed in a HiTrap Q-HP anion exchange column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient of 0.15–1.0 m KCl in the same buffer. FtsZ, which eluted at ∼0.45 m KCl together with a ∼98 kDa protein contaminant, was concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriprep 30K (Amicon), and it was further purified by hydrophobic chromatography in a HiTrap Phenyl Sepharose HP column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with a 0.8–0 m ammonium sulfate gradient in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Purified FtsZ, which eluted at ∼0.4 m ammonium sulfate, was concentrated, desalted with a Fast Desalting column (5-ml Sephadex G-25 superfine, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm NaN3,1mm EDTA, pH 8.0, concentrated again, and stored at –80 °C). FtsZ-His6 and FtsZ-W319Y-His6 were purified as controls of this method and had the same assembly properties under standard conditions (described under “Results”) as those purified by affinity chromatography. FtsZ from E. coli was purified and assembled as described (12Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol.

Purified FtsZ(wt), FtsZ-His6, FtsZ-W319Y, and FtsZ-W319Y-His6 were ≥90% homogeneous in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Their molecular masses, determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 4242 instrument using yeast enolase as an external standard, were within experimental error of the theoretical values from the translated gene sequences. Their N-terminal ends were confirmed in each case by Edman microsequencing (results: Met-Lys-Phe-Leu) with an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with on-line HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GMPCPP, guanosine 5′-(α,β-methylenetriphosphate); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. analysis of the phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. Protein-bound guanine nucleotide was extracted, and protein and nucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as described (21Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), employing for apo-FtsZ-W319-Y and apo-FtsZ-W319Y-His6 the extinction coefficient value 2560 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm in 6 m guanidinium chloride (calculated for 0 Trp, 2 Tyr, and 8 Phe residues). Purified FtsZ contained 0.4 ± 0.2 guanosine nucleotide bound (of which 73% was GTP and 27% GDP); FtsZ-His6, 0.6 ± 0.1 (39% GTP, 61% GDP); FtsZ-W319Y, 0.5 ± 0.2 (98% GTP, 2% GDP); FtsZ-W319Y-His6, 0.5 ± 0.1 (39% GTP, 61% GDP). The low GTP/GDP ratio of the affinity-purified His6-tagged proteins was due to the purification method, since control FtsZ-His6 and FtsZ-W319Y-His6 purified by ammonium sulfate and ion exchange (see above) had 89% GTP-11% GDP and 95% GTP-5% GDP, respectively. FtsZ(wt), FtsZ-His6, FtsZ-W319Y, and FtsZ-W319Y-His6 had practically identical far UV circular dichroism spectra. The guanidinium chloride unfolding curves of the four proteins could be fitted by two-state transition models, with identical half denaturant concentrations (average, 3.03 ± 0.10 m guanidinium chloride) and unfolding free energy changes (average, 11.6 ± 2.0 kcal mol–1) within experimental error (for FtsZ-His6, see Ref. 21Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results indicated that neither modification, the addition of the His6 tag or the W319Y point mutation, had any detectable effects on the average secondary structure and on the stability of FtsZ to chemical unfolding. Assembly, GTPase, and Bound Nucleotide Assays—FtsZ was diluted (≥20-fold) or chromatographically equilibrated into potassium-containing assembly buffer (50 mm Mes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5), or sodium-containing assembly buffer (50 mm Mes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) at 30° (the FtsZ proteins with a six histidine tag had a tendency to precipitate in the cold), centrifuged for 10 min at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA120.2 rotor to remove any aggregates, and its concentration was measured. Aliquots of FtsZ (typically 12.5 μm) were placed into a fluorometer cuvette thermostatted at 55 °C (solution temperatures were measured with a thermocouple), and its 350-nm light scattering was monitored at 90° (21Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assembly was typically started 5 min after by adding 6 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP (or 0.1 mm GMPCPP). Samples (20 μl) for electron microscopy were taken directly from the solution. The GTP and GMPCPP hydrolyzing activities of FtsZ solutions maintained at 55 °C in a thermostatting block (Eppendorf Thermostat Plus) were measured by taking 20-μl samples at several times, extracting the nucleotide with cold 0.5 n HClO4 (with guanosine as an internal standard), followed by neutralization and ionic pair HPLC analysis of nucleotides with an octadecyl silica column as described previously (25Diaz J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The nucleotides bound to FtsZ polymers were analyzed by sedimentation (6 min at 60,000 rpm in a prewarmed Beckman TL100 rotor), followed by pellet resuspension, nucleotide analysis, and FtsZ concentration measurement. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Samples were adsorbed to grids on a hot plate or mildly fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and subsequently stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were taken at various magnifications with JEOL 1200EX-II microscopes operated at 100 kV, and recorded on Kodak SO-163 film. In the case of the FtsZ sheets, micrographs were recorded with a nominal magnification of ×40,000 and the 3 best images, as judged by optical diffraction, digitized in a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a sampling window corresponding to 3.5 Å/pixel. Lattice refinement of the images was carried out using the X-windows-based graphical environment SPECTRA (26Schmid M.F. Dargahi R. Tam M.W. Ultramicroscopy. 1993; 48: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the subsequent image processing, including lattice unbending, was performed using the MRC image processing suite (27Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Transfer function correction was carried out using the Integrated Crystallographic Environment (ICE, Ref. 28Hardt S. Wang B. Schmid M.F. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Images were merged with the program ORIGTILT (27Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), using for that the crystallographic group p2221, which was suggested by the program ALLSPACE (29Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the case of the isolated filaments of FtsZ from M. jannaschii and from E. coli, images were taken at ×60,000 and digitized with a sampling window corresponding to 2.4 Å/pixel. 528 and 268 areas of the thick filaments were respectively selected so that 6 FtsZ monomers (3 of each of the 2 filaments) were present, and were subsequently aligned by cross-correlation free-pattern methods (30Marco S. Chagoyen M. de la Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and processed using the XMIPP software package (31Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martín C. Marco S. Fernández J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Reversible Nucleotide-dependent Assembly of FtsZ from M. jannaschii—The polymerization of purified FtsZ was systematically investigated with light scattering at 90° and electron microscopy. Initial attempts to assemble FtsZ from M. jannaschii at moderate temperatures failed. However, increasing the temperature permitted the observation of reversible, GTP-Mg2+-dependent archaeal FtsZ assembly, similarly to mesophilic bacterial FtsZs at lower temperatures. This is probably related to the fact that this hyperthermophilic archaeon has an optimal growth temperature of 85 °C (32Jones W.J. Leight J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A (trace 1) shows the time course of assembly of FtsZ (wt, 12.5 μm) initiated by addition of 1 mm GTP and 6 mm MgCl2 in potassium-containing Mes assembly buffer, pH 6.5, at 55 °C, which were chosen as standard conditions. Prior to nucleotide addition at time zero, the light scattering was negligible. Twenty seconds later (the shortest time recorded) most of the large scattering increase due to FtsZ assembly had taken place, and it gradually decayed afterward following the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (the solid circles in Fig. 1A are HPLC measurements of the GTP concentration in the solution). Addition of more GTP produced a new cycle of assembly and disassembly; the FtsZ polymers completely disassembled upon GDP addition in less than 20 s. Polymers could be also cycled by cooling and heating the solution, or by chelation of Mg2+ with EDTA followed by excess Mg2+ addition (not shown). A very small light scattering increase was observed with Mg2+ only, and an insignificant increase with GDP and Mg2+, or with GTP or GDP only (Fig. 1A), indicating that similarly large polymers did not assemble under these conditions. Substitution of GTP by the slowly hydrolyzable analogue GMPCPP permitted prolonged assembly (Fig. 1A) during ≥2 h. Decreasing the GMPCPP concentration to 0.1 mm resulted in a shorter assembly, which dropped following hydrolysis of the analogue (Fig. 1A). Polymerizing FtsZ hydrolyzed one GTP per ∼10 s at pH 6.5 and 55 °C (Table I). Increasing the Mg2+concentration decreased the rate of GTP hydrolysis and increased the time stability of the FtsZ polymers. Half disassembly (50% of the maximal scattering value) was reached in ∼4 min with 3 mm MgCl2, whereas it typically took about 9 min with 6 mm MgCl2 and 12 min with 10 mm. Interestingly, disassembly of FtsZ closely followed the consumption of GTP in each of these cases. Fig. 1B shows a plot of the light scattering versus the GDP/GTP ratio of the solution, measured in these experiments. The relative light scattering intensities (which started from different absolute values at each MgCl2 concentration) drop practically together upon hydrolysis of GTP. Similar observations were made with FtsZ-His6, with the difference that the polymers were apparently stable for ≥60 min with 10 mm MgCl2.Table IGTPase and GMPCPPase activities of FtsZ from M. jannaschiiProteinConditionsaMeasurements were made by HPLC from 12 μm FtsZ solutions incubated with 1 mm GTP in 50 mm Mes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5 at 55 °C, unless otherwise indicated (a minimum of two independent determinations were made per measurement).

Open table in a new tab After sedimentation (a total of ∼8 min at 55 °C) the FtsZ polymers were found to contain a large proportion of hydrolyzed nucleotide. Pellets from FtsZ polymers assembled in K+-containing buffer with 5 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 contained 67% GTP and 33% GDP (supernatant: 89% GTP, 11% GDP). With 1 mm GMPCPP and 6 mm MgCl2 they contained 53% GMPCPP and 47% GMPCP (supernatant: 94% GMPCPP, 6% GMPCP). FtsZ with GTP and Mg2+ mainly formed filamentous polymers of widths usually between 120 and 300 Å (see Fig. 2A). FtsZ with GMPCPP and Mg2+ formed polymers (Fig. 2C) as well that were typically wider (∼800 Å) than the GTP-induced polymers. Together with the large GTP and GMPCPP polymers, isolated ∼60 Å wide FtsZ filaments, straight (Fig. 2A) and curved (Fig. 2B), could be also observed. FtsZ at 80 °C, close to the 85 °C optimal growth temperature of M. jannaschii (32Jones W.J. Leight J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar), assembled with GTP and Mg2+ similarly at 55 °C. FtsZ-His6, which is FtsZ with a C-terminal Gly-Ser-His6 extension, initially employed for purification and crystallization (19Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 24Löwe J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), assembled similarly to FtsZ under our standard conditions at 55 °C (not shown). However, upon modification of these conditions, FtsZ-His6 showed significant differences with FtsZ. These included (i) the assembly into helical tubes (Fig. 2D) with Ca2+ (instead of Mg2+) and also with Na+ (instead of K+), (ii) polymerization with Na+ without added nucleotide forming wide tubes (Fig. 2G), and (iii) formation of ordered sheets (Fig. 2E) upon assembly at 80 °C with Mg2+ (with GTP, GDP, or without added nucleotide). The above results indicated that the γ phosphate of the guanosine nucleotide and Mg2+ promote FtsZ assembly; they suggested that nucleotide hydrolysis by the polymer results in its disassembly, and that the six histidine extension enhances assembly, favoring the formation of helical and laminar polymers instead of the filamentous polymers. The structures of the different polymers and of the FtsZ filaments will be addressed later. Activation of FtsZ GTPase by Assembly in K + -containing Buffer—GTP-induced assembly of FtsZ into large light scattering polymers and significant GTP hydrolysis were found to take place above a critical FtsZ concentration (Cr ≃ 2 μm FtsZ). FtsZ assembly measured by sedimentation is cooperative and proceeds above a critical protein concentration in a nucleated condensation polymerization reaction. 2S. Huecas and J. M. Andreu, submitted for publication.Fig. 3 shows parallel measurements of GTP hydrolysis and light scattering at varying FtsZ concentration, indicating that the unassembled FtsZ below Cr hydrolyzed ∼0.3 GTP per minute, whereas assembled FtsZ hydrolyzed 6.2 GTP per minute. Similar observations were made with FtsZ-His6. Nucleotide hydrolysis could be uncoupled from the assembly of FtsZ by replacing K+ by Na+ in the buffer, or with a point mutation inactivating the GTPase activity. Fig. 4 shows the time courses of assembly and nucleotide consumption in sodium-containing Mes assembly buffer at 55 °C. The nucleotide hydrolysis rate decreased more than 100-fold with respect to the rate with K+ (Table I). Under these conditions FtsZ-His6 (12.5 μm) formed sta"

The crystal structure of Aip1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined to a 2.3-Å resolution and a final crystallographic R-factor of 0.204. The structure reveals that the overall fold is formed by two connected seven-bladed β-propellers and has important implications for the structure of Aip1 from other organisms and WD repeat-containing proteins in general. These results were unexpected because a maximum of 10 WD repeats had been reported in the literature for this protein using sequence data. The surfaces of the β-propellers formed by the D-A and B-C loops are positioned adjacent to one another, giving Aip1p a shape that resembles an open “clamshell.” The mapping of conserved residues to the structure of Aip1p reveals dense patches of conserved residues on the surface of one β-propeller and at the interface of the two β-propellers. These two patches of conserved residues suggest a potential binding site for F-actin on Aip1p and that the orientation of the β-propellers with respect to one another plays a role in binding an actin-cofilin complex. In addition, the conserved interface between the domains is mediated by a number of interactions that appear to impart rigidity between the two domains of Aip1p and may make a large substrate-induced conformational change difficult.

The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in cell motility, cell morphology, cytokinesis, and the organization of organelles within the cytosol. The organization of actin filaments within the cytoskeleton is tightly regulated by a number of actinbinding proteins. Among these is cofilin, an essential protein conserved in all of the eukaryotes. Cofilin and other members of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family of proteins are known to aid the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and increase actin filament turnover by binding and severing F-actin (1Rosenblatt J.

Previous studies have shown that Aip1p is involved in endocytosis and cytokinesis and that motility in Dictyostelium (13Konzok A. Weber I. Simmeth E. Hacker U. Maniak M. Muller-Taubenberger A. J.

It has also been shown that in the absence of cofilin, Aip1p has little ability to depolymerize or bind to F-actin (12Okada K. Obinata T. Abe H. J.

Additionally, a number of alanine-scanning mutations in yeast actin that should hinder the binding of cofilin (16Wriggers W. Tang J.X. Azuma T. Marks P.W. Janmey P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also prevent the interaction of actin with Aip1p (17Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting that the actual target of Aip1p in vivo is a binary complex of F-actin and cofilin. Initial studies on S. cerevisiae Aip1p suggested that the addition of substoichiometric amounts of Aip1p to F-actin in the presence of equimolar amounts of cofilin significantly improves the rate and extent of F-actin depolymerization in vitro (10Rodal A.A.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). More recent studies on Xenopus laevis Aip1p have indicated that Aip1p enhances the fragmentation of actin filaments by capping their barbed ends in the presence of cofilin (15Okada K. Blanchoin L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43011-43016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thus preventing the elongation of cofilin-severed actin filaments. These studies have indicated a likely binding site for Aip1p on F-actin (15Okada K. Blanchoin L. Abe H. Chen H. Pollard T.D. Bamberg J.R. J. Biol.

Aip1p is a member of the WD repeat family of proteins and has been predicted to contain as many as 10 WD repeats (14Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These repeats, also known as WD40 repeats, are homologous sequences of ∼40 amino acids frequently bracketed by the amino acid pairs Gly-His on the amino end of the repeat and Trp-Asp at the carboxyl end and are almost exclusive to eukaryotes (18Smith T.F.

Analyses of well characterized genomes such as S. cerevisiae have shown that approximately 1% codes for WD repeat-containing proteins. Domains constructed from WD repeats are utilized by many proteins in the reversible binding and regulation of specific protein targets in an extremely diverse set of cellular systems (18Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Structural characterization of a number of WD repeat proteins has revealed that they form multi-bladed β-propeller structures (19Pickles L.M. Roe S.M. Hemingway E.J. Stifani S. Pearl L.H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with nearly all of them containing seven blades. Each of the blades in the β-propeller is formed by a small anti-parallel β-sheet consisting of four β-strands, labeled A, B, C, and D, beginning with the strand closest to the center of the propeller. A single WD sequence repeat encompasses the D strand of one blade and the A, B, and C strands of the following blade. Each repeat in sequence therefore does not coincide with a single structural repeat. Aip1p has been predicted to contain more WD repeats than any other structurally characterized protein bringing into question whether its WD repeats form one very large β-propeller or multiple smaller β-propeller domains. This general issue has also been raised for other proteins with larger numbers of WD repeats (23Hisbergues M. Gaitatzes C.G. Joset F. Bedu S. Smith T.F. Protein Sci. 2000; 10: 293-300Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To answer this question and to help elucidate the nature of the interactions of Aip1p with actin and cofilin, we have determined the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Aip1p to a 2.3-Å resolution, the first structure of a WD repeat protein containing more than eight WD repeats. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The AIP1 gene was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using the 5′-primer 5′-CTAGTGGCCATGGCATCTATCTCTTTGAAG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-ACTGCCCGGGCTCGAGGACAACATTCCACCT-3′. The resulting fragment was inserted into the NcoI and SmaI sites of the plasmid pTYB4 (New England Biolabs) to yield the final bacterial expression vector. The sequencing of the plasmid indicated conservative H530R mutation, presumably from the PCR. This plasmid was used to transform the Escherichia coli expression strain ER2566. Recombinant Aip1p was produced in fusion with plasmid-derived intein and chitinbinding domains. The wild-type protein was expressed in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 14 h at 15 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled Aip1 (SeMet Aip1p) was produced for the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment by the addition of Met-repressing amino acids (final concentrations: 0.1 mg/ml Lys, 0.1 mg/ml Phe, 0.1 mg/ml Thr, 0.05 mg/ml Ile, 0.05 mg/ml Leu, 0.05 mg/ml Val) and 0.06 mg/ml selenomethionine to E. coli ER2566 cells in modified magnesium medium at 37 °C 30 min before inducing with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and lowering the temperature to 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 12 h after induction and lysed using a microfluidizer at 15,000 p.s.i. Lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 39,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting cell extracts containing either wild-type or SeMet Aip1p/intein/chitin-binding domain fusion protein were passed over a column of chitin beads, which was washed with at least 20 column volumes of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) plus 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by 20 column volumes of Buffer A. The Aip1p-intein fusion protein was then cleaved on the chitin column by incubation for 12 h in Buffer A supplemented with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Aip1p was eluted in Buffer A, dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a quaternized polyethyleneimine HQ column using a BioCad Sprint fast protein liquid chromatography. Aip1p was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient, eluting at a salt concentration of ∼450 mm. The purified protein was then exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 20 mm NaCl and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using Millipore Ultrafree spin concentrators. Dynamic light-scattering experiments using a Protein Solutions Dynapro 99 instrument on purified protein at 0.2 mg/ml concentration indicated that Aip1p exists as a monodisperse monomer with a molecular mass of 61.3 kDa reasonably close to the predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified Aip1p and SeMet Aip1p were crystallized at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Drops containing 1 μl of protein solution at a concentration of 15 mg/ml were mixed with 1 μl of the precipitant solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 13% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000) and suspended on siliconized glass coverslips over a 1-ml reservoir of the precipitant solution. Crystals used in data collection were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 80% v/v precipitant solution and 20% v/v ethylene glycol, picked up in rayon loops, and flash-cooled in a stream of liquid nitrogen vapor at 110 K. Native crystals of Aip1p belonged to the space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 69.1 Å, b = 154.4 Å, and c = 62.1 Å. Crystals of selenomethionine-containing Aip1p belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 60.8 Å, b = 154.5 Å, c = 69.0 Å, and β = 90.65°. Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected on SeMet Aip1p crystals at beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) at 110 K using an ADSC CCD detector (Table I). Data were collected on native crystals at beamline 9-1 at SSRL at 110 K using a Mar 345 imaging plate detector. All of the data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (24Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The positions of 12 selenium sites were located, and multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phases were calculated to a 2.7-Å resolution using SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Density-modified phases using the program RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) yielded interpretable electron density maps with a figure of merit of 0.61. Phases were extended to 2.5 Å using the program CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Two molecules of SeMet Aip1p were then built into the asymmetric unit using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The molecular model was refined by iterative cycles of rigid body refinement, energy minimization, simulated torsional annealing, and individual B-factor refinement in the program CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) followed by model rebuilding in program O. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used in the initial rounds of refinement and released once the model of the protein molecules was completed. The R free value was used to monitor the progress of the refinement and was calculated using 7% of the data. Solvent molecules were added in peaks >3σ in Fo – Fc difference electron density maps and retained if their B-values remained <60 Å2 after a full round of refinement. Two peaks >8σ in Fo – Fc difference electron density maps that were each surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of two histidines and two glutamate residues were modeled as zinc ions and refined with B-values similar to those of the surrounding residues. The observed metal ions were bound in pockets created by the crystal packing of the two SeMet-Aip1p molecules present in the asymmetric unit and are probably not bound to Aip1p outside of the crystal lattice. The final SeMet Aip1p molecular model was refined to a 2.3-Å resolution with R free = 0.257 and R cryst = 0.204. The final model of SeMet-Aip1p comprises residues 2–543 and 550–613 in one Aip1p molecule and residues 2–543 and 550–615 in the other. Superposition of the two SeMet-Aip1p molecules in the asymmetric unit reveals no significant differences with a root mean square difference of 0.31 Å over 606-Cα positions. The structure of native Aip1p was determined by molecular replacement in CNS using the finished model of SeMet Aip1p without solvent molecules or zinc ions as the search model. The molecular model of native Aip1p was refined to a 2.5-Å resolution in the same manner as SeMet Aip1p. Superposition of the final models of native Aip1p and molecule A of SeMet Aip1p in program O shows that the two structures are virtually identical with a root mean square difference of only 0.30 Å over 604-Cα positions.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of Aip1p—The structure of the WD repeat protein Aip1p is formed by two connected seven-bladed β-propellers domains. These domains are both regular and do not contain any significant structural excursions. These are oriented such that the top surfaces of the propellers, those formed by the D-A and B-C loops of each blade, face toward one another (Fig. 1). The resulting overall structure of Aip1p resembles a clamshell opened at an angle of ∼110° with the two doughnut-shaped β-propeller domains of Aip1p twisted ∼15° askew relative to one another. The two β-propeller domains are similar in size, each roughly 45 Å in diameter and 25 Å high. The first β-propeller domain (propeller 1) is formed by blades 1–7 (residues 20–335), and the second β-propeller domain (propeller 2) is formed from blades 8–14 (residues 4–10 and 340–613). The only significant difference in the makeup of the two individual domains is that propeller 1 consists of a continuous string of residues, while the NH2-terminal 10 residues of Aip1p form the final β-strand of blade 14 in propeller 2. This structural motif, sometimes referred to as “molecular velcro,” has been observed in the structures of other WD repeat proteins and other β-propeller proteins as well (18Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 32Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These interactions help to keep propeller 2 tightly folded and are believed to be a major factor in the stability of the WD fold. Therefore, there are two separate segments involved in the region connecting the two domains of Aip1p. These regions are conserved and are composed of residues 10–20 and 337–341. The Interdomain Interface—There is an extensive interface mediated by numerous contacts between the two β-propeller domains of Aip1p. This surface is formed by the d-strands of blades 1, 7, and 14, various residues from blade 8, and the loop connecting blades 7 and 8 (residues 337–341). A hydrogen-bonding network links the side chains of Ser-352 and Ser-354 on strand 8B with the imidazole ring of His-338 from the loop connecting blades 7 and 8 (Fig. 2). Additionally, the hydroxyl group of Ser-352 forms a hydrogen bond with the indole ring nitrogen of Trp-362, possibly helping to orient its hydrophobic side chain. Significant interactions are also observed in the three hydrophobic pockets formed by: (a) Leu-6, Ile-9, Pro-11, Phe-42, and Val-56; (b) Ile-10, Leu-350, Trp-362, and Ile-607; and (c) Pro-14, Leu-315, Leu-321, Phe-323, and Ile-335. Other notable interactions are hydrogen bonds between the side chain amino group of Lys-584 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-63; the guanidinium group of Arg-358 and the carbonyl oxygens of Asp-318 and Gly-337; and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-35, the guanidinium group of Arg-44, and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-14. These interactions may all contribute to the formation of a relatively rigid-connecting region between the two β-propellers of Aip1p that allows very limited movement of its two domains in the absence of its binding partners. Location of Conserved Residues in the Structure of Aip1p— Actin, one of the substrates of Aip1p, is highly conserved, which suggests that the residues mediating the Aip1p-actin interface will also be conserved. Amino acid homology and identity between the yeast Aip1p sequence and that of other eukaryotes is ∼50 and 30%, respectively. Residues in the amino acid sequence of S. cerevisiae Aip1p were considered to be strongly conserved if unchanged or replaced by a homologous residue (Arg ↔ Lys or Asp ↔ Glu) in at least four of six representative Aip1p proteins from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Physarum polycephalum, Dictyostelium discoideum, C. elegans, X. laevis, and Homo sapiens. Dense patches of conserved residues occur in the structure of Aip1p in two areas: neighboring regions in blades 2–5 and at the interface between the two β-propellers (Fig. 3, B and D). The residues that form the C-D loops at the bottom of blades 3, 4, and 5 are highly conserved and are part of a contiguous surface of conserved residues on the side and bottom of propeller 1. At the β-propeller interface, conserved residues involved in the formation of hydrophobic patches include Ile-335 and Trp-362 from blades 7 and 8. All four of the residues involved in the hydrogen-bonding network linking blades 7 and 8 are highly conserved in other organisms as well. Additionally, two glycines at the β-propeller interface, Gly-319 in blade 7 and Gly-357 in blade 8, are highly conserved. Notably, mutation of these glycines in C. elegans Aip1p have been shown to disrupt actin filament organization in body wall muscle (14Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Finally, a few conserved residues are scattered across the solvent-exposed surface on top of the two β-propellers. These residues, which include Arg-18, Phe-208, Lys-340, and Gln-408, may be very important if Aip1p binds part of an actin-cofilin complex between its two β-propeller domains. Structure of Aip1p as a Model for Other WD Proteins—The crystal structure of Aip1p reveals the novel arrangement of two connected WD repeat β-propeller domains in an open clamshell-shaped molecule, an architecture that is almost certainly conserved among species. This arrangement of the β-propeller domains in Aip1p allows for the existence of multiple adjacent protein binding surfaces oriented at specific angles with respect to one another. In related proteins with multiple WD repeat-containing domains, it may be particularly advantageous for binding large substrates, such as protein complexes, or the simultaneous binding of multiple target proteins. Another interesting aspect of the structure is that both of the β-propellers in Aip1p contain seven blades, which supports the idea that a WD repeat structure constructed from multiple seven-bladed β-propellers is more favorable than a single β-propeller containing a large number of blades. A number of other proteins are predicted to contain more than seven WD repeats, and their structures may also be composed of multiple seven-bladed β-propellers as opposed to a single β-propeller constructed from more than eight blades. The structure of Aip1p may serve as a good model for the WD repeat regions of these proteins. One well studied example is human apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), a protein that is 24% identical to homologous regions of Aip1p. APAF1 is a component in a 7-fold symmetrical, 1.4-MDa complex dubbed the apoptosome, a key complex in the activation of an initiator caspase. A substantial portion of APAF1 is predicted to be composed of as many as 12 or 13 WD repeats (33Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 10: 285-288Google Scholar). Cryo-electron microscrope images of the apoptosome, a heptameric complex containing APAF1 and cytochrome c, reveal that the WD repeat domains of APAF1 form spokes radiating from the caspase-binding hub of this complex (34Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Although the structure has been determined at a relatively low resolution (27 Å), the cryo-electron microscrope electron density of the domains in the spoke regions is consistent with a clamshell-shaped molecule formed by two β-propeller domains with one or two cytochrome c molecules bound between the β-propeller domains (34Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Hidden WD Repeats—Because of the diversity found in these motifs, identifying WD repeats by sequence alone appears to be difficult. Varying numbers of repeats have been reported in the Aip1p proteins, ranging from 7 in Xenopus (12Okada K. Obinata T. Abe H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 9 in Dictyostelium (13Konzok A. Weber I. Simmeth E. Hacker U. Maniak M. Muller-Taubenberger A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and chick (35Adler H.J. Winnicki R.S. Gong T.-W.L. Lomax M.I. Genomics. 1999; 56: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to 10 in C. elegans (14Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Based upon sequence and functional conservation among these related proteins, it seems clear that all will fold into a homologous two-domain structure. Moreover, it is clear from the Aip1p structure that all of the “extra” blades are derived from hidden WD repeats. Structure-based sequence alignments of these repeats within Aip1p (Fig. 4) suggest plausible albeit weaker homology with the repeat consensus. Structural overlap of these repeats within the Aip1p model (Fig. 5) confirms that they are authentic with root mean square deviations for the Cα positions in the A, B, and C strands of each WD repeat relative to those in the sixth WD repeat (residues 236–280) ranging from 0.49 to 1.89 Å. These results collectively suggest that there may be many of these repeats that have yet to be identified in the sequence data.Fig. 5A superposition of the β-propeller blades in Aip1p reveals that the majority of the structural divergence is contained within the loops connecting the strands. Each blade was defined as the residues from the beginning of the A strand and ending with the residue before the beginning of the next A strand. The blade 14 was defined as residues 2–22 and 588–615. Each blade is colored in the same manner as in Fig. 1. The β-strands are labeled A, B, C, and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aip1p-Actin Interactions—Recent studies have shown that the interactions of Aip1p with F-actin strongly depend on the presence of cofilin (15Okada K. Blanchoin L. Abe H. Chen H. Pollard T.D. Bamberg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43011-43016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), implying that Aip1p binds to newly formed barbed ends of actin while cofilin is still bound. However, the specific manner in which Aip1p interacts with F-actin and cofilin is still unclear, as the residues on Aip1p that directly interact with F-actin have not yet been identified. The structures and amino acid sequences of actins are highly conserved, and it seems likely that any residues in Aip1p that directly interact with F-actin would also be conserved. A potential interaction site is the large patch of conserved residues along the circumference and bottom loops of blades 2–5 (Fig. 3). This surface of Aip1p includes the residues Arg-130, Arg-172, Lys-194, and Lys-237, which form a positively charged area that could interact strongly with residues on the surface of F-actin. A second potential binding area for an actin-cofilin complex is the region between the two β-propellers within the Aip1p clamshell. This space between the β-propeller domains measures ∼50 Å across the clamshell and maximally 15 Å deep and, by inspection, appears to be large enough to accommodate at least part of such a complex. This would implicate the top surfaces of the β-propellers of Aip1p in binding, a region commonly used by WD repeat proteins to bind partner proteins (18Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The interface between the two domains of Aip1p consists of hydrophobic pockets formed partly by residues on loops connecting the two propellers and a number of hydrogen-bonding interactions that link blades 7 and 8. Due to these interactions, the hinge region connecting the two β-propellers is likely to be inflexible, preventing significant changes in the orientation of the two domains relative to one another in the absence of binding partners. Many of the residues involved in these interactions are conserved in other organisms as well, implying that any rigidity they impart on the Aip1p interface is probably also conserved. A loss of function was observed C. elegans Aip1p mutants (14Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) corresponding to G319E and G357E in S. cerevisiae Aip1p. Based upon the structure of S. cerevisiae Aip1p, the G319E mutation would cause significant steric clashes between the mutated residue and either Gln-13, Asn-339, or Arg-358. At the very least, this mutation would probably result in the displacement of the B-C loop in blade 7 and the disruption of the hydrogen bonds between Asp-318 and Arg-358 at the β-propeller interface. Similarly, the G357E mutation would cause a steric clash between the mutated residue and the D-A loop connecting blades 8 and 9. This mutation would probably cause the displacement of the B-C loop of blade 8, disrupting the interfacial hydrogen-bonding network formed by Arg-358 and possibly disrupting the interactions formed by Trp-362. These observations support the hypothesis that disruption of the β-propeller interface and displacement of the β-propellers from their proper orientation prevents Aip1p from recognizing its substrate. A lack in flexibility may actually aid Aip1p function, possibly making it more specific for particular actin-cofilin complexes, such as those found at the barbed ends of actin filaments (15Okada K. Blanchoin L. Abe H. Chen H. Pollard T.D. Bamberg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43011-43016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The interaction of Aip1p with F-actin appears to be dependent upon the binding of cofilin, as most of the mutations in actin that should hinder cofilin binding also interrupt the interaction of actin with Aip1p (10Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, a double mutation has been made in actin (E253A, R254A) that disrupts interactions with Aip1p but does not interfere with cofilin-actin interactions (10Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Aip1p interacts with actin directly in subdomain 4 and through cofilin-mediated interactions, and that all of these interactions are crucial for proper Aip1p function (36Holmes K.C.

It seems likely that one of more of the patches of conserved residues on the surface of Aip1p are involved in these interactions, and more work on the Aip1p-cofilin-actin system is necessary to elucidate their specific nature. In these efforts, the structure of Aip1p can be used as a tool in the identification of key residues that interact with F-actin and cofilin. We thank Kathryn Kavanagh for help with data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2036343137,"Twinfilin is a highly conserved actin monomer-binding protein that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in organisms from yeast to mammals. In addition to the previously characterized mammalian twinfilin-1, a second protein with ∼65% sequence identity to twinfilin-1 exists in mouse and humans. However, previous studies failed to identify any actin binding activity in this protein (Rohwer, A., Kittstein, W., Marks, F., and Gschwendt, M. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 263, 518–525). Here we show that this protein, which we named twinfilin-2, is indeed an actin monomer-binding protein. Similar to twinfilin-1, mouse twinfilin-2 binds ADP-G-actin with a higher affinity (KD = 0.12 μm) than ATP-G-actin (KD = 1.96 μm) and efficiently inhibits actin filament assembly in vitro. Both mouse twinfilins inhibit the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers and directly interact with capping protein. Furthermore, the actin interactions of mouse twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 are inhibited by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. Although biochemically very similar, our Northern blots and in situ hybridizations show that these two proteins display distinct expression patterns. Twinfilin-1 is the major isoform in embryos and in most adult mouse non-muscle cell-types, whereas twinfilin-2 is the predominant isoform of adult heart and skeletal muscles. Studies with isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated that although the two proteins show similar localizations in unstimulated cells, they are regulated by different mechanisms. The small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 induce the redistribution of twinfilin-1 to membrane ruffles and cell-cell contacts, respectively, but do not affect the localization of twinfilin-2. Taken together, these data show that mammals have two twinfilin isoforms, which are differentially expressed and regulated through distinct cellular signaling pathways.

Actin is a conserved protein that is necessary for a large number of cellular processes including cell division, movement, polarized growth, secretion, and endocytosis. In cells, actin filaments form dynamic structures that rapidly assemble and disassemble in a coordinated fashion. Actin dynamics are tightly regulated by an array of actin-binding proteins that interact with actin filaments and/or monomeric actin. The pool of unpolymerized actin in non-muscle cells can constitute up to 50% of the total cytoplasmic actin, and thus the various actin monomer-binding proteins play an important role in actin dynamics by regulating the size, localizations, and dynamics of the cellular actin monomer pool (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Three families of small actin monomer-binding proteins are conserved in evolution, existing in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals. These are profilins, ADF 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CNS, central nervous system; DTT, dithiothreitol; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PNS, peripheral nervous system; E, embryonic day.1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CNS, central nervous system; DTT, dithiothreitol; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PNS, peripheral nervous system; E, embryonic day.cofilins, and twinfilins. In addition to these evolutionarily conserved proteins, a fourth class of small actin monomer-binding proteins, the β-thymosins, exists in vertebrates. β-Thymosins are small peptides that bind specifically to ATP-G-actin, prevent actin filament assembly, and thus function as actin monomer-sequestering agents in certain specialized vertebrate cell types (2Huff T. Muller C.S. Otto A.M. Netzker R. Hannappel E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Profilins are ubiquitous actin monomer-binding proteins with a molecular weight of 12–16 kDa. Profilins have a higher affinity for ATP-actin monomers than they do for ADP-G-actin, and they also interact with phospholipids and polyproline (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). These ubiquitous proteins can affect several different aspects of actin dynamics. In the absence of free filament-barbed ends, profilins function as actin monomer-sequestering proteins, whereas in the presence of free barbed ends, profilins promote actin filament assembly (3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 4Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most profilins also enhance the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers, and at least in yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, this activity is essential in vivo (5Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Wolven A.K. Belmont L.D. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ADF/cofilins are small (molecular mass = 15–19 kDa) essential proteins composed of a single ADF-H domain. They interact with both actin monomers and filaments and bind ADP-actin with a higher affinity than they do to ATP-actin (7Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry R. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). ADF/cofilins enhance actin filament dynamics by depolymerizing filaments from their pointed ends (8Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry R. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and by severing actin filaments, thereby increasing the amount of filament ends (9Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15538-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ADF/cofilins inhibit the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers (10Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Twinfilin was originally identified from the yeast S. cerevisiae by its sequence homology to ADF/cofilin proteins (12Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J.T.V. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Twinfilin is composed of two ADF/cofilin-like domains (ADF-H domains) that are separated by a short linker region and flanked by a short tail region. The two ADF-H domains are 20% homologous to ADF/cofilin and to each other (12Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J.T.V. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although twinfilin shares similar building blocks to ADF/cofilins, these two proteins have profound differences in their biochemical properties. Whereas ADF/cofilins bind both actin monomers and filaments, twinfilins interact only with monomeric actin and do not promote filament depolymerization (13Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar to ADF/cofilins, twinfilins bind ADP-G-actin with a higher affinity than they do to ATP-G-actin and have slower k off rates from actin monomers and prevent filament assembly much more efficiently than ADF/cofilins (16Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Twinfilins also interact with heterodimeric capping proteins, and their physiological function may be to localize actin monomers to the cellular sites of rapid actin dynamics (16Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Palmgren S. Vartiainen M. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 881-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, there are typically several isoforms of both ADF/cofilin and profilin. The three mammalian ADF/cofilin isoforms (cofilin-1, cofilin-2, and ADF) are expressed in distinct tissues, and their affinities for actin monomers and their effects on actin filament depolymerization and nucleation differ. This finding suggests that the three mammalian ADF/cofilin isoforms have evolved to fulfill the specific requirements for actin dynamics in differentiated cell types (19Vartiainen M.K. Mustonen T. Mattila P.K. Ojala P.J. Thesleff I. Partanen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Yeoh S. Pope B. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 911-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Also the three profilin isoforms in mammals (profilin I, profilin IIa, and profilin IIb) show cell type-specific expression patterns (21Lambrechts A. Braun A. Joncheere V. Aszodi A. Lanier L.M. Robbens J. Van Colen I. Vandekerckhove J. Fässler R. Ampe C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8209-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Di Nardo A. Gareus R. Kwiatkowski D. Witke W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and display differences in their affinities for actin and their other ligands: polyproline and phospholipids (21Lambrechts A. Braun A. Joncheere V. Aszodi A. Lanier L.M. Robbens J. Van Colen I. Vandekerckhove J. Fässler R. Ampe C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8209-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Di Nardo A. Gareus R.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine whether there are also several twinfilin isoforms in mammals, we carried out searches on mouse and human sequence databases. These searches revealed one mouse and one human protein with ∼65% sequence identities to previously characterized mouse and human twinfilin-1. Here, we show that the mouse protein, which we named twinfilin-2, is an actin monomer-binding protein with similar biochemical activities to other known twinfilins. Our analysis also revealed that the two mouse twinfilin isoforms have distinct expression patterns. Twinfilin-1 is expressed with variable levels in most cell types of the developing and adult mouse, whereas elevated levels of twinfilin-2 expression was detected in maturing skeletal and heart muscles. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that the subcellular localizations of the two mouse twinfilin isoforms are regulated through different signaling pathways. Plasmid Construction—The DNA fragment corresponding to mouse twinfilin-2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from an embryonic days (E)7–20 mouse embryo cDNA library. The oligonucleotides introduced NcoI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR product, respectively. The PCR fragment was digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into the pGAT2 vector (25Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pPL68. The plasmid for expressing mouse twinfilin-1 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (pPL78) has been described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For expression of His-tagged versions of twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 in Escherichia coli, the plasmids pPL78 and pPL68 were digested with NcoI and HindIII and the cDNA fragments were cloned into the pHAT2 vector (25Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to create plasmids pPL144 and pPL182. For in situ hybridizations, the full-length mouse twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 cDNAs were subcloned into pBSIIKS vector to yield plasmids pPL184 and pPL185. The vectors for expressing mouse α1β2 and chicken α1β1-capping proteins in E. coli were kindly provided by Drs. John Cooper (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and Takashi Obinata (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan), and have been described previously (16Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The plasmids for expressing Rho family GTPases in mammalian cells have been described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteins—The expression and purification of mouse twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 as GST fusion proteins from the plasmids pPL68 and pPL78 were carried out as described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For expressing His-tagged mouse twinfilins, 6000 ml of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmid pPL144 (twinfilin-1) or pPL182 (twinfilin-2) were grown in Luria broth medium to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm and expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 3 h after induction, washed once with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), resuspended to 40 ml of 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and eluted with a linear 20–250 mm imidazole gradient. The peak fractions containing the His-tagged twinfilins were concentrated to 1.5 ml in Centricon 10-kDa cutoff devices and loaded onto a Superdex-75 HiLoad gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. The peak fractions containing twinfilins were pooled, concentrated in Centricon 10-kDa cutoff devices to a final concentration of 100–300 μm, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –70 °C. Chicken α1β1 and mouse α1β2-capping proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET expression plasmids containing the cDNAs for α and β subunits of capping protein. Cells were grown in 6000 ml of Luria broth medium to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, and expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by 3 h after induction, washed once with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged in a Beckmann SS-34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was applied onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and the proteins were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing the capping protein were pooled, concentrated to a volume of ∼2 ml, diluted 1:20 in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and applied onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0). Proteins were eluted with a linear 20–250 mm KH2PO4 gradient, and the fractions containing capping protein were pooled, concentrated to 1.5 ml, and applied onto a Superdex-75 column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. The peak fractions containing the capping protein were concentrated to 100–300 μm and stored at –70 °C. Rabbit muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder as described previously (27Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), and the recombinant mouse cofilin-1 was purified as described by Vartiainen et al. (19Vartiainen M.K.

The human platelet actin and pyrene-labeled actin were from the Cytoskeleton Inc. Actin Monomer-binding Assays—The change in the fluorescence of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled G-actin was used to monitor the binding of twinfilins to actin monomers. Actin was labeled by NBD-Cl as described previously (28Detmers P. Weber A. Elzinga M. Stephens R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weeds A.G. Harris H. Gratzer W. Gooch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ADP-actin was prepared by incubating NBD-actin with hexokinase-agarose beads (Sigma) and glucose for 2 h at +4 °C (30Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The final concentration of actin in these assays was 0.2 μm, and the twinfilin concentration was varied from 0.05 to 14 μm. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in F-buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ADP or ATP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl). The data were analyzed as described previously (17Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The rate of nucleotide exchange on actin monomers in the absence and presence of twinfilin was measured as described previously (10Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Actin Assembly Assays—Kinetics of actin filament assembly was monitored by pyrene fluorescence with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm using a BioLogic MOS-250 fluorescence spectrophotometer. 54 μl of 3.9 μm actin (1:6 pyrene actin:human platelet actin) in G-buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2) was mixed with 7 μl of G-buffer or 15/30 μm twinfilin-1 or twinfilin-2 in the presence or absence of PI(4,5)P2 (Matreya Inc). Polymerization was induced by the addition of 7 μl of 10× initiation mixture (1 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP). Native Gel Electrophoresis—The interaction of mouse twinfilins with PI(4,5)P2 was examined by native gel electrophoresis as described for yeast twinfilin (16Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Final concentrations of twinfilin in these assays were 4 μm, and the PI(4,5)P2 concentrations were 0, 20, or 30 μm. Twinfilin-capping protein interactions were studied on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. Purified mouse twinfilins and chicken α1β1- or mouse α1β2-capping protein (either alone or in a mixture with each other) was diluted to desired concentrations in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. 15-μl aliquots of the protein samples were then mixed with 5 μl of loading buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 50% glycerol) and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run for 150 min at 100 V by using buffer (25 mm Tris, 194 mm glycine (pH 8.5), 0.5 mm DTT), and the proteins were detected either by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blotting with anti-twinfilin antibodies. Northern Blotting—Twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 cDNA probes were prepared as described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both twinfilin probes were hybridized to commercial mouse embryo and adult mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) according to manufacturer's instructions. The Northern blot filters were then exposed on a PhosphorImager screen for 120 min (with the exception of 600 min in the case of embryo blot for twinfilin-2). RNA in Situ Hybridization—Radioactive in situ hybridization assays were performed on sections from paraffin-embedded mouse embryos or adult tissues as described previously (31Rice D.B. Aberg T. Chan Y. Tang Z. Kettunen P.J. Pakarinen L. Maxon R.E. Thesleff I. Development. 2000; 127: 1845-1855PubMed Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes for twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 were transcribed from plasmids pPL184 and pPL185, respectively. Antibodies—Generation of rabbit anti-mouse twinfilin-1 antibody has been described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, because our studies showed that the antibody also cross-reacted with mouse twinfilin-2, this antibody was further purified by removing the twinfilin-2-recognizing fraction by a twinfilin-2 affinity column. Chicken anti-mouse twinfilin-2 IgY was generated in Agrisera Inc (Vännäs, Sweden) by immunizing chicken with recombinant His-tagged twinfilin-2. For affinity purification, recombinant twinfilin-2 was immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and the chicken antibody was purified from 2 ml of serum according to manufacturer's instructions. Because this antibody also cross-reacted with twinfilin-1, the fraction recognizing twinfilin-1 was removed by a twinfilin-1 affinity column. Cell Culture, Immunofluorescence, and Western Blotting—NIH 3T3 and Neuro2A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For immunofluorescence studies, Neuro2A cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-ornithine (1 mg/ml). For studies with dominant active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmids using the Roche Applied Science FuGENE 6 transfection system according to manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anti-twinfilin-1 antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution and anti-twinfilin-2 at a 1:300 dilution. Rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used at a 1:300 dilution. For Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared as described previously (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the total protein concentrations were measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting was performed according to instructions from Agrisera Inc. Anti-twinfilin-1 antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution, anti-twinfilin-2 was used at 1:500, and anti-cofilin-1 was used at 1:1000. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Inc.) were used at a 1:15,000 dilution. Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer using calculated extinction coefficients at A 280 for mouse twinfilin-1 (ϵ = 36,400 m–1 cm–1), mouse twinfilin-2 (ϵ = 31,300 M–1 cm–1), mouse cofilin-1 (ϵ = 13,490 M–1 cm–1), and chicken α1β1-capping protein (ϵ = 78,270 M–1 cm–1) and at A 290 for actin (ϵ = 26,600 M–1 cm–1). Twinfilin is an actin monomer-binding protein that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in yeast (13Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), fruitfly (15Wahlström G. Vartiainen M. Yamamoto L. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. Heino T.I. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In our data base searches, we identified a new twinfilin-related protein in human and mouse and named it twinfilin-2. The human and mouse twinfilin-2 are 97% identical at the amino acid level and show ∼65% sequence identity to the previously characterized human and mouse twinfilin-1 (14Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mammalian twinfilin-2 proteins appear to have similar domain structures to other known twinfilins, and the residues that were shown to be important for actin monomer binding in yeast twinfilin (16Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and mouse twinfilin-1 (32Paavilainen V.O. Merckel M.C. Falck S. Ojala P.J.

However, the human homologue of twinfilin-2 (A6-related protein) had been previously identified as a binding partner of the catalytic domain of protein kinase Cδ, and these earlier studies failed to detect any actin-related activities in this protein. These data suggested that despite the strong sequence homology to other twinfilins, it would not be an actin-binding protein (33Rohwer A. Kittstein W. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mouse Twinfilin-2 Is an Actin Monomer-binding Protein—To examine the biochemical activities of mouse twinfilin-2, we expressed it as a GST fusion protein in E. coli cells. GST was subsequently removed by thrombin digestion, and the recombinant protein was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant mouse twinfilin-2 was fully soluble and monomeric according to its elution position from a gel-filtration column. We recently showed that the fluorescence of muscle NBD-G-actin is modulated upon binding to mouse twinfilin-1, thereby providing a means to determine the affinity of twinfilin-1/actin monomer complex (17Ojala P.J.

Therefore, we examined whether mouse twinfilin-2 would also affect the fluorescence of NBD-G-actin. The assays were carried out under physiological ionic concentrations and by using NBD-labeled platelet actin. The binding of twinfilin-2 resulted in a 50% enhancement in the fluorescence of NBD-G-actin, indicating that twinfilin-2 also interacts with actin monomers (Fig. 2). The KD values of twinfilin-2 for ADP-G-actin and ATP-G-actin were 0.12 and 1.96 μm, respectively. A similar assay with twinfilin-1 provided KD values of 0.09 μm (ADP-G-actin) and 1.77 μm (ATP-G-actin). Therefore, both mouse twinfilins bind ADP-G-actin with ∼ 20-fold higher affinity than the ATP-G-actin, and"

As an important source of nitric oxide during inflammation, human inducible nitric oxide synthase also plays a role in the regulation of cytokine-driven cell proliferation and apoptosis. The role of mTOR and PI3K in the activation of human inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription by cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated in lung epithelial adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. LY294002, a dual mTOR and PI3K inhibitor, blocked human inducible nitric oxide synthase (hiNOS) promoter activation and mRNA induction by cytokines and LPS in a PI3K-independent fashion.

Consistent with dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K by LY294002, dominant-negative mTOR, anti-mTOR small interfering RNA, or rapamycin each inhibited phosphorylation of STAT1 only in the presence of wortmannin. LPS/IFN-γ led to the formation of a macromolecular complex containing mTOR, STAT1, as well as protein kinase Cδ, a known STAT1α kinase.

When exposed to cytokines, bacterial products, or viral infection, cells can rapidly initiate the activation of genes encoding proteins that modulate the innate immune response (1Strieter R.M.

We studied the molecular mechanisms leading to the activation of hiNOS transcription as a paradigm to identify intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gene expression in response to inflammatory mediators. Characterization of the hiNOS promoter structure and function demonstrated that full transcriptional induction by inflammatory mediators required the integration of multiple signaling pathways by the coordinated binding and activation of specific transcription factors. NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent AP-1, activation and binding were required for full stimulation of the hiNOS promoter in response to cytokines and LPS (6Kristof A.S. Marks-Konczalik J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8445-8452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Optimal hiNOS transcription also required activation by IFN-γ of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) (8Ganster R.W. Taylor B.S. Shao L. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1α at Tyr-701 by Janus kinase led to SH2 domain-dependent dimerization, and was required for nuclear translocation (9Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Unlike Tyr-701, phosphorylation at Ser-727 was required for full STAT1 transcriptional activity, but not dimerization or nuclear translocation (9Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). The signaling events that lead to the activation of STAT1-dependent genes via phosphorylation at Ser-727 are thought to be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, calmodulin-dependent kinase II, or atypical protein kinase C isoforms (PKCδ or ϵ) (10Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Uddin S. Sassano A.

In a pharmacological screen to evaluate the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in control of hiNOS transcription, the inhibitor LY294002, but not wortmannin, blocked hiNOS promoter activation in response to LPS and IFN-γ, suggesting the involvement of a PI3K-independent target for LY294002. Because LY294002 was also a potent inhibitor of mTOR (13Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and mTOR regulated phophorylation of STAT3 at Ser-727 (14Yokogami K. Wakisaka S. Avruch J. Reeves S.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mTOR played a role in gene induction through phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727. mTOR is a protein kinase that regulates cell growth and protein synthesis in response to mitogens and nutrients by activating p70 S6 kinase and 4EBP1 (15Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Although many cellular effects of mTOR were discovered by virtue of its sensitivity to rapamycin, a TOR-containing complex was recently described in yeast, the function of which was unaffected by rapamycin (16Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Here, in mammalian cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines, we demonstrate that mTOR converges with the PI3K pathway to activate STAT1 via phosphorylation at Ser-727. The activation of STAT1 is regulated by mTOR kinase activity independent of p70 S6 kinase, is rapamycin-insensitive, and coincides with the formation of a STAT1·mTOR macromolecular complex that also includes PKCδ. These data establish a novel role for mTOR in the control of transcription via activation of STAT1 that is independent of the p70 S6 kinase pathway. Cell Culture and Cytokine Induction—A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL 185) were cultured and stimulated with cytokine mixture (CM) containing IFN-γ, 100 units/ml, interleukin-1β, 0.5 ng/ml, and tumor necrosis factor-α, 10 ng/ml (all from Roche Applied Science), or a mixture of LPS, 100 μg/ml (Sigma), and IFN-γ, 100 units/ml as previously described (6Kristof A.S. Marks-Konczalik J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8445-8452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, LY294002, and/or wortmannin (Biomol or Calbiochem) dissolved in Me2SO were added directly to the cells as indicated. Transient Transfection and Determination of hiNOS Promoter or STAT1 Reporter Activity—A549 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), 16 μg/ml, with luciferase reporter or mammalian expression vector, 1 μg/ml. Experiments were performed after 36 h, followed by measurement of luciferase activity (Dual Luciferase Assay kit, Promega) or protein immunodetection. In experiments involving transfection with STAT1 reporter vector or cotransfection with pUSE-amp-myr-p110α, 25 ng/ml pRL-TK (thymidine kinase-driven Renilla luciferase reporter, Promega) was included in the transfection mixture, and promoter activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Synthesis and Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)— The following DNA oligonucleotide templates were synthesized (Invitrogen) for use in a T7 polymerase-based in vitro transcription reaction (Silencer siRNA construction kit, Ambion) to generate double-stranded 21-bp RNA with dideoxythymidine overhangs complementary to a 21-bp region in the human mTOR mRNA: antisense, 5′-AACTCCGAGAGATGAGTCAAGCCTGTCTC-3′; sense, 5′-AACTTGACTCATCTCTCGGAGCCTGTCTC-3′. The sequence was not present in any other known mRNA by BLAST analysis. siRNA that was not complementary to any mRNA sequence by BLAST analysis (Ambion) was used as a negative control. A549 cells were plated at a density of 80,000 cells/ml and transfected after 24 h without or with 10 pmol siRNA and 5 μl LipofectAMINE 2000 as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 36 h, experiments were performed as indicated. Plasmids and Antibodies—The plasmid containing the 8.3-kb human iNOS promoter linked to luciferase cDNA (PGL3-hiNOS) has been described and characterized previously (7Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C.

Mammalian expression vector containing the constitutively active PI3K catalytic subunit (pUSE-amp-p110α) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies, and the STAT1 homodimer reporter vector was obtained from Clontech (GAS-Luc). Antibodies raised against the following proteins were employed for Western blots or immunoprecipitations: STAT1, STAT1α, PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-STAT1 Ser-727, phospho-STAT1 Tyr-701, phospho-mTOR Ser-2481, phospho-mTOR Ser-2448, mTOR (Upstate); mTOR (BD Biosciences); hemagglutinin (Covance); protein kinase B, phospho-protein kinase B Ser-473 (Cell Signaling Technology). Measurement of Protein Levels and Phosphorylation—A549 cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). After freezing and thawing, cells were homogenized on ice in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged (5 min, 1000 × g), and supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. For each gel, equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane before immunoblotting with primary antibodies as indicated. Membranes were treated with anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Promega) linked to horseradish peroxidase, developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Super-Signal West Pico, Pierce), and exposed to x-ray film. Probe Synthesis for Northern Blotting—The human iNOS cDNA probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a human lung cDNA library as template. The oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the hiNOS gene boundary sequences used to generate double-stranded DNA probes were as follows: hiNOS-sense (2125–2144), 5′-TACAGGCTCGTGCAGGACTC-3′; and hiNOS-antisense (2356–2375), 5′-CCACTCGCTCCAGGATACCT-3′. Probes labeled with [32P]dCTP (Rad Prime kit, GIBCO) were purified and denatured before addition to hybridization buffer to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cpm/ml. Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot—Samples (10 μg/lane) of total RNA isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Loading consistency was assessed by examination of ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal bands. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (BrightStar Plus, Ambion), pre-hybridized for 1 h, and hybridized (overnight at 42 °C) with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for hiNOS. Membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C. All procedures were carried out using reagents from Ambion according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation—After incubation, A549 cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in homogenization buffer. Lysates were centrifuged (5 min, 1000 × g) and supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. After clearing lysates with 5 μg normal IgG and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) for 1 h, samples (500 μg) of proteins from high-speed supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of antibody overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were captured with 20 μl protein G-Sepharose and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Pellets were washed twice with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline and boiled in sample buffer for 5 min. Equal volumes of supernatants were boiled in sample buffer for 5 min. Western blots were performed as indicated. Microarray Analysis—RNA from A549 cells was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For each experimental condition, biotin-labeled RNA probe was synthesized from a double-stranded cDNA template generated from 5 μg of total RNA using protocols and reagents outlined in the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). Integrity and purity of the RNA and cDNA were assessed by gel electrophoresis and UV absorbance. Microarray chips (Hu95aVer2, Affymetrix) were incubated with fragmented RNA probe, washed, and read using a laser scanner (Hewlett Packard). Images were processed using Micro Array Suite software (Affymetrix). The results reflect duplicate samples analyzed using Genespring 4.2.1 software (Silicon Genetics). The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample. Each measurement for each gene was divided by this calculated positive control. The measurement for each gene in each sample was divided by the corresponding value in the control samples. Inhibition of a LY294002-sensitive Pathway Reveals a PI3K-independent Mechanism for Activation of hiNOS Transcription—To investigate the role of mTOR and PI3K in regulation of the hiNOS promoter, pharmacological, and molecular inhibitors were employed. LY294002, but not wortmannin, inhibited hiNOS promoter activation in response to cytokine mixture (CM: tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, IFN-γ) or LPS/IFN-γ (Fig. 1A). Previous studies (19Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Diaz-Guerra M.J. Castrillo A. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6184-6190PubMed Google Scholar) had demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin potentiated iNOS transcriptional activation, suggesting that LY294002 might inhibit hiNOS transcription via a PI3K-independent mechanism. Consistent with these reports, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the PI3K catalytic unit (p110 CA) suppressed hiNOS promoter activation, an effect that was reversed by wortmannin, but not by LY294002 (Fig. 1B). Northern blots confirmed that LY294002 and wortmannin differentially modulated mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, the stability of wortmannin in solution might be questioned; however, the opposite effects on activation of hiNOS transcription occurred despite equal attenuation of PI3K-dependent protein kinase B phosphorylation by LY294002 or wortmannin (Fig. 1D). In addition, the potentiation of hiNOS promoter activity, and the reversal of p110α-induced suppression of hiNOS promoter activity by wortmannin was persistent at 6 h post-stimulation with LPS/IFN-γ. These results indicate that LY294002 inhibited a rate-limiting step in hiNOS transcriptional activation distinct from PI3K. Inhibition of a LY294002-sensitive Pathway Inhibits the Induction of a Discrete Subset of STAT1-dependent Pro-apoptotic Genes—To define the LY294002-sensitive reaction involved in control of transcription, we sought a PI3K-independent pharmacological target. Gene expression microarray experiments were performed using RNA isolated from cells treated with LY294002 or wortmannin during incubation with LPS/IFN-γ. Of 12,652 probe sets, 40–45% hybridized under any given experimental condition. Using microarray analysis software (GeneSpring ver 4.2.1, Silicon Genetics), the data set was queried for genes whose expression was perturbed by LY294002 or wortmannin in a fashion similar to that of hiNOS (Fig. 2, Pattern A). Of the 234 genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.95, 38 were statistically significant by ANOVA (each p < 0.1, Table I). Of these, 3 unique mRNAs hybridized to two different probes for the same gene on the array (i.e. Fas/ Apo-1, RREST1, SP-100), and sixteen were related to apoptosis and/or growth inhibition. The expression of 3 genes representing the proximal portion of the FasL-stimulated apoptosis pathway was co-regulated, and included Fas, Caspase-8- and Fas-associated death domain-like apoptosis regulator, and Bcl-2 homology 3-interacting domain death agonist (BID). Ten of these genes were known to be regulated by STAT1, and one, Fas, specifically by phosphorylation at Ser-727 (21Stephanou A. Scarabelli T.M. Brar B.K. Nakanishi Y. Matsumura M. Knight R.A.

Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), wortmannin inhibited the activation of p70 S6 kinase and PI3K independent of mTOR (22Romanelli A. Dreisbach V.C. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40281-40289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify genes likely to be regulated independent of mTOR, the data set was queried for genes whose expression is inhibited by LY294002 or wortmannin in the presence of LPS/IFN-γ (Fig. 2, Pattern B). Of 108 genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.95, 44 exhibited statistically significant expression in at least 1 experimental condition (data not shown). The genes correlating with pattern B were all different from those correlating with pattern A, indicating the absence of overlap between LY294002- and wortmannin-sensitive pathways. Thus, LY294002 unmasks a discrete subset of genes related to apoptosis and STAT1 activation in the presence of LPS/IFN-γ. LY294002 Inhibits Activation of STAT1 by Attenuating Phosphorylation at Ser-727—STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser-727 in response to IFN-γ was enhanced in the presence of LPS (Fig. 3A), consistent with additive agonist effects on intracellular signaling. Phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 was detected in unstimulated cells and increased over 30 min in response to LPS/IFN-γ. LY294002, but not wortmannin, inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser-727 (Fig. 3B), consistent with their effects on hiNOS transcription (Fig. 1A), as well as a role for STAT1 in activation of hiNOS transcription (8Ganster R.W. Taylor B.S. Shao L. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar). LY294002 had no effect on STAT1 phospho-Tyr-701 levels, indicating that the LY294002 target is independent of the Janus kinase tyrosine kinase pathway. LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated STAT1 activity was inhibited by LY294002, and not by wortmannin, providing a functional correlate for phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 (Fig. 3C). Consistent with its effect on mTOR, LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at T389 and mTOR at Ser-2481 (autophosphorylation site), both markers of mTOR kinase activity (Fig. 3D) (23Peterson R.T.

Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway can regulate mTOR-dependent signaling via protein kinase B phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448, or through phosphorylation of the mTOR suppressor TSC2 (25Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 26Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). However, in A549 cells, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448, suggesting that direct regulation of mTOR by protein kinase B was unlikely to affect downstream signaling in response to LPS/IFN-γ. Moreover, wortmannin did not inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2481, confirming a previous study that demonstrated a weak inhibitory effect of wortmannin on mTOR kinase activity (13Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous study (22Romanelli A. Dreisbach V.C. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40281-40289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrating PI3K regulation of p70 S6 kinase independent of mTOR, wortmannin inhibited phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at Thr-389 (Fig. 3D) but not phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, LY294002, but not wortmannin, inhibits LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated mTOR activity. Because wortmannin effectively blocked phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at Thr-389, activation of STAT1 is independent of p70 S6 kinase. mTOR Kinase Activity Regulates Phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727—Unlike LY294002, a dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitor, rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR by inducing a rapamycin·FKBP12·mTOR complex, did not block STAT1 activation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, either (i) the effect of LY294002 on activation of STAT1 was not via mTOR; (ii) simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and PI3K was required; or (iii) the mTOR·STAT1 complex was resistant to the effects of rapamycin. To demonstrate the requirement of mTOR kinase activity for phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727, cells were transfected with empty vector (EV), or mammalian expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type or dominant-negative (NK) mTOR. Overexpression of wild-type mTOR increased basal and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–8). Consistent with the lack of rapamycin sensitivity, overexpression of dominant-negative mTOR alone failed to reduce LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10). Moreover, although rapamycin abolished phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at Thr-389, phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 in cells overexpressing wild-type mTOR was not affected (data not shown). To mimic the dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K by LY29002, we assessed STAT1 phosphorylation in the presence of kinase-dead mTOR and wortmannin. Simultaneous inhibition of PI3K and mTOR decreased phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727, indicating that under conditions of reduced PI3K activity, mTOR is required for LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated STAT1 activation (Fig. 4A, lanes 11 and 12). Wortmannin alone did not attenuate phosphorylation of STAT1 in cells transfected with empty vector or wild-type mTOR, suggesting that PI3K inhibition did not override mTOR-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 8). Overexpression of dominant-negative mTOR increased total STAT1 levels, in part explaining the increase in basal phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 (Fig. 4A, lanes 9–12). When densitometry was performed, and phospho-STAT1 levels were normalized to total STAT1 levels, the reduction in phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 due to overexpression of dominant-negative mTOR in the presence of wortmannin was confirmed (Fig. 4B). Moreover, rapamycin and wortmannin had an additive inhibitory effect on STAT1 activation by LPS/IFN-γ (Fig. 4C). In agreement with the experiments using overexpressed dominant-negative mTOR, transfection of cells with anti-mTOR siRNA led to the inhibition of LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 only in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 4D).

We previously showed that VCP contains a substrate-binding domain, N, and two conserved ATPase domains, D1 and D2, of which D2 is responsible for the major enzyme activity. VCP has a barrel-like structure containing two stacked homo-hexameric rings made of the D1 and D2 domains, and this structure is essential for its biological functions. During ATPase cycles, VCP undergoes conformational changes that presumably apply tensions to the bound substrate, leading to the disassembly of protein complexes or unfolding of the substrate. How ATPase activity is coupled with the conformational changes in VCP complex and the D1 and D2 rings is not clear. In this report, we took biochemical approaches to study the structure of VCP in different nucleotide conditions to depict the conformational changes in the ATPase cycles. In contrast to many AAA chaperones that require ATP/ADP to form oligomers, both wild type VCP and ATP-binding site mutants can form hexamers without the addition of nucleotide. This nucleotide-independent hexamerization requires an intact D1 and the down-stream linker sequence of VCP. Tryptophan fluorescence and trypsin digestion analyses showed that ATP/ADP binding induces dramatic conformational changes in VCP. These changes do not require the presence of an intact ATP-binding site in D1 and is thus mainly attributed to the D2 domain. We propose a model whereby D1, although undergoing minor conformational changes, remains as a relatively trypsin-resistant hexameric ring throughout the ATPase cycle, whereas D2 only does so when it binds to ATP or ADP. After ADP is released at the end of the ATP hydrolysis, D2 ring is destabilized and adopts a relatively flexible and open structure.

The family proteins are characterized by the presence of one (type I) or two (type II) highly conserved ATPase domains, also referred to as AAA domains. The ∼250-amino acid ATPase domain contains the consensus Walker A and B motifs, which are responsible for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively, and a second region of homology, which distinguishes the AAA family from other Walker-type ATPases. In addition to sequence homology, the family members almost always form a ring-shaped oligomeric structure. The contrast between the functional diversity and the high sequence and structural similarities suggests that AAA proteins play a common and fundamental role in cells, and the ring-shaped oligomeric structure is essential for such a role. As other AAA proteins, VCP plays an important role in numerous seemingly unrelated cell activities, including membrane fusion (8Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V.

Interestingly, all these activities have been shown to be regulated, directly or indirectly, by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. This notion suggests that VCP may play a fundamental role in the degradation pathway that underlies all these seemingly unrelated functions. Indeed, we and others (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat.

We further showed (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) that VCP physically associates with the ubiquitinated proteins, through a direct binding to the multiubiquitin chains, thus targeting the substrates to the proteasome for degradation.

VCP likely acts as a molecular chaperone that extracts the ubiquitinated proteins from the ER membrane, modifies the conformation of the substrate proteins, and then targets the proteins to the 26 S proteasome for degradation. Moreover, VCP has also been proposed to work as a chaperone with cofactors, such as p47, SVIP, and VCIP135, to mediate membrane fusion in Golgi, ER, and nuclear membrane assembly (23Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 24Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B.

Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity is powered by the energy generated from the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by VCP. The conformational change of VCP during the ATPase cycle likely exerts mechanical force on the substrates and possibly the cofactors to accomplish the chaperone actions. VCP molecule is composed of an N-terminal domain (N), two ATPase domains (D1 and D2), and a C-terminal domain (C). We previously showed that the entire VCP molecule is required for mediating the in vitro degradation of cyclin E (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The N domain binds to the multiubiquitin chain and thus is responsible for substrate recognition (11Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and both D1 and D2 are required for providing the chaperone activity (26Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Whether the two ATPase domains function equally and how they coordinate with each other is not understood. Previous reports have shown that the two ATPase domains of type II AAA proteins are different from each other with respect to sequence and function. Frequently, only one of them is a bona fide AAA domain, whereas the other exhibits lower similarity to the AAA consensus sequence. In NSF (27Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), D1 is responsible for the major ATPase activity, whereas D2 mediates hexamerization. In bacterial ClpA and trypanosome TClpB, the functions of the respective AAA domains are reversed (30Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, D1 and D2 of VCP share high sequence similarities with each other and with those identified to mediate the ATPase activity. Thus, it is of particular interest to identify the specific functions of D1 and D2 in VCP. Indeed, we recently found that D1 and D2 are not enzymatically equal. Although D2 is responsible for the major ATPase activity at physiological temperature, D1 mediates a heat-enhanced ATPase activity (26Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (EM) study indicated that VCP has a barrel-like homo-hexameric structure that comprises two-stacked hexameric rings made of the respective AAA modules (33Rouiller I. DeLaBarre B.

Although a crystallography study of an ADP-bound N-D1 domain provided significant structural details of the D1 ring (34Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), very little was known about the D2 ring and the conformation of respective rings during the ATPase cycle. We have taken biochemical approaches to characterize the conformation of VCP, either unbound or bound to ATP/ADP, with the goal of depicting the conformational changes accompanying ATP hydrolysis. We report that hexamer formation in VCP does not depend on the presence of nucleotide. An intact D1 and down-stream linker region is required for the nucleotide-independent oligomerization. In addition, ATP/ADP binding induces dramatic conformational changes in D2. Both intrinsic Trp fluorescence and limited digestion studies suggest that D2 exhibits a relatively relaxed structure in the absence of nucleotide but forms a compact hexameric ring in the presence of ATP/ADP. While this report was being prepared, Rouiller et al. (33Rouiller I. DeLaBarre B. May A.P. Weis W.I. Brunger A.T. Milligan R.A. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Nat. Struct.

In general agreement with their findings, our study, using an independent, biochemical approach, provides additional molecular insights to the conformations of VCP during ATPase cycle. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—ATP-binding site mutants, A1, A2, and A1A2, were generated as described previously (26Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol.

The additional deletion mutants, 1–511 and 1–481, were generated using the following oligonucleotides and their corresponding complimentary strands (not shown): 1–481, 5′-GTAACCTGGGAAGATATTGGAGGCCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGC-3′; 1–511, 5′-CCTCAAATTTGGCATGACTCCCTCCCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGC-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All VCP variants were cloned into a His fusion expression vector, pQE60, and expressed as His fusion protein (through the C terminus of VCP) in Escherichia coli strain M15 [pREP4] (QIAexpress system, Qiagen). His-tagged wild type and mutant VCP proteins were purified as previously described (26Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Affinity-purified His-tagged VCP and variants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min before they were loaded onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 1% glycerol. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collected in 16 fractions (0.5 ml/each). An aliquot of 20 μl from each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody against the C terminus of VCP (15Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of Nucleotides—To detect the nucleotide bound to the purified VCP, samples (0.2 ml of 4 μm) suspended in dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) were boiled for 5 min and then passed through a 30,000 MWCO filter (Millipore, Ultra-free MC) as described previously (37De La Cruz E.M. Mandinova A. Steinmetz M.O. Stoffler D. Aebi U. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The filtrate was resolved by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters model 626) with a Waters Xterra MS C18 column (4.6 mm × 5 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0). The nucleotide was eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN from 0 to 98% at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detected at 254 nm with a 996 PDA detector. For reassembled samples, wild type VCP was dissociated with 6 m urea and reassembled in the presence or absence of ATP for2has previously described (36Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reassembled VCP was passed through a Sephadex G-50 column to remove the unincorporated ATP and then boiled and analyzed by HPLC. For controls, ATP and ADP (0.2 ml of 2.5 μm) were also analyzed. Native Gel Electrophoresis—In addition to gel filtration chromatography, the oligomeric status of VCP was examined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was loaded onto 8% Tris/glycine mini gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 20 mA for 2hat4 °C. The running buffer contains 25 mm Tris, 195 mm glycine, pH 8–9. The oligomeric status was also verified by analyzing the same samples with gel filtration chromatography. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of tryptophan were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 luminescence spectrometer with the use of a 1.0-mm cell at approximately 24 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm so as to monitor tryptophan emission between 305 and 450 nm with bandwidths of 5 nm. The protein concentration used was approximately 100 μg/ml. The experiments were carried out in the dialysis buffer plus 10 mm MgCl2 and either with or without 4 mm nucleotides. Limited Proteolysis—Purified VCP (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 μg/ml trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for various periods of time in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT and with or without 4 mm ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) and SDS-gel sample buffer. The digestion products were separated into two parts. One part was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with a SilverXpress silver staining kit (Invitrogen). The other part was resolved on SDS-gel and immunoblotted with antiserum recognizing either the N or C terminus of VCP (15Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-VCP C terminus (1:1000), N terminus (1:1000) (15Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-His (1:1000) (Qiagen). Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant VCP—To study the conformation and hexameric status of VCP at different nucleotide states (empty, ATP, or ADP), three groups of mutants were generated. Site-specific mutations were introduced into the Walker A motif of each or both of the ATPase domains, in which a highly conserved lysine was changed to threonine (Fig. 1A). Various deletion mutants were generated, into which progressive deletions from either the N or C terminus of VCP were introduced (see Fig. 3A). In addition, tryptophan at positions 454, 476, or 551 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 1A) for the fluorescence study. Wild type and mutant VCP were expressed as fusion proteins with a His6 tag fused at the C termini. All variants were subjected to consecutive affinity chromatography and purified to apparent homogeneity (Figs. 1B and 3B).Fig. 3D1-linker, but not N, D2, or C, is required for nucleotide-independent hexamerization. A, structure and the hexamerization status of VCP deletion mutants. Various N- or C-terminally truncated VCP mutants are depicted, and the results from their nucleotide-independent hexamerization (from C) are summarized. B, affinity-purified deletion mutants. Wild type and mutant (as indicated on the top) VCP-His fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. The purified proteins (about 1 μg each) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The molecular size standards are shown on the left.

The hexameric form is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hexamerization of VCP in the Absence of Nucleotide—Our previous study showed that VCP has an unusually high preponderance to form a ring-shaped hexameric structure. Because many AAA proteins assemble into oligomers in the presence of ATP but remain monomeric in the absence of nucleotide, we asked whether this is also true in VCP. Wild type VCP fusion protein was purified (Fig. 1B) and subjected to gel filtration chromatography in the absence of nucleotides. Remarkably, almost all VCP appears in a complex with a molecular size consistent with a hexamer (Fig. 1C). To further confirm this nucleotide independence, an A1A2 double mutant, which harbors a mutation in the ATP-binding site in both D1 and D2 domains (Fig. 1A), was analyzed. The detection of A1A2 as hexamers (Fig. 1D) strongly supported that oligomerization of VCP does not require nucleotide binding. Although the analyses were performed without the addition of nucleotides, it was formally possible that the purified recombinant VCP already contained a sufficient amount of nucleotides to maintain the hexameric structure. We thus boiled the VCP preparations to release the potentially bound nucleotide and then analyzed the sample by HPLC. Because the control ATP sample exhibits a sharp peak on the chromatogram (Fig. 2A), neither ATP (Fig. 2B) nor ADP (data not shown) was found in the purified wild type and A1A2 preparations. Furthermore, we dissociated VCP to monomers with 6 m urea, reassembled the dissociated VCP in the presence or absence of ATP/ADP (36Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), removed the unbound nucleotide, and then subjected the samples to HPLC analysis. As we previously reported, although hexameric VCP was efficiently reassembled in both conditions (36Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), ATP/ADP was only detected in the hexamers reassembled in the presence of added nucleotide (Fig. 2C). This result validated our ability to detect the ATP/ADP bound to hexameric VCP and further supported the nucleotide-independent nature of VCP oligomerization. Taken together, we conclude that nucleotide is not required for forming stable hexameric VCP complexes, an unusual property among AAA proteins. D1-linker, but Not N or D2-C, Is Required for Nucleotide-independent Hexamerization—Next, we determined which one or more domains are responsible for the nucleotide-independent hexamerization. Prior crystallography study showed that the N-D1 domain (residues 2–458) of p97 forms a hexameric structure that tightly binds to ADP, and no nucleotide-free hexameric N-D1 was detected (34Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This seems to suggest that N-D1 alone is not sufficient for the nucleotide-independent hexamerization. To identify the sequence requirement, we generated a series of deletion mutants with progressive N- or C-terminal truncations (Fig. 3A). The purified VCP variants (Fig. 3B) were subjected to native gel electrophoresis in the absence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 3C (also summarized in Fig. 3A), wild type and variants 1–511, 1–481, and 141–806 can form hexamers without the addition of nucleotides. These variants all contain an intact D1 (#200–458) and the subsequent linker (#458–473) region (designated as D1-linker) but lack at least part of the N, D2, or C domains. Thus, the D1-linker may be necessary for the hexamerization, and N, D2, and C are dispensable for the process. Moreover, variants 2–458, 443–806, and 268–806, all lacking at least part of the D1-linker region, failed to form hexamers (Fig. 3, A and C), indicating the requirement for D1-linker. Comparing variants 2–458 (N-D1) and 1–481, it is apparent that the linker region plays a critical role in nucleotide-free hexamerization. Without the linker, VCP is mostly present in monomeric form. This may provide the explanation why N-D1 cannot form hexamers without ADP as reported in previous crystallography study (34Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We conclude that the D1-linker domain, but not the N or D2-C domain, is required for the nucleotide-independent hexamerization of VCP. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Study: Dramatic Conformational Change of D2 upon Nucleotide Binding—We previously demonstrated that the ATPase activity of VCP is required in carrying out its biological functions, such as ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Thus, it is important to characterize the conformational changes of VCP during the ATPase reaction. Because a crystal structure of full-length VCP is not available, we took biochemical approaches to study the conformation of VCP either unbound or bound to ATP/ADP, representing specific phases of the ATPase cycle. Based on the facts that Trp fluorescence represents a sensitive probe for conformational change and wild type VCP contains three tryptophan (Trp) residues, we measured the changes in the fluorescence emission spectra of Trp under different nucleotide conditions. Because the experiments were carried out at room temperature, at which VCP exhibits negligible ATPase activity (26Song C. Wang Q. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the change in fluorescence after ATP addition is attributed to mainly the binding and not the hydrolysis of ATP. As shown in Fig. 4A and Table I, the Trp fluorescence of VCP peaks at a wavelength of 345 nm, and binding to ATP or ADP results in increases of 53.9 ± 2.0% or 28.9 ± 1.7%, respectively. These increases suggest that nucleotide binding to VCP induces a conformational change in VCP molecule. The enhanceme"

Since the peptide (4(R)-Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 does not form a triple helix, it was generally believed that polypeptides with a -Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa-repeated sequence do not form a triple helix. Recently, we found that acetyl-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 forms a triple helix in aqueous solutions. To further study the role of 4(R)-hydroxyproline in the Xaa position, we made a series of acetyl-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptides where Yaa was alanine, serine, valine, and allo-threonine. We previously hypothesized that the hydroxyl group of threonine might form a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of 4(R)hydroxyproline. In water, only the threonine- and the valine-containing peptides were triple helical. The remaining peptides did not form a triple helix in water. In 1,2- and in 1,3-propanediol at 4 °C, all the soluble peptides were triple helical. From the transition temperature of the triple helices, it was found that among the examined residues, threonine was the most stable residue in the acetyl-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptide. The transition temperatures of the valine- and allo-threonine-containing peptides were 10 degrees lower than those of the threonine peptide. Surprisingly, the serine-containing peptide was the least stable. These results indicate that the stability of these peptides depends on the presence of a methyl group as well as the hydroxyl group and that the stereo configuration of the two groups is essential for the stability. In the threonine peptide, we hypothesize that the methyl group shields the interchain hydrogen bond between the glycine and the Xaa residue from water and that the hydroxyl groups of threonine and 4(R)hydroxyproline can form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds. 4(R)-Hydroxyproline in the Yaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-repeated sequence of collagen plays a crucial role in the stability of the triple helix.

Collagen is the most abundant protein in multicellular animals. Collagens work not only as the scaffold of tissues and organs but also as regulators of many biological process including cell attachment, cell proliferation, and gene expression. Although it is one of the most extensively studied proteins, the structure of the collagen triple helix is still not fully understood. Collagen molecules consist of three polyproline II-like left-handed helices (all trans) that form a right-handed super helical structure, the triple helix. Formation of a triple helix requires the presence of a repeated -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-sequence. The Xaa and Yaa positions are frequently occupied by proline residues. Almost all prolines in the Yaa position of vertebrate collagens are posttranslationally modified to 4(R)-hydroxyproline by prolyl-4-hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.11.2). Although there are some exceptions, the transition temperature of the collagen triple helix from various species is correlated to the 4(R)-Hyp content (1Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Burjanadze T.V. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the peptide (Pro-4(R)-Hyp-Gly)10 forms a triple helix and has a significantly higher transition temperature than the trimer of the peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (3Engel J.

Since prolyl residues seem the most stable among the natural amino acids in the triple helix, it has been believed that (Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10 peptides (Yaa is any amino acid residue) do not form a triple helix in water, until our report showed that the peptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 forms a triple helix in water (12Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the collagen triple helix arises from the interchain hydrogen bonds between the amide group of glycine and the carboxyl group of Xaa and the restriction of the ϕ dihedral of the pyrrolidine ring structure. In addition, several additional factors have been reported to contribute to the stability of the triple helix: solvent water molecule-mediated hydrogen bonds (13Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M.

Collagens of invertebrates have been shown to exhibit unusual and interesting properties (18Coyne K.J. Qin X.X. Waite J.H.

This organism lives under extreme conditions (high pressure, low oxygen, and steep temperature gradients) but is protected from its environment by a thick cuticle (21Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H.

Biol. 1991; 221: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The R. pachyptila cuticle is mainly composed of a collagen that forms a plywood-like network of fibrils and exhibits a unique amino acid composition (22Gaill F. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Kühn K. Timpl R.

Characteristic for these collagens is the occurrence of 4(R)-Hyp in the Xaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-tripeptide repeat (24Goldstein A. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5478-5483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Muir L. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 502-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found that the Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 peptide forms a triple helix in water, and the addition of galactosyl residue to threonine increases the stability of the triple helix (12Bann J.G.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further characterize the mechanism of stabilization of peptides with 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position, we made a series of polypeptides with the amino acid sequences of acetyl-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 (Yaa = Ser, Val, Ala, alloThr) 1The abbreviations used are: alloThr, (2S,3S)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutyric acid, l-allo-threonine; Fmoc, N-(9-fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl; tBu, t-butyl. and characterized them by circular dichroism measurements in water, in 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol. The experimental results indicate that the stereo chemical configuration of both hydroxyl and methyl groups of threonine are essential in stabilizing the triple helix in these peptides. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized either on a Milligen 9050 peptide synthesizer or on an ABI 433A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Couplings were carried out on PALPEG-PS resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, 0.16 mmol/g) using Fmoc amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-4(R)-Hyp(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Thr-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH, Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Gly-4(R)Hyp (Novabiochem), and acetyl glycine (Bachem, Torrence, CA). Fmoc-Gly-4(R)Hyp-OH was also synthesized from H-Gly-4(R)-Hyp-OH (Bachem) and (N-(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyloxy)-succinimide) (Bachem). O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Perseptive Biosystems) (4.0 eq)/diisopropylethylamine-mediated peptide couplings. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac® C18, 5 μm, 300E, 250 × 10 mm, W.R. Grace, Columbia, MD). All synthesized peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using a Peltier thermostatted cell holder and a 1-mm (Starna Cells Inc., Atascadero, CA) or a 0.1-mm (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany) path length rectangular cell. Measurements were performed in water, 1,2-propanediol (Sigma), or 1,3-propanediol (Sigma). Molecular sieve type 3 Å 4–8 mesh beads (EM science) were added to both 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol to remove water before use. Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The wavelength spectra represent at least an average of 10 scans with 0.1-nm wavelength steps. Thermal transitions were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C/h. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The temperature dependence of the partial heat capacity was measured in an N-DSC II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Science Corp., UT). The peptide solutions in 1,2-propanediol were centrifuged at 4 °C for 60 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman model L-8 ultracentrifuge before measurement. The heating rate was 15 °C/h, and the data were collected and analyzed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Molecular Modeling—The structure was modeled using the structure of Protein Data Bank accession number 1G9W as a template for the backbone conformation (4Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Sorrentino G. Carotenuto L. Piccolo C. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 was changed to an amide, and the Xaa and Yaa positions were replaced by 4(R)-hydroxyproline and threonine. Side chain conformations of the threonine residues were optimized by manually selecting the lowest energy conformer with the Biopolymer program in Insight II (Accelrys, Pharmacopeia Inc., Princeton, NJ). Subsequent energy minimizations were performed with the Discover program of Insight II, using the consistent valence force field. The backbone was tethered in place throughout with a force constant of 100 kcal/Å2. The peptides were soaked with a five-molecule-thick layer of water. The side chains of all amino acids were uncharged to approximate the effects of solvent shielding (27Vitagliano L. Nemethy G. Zagari A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7354-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protocol for minimization was as follows: the method of steepest descents was used until a maximum derivative of <5 kcal/Å was reached, with the charge term included. Next, the method of conjugate gradients was used for 500 iterations until a maximum derivative of <5.0 kcal/Å was reached, with the charge term included. Next, the method of conjugate gradients was used until a maximum derivative of <1.0 kcal/Å was reached, with charges and cross-term energies included. Finally, the VA09A quasi-Newton-Raphson method was used until a maximum derivative of <0.01 kcal/Å was achieved, with charges, cross-terms, and a Morse bond potential included. The far-ultraviolet CD spectra of collagen molecules typically show a negative ellipticity (θ) of about –50,000 degrees cm2/dmol around 198–200 nm and a maximum ellipticity near 220–225 nm of 7000 degrees cm2/dmol, indicating the presence of a left-handed all trans X-Pro bonded polyproline II like secondary structure. Collagen-like peptides are known to show similar spectra when they form a triple helix. Upon denaturation, the positive CD peak around at 225 nm disappears. Fig. 1A shows that of the peptides measured in water, only the threonine and the valine peptides showed a positive peak around at 220–225 nm. The serine, the alanine, and the allo-Thr peptides showed no obvious positive peaks at 220–225 nm. When the temperature dependence of the CD signal at 221 nm was studied, only the threonine and the valine peptides showed the cooperative transition from triple helix to coil. The other peptides showed a linear decrease of the CD signal with temperature (Fig. 1B). It was observed that the valine peptide stock solution (about 1 mm) needed more than one month at 4 °C after the dissolution of the lyophilized peptide to show a cooperative transition curve. The inability of triple helix formation of the serine peptide indicates that the presence of a hydroxyl group is not sufficient to stabilize a triple helix with 4(R)-Hyp in the Xaa position in water. Although the methyl group seems to contribute more to the stability in water, it alone also does not account for the stability found in the threonine peptide. Both groups are necessary to form a stable triple helix. The inability of triple helix formation of the alloThr peptide also clearly indicates that the stereochemical configuration of the two groups of threonine significantly contributes to the stability of the peptide. To compare the thermal stability of all the peptides, we had to use a solvent where a stable triple helix could be obtained for all peptides. 1,2-propanediol was shown to increase the melting temperature of collagen-like peptides; we therefore used this solvent to compare the thermal stability of these peptides (3Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that solvents with more than one hydroxyl group, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and glucose, increase the stability for type I collagen at pH 4.0 (28Gekko K. Koga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for galactose with Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 peptides (26Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 1,2-propanediol for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-4(R)-Hyp-Gly)10 (3Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and ethylene glycol for Ac-(Gly-Pro-Nleu)6 and 9, or (Gly-Nleu-Pro)6-NH2 peptides (29Feng Y. Melacini G. Goodman M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8716-8724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In 1,2-propanediol, the peptides that do not form triple helix in water formed a triple helix, with the exception of the alanine peptide that was not soluble in 1,2-propanediol. Fig. 2A shows the CD spectra of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptides in 1,2-propanediol. All the soluble peptides show positive peaks around 220–225 nm and also showed a cooperative transition when the temperature was increased (Fig. 2B). In 1,2-propanediol, the threonine peptide is still most stable. The order of transition temperatures in 1,2-propanediol is Thr (T m = 48 °C) → alloThr (T m = 37 °C) → Val (T m = 33 °C) → Ser (T m = 27 °C). We also measured Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2, that does not form a triple helix in water (26Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The midpoint of the thermal transition is at 33 °C. This value is a little higher than the T m of 27 °C determined for H-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-Gly-Pro-Cys-Cys (23Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 1,2-propanediol is a more stabilizing solvent not only for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10 but also for the (Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa) peptides. Table I lists the thermodynamic data determined from the transition curves of the Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptides in 1,2-propanediol.Table IThermodynamic data of the triple helix coil transition of the Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)-NH2 peptides in 1,2-propanediolPeptideTm aMelting temperatures (Tm) are concentration-dependent and are determined from the CD measurements (100 μM), together with ΔH 0VH and ΔS 0, using Equation 2 in Ref. 3.ΔH 0VHΔS 0Tm bMelting temperatures (Tm) are determined by differential scanning calorimetry at the indicated concentration.ΔH 0calConcentration°CkJ/molJ/mol/K°CkJ/molmMAc-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH248.2-10.6-2950.1-15.11.0Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Val)10-NH234.9-6.3-1837.8-7.01.9Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Ser)10-NH226.4-10.4-30—cThe serine peptide was not soluble at the higher concentrations needed for differential scanning calorimetry.——Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-alloThr)10-NH237.6-7.9-2239.6-7.22.2a Melting temperatures (Tm) are concentration-dependent and are determined from the CD measurements (100 μM), together with ΔH 0VH and ΔS 0, using Equation 2 in Ref. 3Engel J.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows the CD spectra of the peptides in 1,3-propanediol. Again, all peptides showed a positive peak around 220–225 nm, and the corresponding transition curves are shown in Fig. 3B. The peptides are more stable in 1,3-propanediol than in 1,2-propanediol. The serine peptide was not soluble in this solvent, and limited solubility was observed for the valine peptide. The threonine-containing peptide was again the most stable one (T m = 56 °C) followed by the valine (T m = 47 °C), the alanine (T m = 44 °C), and the allothreonine-containing peptide (T m = 43 °C). The energy-minimized structure of the threonine peptide shows that the methyl group of threonine faces toward the inside of the triple helix between the peptide bond of Thr-Gly of the adjacent chain and the glycine carbonyl of the same chain (Fig. 4). The methyl group covers the interchain hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of hydroxyproline in the Xaa position of the adjacent chain and the amino group of the next glycine residue in the same chain. The hydroxyl group points toward the outer surface of the triple helix. The pyrrolidine ring of hydroxyproline in the Xaa position is puckering down (Cγ-endo), which brings the Cγ atom closer to the threonine residue. The distance between the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of threonine and the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline is 3.7 Å, which is longer than the distance found in typical hydrogen bonds (2.90–3.20 Å). We have recently shown that Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 forms a stable triple helix in water. This was a surprise because it was assumed that 4(R)-hydroxyproline in the Xaa position prevented the formation of a triple helix because it was shown that (4(R)-Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 was unable to form this structure. On the other hand, for Lumbricus terrestris cuticle collagen, it is reported that the sequence -Gly-Hyp-Ser-accounts for 4–5% of the total hydroxyproline content and that the cuticle collagen of R. pachyptila has a very low proline and hydroxyproline content (5%). The stabilizing factor in the cuticle collagen of R. pachyptila is the galactosylation of threonines occurring in the Yaa position. However, sequencing revealed the presence of 4(R)-hydroxyproline in the Xaa position. Our results presented here with peptides containing 4(R)-hydroxyproline in the Xaa position and threonine, serine, valine, alanine, and allothreonine shed some insight into the stabilizing forces of these peptides. In our previous studies (12Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the threonine-containing peptide, we concluded that there could be an additional hydrogen bond in this peptide, as indicated by an increase in the ΔH o between the proline and 4(R)-hydroxyproline-containing peptides. However, the serine-containing peptide in this study does not form a stable triple helix in water. In 1,2-propanediol, we find a lower increase in ΔH o for the serine as compared with the threonine peptide, and this together with a slightly larger ΔS o makes the serine-containing peptide significantly less stable. The conclusion therefore is that the hydroxyl group alone does not account for the increased stability. The valine-containing peptide is nearly as stable as the threonine-containing peptide in water, indicating that the methyl group plays an important role in stabilizing the triple helix through van der Waals interactions as well. The allothreonine-containing peptide shows that the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl and methyl group is important in this stabilization. In water, the allothreonine-containing peptide does not form a triple helix, and the ΔH o in 1,2-propanediol is significantly lower than that of the threonine-containing peptide. The effect of both 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol on thermal stability of the Ac-(Gly-4(R)-Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Ethylene glycol also has the similar effect on some of the peptides used in this study (data not shown). Glycerol is also known to increase the melting temperature of type I collagen (28Gekko K. Koga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In contrast, the melting temperature of type II collagen is decreased by the addition of 1,2-propanediol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol (31Bächinger H.P. Morris N.P. Matrix. 1990; 10: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The stabilizing effect of 1,2-propanediol on the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10 was reported (3Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of stabilization by these solvents is still unclear. Recent synchrotron radiation analysis of the ((Pro-Pro-Gly)10)3 crystal grown in micro gravity by Berisio et al. (16Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which diffracted up to 1.3 Å, indicates that many water molecules interact with the peptide. These authors suggest that the unusually high percentage of exposed unsaturated carbonyl groups, together with the triple helix peculiar rod-like shape, are the main reasons of the observation. It is still controversial how water or other solvent molecules contribute to the stability of the triple helix (32Engel J. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, previous studies and our experimental results indicate that both 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol significantly contribute to the stability of the triple helix. Generally, the peptides are more stable in 1,3-propanediol. This is especially true for the valine peptide, which shows a T m value that is 14 °C higher than in 1,2-propanediol. We hypothesize that 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol molecules might act as three or four hydrogen-bonded water molecules, which interact with the surface of the triple helix. The increase in stability in 1,3-propanediol over 1,2-propanediol probably results from the difference in the spacing of the hydroxyl groups. 1,3-propanediol can form longer connections than 1,2-propanediol and potentially can also provide van der Waals contacts with the central CH2 group. This could explain the increased stability of the valine peptide in 1,3-propanediol. The common effect on the examined peptides implies that propanediol molecules preferentially interact with the main chain carbonyl groups of Gly or the Yaa position residues. The order of stability of the threonine peptide, followed by the valine, allothreonine, and serine peptides, suggests that the stereochemical configuration of both the methyl and the hydroxyl group is important for the stability. The energy minimization calculations suggest that the methyl group of threonine shields the interchain hydrogen bond between the amino group of glycine and the carboxyl group of hydroxyproline from solvent molecules. This interchain hydrogen bond is a major source of the thermal stability of the collagen triple helix. Exclusion of solvent molecules has also been observed for the galactosyl-threonine-containing peptides (33Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. Peyton D.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4042-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The increased stability of the threonine peptide as compared with the valine peptide suggests the possibility of a contribution by hydrogen bond formation of the hydroxyl group of threonine. In the energy-minimized structure, the formation of a direct hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups of hydroxyproline and threonine seems unlikely; however, a water-mediated hydrogen bond cannot be excluded. The stability of the allothreonine peptide suggests that such a contribution exists and that it is stereospecific.

Here we report caspase-dependent stimulation of potassium channels by the Fas receptor in a human Jurkat T cell line. Receptor activation with Fas ligand for 30 min increased the amplitude of voltage-activated potassium currents 2-fold on average. This produces a sustained outward current, ∼10 pA, at physiological membrane potentials during Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. Both basal and Fas ligand-induced currents were blocked completely by toxins that selectively inhibit Kv1.3 potassium channels. Kv1.3 stimulation required the expression of Fas-associated death domain protein and activation of caspase 8, but did not require activation of caspase 3 or protein synthesis. Furthermore, Kv1.3 stimulation by Fas ligand was prevented by chronic stimulation of protein kinase C with 20 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate during Fas ligand treatment, which also blocks apoptosis. Thus, Fas ligand increases Kv1.3 channel activity through the same canonical apoptotic signaling cascade that is required for potassium efflux, cell shrinkage, and apoptosis.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an essential process for normal tissue homeostasis and immune system regulation. One of the early features of apoptosis is the loss of potassium ions and the accompanying cell shrinkage, also termed apoptotic volume decrease (1Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Biochem.

We were interested in the signaling pathway that results in potassium efflux during apoptosis. We used Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis of the well characterized human lymphoma Jurkat T cell line to study the mechanism of potassium efflux and the signaling molecules involved in this important feature of the death pathway. Apoptosis is the central regulatory feature of the immune system, controlling lymphocyte maturation, receptor repertoire selection, and homeostasis (9Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The elimination of most T cells after the peak proliferative, clonal expansion phase of an immune response is orchestrated by death receptor-associated apoptosis. A subset of the receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF-R) family members are the so called “death receptors” that transduce death signals. In particular, the death receptor Fas (CD95) is a 45-kDa protein that induces T cell death upon binding to its natural ligand Fas (10Zimmermann K.C. Bonzon C. Green D.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).

Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Within seconds of Fas ligand binding to the Fas/CD95 receptor, trimerization and receptor activation occurs. This is rapidly followed by the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), which recruits the scaffolding protein, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), to the death domain of the activated Fas receptor. FADD in turn initiates a caspase cascade that begins with the mobilization and activation of pro-caspase 8 (13Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G. Medema J.P. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Active caspase 8, in turn, cleaves and activates pro-caspase 3. The active effector caspase 3 is a semi-selective protease, which disrupts normal cell function by cleaving key structural proteins and signaling molecules that ultimately results in cellular destruction. T lymphocytes are known to express several classes of potassium channels (14Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin.

Here we report a Fas-induced increase in the voltage-dependent potassium current carried by Kv1.3 channels. We also show that this increase in potassium channel activity, like several other components of apoptosis, is dependent on Fas receptor activation, recruitment of FADD, and caspase 8 activation. Reagents and Protocol of Cell Culture and Treatments—Jurkat T cells, E6.1 (human lymphoma), were cultured at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 75 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. FADD-deficient Jurkat cells were kindly provided by Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard) and incubated under the same conditions described for Jurkat T cells. Cells (∼1.5 × 106/ml cells) were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml Fas ligand or 2 μg/ml Fas antibody (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA). Caspase inhibitors were incubated with cells at 100 μm caspase 3 inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (DEVD), caspase 8 inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (IETD), or broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD) (Kamiya Biomedical Co.). Protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (20 nm) (PMA) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was incubated with cells for 30 min. Protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was used at a concentration of 2.5 μm. Both PMA and Gö6976 were freshly dissolved in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration never exceeded 0.1% in the culture medium). Electrophysiology—Jurkat cells were bathed in a salt solution at 20–24 °C and voltage-clamped to –80 mV in the whole cell recording mode with an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The bath solution for these recordings contained (in mm) 5 KCl, 140 tetramethylammonium chloride, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose at pH 7.3. The pipette solution contained (mm) 140 potassium gluconate, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose at pH 7.4. Immediately prior to recording Jurkat cells were collected by gentle centrifugation and resuspended in bath solution. Potassium currents were evoked by a range of 100-ms voltage steps from –60 to 80 mV from a holding potential of –80 mV. The sustained currents were evoked by 9.8-s step depolarizations between –50 and +30 mV. The current was measured after 8 s recording. Channel block was achieved by bath perfusion (2 ml/min) of 5 nm l-(α, β-diaminopropionyl22)-stichodactyla helianthus neurotoxin (Shk-Dap22) (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) or 50 nm margatoxin (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Changes in cell volume were assessed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSort. Five thousand cells/ml were used per sample. Excitation with a 488 nm argon laser was used to determine light scatter. Changes in cell volume for each population were determined with FACS by measuring forward light scatter. The forward scatter versus cell number values were analyzed with CellQuest software. Acute changes in plasma membrane potential were measured by FACS using DiBAC4 (3Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) for 10 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere and immediately examined by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSort using argon laser excitation at 488 and 530 nm of emission. For analysis of DNA degradation cells were fixed in cold 70% ethanol overnight, pelleted, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Cells were examined by flow cytometry for propidium iodide fluorescence and the percentage of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells displaying subdipolid DNA divided by the total number of cells examined. Western Blot Analyses—Jurkat lysate preparation was done as previously described (17Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Complete™). Cells were then disrupted with a 25-gauge needle, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and protein was normalized among the different treatments. Samples were run on 4–20% Tris glycine gels and exposed to antibodies after blotting. Monoclonal anti-caspase-8 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); rabbit polyclonal anti-procaspase-3 and monoclonal anti-processed caspase-3 were from Cell Signaling and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively; monoclonal anti-FADD was from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Fas Ligand Increases Voltage-activated Potassium Current before Cell Shrinkage—The voltage-activated potassium conductance of Jurkat T lymphocytes was measured with the conventional whole cell voltage-clamp technique and normalized to cell capacitance to control for cell size. Fig. 1 shows representative currents elicited from control untreated cells (B) and Jurkat T cells incubated with 2 μg/ml Fas ligand for 30 min (C). The potassium current density of Fas ligand-treated cells was ∼2-fold larger on average compared with the untreated controls at all test potentials that elicited a current. Because apoptosis occurs stochastically in response to all death signals cells were incubated with a high concentration of Fas ligand (2 μg/ml) to accelerate the initiation and progression of apoptosis. Cells treated with Fas ligand for less than 20 min had currents of the same average amplitude as untreated cells (not shown). Cell shrinkage is a hallmark of apoptosis that is associated with potassium efflux from the cell (18Barbiero G. Duranti F. Bonelli G. Amenta J.S. Baccino F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The time course of cell shrinkage was analyzed by flow cytometry and compared with the onset of potassium efflux in different cell populations. Although treatment of Jurkat T lymphocytes for 30 min with Fas ligand (2 μg/ml) was not sufficient for significant cell shrinkage compared with untreated populations, 58% of the cell population exhibited cell shrinkage after 1 h of incubation (data not shown). Thus, the delayed increase in potassium current produced by Fas ligand occurred early enough to account for the subsequent reduction in cell volume. Kv1.3 Channels Conduct the Fas-induced Potassium Current—The voltage-activated potassium current observed after Fas ligand stimulation had similar kinetics to channels of the Shaker family of delayed-rectifier channel proteins (19Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Pountney D. Saganich M. De Miera E.V.S. Rudy B. Rudy B. Seeburg P. Molecular and Functional Diversity of Ion Channels and Receptors. Vol. 868. New York Academy of Sciences, New York1999: 233-285Google Scholar), so we tested whether the current was conducted through Kv1.3 channels, which activated lymphocytes are known to express (20Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). At nanomolar concentrations, the scorpion toxin, margatoxin, and the mono-substituted analogue of a sea anemone toxin ShK-Dap22 are selective blockers of Kv1.3 channels (22Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (A410): A410Google Scholar, 23Garciacalvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18866-18874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potassium currents from Jurkat cells treated with Fas ligand for 30 min were recorded before and after bath perfusion with margatoxin or ShK-Dap22. A representative family of Fas-induced current traces is shown in Fig. 2 before (A) and after (B) bath application of ShK-Dap22 (5 nm). Fig. 2C shows the current-voltage relationship derived from untreated cells, cells treated with Fas ligand for 30 min, and Fas ligand-treated cells after bath perfusion with margatoxin (50 nm). Margatoxin (50 nm) blocked the majority of the Fas-induced current (89% ± 2.8, n = 6). The Kv1.3 selective sea anemone toxin analogue ShK-Dap22 (5 nm) also inhibited the majority (83% ± 6.9, n = 4) of the Fas-induced potassium current. Thus, our data strongly suggest that Kv1.3 is the predominant voltage-activated channel activated by Fas ligand in Jurkat cells. Therefore we examined the mechanism of Kv1.3 stimulation by Fas ligand. Fas Increases Kv1.3 Channels through the Fas Receptor— Jurkat T cells incubated with either Fas ligand or Fas receptor antibody for 30 min showed a doubling of the voltage-activated potassium current amplitude (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the non-stimulating Fas antibody (Zb-Ab, 5 μg/ml), which binds to the Fas receptor but does not result in receptor activation, did not increase potassium current (Fig. 3A). Thus, the increase in current required Fas receptor activation. Furthermore, decreasing the dose of Fas ligand produced even longer delays before the increase in current amplitude could be detected. Only one of four cells treated with 200 ng/ml Fas ligand for 30 min showed potassium currents over 20 pA/pF. After 45 min, however, five of six cells showed currents over 20 pA/pF (data not shown). Kv1.3 Channel Stimulation by Fas Signaling Does Not Require de Novo Protein Synthesis—De novo protein synthesis is not required for Fas ligand-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T lymphocytes (24Anderson K.L. Anderson G. Michell R.H. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4083-4091PubMed Google Scholar), but the Fas ligand-induced increase in Kv1.3 potassium current required at least 20 min incubation with Fas ligand. Therefore, we investigated whether the delay reflected a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Jurkat T lymphocytes were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (5 μm), for 5 min prior to addition of Fas ligand, and cycloheximide was present during the subsequent 30 min of Fas ligand treatment. Despite inhibition of protein synthesis, Fas ligand produced an increase in current comparable with control Jurkat T cells treated with Fas ligand for 30 min (Fig. 3B). Thus, like Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, the Fas ligand-induced potassium current increase did not require de novo protein synthesis. The cytoplasmic signaling events downstream of Fas receptor activation and the subsequent caspase cascade that transduces apoptosis have been well characterized (10Zimmermann K.C. Bonzon C. Green D.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 25Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of Kv1.3 stimulation triggered by Fas receptor activation we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches. Recruitment of FADD Is Necessary for the Fas-induced Potassium Increase—Fas receptor activation stimulates the recruitment of the scaffolding protein, FADD, to the intracellular domain of the activated Fas receptor, which is necessary for the initiation of the caspase cascade (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). To test whether FADD is necessary for signaling the increase of Kv1.3 channel activity we used FADD-deficient Jurkat T cells that express a low level of inactive FADD protein (26Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J.Y. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A confirms that in FADD-deficient T cells neither cleavage of procaspase 8 to the active caspase 8 protein nor cleavage of procaspase 3 to active caspase 3 protein occurs after Fas ligand stimulation. We treated the FADD-deficient cells with Fas ligand for 30 min and measured the potassium currents as described above. The Fas ligand-induced potassium current increase was abolished in the FADD-deficient cells (Fig. 4B). Caspase 8 Is Necessary for the Fas-induced Potassium Current Increase—Activation of FADD by the Fas receptor leads to activation of caspase-8. To evaluate the role of caspase-8 in the potassium channel activation pathway we first used two pharmacological inhibitors: the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, ZVAD (10 and 100 μm), and the selective peptide inhibitor of caspase-8, IETD (100 μm) (27Xiang J.L. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 28Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of caspase 8 prevented the Fas-induced increase in potassium currents (Fig. 5A). Both ZVAD and IETD (100 μm) blocked the DNA degradation when Jurkat T cells were stimulated with Fas ligand (2 μg/ml) confirming that these inhibitors are effective at blocking caspase activity under these conditions (Fig. 5D). We also studied a lymphocyte cell line deficient in caspase 8 to define the signaling pathway. Fig. 4A confirms that capase 8-deficient cells do not contain any detectable cleaved, active caspase 8 protein and the conversion of procaspase 3 to active caspase 3 protein does not occur. The absence of caspase-8 prevented the Fas ligand-induced increase in potassium current (Fig. 4B). Thus, selective block of caspase 8 activity either pharmacologically or by genetic mutation of caspase 8 prevented the Fas-induced increase of potassium currents in Jurkat T cells. Caspase 3 Is Not Required for the Potassium Current Increase—The executioner caspase, caspase 3, is activated directly by caspase 8. Caspase 3 then cleaves key structural and signaling molecules resulting in extensive protein breakdown and cellular destruction during apoptosis. We were interested to discover whether caspase 3 activity was necessary for the observed increase in potassium currents. To investigate this we used a selective caspase 3 peptide inhibitor (DEVD) (27Xiang J.L. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Despite incubation with the caspase 3 inhibitor DEVD (100 μm) for 30 min, Fas ligand produced the same increase in potassium current as it did on control cells (Fig. 5B). We tested whether DEVD was an effective caspase blocker when cells had been triggered to undergo apoptosis with the relatively high Fas ligand concentrations used in these experiments. We used flow cytometry to analyze Jurkat T cell DNA content and found that pre-treating cells with DEVD (100 μm) for 30 min was sufficient to block DNA degradation induced by Fas ligand (2 μg/ml). Fig. 5C shows a representative frequency histogram of propidium iodide fluorescence showing the DNA content of untreated control cells, Fas ligand-treated cells and DEVD (100 μm) and Fas ligand (2 μg/ml)-treated cells. Thus, caspase 8 but not caspase 3 is necessary for the Fas-induced increase in potassium current. Protein Kinase C Prevents Fas-induced Potassium Currents—Previous studies have shown that activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters can inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis at signaling sites upstream of caspase 8 activation, by acting at the Fas receptor to prevent the recruitment of signaling/scaffolding proteins required for death signaling (17Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A illustrates our finding that Jurkat T lymphocytes treated with the protein kinase C activator, PMA (20 nm), were protected from Fas-induced cell shrinkage, which is a reflection of potassium loss from the cells. We were interested in whether protein kinase C activation could also inhibit the Fas-induced increase in potassium current. Jurkat T lymphocytes that were incubated with both PMA (20 nm) and Fas ligand (2 μg/ml) for 30 min did not show any Fas-induced potassium current increase (Fig. 6B). The protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent modulation of the Fas signaling pathway that is known to block cell shrinkage and apoptosis also blocked the increase in potassium currents. It is also worth noting that Fas-induced potassium current rapidly decreased in amplitude after bath application of PMA (20 nm) (control, 19 ± 7% current decrease in 15 min, n = 5; PMA, 53 ± 4% current decrease in 15 min, n = 8). These data suggest that protein kinase C may have actions on the channel proteins in addition to its upstream targets in the Fas receptor signaling pathway (39Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been shown that inhibition of PKC enhances Fas-induced cell shrinkage and apoptosis. Fig. 6A shows changes in cell size of Jurkat T cells treated with a PKC inhibitor, Gö6976 (2.5 μm), for 30 min, illustrating the stimulatory effect of Gö6976 on Fas-induced cell shrinkage. We investigated whether inhibition of protein kinase C could also affect the amplitude of potassium currents. To this end we inhibited PKC by incubation of Jurkat T lymphocytes with Gö6976 (2.5 μm) for 30 min. This inhibition of PKC resulted in a significant increase in the normalized potassium current amplitude (p < 0.017) (Fig. 6B). Fas Ligand-dependent Changes in Ionic Properties of Jurkat T Cells—The results presented above demonstrate that Fas ligand increases the amplitude of Kv1.3 currents in response to imposed depolarizations under voltage-clamp, but Jurkat T cells do not fire action potentials, so how are the channels activated during apoptosis? It has been reported that Jurkat T cells also depolarize prior to shrinking (34Trimarchi J.R. Liu L. Smith P.J.S. Keefe D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C588-C594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that Fas ligand (2 μg/ml), which increased potassium currents, also depolarized these cells (Fig. 7A). However, sustained depolarization not only activates Kv1.3 channels, it also inactivates them. Consequently we investigated whether Fas ligand stimulation increased the steady-state current. Fig. 7B shows a family of traces evoked from a series of depolarizations from –50 to 30 mV for 9.8 s. The currents were measured after prolonged activation of 8 s after the current has fully inactivated, (τ4 inactivation ∼1 s). The mean currents, measured at 8 s, were plotted against membrane potential (see inset). The mean steady-state current of Fas ligand-treated Jurkat T cells was significantly larger than those measured in control, untreated cells at all voltages tested (p < 0.0003). This sustained current remained sensitive to Shk-Dap22 (5 nm); 67% ± 4, n = 4, current measured at 8 s was blocked by bath perfusion of toxin. The efflux of potassium ions is a pivotal apoptotic event in a variety of cell types that occurs in response to diverse stimuli: for example, cortical neurons in response to ceramide (5Yu S.P. Yeh C.H. Gottron F. Wang X. Grabb M.C. Choi D.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), myeloblastic leukemic cells in response to ultraviolet irradiation (29Wang L. Xu D. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3678-3685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and Jurkat T lymphocytes in response to Fas ligand (4Thompson G.J. Langlais C. Cain K. Conley E.C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 66: 49-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed potassium efflux is so critical for apoptosis that when it is blocked by bathing cells in high extracellular potassium, apoptosis is also blocked (4Thompson G.J. Langlais C. Cain K. Conley E.C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yu S.P. Yeh C. Strasser U. Tian M. Choi D.W. Science. 1999; 284: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify the signaling events that increase potassium efflux in Jurkat T cells triggered to undergo the apoptotic program by the cytokine, Fas ligand. We show here that Fas receptor activation increases the amplitude of the voltage-activated potassium currents in a human Jurkat T cell line. This effect took over 20 min to appear, but did not require protein synthesis and preceded cell shrinkage. Under our conditions, all the voltage-activated current was carried by a single class, Kv1.3, of Shaker-related, delayed rectifier channel proteins. The Kv1.3 channel has been identified as the predominant voltage-gated potassium channel expressed in lymphocytes (21Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). T cells also express several other potassium channels (16Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 32Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which might also be stimulated by Fas ligand, but their contribution to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells was not tested here. Other studies show that lymphocytes genetically deficient in Kv1.3 channels are protected from undergoing the apoptotic program in response to cytostatic drugs (33Bock J. Szabo I. Jekle A. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on the idea that Kv1.3 channels contribute to potassium efflux during apoptotic volume decrease we tested whether Fas ligand-induced stimulation of Kv1.3 channels were sufficient for potassium efflux during apoptosis. We incubated cells with a blocker of Kv1.3 channels and asked if it was sufficient to prevent cell shrinkage. When cells were incubated with Shk-Dap22 (10 nm) and treated with Fas ligand (2 μg/ml) for 30 min the cells still shrank showing no significant protective effect from the presence of the toxin channel blocker (data no shown). We conclude from this that other channels may also be involved in potassium efflux, for example, the two-pore domain potassium channels that have recently been shown to play a role in apoptotic volume decrease (34Trimarchi J.R. Liu L. Smith P.J.S. Keefe D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C588-C594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we have focused on the signaling mechanism for the Fas receptor-induced increase in Kv1.3 activity. The increase of the Kv1.3 current amplitude in response to Fas ligand required the same signaling cascade as other cellular hallmarks of apoptosis, such as caspase activation (35Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and cell shrinkage (17Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, either loss of FADD and the death receptor complex or loss of the downstream effector, caspase 8, completely prevented the increase in Kv1.3 activity. Furthermore, activation of PKC activity, which attenuates Fas-induced apoptosis at the Fas receptor level (36Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. Izquierdo M. de Murcia G. Lopez-Rivas A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Gomez-Angelats M. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19609-19619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), prevented the increase in Kv1.3 channel activity. PMA also enhanced the rundown of both the Fas ligand-activated and control currents, suggesting that PKC could also act directly on potassium channels. Conversely, inhibition of PKC with Gö6976, which exacerbates the progression of apoptosis (17Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), increased the Kv1.3 current amplitude of Jurkat T cells even in the absence of Fas ligand, which also supports a more direct action of PKC on the channels. In contrast, inhibition of the executioner caspase, caspase 3, even with fairly nonspecific peptide inhibitors, did not prevent the Fas-induced increase in Kv1.3 activity. This agrees with a recent report that caspase 3 activation is downstream of the potassium efflux (4Thompson G.J. Langlais C. Cain K. Conley E.C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Kv1.3 stimulation is a relatively early event in the apoptotic program and is consistent with the postulated role of potassium efflux in contributing to the reduction in cytoplasmic ionic strength, which contributes to the activation of many of the executioner enzymes that carry out degradation. The only conundrum in this scenario is how a voltage-activated channel contributes to potassium efflux in a cell that does not fire action potentials. We have used the voltage-clamp technique to measure the maximal available current in response to artificially imposed test depolarizations. Fas receptor activation increased the peak currents measured at 100 ms and also sustained currents measured at 8 s by ∼2-fold at all voltages that elicited a current. In lymphocytes the net amount of channel activity will be determined by the resting membrane potential of the cell. Resting membrane potentials more positive than –40 mV will activate the channels, but as the membrane potential becomes more depolarized (positive) more channels will become unavailable because of steady-state inactivation of the channels. In many cells these two properties of activation and inactivation overlap so there is a window of membrane potential where the channels are activated but not completely inactivated, and this produces a steady potassium efflux. Thus, potassium efflux would require three coincident steps before it would become significant: Kv1.3 stimulation, inhibition of the Na, K-ATPase, and membrane depolarization. Indeed early in apoptosis the Na, K-ATPase is inhibited and this is coupled to membrane depolarization (35Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 38Nobel C.S. Aronson J.K. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Slater A.F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This could explain the long initial delay but rapid progression of apoptosis once all these conditions are met. In the Jurkat cells the amplitude of the sustained current produced by Fas receptor activation is more than enough to produce rapid loss of cytoplasmic potassium ions. Using estimates taken from our averaged data, Fas ligand-stimulated cells have a steady-state current of ∼10 pA at a membrane potential of –20 mV, which corresponds approximately to an efflux of 6 × 107 potassium ions per second. Calculating that a 10 μm diameter cell contains ∼0.5 pl of cytoplasm and 4 × 1010 potassium ions, it would take only 10 min for all of the potassium ions to leave the cell in the absence of pumping. If each potassium channel passes 1 pA, then only 10 open channels would be required. Thus, even a voltage-activated potassium channel, such as Kv1.3, could account for the rapid and complete loss of potassium ions during apoptosis particularly if the cells were first depolarized and the Na, K-ATPase was inhibited as has been recently reported (34Trimarchi J.R. Liu L. Smith P.J.S. Keefe D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C588-C594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the sustained current is sufficient to account for cell shrinkage on the time scale examined here, it does not fully account for the Fas ligand-induced increased current amplitudes observed under voltage-clamp. There must be an additional increase in channel density or a reorganization of existing channels in the membrane to account for the increased currents. Alternatively the increased potassium current amplitude might result from an increased open probability because of channel modification such as a phosphorylation or dephosphorylation events. Caspases are selective proteases that cleave many signaling molecules that can result in the dysregulation of their activity. For example, caspase cleavage of protein phosphatase 2A switches it into a constitutively active mode (39Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because protein phosphatase 2A activity is known to increase Kv1.3 open probability (40Payet M.D. Dupuis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18270-18273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it would be interesting to test its role in signaling the Fas-induced increase in potassium efflux. The signaling pathways downstream of caspase 8 that contribute to potassium channel activation remain unknown. A recent report shows that cytochrome c activates potassium channels when dialyzed into smooth muscle cells through the patch pipette (41Platoshyn O. Zhang S. McDaniel S.S. Yuan J.X.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1298-C1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This presumably mimics cytochrome c release from the mitochondria that is a critical step in initiating apoptosis that occurs downstream of caspase 8 activation (42Singh R. Pervin S. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37630-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Sharoy V.G. Todor A.V. Goldstein S. Sabbah H.N. J. Am. Coll.

In conclusion we show for the first time the signaling steps between the apoptotic stimuli and potassium efflux. The data presented here illustrates that the same signaling events downstream of Fas receptor activation that trigger the initiation of the caspase cascade also trigger potassium efflux by stimulating Kv1.3 channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000999799,"We had previously described the leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP) as a candidate mediator of toxicity in the polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). This was based on the observation that LANP binds ataxin-1, the protein involved in this disease, in a glutamine repeat-dependent manner. Furthermore, LANP is expressed abundantly in purkinje cells, the primary site of ataxin-1 pathology. Here we focused our efforts on understanding the neuronal properties of LANP. In undifferentiated neuronal cells LANP is predominantly a nuclear protein, requiring a bona fide nuclear localization signal to be imported into the nucleus. LANP translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the process of neuritogenesis, interacts with the light chain of the microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), and modulates the effects of MAP1B on neurite extension. LANP thus could play a key role in neuronal development and/or neurodegeneration by its interactions with microtubule associated proteins.

In undifferentiated neuronal cells LANP is predominantly a nuclear protein, requiring a bona fide nuclear localization signal to be imported into the nucleus. LANP translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the process of neuritogenesis, interacts with the light chain of the microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), and modulates the effects of MAP1B on neurite extension. LANP thus could play a key role in neuronal development and/or neurodegeneration by its interactions with microtubule associated proteins. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) 1The abbreviations used are: SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1; LANP, leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. belongs to a group of disorders in which a polyglutamine expansion in the disease protein launches a cascade of events that causes relentless neurodegeneration. We had previously proposed that the leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP) stands out as a particularly appealing candidate mediator of toxicity in SCA1 based on its ability to interact with ataxin-1 in a glutamine repeat-dependent manner (1Matilla A. Koshy B. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Moreover, LANP is expressed at particularly high levels in purkinje cells, the seat of SCA1 pathology. Thus, one could envisage a scenario where the functions of LANP could be altered upon binding to ataxin-1, triggering downstream toxic events. This could also account for the regional toxicity of ataxin-1, despite its own ubiquitous expression. Since its first description in 1994, LANP has been implicated in myriad cellular functions from the cell surface to the nucleus. First described as a putative human leukocyte antigen class II-associated protein (and hence called PHAPI), it was suspected to be involved in signal transduction in lymphocytes (2Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Matsuoka et al. (1994) independently described this protein in the developing cerebellum, and noting that it contained a leucine-rich repeat, called it by the acronym LANP. With a modular architecture reminiscent of a tadpole, LANP consists of a globular head formed by the N-terminal leucine-rich domain containing five leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a C-terminal tail formed by the remaining length of acidic residues (3Matsuoka K. Taoka M. Satozawa N. Nakayama H. Ichimura T. Takahashi N. Yamakuni T. Song S.-Y. Isobe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9670-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As such, it belongs to a large and very interesting family of proteins that contain LRRs crucial for protein interactions, by forming a very characteristic secondary structure designed for protein-protein interactions (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 5Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

It was therefore proposed to be a modulator of signaling pathways in cerebellar morphogenesis. LANP has since been implicated in a number of other functions: as a phosphorylated protein, LANP (known in this context as phosphoprotein 32 or pp32) was suggested to act as tumor suppressor (7Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Bai J. Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S.

Treat. 2001; 68: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); LANP has been shown to bind and shuttle the RNA-binding protein HuR, which is involved in RNA stability and transport. More recently it has been described as an inhibitor of histone acetylation and thus a transcriptional regulator (11Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and in a very different role as a modulator of apoptosis (12Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D.

A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were the first to suggest that LANP may also have cytoplasmic functions: in biochemical assays it binds to the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP2, MAP4, and tau, stimulating the microtubule- and dynein-dependent localization of the Golgi apparatus in semi-intact cells. Since it is unclear which of the functions of LANP, if any, might be perturbed in SCA1 pathogenesis, we sought to understand the neuronal properties of LANP. Here we report that LANP is typically nuclear in undifferentiated neuro2a cells. This compartmentalization is dependent on a nuclear localization signal in its C-terminal domain. LANP tends to be drawn to the cytoplasm during the process of neuronal differentiation. Intriquingly, in a search for LANP interacting proteins, we have identified the microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B, as a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with LANP. This interaction occurs via its light chain. Moreover the effects of MAP1B on neurite extension are altered by its interaction with LANP. This interaction has the potential to not only modulate neuritogenesis during neuronal development, but could also contribute to the loss of neurites and cytoarchitectural disarray seen in SCA1. Yeast Two-hybrid Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Full-length mouse LANP cDNA was subcloned into the NcoI-SmaI sites of the yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid pGBKT7, and the plasmid DNA was transformed into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). Transformed AH109 yeast strains containing the LANP bait plasmid were mated to the Y187 yeast strain pretransformed with a mouse brain pACT2 library. We used high stringency auxotrophic selection (using media deficient in adenine and histidine) to select for interacting clones. Positive clones were also tested for beta galactosidase activity in an overlay assay for the interaction of the bait and prey (library clone) interactions independently. To delimit the region of interaction of LANP we generated N- and C-terminally deleted LANP constructs. The C-terminally deleted LANP construct was engineered by digesting pGBK-T7 LANP with BsmI-SmaI to remove the C-terminal acidic domain, preserving the complete LRR region and then religating the backbone. To generate the N-terminally deleted construct we used a PCR-based strategy to clone a truncated LANP (residues 129–247) into the NdeI-SmaI sites of pGBK-T7. Cell Culture, Transfection, Expression Constructs, and Immunofluorescence—Clones derived from the pACT2 yeast two-hybrid screen were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-HA (Clontech). The construction of the mammalian tet-responsive expression plasmids (pMT5tet and pMT17tet) containing the heavy chain and full-length clones of rat MAP1B tagged at their C-terminal ends to the myc epitope has been described (17Togel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signal mutants of LANP were constructed by a PCR based mutagenesis strategy so as to alter residues 236 and 237 to alanine residues (from lysine and argine respectively) followed by subcloning into pCMV-myc (Clontech). Tissue culture cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). Neuro2a was used as a prototypical neuronal cell line. Differentiation of neuro2a cells was performed by growing cells in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) containing 0.3 mm dibutyryl cAMP (18De Girolamo L.A. Billett E.E. Hargreaves A.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For experiments on non-neuronal cells, COS-7 cells or BHK-21 cells (a kind gift of Dr. O. Skalli, University of Illinois) were used. To quantify neuritogenesis, cells were counted as having extended neurites if they exhibited at least one process longer than two cell bodies in length. Transfections were performed on coverslips using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection before being processed for immunofluorescence (17Togel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All images were captured by either light or confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Zeiss). Images were manipulated using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Antibodies—Anti-LANP antibody (antibody 3118) was generated by immunizing goat with bacterially expressed full-length LANP as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expressed and purified after subcloning into the bacterial expression vector pGEX5X3 (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-MAP1B C-20 antibody recognizes the light chain of MAP1B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following antibodies to epitope tags were used: anti-myc epitope, clone 9E10 (Sigma); anti-FLAG, clone m2 or polyclonal F7425 (Sigma); and anti-HA, clone HA.11 (Covance); dilutions of 1:100 for immunofluorescence and 1:1000 for Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected at ∼80% confluence on 150-mm dishes using 50 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The light chain of MAP1B was expressed as an HA-tagged fusion using the vector pCMV-HA; LANP was expressed as a FLAG-tagged fusion in pFLAG CMV-2. Two days post-transfection cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 3 ml of lysis buffer: phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) using the protocol recommended in the antibodies protocol guide using the relevant antibody or nonspecific immunoglobulins as controls (Clontech). Anti-HA immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-HA beads (Sigma); anti-LANP IP was performed by protein G beads coupled to FLAG M2 and 3118. LANP Is a Nucleo-cytoplasmic Shuttling Protein That Translocates from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm upon Differentiation—LANP has been described as both a nuclear and a cytoplasmic protein (1Matilla A. Koshy B. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Brennan et al. (19Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar) had earlier shown than in non-neuronal HeLa cells, LANP is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that interacts with the nuclear export factor CRM1, presumably via its leucine-rich domains, two of which are consensus sequences for the leptomycin-sensitive nuclear export signals, seen in rev and other shuttling proteins. Although it is not possible to mutate these putative nuclear export signal regions without affecting the conserved leucine-rich domains, the defining feature of the family of LRR proteins (6Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), the existence of these export signals seems likely based on the ability of leptomycin B to inhibit shuttling of LANP. LANP also bears a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its C-terminal acidic domain. This is a four-amino acid stretch of basic residues seen in LANP spanning residues 234–237 (lysine-arginine-lysinearginine). In a mouse LANP-like protein, this sequence when tagged to green fluorescent protein is sufficient to induce the nuclear localization of green fluorescent protein suggesting that this stretch of amino acids can function as an NLS (21Matsubae M. Kurihara T. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test whether this sequence is indeed the NLS for LANP and whether these residues are necessary for the nuclear localization of LANP, we mutated the second lysine and arginine residues of the this quartet to alanine residues. This mutant form of LANP (henceforth called LANP-KRAA) remains mainly cytoplasmic even when co-expressed with wild type LANP (that remains predominantly nuclear) (Fig. 1). This experiment also demonstrates the inability of mutant LANP to piggy-back on its wild type counterpart and enter the nucleus. Such a scenario might have been expected based on the ability of LANP to self-associate existing as dimers and trimers as has been reported previously (16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since LANP is a developmentally regulated protein in neuronal cells, with maximum abundance in the early postnatal life, we sought to determine whether its localization is altered depending on the process of differentiation, as has been observed for other proteins expressed at high levels during development (22Wakamatsu Y. Watanabe Y. Shimono A. Kondoh H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Carlock L. Vo T. Lorincz M. Walker P.D. Bessert D. Wisniewski D. Dunbar J.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In undifferentiated neuro2a cells, LANP typically is nuclear with little cytoplasmic staining. Upon differentiation by dbcAMP in the presence of low serum (18De Girolamo L.A. Billett E.E. Hargreaves A.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), LANP tends to be diffuse cytoplasmic, particularly in those cells with the most extensive neurites (Fig. 2, top panel). In addition to staining endogenous LANP with an LANP specific antibody, we also transfected epitope-tagged LANP into neuro2a cells so as to follow localization by an antibody specific to the epitope tag to rule out the possibility of nonspecific staining. Immunofluorescence microscopy once again revealed a dramatic alteration in LANP localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, often to the extent that the nucleus became completely devoid of LANP staining (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Approximately 80% of undifferentiated cells showed nuclear staining, while upon differentiation roughly the same percentage showed a cytoplasmic staining pattern for LANP. This translocation suggests that LANP shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during neuritogenesis, where its cytoplasmic function(s) may be more critical. LANP Interacts with MAP1B—To further delineate the neuronal properties of LANP, we decided to search for LANP interacting proteins expressed in neurons. To this end we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a mouse brain library and full-length LANP as bait. We identified MAP1B as a potential interacting partner. Three representative library clones of MAP1B that were fished out by the two-hybrid screening are shown in the schematic in relationship to the sequence of the rat MAP1B construct (Fig 3A). We also pulled out several clones corresponding to the C-terminal domain of MAP1A. These interacting clones were in general short. This result was not surprising in view of the fact that MAP1B and A share extensive similarity in their primary structure (80% identity in their last 100 amino acids). Intriguingly we also identified a tau isoform (GenBank™ accession number U12916) as an interacting bait. Since LANP had been demonstrated to interact with tau in biochemical assays we did not pursue the interaction of LANP with tau (15Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Itin C. Ulitzur N. Muhlbauer B. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2191-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of our microtubule-associated interactors, we decided to pursue the MAP1B interaction further, as it would indicate that LANP has the intriguing property of binding to all classes of structural microtubule-associated proteins. MAP1B, along with MAP1A, constitute the family of large molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins. Both these proteins have shared domains in addition to the C-terminal tail, some of which contain canonical repeats (Lys-Lys-Glu-X) involved in binding to microtubules (25Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26Zauner W. Kratz J. Staunton J. Feick P. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins are also processed similarly, undergoing proteolytic cleavage of a single precursor to produce a light chain and a heavy chain (27Hammarback J.A. Obar R.A. Hughes S.M. Vallee R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 129-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of MAP1B the heavy chain is 243 kDa, while the light chain is 27 kDa; the cleavage site has been narrowed to within 40 residues of a proline-rich hydrophobic domain of the full-length MAP1B (29Togel M. Eichinger R. Wiche G. Propst F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of our clones (clone 3-87; 242 residues) corresponded almost exactly to the complete light chain of MAP1B, beginning four residues downstream from the predicted cleavage event. This clone was the strongest interactor in our yeast two-hybrid screen, interacting more robustly with LANP than the other MAP1B clones picked up in the yeast two-hybrid that were either longer (clone 3-75, 559 residues) or shorter (clone 3-3, 168 residues) than the light chain. This suggests that LANP binds to the light chain per se (Fig. 3A). Since we were keen to determine which domain of LANP mediates the interaction of LANP with MAP1B, we generated N- and C-terminal deletions of LANP. Using yeast two-hybrid assays we were able to demonstrate that the acidic C-terminal domain of LANP interacted more robustly with the light chain of MAP1B than did the N-terminal domain of LANP, the domain bearing the LRRs (Fig. 3B). Incidentally, it is the C-terminal domain that bears the nuclear localization signal. It should be mentioned in the context of discussing the domain structure of LANP that it is the N-terminal region, i.e. the leucine-rich region, that is responsible for the interaction of LANP with ataxin-1 (1Matilla A. Koshy B. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). LANP Interacts with the Light Chain of MAP1B in Vivo— Since the majority of the MAP1B fragments isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen correspond to the C-terminal domain of the MAP1B precursor that eventually becomes the light chain, we sought to test the idea that the interaction of LANP is specific to the light chain of MAP1B. We first performed immunfluorescence studies to look at the subcellular localization of LANP in the presence of the MAP1B light chain (Fig. 4). When transfected alone, LANP localized predominantly to the nucleus in ∼80% of the cells. In the small percentage of COS-7 cells in which LANP is cytoplasmic, the staining is either diffuse or slightly vesicular, as was reported for CHO cells (Fig. 4A) (16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Incidentally, in our own studies using CHO cells, we found that LANP (transfected or endogenous) displays a predominant nuclear staining in addition to the lower intensity cytoplasmic staining (data not shown). Discrepancy with earlier findings might relate to the fact that the antibody used by Ulitzur et al. (16Ulitzur N. Rancaño C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recognizes only a subset of LANP in cells based on post-translational modifications (for instance phosphorylation). When co-tranfected with the MAP1B light chain, however, LANP relocated to the cytoplasm in ∼80% of COS-7 cells. This relocation to the cytoplasm was dramatic and in most of the cells LANP tends to be diffuse and cytoplasmic. However, in a few cells the LANP distribution was clearly fibrillar, with both MAP1B and LANP, co-localizing in a perinuclear filamentous pattern. This pattern reflects the bundled and collapsed microtubule networks described during earlier studies on its role in organizing tubulin networks (Ref. 17Togel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and our own data not shown using anti-tubulin antibodies) (Fig. 4). This suggests not only that the light chain of MAP1B interacts with LANP, but that LANP can bind at least to some extent with the microtubule-bound pool of the MAP1B light chain. In undifferentiated neuro2a cells this relocation to the cytoplasm is even more dramatic with more than 90% showing a cytoplasmic distribution of LANP when MAP1B light chain is overexpressed, reminiscent of the translocation of LANP seen during the process of differentiation. We next sought co-IP evidence. In Fig. 4H we demonstrated that we can co-immunoprecipitate the MAP1B light chain using antibodies targeted to LANP and also in the reverse direction, i.e. co-IP LANP when using antibodies directed against MAP1B light chain. The interaction between the two is thus fairly robust. Finally, to determine whether the preference of LANP for the light chain holds in cells, we used tagged constructs of MAP1B corresponding to the full-length precursor and the heavy chain of rat MAP1B (∼95% identity to mouse MAP1B) (Fig. 5 schematic) and transfected cells with FLAG LANP along side either full-length MAP1B or just with its heavy chain. We discovered that, much like the light chain of MAP1B, full-length MAP1B also causes a dramatic shift of staining from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, with a majority of cells (close to 70%) showing a cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5). This was to be expected, since full-length MAP1B is cleaved into its heavy and light chain in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (17 and data not shown). In contrast, expressing the heavy chain alone causes a less dramatic transition from nuclear to cytoplasmic staining, although it did increase the total number of cells showing a cytoplasmic staining from ∼20% to 40%. We speculate that this increase might be due to alterations in the dynamics of the endogenous light chain caused by the abundant quantities of newly introduced heavy chain, although it is possible that there is an interaction albeit less robust with the heavy chain as well. This is conceivable since the heavy chain contains a microtubule binding domain consisting of several KKEX and KKEE motifs, thought to contribute basic properties to the heavy chain and that could also potentially interact with the acidic tail domain of LANP (25Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). LANP Modulates the Functions of MAP1B in Neuritogenesis—Recent evidence suggests that the ratio of light chain to heavy chain is under strict developmental control, mediated by differential proteolysis and clearance of these fragments to keep the light and heavy chains in a 6:1 to 8:1 molar ratio (30Mei X. Sweatt A.J. Hammarback J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether different fragments of MAP1B might have differential effects on neurite outgrowth in neuro2a cells and whether the binding of LANP to the light chain could thereby affect neuritogenesis. Full-length MAP1B, the light chain and the heavy chain each, had a different effect on the ability of neuro2a cells to extend neurites (Fig. 6). Although full-length MAP1B has been previously shown to have only modest effects on microtubule stability in non-neuronal cells (31Takemura R. Okabe S. Umeyama T. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 953-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goold R.G. Owen R. Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it dramatically altered the morphology of transfected neuro2a cells. These cells became rounded (more than 80%) and were incapable of spreading out or extending neurites even after stimulation with dbcAMP, a potent inducer of neuritogenesis (up to 4 days after induction). Neither the light chain nor the heavy chain alone had such a significant effects on neuritic morphology (Fig. 6), although we noticed that the heavy chain had a greater inhibitory effect on neuritogenesis when compared with the light chain (80 and 60% of cells transfected with the light or heavy chain, respectively, were able to extend neurites). Thus, it appears that both the light chain and the heavy chain are presumably required to stabilize the microtubule cytoskeleton at the expense of neuritogenesis. This inhibitory effect on neuritogenesis by full-length MAP1B now allowed us to test whether LANP modulates the ability of full-length MAP1B to suppress neurite formation induced by dbcAMP (Fig. 7). Co-transfecting LANP with full-length MAP1B significantly increased the ability of the cells to form neurites. On the other hand, LANP did not affect the ability of cells to express neurites when transfected with either the heavy chain or light chain alone, suggesting that the alleviation on the inhibition of neuritogenesis is because of its interaction with the MAP1B complex. Although it is clear that SCA1 is caused by an expansion of glutamine repeats in the disease-causing protein ataxin-1, precisely how this repeat expansion translates into neurotoxic events is still an unanswered question. The experiments in this study were driven by the rationale that understanding the interactions and functions of proteins that may be sequestered by ataxin-1 might point to possible candidate toxic scenarios. LANP is one such ataxin-1 interacting protein that interacts more strongly with mutant ataxin-1 than its wild type counterpart, is expressed at higher levels in neurons that tend to be affected in SCA1, and has been shown to be redistributed into ataxin-1 inclusions (1Matilla A. Koshy B. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to identify the neuronal properties of LANP as a first step toward understanding its possible role in SCA1 pathogenesis. We found that, during neuronal differentiation, LANP translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where at least one of its interacting proteins is the light chain of MAP1B. Moreover LANP influences the modulatory role of MAP1B on neurite exte"
https://openalex.org/W2002873704,"Conformational diseases are caused by a structural rearrangement within a protein that results in aberrant intermolecular linkage and tissue deposition. This is typified by the polymers that form with the Z deficiency variant of α1-antitrypsin (Glu-342 → Lys). These polymers are retained within hepatocytes to form inclusions that are associated with hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We have assessed a surface hydrophobic cavity in α1-antitrypsin as a potential target for rational drug design in order to prevent polymer formation and the associated liver disease. The introduction of either Thr-114 → Phe or Gly-117 → Phe on strand 2 of β-sheet A within this cavity significantly raised the melting temperature and retarded polymer formation. Conversely, Leu-100 → Phe on helix D accelerated polymer formation, but this effect was abrogated by the addition of Thr-114 → Phe. None of these mutations affected the inhibitory activity of α1-antitrypsin. The importance of these observations was underscored by the finding that the Thr-114 → Phe mutation reduced polymer formation and increased the secretion of Z α1-antitrypsin from a Xenopus oocyte expression system. Moreover cysteine mutants within the hydrophobic pocket were able to bind a range of fluorophores illustrating the accessibility of the cavity to external agents. These results demonstrate the importance of this cavity as a site for drug design to ameliorate polymerization and prevent the associated conformational disease. Conformational diseases are caused by a structural rearrangement within a protein that results in aberrant intermolecular linkage and tissue deposition. This is typified by the polymers that form with the Z deficiency variant of α1-antitrypsin (Glu-342 → Lys). These polymers are retained within hepatocytes to form inclusions that are associated with hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

These results demonstrate the importance of this cavity as a site for drug design to ameliorate polymerization and prevent the associated conformational disease. Conformational diseases arise when a protein undergoes a change in size or a fluctuation in shape, which results in self-association and tissue deposition (1Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This process is now recognized to underlie a whole range of diseases including the amyloidoses, prion encephalopathies, glutamine repeat diseases, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (2Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The paradigm for the conformational diseases was provided by the serpinopathies, which result from mutations in members of the serine proteinase inhibitor or serpin superfamily. The most well characterized of these is the severe plasma deficiency that is associated with the Z allele of α1-antitrypsin (3Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). α1-Antitrypsin is the most abundant circulating proteinase inhibitor and the archetypal member of the serpin superfamily (4Potempa J.

Most individuals have two M α1-antitrypsin alleles, but ∼1 in 2000 are homozygous for the Z variant. The Z mutation results from a Glu → Lys substitution at amino acid 342 (6Jeppsson J.-O. FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and leads to retention of α1-antitrypsin as inclusion bodies within the hepatocyte. These inclusions predispose to neonatal hepatitis, juvenile cirrhosis, and adult hepatocellular carcinoma (7Sveger T. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1988; 77: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Eriksson S. Carlson J. Velez R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 9Sharp H.L. Bridges R.A. Krivit W. Freier E.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1969; 73: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting secretory defect accounts for the low circulating plasma level of α1-antitrypsin, which is only 15% of normal in the Z homozygote. This plasma deficiency exposes the lungs to uncontrolled proteolytic attack that in turn causes early onset panacinar emphysema particularly in Z α1-antitrypsin homozygotes who smoke (10Piitulainen E. Eriksson S. Eur. Respir. J. 1999; 13: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure of α1-antitrypsin is based on a five-stranded β-sheet A and a mobile reactive center loop (11Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H.

Our previous studies have shown that the Z mutation promotes opening of β-sheet A to facilitate a sequential interaction between the reactive center loop of one molecule and β-sheet A of a second, resulting in polymer formation (3Lomas D.A.

These polymers tangle within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes to form the periodic acid-Schiff-positive inclusions that are associated with liver disease (3Lomas D.A. Evans D.L.

The significance of the reactive loop-β-sheet linkage was underscored by two other α1-antitrypsin variants, Siiyama (Ser-53 → Phe) and Mmalton (Δ52 → Phe) that also resulted in hepatic inclusions and severe plasma deficiency of α1-antitrypsin. Both of these mutants spontaneously formed polymers in vivo (18Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

Moreover, this linkage accounts for the mild plasma deficiency observed with both S (Glu-264 → Val) and I (Arg-39 → Cys) α1-antitrypsin (20Elliott P.R. Stein P.E. Bilton D. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A.

Further support for polymer formation as the mechanism responsible for the retention of mutant α1-antitrypsin within hepatocytes came from studies utilizing the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Point mutations that attenuated polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin in vitro (14Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8393-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the mechanism underlying polymerization has allowed the design of strategies to prevent polymer formation (3Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 16Mahadeva R. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6771-6774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To date, however, these have been based on peptides that bind to β-sheet A and as a consequence inactivate α1-antitrypsin as a proteinase inhibitor. A more useful strategy would be to identify cavities in α1-antitrypsin that can bind peptides, or their mimetics, and block polymerization without a loss of inhibitory activity. Our high resolution crystal structure of α1-antitrypsin revealed a large hydrophobic cavity bounded by strand 2 of β-sheet A and helices D and E (Fig. 1). The cavity is present in monomeric α1-antitrypsin but is obliterated during polymerization (24Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This cavity could provide an ideal target for drug design to prevent polymer formation and the associated liver disease (11Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Kim S.-J. Woo J.-R. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. Ryu S.-E. J. Mol.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to explore the role of this surface cavity in the conformational transitions of α1-antitrypsin in vitro and in vivo. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant α 1-Antitrypsin—Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin (Met-358 → Arg) was used as the wild type protein. Replacement of the P1 methionine to arginine renders the protein a potent inhibitor of thrombin rather than neutrophil elastase. It otherwise has the same biophysical properties and rate of polymerization as Met-358 α1-antitrypsin (15Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33663-33668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 4: 453-458Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The α1-antitrypsin mutants (Leu-100 → Phe, Thr-114 → Phe, Gly-117 → Phe, Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe, Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, and Thr-114 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and the sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. The α1-antitrypsin variants were cloned into the pET16b plasmid and transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, and expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Recombinant α1-antitrypsin was extracted from the crude E. coli extract by Q-, then zinc chelating-, and finally glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (11Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However this method was not efficient for purification of the cysteine cavity mutants. Therefore, the α1-antitrypsin cavity mutants were also expressed in the pQE31 vector that contained an amino-terminal MRSHHHHHH tag. Recombinant proteins were then purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli lysate by HiTrap Ni-chelating and Q-Sepharose column chromatography as detailed previously (26Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and purity was confirmed by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. Characterization of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant α 1-Antitrypsin—The recombinant proteins were characterized by non-denaturing and 0–8 m transverse urea gradient PAGE. Inhibitory activity was calculated by incubating bovine α-chymotrypsin (5 pmol) of known active site (27Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 3-20Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with increasing concentrations of α1-antitrypsin (estimated active site concentration of 0.1 μm) in a total volume of 100 μl with 0.03 m sodium phosphate, 0.16 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 4000, pH 7.4, reaction buffer. The reaction proceeded for 10 min at room temperature, and the residual proteolytic activity was determined by the addition of the substrate succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-propyl-l-phenylanalyl-p-nitroanilide to a final concentration of 0.16 mm (18Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in the A 405 over 3 min was observed. Active site values were obtained by plotting residual proteolytic activity against the volume of α1-antitrypsin and extrapolating to the x intercept (28Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binary complexes were formed by incubating 50–100-fold molar excess of the antithrombin 12-mer peptide (P14–3; Ac-Ser-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-OH) or α1-antitrypsin 6-mer peptide (P7–2′; Ac-Phe-Leu-Glu-Ala-Ile-Gly-OH) with each α1-antitrypsin variant at 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for up to 48 h. Samples at different time points were assessed on a 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing gel containing 8 m urea (16Mahadeva R. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6771-6774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. The melting temperature and far ultraviolet (250–195 nm) CD spectrum were obtained for each α1-antitrypsin mutant as described previously (14Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) Assessment of Polymerization of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant α 1-Antitrypsin—Polymer formation was assessed by incubating each of the recombinant α1-antitrypsin variants at 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, at 52 °C. The samples were then separated by 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE, and the protein was visualized by silver staining. Loss of intensity of the monomeric protein band was determined by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). The half-life for polymer formation was calculated from the semi-log plot of the ln fractional loss against time in seconds. Assessment of α 1-Antitrypsin Secretion from the Xenopus Oocyte— The cavity mutants Leu-100 → Phe, Thr-114 → Phe, and Gly-117 → Phe were inserted into the sp64T plasmid containing either M or Z α1-antitrypsin by site-directed mutagenesis, and the sequences were confirmed as before. The in vitro transcription and assessment of α1-antitrypsin secretion from the Xenopus oocyte were undertaken as described previously (23Sidhar S.K. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Foreman R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8393-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorophore Labeling of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant α 1-Antitrypsin—The cysteine cavity mutants were labeled with a 20-fold molar excess of either tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide (5-TM-RIA), 1The abbreviations used are: 5-TMRIA, tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide; 5-IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF), N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl)-N′-iodoacetylethylenediamine (FL IA) or N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl) iodoacetamide (FL C1-IA) at both 20 and 37 °C, for up to 72 h at pH 7.4 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 14.3 m β-mercaptoethanol, and the labeled protein was separated from excess label on a NAP-10 gel filtration column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4. Three residues of α1-antitrypsin were selected for site-directed mutagenesis in order to explore the role of the cavity in polymer formation. Leu-100 on hD and Thr-114 on s2A have side chains that point into the hydrophobic pocket, whereas Gly-117 is located at the base of the cavity on s2A (Fig. 1B). Introducing large phenylalanine residues, or cysteine residues that could be labeled with bulky fluorophores, at these sites was predicted to fill the cavity and mimic the effect of binding a small molecule inhibitor. The one naturally occurring cysteine at position 232 in α1-antitrypsin was replaced by a serine residue to ensure that only the newly introduced cavity cysteine was available for labeling. The Cys-232 → Ser mutation has no effect on the inhibitory activity or polymerization of recombinant α1-antitrypsin (15Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

Purification of Cavity Mutants—Wild type, Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, Thr-114 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, and Gly-117 → Phe α1-antitrypsin were purified from the supernatant following lysis of the E. coli (11Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, this approach relies on glutathione affinity chromatography, and the α1-antitrypsin cavity mutants Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser and Thr-114 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser were unable to bind to the glutathione resin. Wild type, Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, Thr-114 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, Leu-100 → Phe, Thr-114 → Phe, Gly-117 → Phe, and Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe α1-antitrypsin were therefore cloned into an expression vector containing the MRSHHHHHH tag at the amino terminus. They were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by Ni-chelating- and Q-Sepharose column chromatography. Subsequent experiments were performed with purified recombinant α1-antitrypsin variants containing an amino-terminal His tag. All the recombinant proteins migrated as a characteristic doublet on 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE and as a single band on 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE apart from Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe α1-antitrypsin which contained a minor contaminant (data not shown). All the mutants had an unfolding profile that was similar to wild type α1-antitrypsin on a 0–8 m transverse urea gradient gel with the exception of Gly-117 → Phe, which unfolded at a higher urea concentration (∼4 m) indicating increased stability (data not shown). Finally the far UV CD spectrum of all the variants was similar to that of wild type α1-antitrypsin confirming that the mutations did not cause a significant perturbation in the overall structure of the molecule (data not shown). Inhibitory Function of Recombinant α 1-Antitrypsin Variants—Recombinant wild type α1-antitrypsin was 66.8% active as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin. All the cavity mutants displayed similar inhibitory activities (Table I) except Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe and Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser α1-antitrypsin whose activities were reduced to 46.6 and 35.1%, respectively. The recombinant proteins all formed SDS-stable complexes when incubated in a 1:1 active site molar ratio with bovine α-chymotrypsin (Fig. 2).Table IThe inhibitory activity, melting temperatures, and rate of polymer formation of recombinant wild type and mutant α1-antitrypsinα1-Antitrypsin mutantInhibitory activityMelting temperaturePolymer formation%°Ct½ hWild type66.8 ± 0.465.4 ± 0.75.6 ± 0.81Leu-100 → Phe76.7 ± 1.661.9 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.47Thr-114 → Phe64.6 ± 1.268.4 ± 0.156.2 ± 8.01Gly-117 → Phe62.6 ± 1.173.9 ± 0.496.3 ± 0.02Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe46.6 ± 0.567.8 ± 0.48.6 ± 1.43Leu-100 → Cys/Cys 232 → Ser35.1 ± 0.866.3 ± 0.85.9 ± 0.72Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → SeraThis represents the cysteine variants maximally labeled with 5-IAF in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 2 h.

Open table in a new tab Thermal Stability of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant α 1-Antitrypsin—The melting temperature (Tm) of wild type and mutant α1-antitrypsin was examined by circular dichroic spectroscopy. The amino-terminal histidine tag increased the melting temperature of all the recombinant α1-antitrypsin variants by 6 °C when compared with the proteins purified from E. coli lysate that lacked the histidine tag (data not shown). All the mutations introduced into strand 2A elevated the Tm of the protein. In particular, Gly-117 → Phe α1-antitrypsin had a melting temperature that was more than 8 °C higher than the wild type protein. Helix D mutations had differing effects according to their size. Leu-100 → Phe lowered the melting temperature by 3.5 °C, whereas a cysteine residue at the same position did not significantly alter the Tm when compared with the wild type control. Furthermore, the addition of a second phenylalanine residue within the cavity at position 114 (Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe) resulted in an increase in thermal stability, reversing the effect of Leu-100 → Phe mutation alone (Table I). Thermal stability was also assessed by incubating recombinant wild type or cavity mutants of α1-antitrypsin between 30 and 100 °C, at increments of 10 °C for 15 min, and assessing the samples by 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE. Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser and Leu-100 → Phe α1-antitrypsin had thermal stabilities similar to that of wild type protein. However, Gly-117 → Phe α1-antitrypsin was the most thermostable as it remained monomeric following incubation at 60 °C for 15 min, which was 10 °C higher than wild type α1-antitrypsin. Thr-114 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser, Thr-114 → Phe, and Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe α1-antitrypsin all had intermediate thermal stabilities (data not shown). Thus, the differences in melting temperatures were mirrored in the thermal stability of wild type and mutant α1-antitrypsin when assessed by heating and separation on non-denaturing PAGE. Polymerization of Recombinant α 1-Antitrypsin Variants—Polymerization was assessed at 0.1 mg/ml and 52 °C for up to 7 days as these conditions led to polymer formation of histidine-tagged recombinant α1-antitrypsin that could be visualized by non-denaturing PAGE. The rate of polymer formation was calculated from the loss of intensity of the monomeric protein band using densitometry scanning (Table I). Wild type α1-antitrypsin almost completely polymerized within 24 h when heated at 52 °C (Fig. 3a). Leu-100 → Phe α1-antitrypsin accelerated polymer formation in keeping with its lower melting temperature (Fig. 3b). However, replacing Leu-100 with a cysteine residue (Fig. 3c) or introducing another bulky phenylalanine residue at position 114 (Fig. 3d) within the cavity reversed this effect as these mutants polymerized at a rate similar to wild type α1-antitrypsin (Table I). Interestingly, all the mutations introduced on to s2A, independent of size, slowed polymer formation as would be predicted from their melting temperatures (Fig. 3, e–g) (Table I). The most thermostable mutant Gly-117 → Phe α1-antitrypsin dramatically impeded polymer formation, as polymers were evident only after incubating at 52 °C for 72 h. Binary Complex Formation between Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant α 1-Antitrypsin and Exogenous Reactive Loop Peptides—A 12-mer peptide corresponding to the reactive center loop of antithrombin (P14–3) was used to assess the patency of β-sheet A. Binary complexes were formed by incubating recombinant α1-antitrypsin (0.5 mg/ml) with a 50–100-fold molar excess of amino-terminal acetylated 12-mer peptide at 37 °C for 48 h. Samples were examined on 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE containing 8 m urea. Recombinant wild type α1-antitrypsin and the cavity mutants all formed a binary complex with the 12-mer peptide with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 4, a–g). Gly-117 → Phe α1-antitrypsin formed a binary complex with the peptide at a rate faster than wild type α1-antitrypsin (Table II and Fig. 4b), whereas binary complex formation was significantly retarded by Leu-100 → Phe α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 4c). The other cavity mutations all similarly slowed annealing of the peptide to β-sheet A. Neither recombinant wild type nor Leu-100 → Phe α1-antitrypsin was able to form a binary complex with the 6-mer peptide, corresponding to P7–2 of the reactive loop of α1-antitrypsin, under the same conditions at 24 h (data not shown).Table IIBinary complex formation for recombinant wild type and cavity mutants of α1-antitrypsinα1-Antitrypsin mutantBinary complex formation (t ½ h)Wild type2.6 ± 0.27Leu-100 → Phe7.0 ± 1.78Thr-114 → Phe4.0 ± 0.57Gly-117 → Phe1.3 ± 0.43Leu-100 → Phe/Thr-114 → Phe3.4 ± 0.29Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → Ser4.3 ± 1.39Leu-100 → Cys/Cys-232 → SeraThis represents the cysteine cavity mutants maximally labeled with 5-IAF in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 2 h.

This mutant is too unstable to be expressed as a recombinant protein, and the mutants were therefore assessed for their effect on the secretion of Z α1-antitrypsin in vivo. 62% (S.E. ± 4%) of the wild type protein was secreted from the oocytes compared with 10% (±2%) of Z α1-antitrypsin (p = 0.0001, Student's t test with Welch correction). Gly-117 → Phe and Leu-100 → Phe had little effect on the secretion of Z α1-antitrypsin (17 ± 5 and 18 ± 5%, respectively). However Thr-114 → Phe more than doubled the secretion of Z α1-antitrypsin to 23 ± 4% (p = 0.0018 compared with Z α1-antitrypsin). The results are the mean of 5–9 separate experiments.

From initial velocity experiments, catalytic constants for substrates best suited for the first and second C1 transfer activities, cycloartenol and 24(28)-methylenelophenol, were 0.01 and 0.001 s–1, respectively. Two-substrate kinetic analysis using cycloartenol and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) generated an intersecting line pattern characteristic of a ternary complex kinetic mechanism. The high energy intermediate analog 25-azacycloartanol was a noncompetitive inhibitor versus cycloartenol and an uncompetitive inhibitor versus AdoMet. The dead end inhibitor analog cyclolaudenol was competitive versus cycloartenol and uncompetitive versus AdoMet. 24(28)-Methylenecycloartanol and AdoHcy generated competitive and noncompetitive kinetic patterns, respectively, with respect to AdoMet. Therefore, 24(28)-methylenecycloartanol combines with the same enzyme form as does cycloartenol and must be released from the enzyme before AdoHcy. 25-Azacycloartanol inhibited the first and second C1 transfer activities with about equal efficacy (Ki = 45 nm), suggesting that the successive C-methylation of the Δ24 bond occurs at the same active center. Comparison of the initial velocity data using AdoMet versus [2H3-methyl]AdoMet as substrates tested against saturating amounts of cycloartenol indicated an isotope effect on V CH3/V CD3 close to unity.

The stereochemical features as well as the observation of isotopically sensitive branching during the second C-methylation suggests that the two methylation steps can proceed by a change in chemical mechanism resulting from differences in sterol structure, concerted versus carbocation; the kinetic mechanism remains the same during the consecutive methylation of the Δ24 bond.

Sterol methyltransferases (SMTs) 1The abbreviations used are: SMT, sterol methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.41); AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; phytosterol, 24-alkyl(idene) sterol; HEI, high energy intermediate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; KIE, kinetic isotope effect. are ubiquitously represented in plants and fungi (1Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Together, these enzymes generate 24-alkyl sterol diversity, which includes formation of singly and doubly C-24-alkylated sterol side chains and olefin variants possessing Δ24(28), Δ23(24), and Δ25(27) side chains (2Goad L.J. Lenton J.R. Knapp F.F. Goodwin T.W. Lipids. 1974; 9: 582-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In most organisms, SMTs catalyze the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phytosterols (3Nes W.D. Venkatramesh M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 3: 81-93Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Chappell J. Wolf F. Proulx J. Cuellar R. Saunders C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The crucial role of these enzymes to generate an essential physiological group in sterol structure has stimulated considerable interest in the stereochemistry and mechanism of the C-methylation reaction (5Nes W.R. Sekula B.C. Nes W.D. Adler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6218-6225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bloch K.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 14: 47-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Several SMTs have been characterized at the molecular level, and their amino acid compositions reveal a highly conserved signature motif that represents the sterol-binding site (7Nes W.D.

(2003) Phytochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). A number of these enzymes have been characterized, and they share similar native molecular masses in the range of 160–175 kDa and similar properties (1Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The methyl transfer reaction catalyzed by SMT is proposed to proceed through a nucleophilic attack by the π electrons of the Δ24 double bond on the S-methyl group of AdoMet (9Moore J.T. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Venkatramesh M. Guo D. Jia Z. Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The reaction can lead to the formation of a high energy intermediate (HEI) possessing a methyl at C-24 and a carbonium ion at C-25. After a hydride transfer from C-24 to C-25, an elimination of a proton at C-28 occurs, giving a 24(28)-methylene sterol. The steric course of the reaction has been hypothesized to proceed by an “X-group” (covalent), carbocation, or concerted mechanism (Scheme 1) (8Nes, W. D. (2003) Phytochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). As recognized in the steric-electric plug model and X-group mechanism, the conformation of the bound sterol side chain can influence the configuration of the enzyme-generated product at C-24 and C-25 (Scheme 1A) (8Nes, W. D. (2003) Phytochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar).Scheme 1Hypothetical C-methylation pathway.

Ciba Found. Symp. 1978; 60: 243-258Google Scholar, 12Guo D. Jia Z. Nes W.D. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8507-8508Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Zhou W. Guo D. Nes W.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 1339-1442Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and therefore suggested a general catalytic mechanism for sterol C-methylation. Early kinetic studies carried out with microsomal preparations or detergent-solubilized enzyme preparations ruled out a Ping Pong (covalent) mechanism and supported either a concerted or carbocation mechanism for catalysis (9Moore J.T. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Venkatramesh M. Guo D. Jia Z. Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Support for the carbocation mechanism was considered to result from the intermediacy of HEIs in sterol C-methylation catalysis, whereby mimics of the transition state species were effective inhibitors of plant and fungal SMT activity (1Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the carbocation mechanism was recently eliminated as a possible route in ergosterol synthesis (operating the first C1 transfer reaction) by work on the stereochemistry of the fungal enzyme-mediated CH3 to CH2 reaction and the stereochemistry at C-25 resulting from the 1,2-hydride shift reaction (11Arigoni D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1978; 60: 243-258Google Scholar, 12Guo D. Jia Z. Nes W.D. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8507-8508Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Zhou W. Guo D. Nes W.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 1339-1442Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). According to these stereochemical experiments, C-methylation of zymosterol (cholesta-8,24-dienol; native substrate) by yeast SMT is to occur via a noncovalent pathway whereby methyl addition to Δ24 and deprotonation of C-28 give rise to a nucleophilic rearrangement in which H-24 migrates to C-25 on the re-face of the substrate double bond in concert with the initial ionization. Previous investigators attempted to characterize the chemical and kinetic mechanism of the first and second C1 transfer reactions catalyzed by plant SMTs by studying each individually (14Rahier A. Taton M. Bouvier-Nave P. Schmitt P. Benveniste P. Schuber F. Narula A.S. Cattel L. Anding C. Place P. Lipids. 1986; 21: 51-62Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). Thus, differences in pathway sequencing, substrate specificity, inhibitor recognition, and primary structures of the enzyme from different organisms have been interpreted as indicating that two classes of SMTs, SMT1 and SMT2, are responsible for the creation of two types of methylated species (14Rahier A. Taton M. Bouvier-Nave P. Schmitt P. Benveniste P. Schuber F. Narula A.S. Cattel L. Anding C. Place P. Lipids. 1986; 21: 51-62Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Shi J. Gonzales R.A.

One enzyme activity, SMT1, exhibits a marked preference for position-specific Δ24(25)-olefins monomethylating to form Δ24(28)-sterols in plants and fungi. The second activity, SMT2, was initially described as a 24(28)-methylenelophenol methyltransferase from plants (14Rahier A. Taton M. Bouvier-Nave P. Schmitt P. Benveniste P. Schuber F. Narula A.S. Cattel L. Anding C. Place P. Lipids. 1986; 21: 51-62Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although it is now known to exist in fungi, where it is much more efficient for substrates such as 24(28)-methylenelanosterol (19Kaneshiro E.S.

SMT2 is considered to monomethylate the product of the first C1 transfer reaction, forming Δ24(28) Z-ethylidene sterols exclusively. Nes et al. (20Nes W.D. McCourt B.S. Zhou W. Ma J. Marshall J.A. Peek L-A. Brennan M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) purified the yeast SMT to homogeneity in 1998 and generated a mutant by site-directed mutagenesis, making it clear that both methyl transfer reactions involving Δ24(25)- and Δ24(28)-sterols can be catalyzed by a single enzyme and that the second C1 transfer activity can result from the same active site as the first C1 transfer activity to give multiple products. However, as of yet, the overall catalytic action of a plant SMT has not been established. The recent cloning of a fusion SMT from soybean (15Shi J. Gonzales R.A. Bhattacharyya M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9384-9389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and our efforts to prepare a range of sterol substrates from natural sources or through synthesis has made it possible to generate large amounts of native protein for purification and detailed kinetic analysis. We now describe a systematic approach to determine the overall mechanism of SMT catalysis for a plant SMT, which necessitated experiments to establish a stereochemical correlation between the products of the first and second C1 transfer activities and the predicted high energy intermediate of the reaction. In addition, the steady-state kinetic parameters derived for substrates and inhibitors have been compared in order to reveal topological relations as directed in the steric-electric plug model for SMT action (Scheme 1).

[3-3H]24(28)Methylenecycloartanol (89 μCi/μmol) was prepared from [3-3H]cycloartenol, and [25-2H]24 (28)-methylenecycloartanol was prepared from [24-2H]cycloartenol using the soybean SMT assay system. [28E-2H]24(28)-methylenecycloartanol and [28Z-2H]24(28)-methylenecycloartanol (95% atom enrichment) was prepared according to Arigoni with modifications as specified (11Arigoni D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1978; 60: 243-258Google Scholar, 22Okuzumi T. Kaji Y. Hamada H. Fujomoto Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 3623-3626Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purity and identification of all sterol compounds assayed with the soybean SMT (>99%) were established after HPLC and/or analysis by GC/MS and 1H NMR (500 MHz) as described (23Guo D. Venkatramesh V. Nes W.D. Lipids. 1995; 30: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Construction of Native SMT—The cDNA encoding soybean SMT (provided by the Noble Foundation) (15Shi J. Gonzales R.A. Bhattacharyya M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9384-9389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was contained in the plasmid pSERT carrying a FLAG epitope-tagged SMT1 cDNA that generates a fusion protein. The entire open reading frame of the DNA encoding soybean SMT was transferred to a T7-based high level expression system, pET23a, and the resulting construct was transformed into BL21 cells for protein expression. The original cDNA was used for PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the forward primer GGAATTCCATATGCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATCGAAAC, which substituted the 5′ terminus of pSERT and installed an NdeI restriction site at the starting methionine, in conjunction with the reverse primer, CGCGGATCCTTAGTTCCTGTCTAAATCAGGC, which introduced a BamHI restriction site following the stop codon to give the native form of the protein. The resulting amplicons were modified to include NdeI and BamHI (sticky ends) overhangs and ligated into TA cloning vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to yield the corresponding vector, SMT/PCR2.1. This construct together with pET23a was doubly digested with NdeI and BamHI. The liberated SMT gene was then ligated into pET23a using the NdeI and BamHI overhangs generated during digestion. The resulting ligation mixture was transformed into BL21(DE3)-competent E. coli cells by heat shock (20Nes W.D. McCourt B.S. Zhou W. Ma J. Marshall J.A. Peek L-A. Brennan M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sequencing confirmed that no errors had been introduced by the polymerase reactions (dideoxy terminator sequencing ABI 373 sequencer). cDNA Expression and Enzyme Purification—A frozen stock of the BL21(DE3) strain harboring the soybean SMT cDNA provided single colonies to inoculate 250 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and grown for 10 h at 30 °C in a floor shaker. The culture was used to inoculate 4 liters of Luria Broth divided into four Erlenmeyer flasks containing the same antibiotic. When A 600 of the suspended culture reached ∼0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 ml, and the culture was incubated further at 30 °C for 2 h with moderate shaking (200 rpm) to induce SMT expression. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4 °C, 10,000 x g, 10 min), and the cell paste was snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C or used directly. A portion of the cell paste (5 g) was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 ml Tris-HCl, 2 ml MgCl2, 2 ml β-mercaptoethanol, 1 ml EDTA, and 5% glycerol (v/v) at pH 8.5), and the suspension was lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Insoluble protein and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 100,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant (25 ml) was used for enzyme assay or as a source of SMT for further purification. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. In order to reduce contaminants, the 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to a column of Q-Sepharose (∼20 nmol of SMT to a 20-ml column volume) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. To the first 25 ml of eluant was added 0.4% emulphogen, and the sample was stirred on ice for 30 min. The material was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column containing buffer A and emulphogen detergent (to a final concentration of 0.4%). The column was developed with a stepwise gradient from 100 to 300 ml NaCl in buffer A and detergent (0.4%). Each of five fractions (30 ml/15 min) was monitored for SMT activity and by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli in a 12% polyacrylamide vertical slab preceded by 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Gels were stained with 2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250R in methanol/acetic acid/water (45:10: 45). Protein content during the purification was estimated by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) referenced to bovine serum albumin. Fractions corresponding to 150 ml salt containing SMT activity were combined, desalted by washing with fresh buffer A (15 × 5 ml), and concentrated (Amicon ultrafiltration YM-10 membrane) to a final volume of 10 ml. The average yield to this point was about 16 mg of total protein. The solution from Q-Sepharose was loaded onto an Amersham Biosciences Mono Q™ HR 10/10 column that was previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.4% emulphogen. The column was eluted with a 150-ml stepwise gradient from 50 to 300 ml NaCl in the same buffer while monitoring the effluent as before. A set of fractions (2 ml each) in the 150 ml NaCl possessed a homogenous protein by SDS-PAGE (single ∼41-kDa band). The concentration of SMT at the 90% or greater purity level was 0.3 mg/ml. In some preparations, a doublet was found to chromatograph in SDS-PAGE at the 36–41-kDa range. The two species were electroeluted from the gel and Edman-sequenced. The lower band was found to possess a sequence identical to the top band except lacking in the first 56 amino acids, suggesting it to be a translational truncation product or partially proteolyzed form resulting from expression in the E. coli host. To generate a pure SMT species, the set of fractions corresponding to SMT activity eluting between fractions 16 and 30 were combined and loaded onto the FPLC again. Fractions (numbers 18–22) corresponding to the center of the activity/mass peak were found to be pure by SDS-PAGE. These fractions were then used for k cat, molecular weight, and amino acid composition determinations. A second determination of the molecular mass of the pure protein was determined commercially by MALDI-TOF (Scripps Research Institute), giving a mass for the monomer of 41,597 Da. For a precise determination of protein concentration to establish the k cat value, the A 280 was measured using an extinction coefficient of 50,010 m–1 cm–1. Native molecular weight of pure protein from FPLC was determined by gel permeation chromatography. A 0.5-ml sample of the 100,000 × g supernatant in 0.4% emulphogen was loaded onto a calibrated (Bio-Rad reference standards from 1.67 to 670 kDa) Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column coupled to an FPLC system eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Activity assays were performed on each fraction during the run from 10 to 300 min. A single peak of activity was observed between fractions 135 to 140, which corresponded to a molecular mass of ∼161 kDa. SMT Assays and Product Detection—The standard assay for recombinant SMT activity was performed in 600 μl of total volume, 5–15 μg of pure SMT, or 1–2 mg of total protein in buffer B (50 ml Tris buffer, 2 ml MgCl2, 2 ml 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5), 50 μl sterol substrate, 50 μl [methyl-3H3]AdoMet at 0.6 μCi, and Tween 80 (1%, v/v) to produce 104 to 106 dpm of product in 45 min at 35 °C. The incubation mixture was terminated with 500 μl of a solution of 10% methanolic KOH. The methylated sterol product was extracted three times with 2.5 ml each in hexane (Fisher) and mixed on a vortex mixer for 30 s. The resulting organic layer was then transferred to a 7-ml scintillation vial, and the sample was taken for liquid scintillation counting to determine conversion rate (20Nes W.D. McCourt B.S. Zhou W. Ma J. Marshall J.A. Peek L-A. Brennan M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, standard assays were performed at 10 substrate concentrations from 5 to 200 μl sterol with the AdoMet concentration held at saturation of 50 μl. The Km and V max for AdoMet were determined from 5 to 200 μl with sterol concentration held at 50 μl. From the variation of reaction velocity with substrate concentration according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, an apparent saturation of either substrate approached 50 μl (data not shown). Random variations in measured velocities did not exceed ±10%. Reactions up to 3 h were linear with protein concentration up to 2 mg/ml and were carried out such that there was about 70% conversion of substrate using the standard assay at saturating concentrations of cycloartenol and AdoMet. The enzyme preparations were free of contaminating sterol, which can be a problem when 100,000 × g preparations are developed from plant tissues. The initial velocity data were determined using the computer program Sigmaplot 2001 plus the enzyme kinetics module software package. Data were fitted to the equation, ν=Vmax*S/(Km+S)(Eq. 1) using a nonlinear least-squares approach, and the kinetic constants ± S.E. were never greater than 5% of the experimental measurement, and R 2 values were between 0.95 and 0.97. The product distribution generated by the SMT was determined at saturating levels of substrate and with sufficiently large preparations (5 mg/ml of protein) to ensure accuracy by GC/MS peak integration by the total ion current chromatogram (25Nes W.D. McCourt B.S. Marshall J.A. Dennis A.L. Lopez M. Le H. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An estimate of the conversion of stable isotope-labeled substrates was obtained by summing the relevant ion intensities, followed by background correction, relative to those of the corresponding nonisotopically labeled enzyme-generated product in parallel experiments; isotopic abundance was calculated from the molecular ion(s) following background correction. The back reaction to establish the equilibrium for the C-methylation reaction was performed with 5 mg/ml protein of partially pure SMT derived from the Q-Sepharose column fractions. The analysis was performed by standard assay, except saturating concentrations of [3-3H]24(28)-methylenecyloartanol and AdoHcy were added to the reaction mixture for overnight incubation. The resulting tritiated sample was isotopically diluted with 25 μg of cycloartenol, and the sterol composition was examined by HPLC-radiocounting (26Nes W.D. Janssen G.G. Bergenstrahle A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15202-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding constants for the SMT were determined using equilibrium dialysis and the filter-binding method. Tritiated ligand, sterol or AdoMet, was assayed with pure soybean SMT by a standard protocol (7Nes W.D. Marshall J.A. Jia Z. Jaradat T.T Song Z. Jayasimha P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42549-42556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two-substrate Kinetic Measurements—The two-substrate kinetic analysis was performed at cycloartenol concentrations spanning 10–50 μl and AdoMet concentrations spanning 20 to 100 μl, and the data were fitted to the sequential (ternary complex) mechanism equation (Equation 2) using the same software package based on the algorithms of Cleland as discussed by Copeland (27Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar), ν=Vm*A*B/(Kia*Kb+Kma*B+Kmb*A+A*B)(Eq. 2) using a nonlinear least squares approach. Related formulations as discussed by Cleland to establish a Ping Pong (covalent intermediate) mechanism and the equilibrium-ordered mechanism were also examined (data not shown). Kma = Km of AdoMet, Kia = kd for AdoMet (dissociation constant to free enzyme where AdoMet binds prior to sterol), and Kmb = Km of sterol. Steady-state Inhibition—Kinetic data from standard activity assays of product inhibition and dead end inhibition experiments were analyzed with the software package in analogous fashion to the initial velocity data analysis. The constant substrate in these experiments was held at subsaturating concentrations, and the varied substrate was added to the activity assays at several fixed concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μl AdoHcy, from 50 to 150 μl 24(28)-methylenecycloartenol, from 5 to 50 μl AdoMet, and from 5 to 50 μl cycloartenol. Cyclolaudenol and 25-azacycloartanol were used in the dead end inhibition studies assayed in the individual experiments against sterol substrate at several fixed concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μl and from 10 to 100 nl, respectively. To investigate whether competitive (Equation 3), noncompetitive (Equation 4), or uncompetitive (Equation 5) inhibition was observed, the data were fitted to the respective equations based on the algorithms defined by Cleland (27Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar) using nonlinear least squares analysis. ν=Vm/[1+(Km/S)*(1+I/Ki)](Eq. 3) ν=Vm/[(1+I/Ki)*(1+Km/S)](Eq. 4) ν=Vm/(1+I/Ki+Km/S)(Eq. 5) The data for individual experiments with each inhibitor versus varied substrate were fit to all three inhibitor models. Kinetic constants ± S.E. are shown as relevant. V max is the maximum velocity, Km is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, S is the concentration of sterol or AdoMet substrate, I is the concentration of the inhibitor, and Ki is the dissociation constant (assuming dissociation to free enzyme where AdoMet binds prior to sterol). Choice of kinetic fit was based on a combination of visual inspection and comparison of S.E. values and residual for all three inhibition types applied to the data sets. Kinetic Isotope Effects—The KIE on overall rate (V) is determined from the ratios of the intercepts (VH /VD) and the KIE on V/K is determined from the ratio of the slopes ((V/K) H /(V/K) D)). The V and V/K values and KIE are determined by fitting the steady-state data using the computer programs developed by Cleland as described by Cook (28Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanisms from Isotope Effects.

https://openalex.org/W2128242319,"Although genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for Eps15 homology domain containing proteins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the specific functions of these proteins have been elusive. Eps15 is found at the growing edges of clathrin-coated pits, leading to the hypothesis that it participates in the formation of coated vesicles. We have evaluated this hypothesis by examining the effect of Eps15 on clathrin assembly. We found that although Eps15 has no intrinsic ability to assemble clathrin, it potently stimulates the ability of the clathrin adaptor protein, AP180, to assemble clathrin at physiological pH. We have also defined the binding sites for Eps15 on squid AP180. These sites contain an NPF motif, and peptides derived from these binding sites inhibit the ability of Eps15 to stimulate clathrin assembly in vitro. Furthermore, when injected into squid giant presynaptic nerve terminals, these peptides inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits and coated vesicles during synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Eps15 regulates clathrin coat assembly in vivo, and indicates that interactions between Eps15 homology domains and NPF motifs are involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation during synaptic vesicle recycling.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that Eps15 regulates clathrin coat assembly in vivo, and indicates that interactions between Eps15 homology domains and NPF motifs are involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation during synaptic vesicle recycling. Eps15 is a protein that was first discovered in a screen for substrates of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity (1Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Santolini E. Salcini A.E. Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Di Fiore P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 186-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, the structural organization of Eps15 has been well characterized. At its N terminus, Eps15 contains 3 copies of an ∼100-amino acid domain that has been found in a large number of proteins from yeast to man and named the Eps15 homology (EH) 1The abbreviations used are: EH, eps15 homology; sAP180, squid AP180; C45, 45-kDa C-terminal domain of sAP180; DPF, Asp-Pro-Phe; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hAP180-2, human AP180-2 (CALM); NPF, Asn-Pro-Phe; PSP, postsynaptic potential; RUs, response units; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SV, synaptic vesicle; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. domain (3Wong W.T.

NMR studies show that the structure of the central EH domain of Eps15 consists of a pair of EF hand motifs, the second of which binds tightly to calcium (4de Beer T. Carter R.E. Lobel-Rice K.E. Sorkin A. Overduin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). EH domains are 60% similar at the amino acid level, and the structurally critical residues are well conserved, suggesting that their three-dimensional structure also is well conserved. Binding partners for the EH domains of Eps15 and its homologues include the clathrin assembly protein AP180 (5Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), epsin (6Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Ringstad N. Hudson A. Butler M.H. Salcini A.E. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most EH domains recognize a well conserved Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif found within their binding partners (9Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This NPF motif binds within a hydrophobic pocket between two α-helices of the central EH domain of Eps15 (4de Beer T. Carter R.E. Lobel-Rice K.E. Sorkin A. Overduin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The central domain of Eps15 contains a series of heptad repeats, and the C-terminal domain of Eps15 contains 15 DPF repeats. This DPF-rich domain was identified as one of the first of many binding partners that interact with the α-ear domain of AP-2, another clathrin assembly protein (10Benmerah A. Begue B.

Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although its exact site of interaction is still unknown, Eps15 also interacts both biochemically and genetically with dynamin, a GTPase believed to catalyze the fission reaction as nascent coated vesicles are released from the membrane (14Salcini A.E. Hilliard M.A. Croce A. Arbucci S. Luzzi P. Tacchetti C. Daniell L. De Camilli P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Bazzicalupo P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given that many of the binding partners of Eps15 are associated with clathrin, it is likely that Eps15 might participate in some aspect of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Several studies have indeed implicated Eps15 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For example, Eps15 associates transiently with the growing edges of clathrin-coated pits, as identified by immunoelectron microscopy (15Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is inhibited in cells that overexpress Eps15 mutants lacking either the DPF-rich AP-2 binding domain (16Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or the EH domains (17Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of Eps15, EHS-1, results in an uncoordinated phenotype and depletes synaptic vesicles, supporting a role for EHS-1 in SV recycling (14Salcini A.E. Hilliard M.A. Croce A. Arbucci S. Luzzi P. Tacchetti C. Daniell L. De Camilli P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Bazzicalupo P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, Pan1p, a yeast homologue of Eps15, binds to and activates the actin-nucleating Arp2-Arp3 complex. This has led to the hypothesis that Eps15 plays an additional role in linking clathrin-coated pits to the actin cytoskeleton (5Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Duncan M.C. Cope M.J. Goode B.L. Wendland B. Drubin D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of evidence that Eps15 plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the mechanism of action of this protein is not clear. Given that Eps15 is localized at the growing edges of clathrin-coated pits (15Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that Eps15 plays a role in the assembly of clathrin into coated pits and vesicles. We have evaluated this hypothesis by biochemically characterizing the effects of Eps15 on clathrin assembly. We have found that although Eps15 has no intrinsic clathrin assembly activity, it greatly stimulates the ability of AP180 to assemble clathrin. We have also identified two NPF-containing binding sites for Eps15 on sAP180, and we have shown that the Eps15-mediated stimulation of clathrin assembly is inhibited by peptides that mimic these Eps15-binding sites. To determine the physiological importance of these interactions, we utilized the squid giant synapse, a system well suited for study of the macromolecular interactions that underlie clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis (19Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morgan J.R. Zhao X. Womack M. Prasad K. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10201-10212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When injected into squid giant presynaptic nerve terminals, these NPF-containing peptides inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles during synaptic vesicle endocytosis in vivo. These results indicate that interactions between Eps15 homology domains and NPF motifs are involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation during synaptic vesicle recycling. Proteins—A human Eps15 construct with a His6 tag was a kind gift of Dr. Tom Kirchhausen, Harvard University. This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described (22Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33430-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clathrin and GST fusions of sAP180 and its C-terminal 45-kDa domain, C45, were purified as described previously (21Morgan J.R. Zhao X. Womack M. Prasad K. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10201-10212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hAP180-2 was expressed as a GST fusion by PCR cloning into pGEX-4T1 and purified as described for sAP180. The concentration of clathrin was determined using an extinction coefficient of E1&x0025;280nm=10.4 . Densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels was used to determine the concentrations of sAP180, C45, and Eps15 utilizing the top band to quantify intact protein relative to a clathrin standard. A peptide containing residues 387–405 of sAP180 was synthesized with an additional N-terminal cysteine (NPF1 peptide), and a peptide containing residues 433–450 of sAP180 was synthesized with a C-terminal cysteine (NPF2 peptide). Mutant versions of each peptide were also synthesized in which the NPF motifs were changed to AAA (Mut NPF1 and Mut NPF2, respectively). All peptides were synthesized in the University of Texas Health Science Center Institutional Protein Core Laboratory (San Antonio, TX). Surface Plasmon Resonance—All SPR experiments were done on a BIAcore 3000 instrument using CM5 research grade sensor chips (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25 °C. A running buffer, HBS (HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P-20, pH 7.0) was used at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Equivalent amounts of GST-sAP180, GST-hAP180-2, GST, and bovine IgG (∼3000 response units (RUs), where 1000 RUs = a change of ∼1 ng/mm2 in surface protein concentration) were coupled to the sensor chips utilizing an amine coupling kit (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Eps15 was passed over the surfaces for 6 min, followed by a 4-min injection of HBS. The surfaces were then regenerated by a 3-min injection of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride. All peptides contained a cysteine at either their N-terminal or C-terminal ends and were coupled to the sensor chip utilizing a thiol coupling kit (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). All the peptides were coupled to the sensor chip at a similar level (∼800 RU). Eps15 was passed over the surfaces at the indicated concentration for 6 min, followed by a 4-min injection of HBS buffer. The surfaces were regenerated by a 3-min injection of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The surfaces retained their activity for 20–50 experiments. All SPR studies were carried out in the University of Texas Health Science Center for Macromolecular Interactions (San Antonio, TX). Clathrin Assembly—The assembly of clathrin cages was quantified as described previously (20Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each assembly protein was combined with 0.5 μm clathrin in the presence or absence of Eps15. Clathrin assembly was initiated by adding 0.1 volume of 1 m MES-NaOH, at the indicated pH. The mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min and centrifuged at 400,000 × g at 4 °C for 6 min. The upper 80% of the supernatant was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The gel bands were quantitated utilizing an Amersham Biosciences Personal Densitometer and ImageQuant Software. Background amounts of clathrin assembly were measured in the absence of added proteins; these values constituted ∼2% of clathrin at pH 7.0, whereas at pH 6.7 and 6.5 ∼3–5% of clathrin sedimented. The inhibition of clathrin assembly by peptides was examined under the following conditions: 0.5 μm clathrin, 1 μm C45, 1 μm Eps15, and 200–1000 μm peptide, 9 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 7.0. The amount of clathrin assembled was determined as described above. Solutions of assembled baskets were analyzed on 5–20% (w/v) glycerol gradients in 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 7.0. Typically 0.8 ml of samples were layered on 11 ml of gradient solution and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments). One-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes by using a peristaltic pump and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophysiology—Electrical measurements were made on giant synapses in isolated stellate ganglia of the squid, Loligo pealei (21Morgan J.R. Zhao X. Womack M. Prasad K. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10201-10212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ganglia were superfused with oxygenated physiological saline at 10–15 °C containing (in mm): 466 NaCl, 54 MgCl2, 11 CaCl2, 10 KCl, 3 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. An electrode filled with 3 m KCl was inserted into the presynaptic axon to inject current used to evoke presynaptic action potentials. Single action potentials were elicited by injecting current pulses (1 ms; 0.7–1.9 μA) every 30 s (0.03 Hz) into the presynaptic axon. A second electrode was inserted into the postsynaptic axon to measure PSPs resulting from transmitter released by the presynaptic action potentials. PSPs were quantified by measuring their initial rate of rise. A third electrode was inserted into the presynaptic terminal both to record presynaptic action potentials and to microinject peptide reagents. Electrical signals were detected with an Axoclamp-2A amplifier (Axon Instruments; Union City, CA), then acquired and analyzed with Axobasic programs written by F. E. Schweizer (UCLA). For microinjection, NPF peptides and mutants were diluted in physiological solution containing (in mm): 250 potassium isothionate, 100 KCl, 100 taurine, 50 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Peptides were injected from the microinjection pipette directly into presynaptic terminals by delivering pulses of positive pressure (10–80 ms; 10–100 pounds/square inch; N2 gas) from a Picospritzer injector (General Valve; Fairfield, NJ). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Molecular Probes; 3 kDa; 100 μm) was co-injected in order to estimate the amount of peptide injected. Fluorescence was imaged with a Zeiss Axioskop upright microscope (×10, 0.25 NA objective), detected with a COHU SIT camera, and acquired with Image-1 software (Universal Imaging, Inc; Downingtown, PA). Electron Microscopy—Following the injection of NPF peptides, when synaptic transmission was inhibited by greater than 95%, terminals were fixed for electron microscopy with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Two terminals each were injected with NPF1 and Mut NPF1 peptides. Fixed terminals were processed as described (23Sanchez M.E. Nuno C.M. Buchanan J. Augustine G.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 152: 369-387PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an 80-nm section was taken every 50 μm through the entire length of the presynaptic terminal, resulting in 8–12 sections per injected terminal. Each section was magnified ×12,000 and examined with a JEM-1200 ExII electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). Analysis was performed using Image-1 software. For the electron microscopic analysis, distances between the active zone plasma membrane and individual synaptic vesicles were measured, as described (24Hess S.D. Doroshenko P.A. Augustine G.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because active zones are typically spaced about 1 μm apart, synaptic vesicles within a 500-nm radius surrounding the active zone were measured in order to ensure that each synaptic vesicle was counted only once. In addition, the total number of clathrin-coated pits and coated vesicles associated with active zones was counted in each section. Differences in the number and distribution of synaptic vesicles and coated vesicles were compared between NPF1 and Mut NPF1 peptide-injected terminals and analyzed using Origin 6.1 software. Eps15 Interacts with AP180-–We first developed an assay based on SPR to determine whether sAP180 interacts with Eps15. In this assay, GST-sAP180 and GST were immobilized on independent neighboring surfaces of a sensor chip. Purified recombinant human Eps15 was passed over these surfaces, and the resulting changes in surface refractive index, measured in RUs, were continuously monitored. The binding of Eps15 to the GST-sAP180 surface was observed as a time-dependent increase in the surface refractive index (Fig. 1A, top trace). When the sensor chip was then exposed to buffer, dissociation of the bound Eps15 was observed. The small response of the GST surface (Fig. 1A, middle trace), which was due to a change in bulk flow, was defined as background and subtracted from the response of the GST-sAP180 surface (Fig. 1A, lower trace). The binding of Eps15 to sAP180 depended on the concentration of Eps15 (Fig. 1B), with the maximal amplitude of the responses varying as a function of Eps15 concentration. Binding of Eps15 to sAP180 was saturable and had an apparent KD of 0.5 μm with a stoichiometry >0.5 Eps15:1 sAP180 (Fig. 1C). To be sure that the interaction we observed was not unique to AP180 homologues from lower organisms, we also evaluated the ability of hAP180-2 (also called CALM) to bind to Eps15. We found that Eps15 also bound to hAP180-2. This binding was saturable and had an apparent KD of 0.7 μm with a stoichiometry >0.5 Eps15:1 hAP180-2 (Fig. 1D). Similarly, C. elegans AP180 (unc11) also binds to human Eps15. 2E. M. Lafer, K. Prasad, and A. Alfonso, unpublished observations. Thus, AP180 and Eps15 homologues from yeast to man can interact (5Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of sAP180 contains two NPF motifs, one at position 397–399 and a second at position 438–440. Because EH domains are known to interact with NPF motifs (9Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we asked whether the two NPF motifs in sAP180 constitute Eps15-binding sites. Two 21-amino acid peptides (NPF1 and NPF2) representing the sequences surrounding these two NPF motifs were synthesized. Two additional peptides in which the NPF residues were mutated to AAA (Mut NPF1 and Mut NPF2) were used as controls. A cysteine residue was included at the end of each peptide, allowing disulfide interaction to attach these four peptides to adjacent surfaces of a Biacore sensor chip. There was significant binding of Eps15 to both the NPF1 and NPF2 peptides (Fig. 2A). This binding was concentration-dependent, because it was greater in the presence of 4 μm Eps15 (Fig. 2A) than in the presence of 1 μm Eps15 (Fig. 2B). At both concentrations, there was more binding of Eps15 to NPF1 than to NPF2 (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting a higher affinity for NPF1 than for NPF2. In contrast, only background levels of binding were observed on the surfaces to which the control peptides (Mut NPF1 and Mut NPF2) were attached (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that the two NPF motifs within sAP180, located at amino acids 397–399 and 438–440, constitute two separate Eps15-binding sites. Eps15 Stimulates AP180-mediated Clathrin Assembly— Given that Eps15 binds to AP180, it is possible that Eps15 regulates the ability of AP180 to assemble clathrin. We examined this possibility by determining the effects of Eps15 on AP180-mediated clathrin assembly. For these experiments we used the 45-kDa C-terminal domain of sAP180 (amino acids 313–751; C45) because this domain is responsible for the ability of AP180 to assemble clathrin (21Morgan J.R. Zhao X. Womack M. Prasad K. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10201-10212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains the NPF motifs that mediate Eps15 binding, and is more stable than the full-length protein. The increased stability of C45 improved the quality of the quantitative analysis, although full-length sAP180 yielded comparable results. Because the ability of mammalian assembly proteins to polymerize clathrin depends upon pH (25Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we first asked how pH influences the clathrin assembly activity of GST-C45 in vitro. As is the case for mammalian assembly proteins, C45 exhibited very little clathrin assembly activity at pH 7.0, but its activity dramatically increased at more acidic pH levels (Fig. 3). Thus, to allow easier detection of a possible regulatory influence of Eps15, we worked at a pH (7.0) where the endogenous activity of C45 was low. We examined the effect of Eps15 on clathrin assembly. When clathrin polymerizes, it forms regular, polyhedral cages that pellet upon ultracentrifugation (25Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, clathrin assembly can be measured as a loss of clathrin from the supernatant. When mixtures of Eps15 and clathrin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, there was no loss of clathrin from the supernatant (Fig. 4A, 5th to 9th lanes) compared with the control condition (Fig. 4, A, 1st to 4th lanes, and B). Thus, Eps15 does not polymerize clathrin (Fig. 4B), which confirms a previous report (26Cupers P. Jadhav A.P. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1847-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, Eps15 dramatically stimulated clathrin assembly mediated by GST-C45, evident as a decrease in the amount of clathrin present in the supernatants (Fig. 4C). Increasing concentrations of GST-C45 (1–5 μm; 3rd to 7th lanes) produced very little polymerization of clathrin in comparison to the controls (1st and 2nd lanes). Yet adding 0.4 μm Eps15 yielded a dramatic reduction in the amount of clathrin and GST-C45 in the supernatants (8th to 12th lanes), indicating significant polymerization of clathrin into cages. Quantitative analysis of a series of experiments carried out at various concentrations of Eps15 indicated that Eps15 stimulated clathrin polymerization at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm (Fig. 4D). At the highest concentration of Eps15 tested (1 μm), clathrin assembly was comparable with that produced by C45 at pH 6.5 (Fig. 3). Therefore, it appears that the complex of Eps15 and C45 has a higher affinity for clathrin than does C45 alone. At a constant concentration of GST-C45, the activity of Eps15 saturated at 1 μm (Fig. 4, E and F). Human Eps15 also stimulates clathrin assembly mediated by mouse AP180, indicating the conservation of this effect among species. 3K. Prasad and E. M. Lafer, unpublished observations. Thus, at physiological pH Eps15 potently stimulates clathrin assembly by AP180. In the above studies, sedimentation was used as a measure of clathrin assembly. However, such measurements do not clearly distinguish between assembled clathrin baskets and large, nonspecific aggregates of clathrin. We considered the possibility of clathrin aggregation in three ways. First, clathrin aggregates should sediment easily after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. There was no sedimentation of clathrin under these conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the clathrin was not aggregated. Second, we analyzed assembly reactions carried out with and without Eps15 by dynamic light scattering which can readily distinguish between aggregates and baskets. The particles assembled by C45 with and without Eps15 were indistinguishable and had an average diameter of 81 nm which is consistent with the sizes of clathrin cages that have been reported previously (27Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Third, we employed glycerol gradient centrifugation to determine the sedimentation coefficient of the assembled clathrin. As a control we first produced clathrin baskets with GST-C45 (2 μm) under standard conditions for assembly (pH 6.5; 1 μm clathrin; 0.1 m MES-NaOH) and then analyzed these on 5–20% glycerol gradients (Fig. 5A). Lanes 1–3 are from the top of the gradient and contained unpolymerized clathrin, which has a low sedimentation coefficient of 8 S (Fig. 5A). Lanes 6–8 contained assembled clathrin baskets, which have a sedimentation coefficient of 150 S (29Prasad K. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This profile with two distinct clathrin peaks is very different from that expected of clathrin aggregates, which would either create a smear of clathrin across the entire gradient or would cause clathrin to sediment at the bottom of the gradient. When this experiment was repeated at pH 7.0, where polymerization is minimal, <10% of the total clathrin was located in the fractions where baskets are found (Fig. 5B, lanes 6–8). Instead, most of the clathrin remained at the top of the gradient, indicating that it was in an unpolymerized state (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3). When 1 μm Eps15 was included in the reaction, 60% of the clathrin was in the position corresponding to clathrin baskets (Fig. 5C, lanes 6–8), as expected if the clathrin was polymerized by the presence of Eps15. These results indicate that the structures formed in the presence of Eps15 are clathrin baskets rather than aggregates. GST-C45 co-sedimented with assembled clathrin baskets (Fig. 5, A and C). The relative molar ratio of clathrin to GST-C45 in these fractions was nearly one to one, consistent with previous reports that AP180 assembles clathrin stoichiometrically (29Prasad K. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6098-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little Eps15 was found in the position of the baskets (Fig. 5C, lanes 6–8) but instead remained at the top of the gradient (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–3). This absence of Eps15 in the assembled clathrin fraction was more clearly seen when the peak fractions (6Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5D). The relative molar ratio of clathrin to GST-C45 was similar in both cases, whereas very little Eps15 was present in the assembled baskets (Fig. 5, C and D). These results reveal that Eps15 associates only transiently with the clathrin baskets. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the finding that Eps15 is present at the rims of clathrin-coated pits but does not associate with clathrin in mature coated vesicles (15Tebar F.

This study concerns the interaction between the Kv2.1 channel, the prevalent delayed rectifier K+ channel in neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, and syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25. We recently showed in islet β-cells that the Kv2.1 K+ current is modulated by syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25. Here we demonstrate, using co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry analyses, the existence of a physical interaction in neuroendocrine cells between Kv2.1 and syntaxin 1A. Furthermore, using concomitant co-immunoprecipitation from plasma membranes and two-electrode voltage clamp analyses in Xenopus oocytes combined with in vitro binding analysis, we characterized the effects of these interactions on the Kv2.1 channel gating pertaining to the assembly/disassembly of the syntaxin 1A/SNAP-25 (target (t)-SNARE) complex. Syntaxin 1A alone binds strongly to Kv2.1 and shifts both activation and inactivation to hyperpolarized potentials. SNAP-25 alone binds weakly to Kv2.1 and probably has no effect by itself. Expression of SNAP-25 together with syntaxin 1A results in the formation of t-SNARE complexes, with consequent elimination of the effects of syntaxin 1A alone on both activation and inactivation. Moreover, inactivation is shifted to the opposite direction, toward depolarized potentials, and its extent and rate are attenuated. Based on these results we suggest that exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells is tuned by the dynamic coupling of the Kv2.1 channel gating to the assembly status of the t-SNARE complex.

Our results showed that in brain synaptosomes the presynaptic Kv1.1 channel (7Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O.

We also showed that Kv1.1 in complex with the auxiliary Kvβ 1.1 subunits (8Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

In the present work we show that the Kv2.1 channel interacts directly with the two plasma membrane-associated SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in neuroendocrine cells. We further show that these interactions have functional implications observed in Xenopus oocytes. Both activation and inactivation of the channel are affected, depending on the assembly/disassembly of the binary complex SNAP-25/syntaxin 1A. On the basis of our results, we suggest a physiological relevance for these interactions in the release processes described in neuroendocrine cells.

Oocytes were injected with 15 ng/oocyte or with 0.05–0.25 ng/oocyte Kv2.1 mRNA for biochemical or electrophysiological studies, respectively. Syx mRNA was injected at 0.5 ng/oocyte for electrophysiological experiments and at 1.25 ng/oocyte for the biochemical experiments. SNAP mRNA was injected at 15 ng/oocyte for biochemical experiments and at 15 or 5 ng/oocyte for electrophysiological experiments. BoNT/A or BoNT/C mRNAs at 5–15 ng/oocyte were injected for both biochemical and electrophysiological experiments. AS-ODN at 0.05 ng/oocyte was injected 2 days before the electrophysiological assay, which was done 3 days after the mRNA injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (25Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol.

To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 4 μA were recorded. Net current was obtained by subtracting the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step from –80 to –90 mV. Oocytes with a leak current of more than 3 nA/1 mV were discarded. Experimental protocols and data analyses are described in the figure and table legends. Immunoprecipitation in Oocytes—Oocytes were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (25Levin G. Keren T.

Briefly, immunoprecipitates from 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of either plasma membranes (PM) or internal fractions (IF) (separated mechanically, as described in Ref. 26Ivanina T. Perets T.

Digitized scans were derived by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and relative intensities were quantified by ImageQuant. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting in PC12 Cells—Immunoprecipitation (IP) has been described in detail for synaptosomes (6Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the following, only the changes relevant for PC12 cells are described. Cells (5–15 × 10–6) were suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, freshly prepared 1% CHAPS (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm. After overnight incubation of the supernatant with antibodies at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) were added, and the bound proteins were thoroughly washed (in phosphate-buffered saline with only 0.1% Triton X-100), separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy in PC12 Cells—One day after the PC12 cells were seeded on a plastic coverslip (Thermanox, Nunc, Naperville, IL), the cells were washed twice with TBS solution (10 mm Tris and 135 mm NaCl) containing 2 mm CaCl2, fixated for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton for 10 min, and washed twice with TBS buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2. Nonspecific sites were blocked with donkey immunoglobulin G (IgG, whole molecule, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. Each coverslip was incubated for 2 h with mouse antibodies (Abs) against syntaxin (1:2000; Sigma) and rabbit Abs against Kv1.1 (1:5; Alomone Labs). Residual Abs were removed by washing 3 times, each time for 5 min, with TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 2% bovine serum albumin. This was followed by incubation for 30 min with the secondary Abs Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, The Jackson Laboratory) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Free secondary Abs were then washed three times with TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 2% bovine serum albumin, and the coverslips were mounted on a glass slide. The fluorescent labeling was examined by the use of a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410 invert, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 25-milliwatt krypton-argon laser (488 and 568 maximum lines). A 40 NA/1.2 C-apochromat water-immersion lens (Axiovert 135 M, Zeiss) was used for imaging. Cy3- or Alexa-conjugated Abs were excited at 488 or 568 nm, respectively, and the emitted light was collected using BP 515-540 or LP 590 filters, respectively. The fluorescent signals were analyzed using the microscope manufacturer's program (LSM, Zeiss). In Vitro Binding of GST Fusion Proteins with Syx and SNAP—The fusion proteins were synthesized and reacted with Syx as described (6Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins (150 pmol) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated either with 5 μl of the lysate containing 35S-labeled syntaxin or SNAP (translated on the template of in vitro synthesized mRNAs using a translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega)) or with 200 pmol of recombinant syntaxin peptide prepared from a GST fusion construct (amino acids 1–264) cleaved by thrombin, as described, in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.5% CHAPS. The GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the two groups was calculated by the use of independent sample t test procedures assuming unequal variance (Mann-Whitney's rank-sum test). One-way analysis of variance was used to estimate the statistical differences in experiments comparing several groups. The Voltage-gated K + Channel Kv2.1 Interacts Physically with Syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in PC12 Cells—In view of the wide distribution of the Kv2.1 channel in neuroendocrine cells, we were interested in finding out whether it interacts in PC12 cells with syntaxin 1A (Syx) and SNAP-25 (SNAP), which are the target SNARE (t-SNARE) partners of the exocytotic machinery (Fig. 1A). By using an antibody against Kv2.1, we found that both Syx and SNAP co-precipitate with the Kv2.1 protein. The co-precipitation of both Syx and SNAP could be reduced substantially by preincubation of the antibodies with the peptide against which the antibodies were raised. To verify the specificity of the co-precipitation, we performed the reciprocal experiments, in which Kv2.1 was co-precipitated with Syx and SNAP, using antibodies against Syx or SNAP. Kv2.1 Co-localizes with Syx in PC12 Cells—The co-immunoprecipitation results indicated an interaction between the channel protein and Syx (the interaction with SNAP was suggested to be prevalently via Syx, see below). To evaluate the extent of the interaction, we carried out an immunocytochemical study in PC12 cells. A monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 1A and a polyclonal antibody against Kv2.1 were used for double staining of the corresponding proteins. The confocal fluorescence microscopic images are shown in Fig. 1B. Kv2.1 was found to be distributed both at perinuclear regions and at plasma membranes, whereas Syx was mostly at the plasma membranes. The overlay image (Fig. 1B, right panel) shows co-localization of the channel at the plasma membranes with Syx. Syx and SNAP Directly Bind Cytosolic Domains of Kv2.1— Previously, we have shown in an in vitro binding assay that Syx and SNAP bind to the Kv2.1 channel (14MacDonald P.E. Wang G. Tsuk S. Dodo C. Kang Y. Tang L. Wheeler M.B. Cattral M.S. Lakey J.R. Salapatek A.M. Lotan I. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X.

In this study we carried out a more comprehensive in vitro binding assay to substantiate the physical interaction of the channel with these proteins. First, immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins corresponding to the major cytoplasmic parts of the channel: the N terminus (amino acids 1–182; N), and the proximal and distal halves of the C terminus (amino acids 411–632 and 633–853; C1 and C2, respectively) (Fig. 2A). These fusion proteins and GST itself were incubated in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 with 35S-labeled full-length Syx or SNAP synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2, B and C). Both Syx and SNAP bound to the channel, Syx bound preferentially to the C1 domain, whereas SNAP bound to the N- and the C-terminal domains with some preference for C2. Notably, the binding of Syx was stronger by about 1 order of magnitude than that of SNAP which was rather weak. The binding of Syx to C1 was further evaluated by the use of the recombinant cytoplasmic part of syntaxin (corresponding to amino acids 4–264) cleaved by thrombin from its corresponding GST fusion protein in two different detergents (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% CHAPS) (Fig. 2D). By using different concentrations of Syx, we estimated that under our binding conditions, the binding was half-maximal at ∼0.3–0.4 μm Syx and that ∼2.2 pmol of Syx were bound per 6 pmol of C1, at a saturating concentration of Syx (Fig. 2E). We concluded that the binding of Syx to the channel was devoid of detergent artifacts, strong, targeted to a defined region on the channel (C1), dose-dependent, and saturable. However, the binding of SNAP-25 was less conclusive, being weak and not defined to a distinct region on the channel. Syx and SNAP Affect the Voltage Dependence of Inactivation of Kv2.1 Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—To study the modulation of the Kv2.1 currents by Syx and SNAP, we used Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with Kv2.1 mRNA exhibited outward K+ currents, which inactivated slowly upon 25-s membrane depolarizations to different voltages (Fig. 3A, upper left panel). Co-injection of Syx or SNAP mRNAs affected the Kv2.1 current traces (Fig. 3A). The effects of Syx and SNAP on the voltage dependence of the Kv2.1 current inactivation were studied using depolarizing prepulses. We started with prepulses of 25-s duration, which induces full inactivation, but for practical reasons subsequent experiments were done with 5-s prepulses, which yielded qualitatively similar results. Co-injection of Syx mRNA with Kv2.1 resulted in a negative shift of the half-inactivation voltage (Vi ½) by ∼20 mV, with no effect on the residual current fraction (RCF), defined as the fraction of current remaining after a 5-s prepulse to +15 mV (Fig. 3B and Table I).Table IEffect of syntaxin 1A (Syx), SNAP-25 (SNAP), and the combination of Syx and SNAP on the voltage dependence of inactivation of Kv2.1Vi1/2aNormalized RCFmV%Effect of SyxKv2.1 (Control)-17.32 ± 0.9-5.08 ± 0.83100+ Syx-37.43 ± 6.15ap values denoting statistically significant differences from control were obtained by t test in two group experiments and by one-way analysis of variance in multigroup experiments. p < 0.001.-7.38 ± 1.499.28 ± 2.09Effect of SNAPKv2.1 (Control)-17.72 ± 0.79-6.57 ± 1.36100+ SNAP-8.95 ± 2.49bp < 0.05.-8.33 ± 1.45155.26 ± 8.06ap values denoting statistically significant differences from control were obtained by t test in two group experiments and by one-way analysis of variance in multigroup experiments. p < 0.001.Effect of the combination of Syx (0.5) and SNAPKv2.1 (Control)-17.86 ± 1.54-4.61 ± 0.28100+ Syx + SNAP-15.14 ± 1.96-6.94 ± 0.99155.09 ± 5.63ap values denoting statistically significant differences from control were obtained by t test in two group experiments and by one-way analysis of variance in multigroup experiments. p < 0.001.a p values denoting statistically significant differences from control were obtained by t test in two group experiments and by one-way analysis of variance in multigroup experiments. p < 0.001.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Co-injection of SNAP with Kv2.1 mRNAs shifted Vi ½ to membrane potentials that were more depolarized by ∼9.5 mV and enhanced the RCF by ∼55% (Fig. 3C and Table I). Neither Syx nor SNAP had a significant effect on the slope factor (a) of the inactivation curve (Table I). Effect of a Combination of Syx and SNAP on Kv2.1 Voltage Dependence of Inactivation—The target membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 have been shown to form a complex on presynaptic plasma membranes (29Zhang F.

Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the functional interaction of a combination of Syx and SNAP with Kv2.1. Concomitant expression of Syx and SNAP resulted in elimination of the leftward shift of Vi ½ by Syx. Rather, the combination of Syx and SNAP yielded effects similar to those observed with SNAP alone, namely a rightward shift of Vi ½ and an increase in RCF (Fig. 3D and Table I). The rightward shift in Vi ½ was smaller than in the case of SNAP alone. SNAP Affects the Kinetics of Kv2.1 Channel Inactivation— The kinetics of inactivation was characterized by the use of two experimental protocols. At potentials above the level where current activation became significant (above 10 mV), inactivation was measured as the rate of current decay during 25-s depolarizing pulses (Fig. 4A). At –10 mV, the onset of inactivation was determined by imposing prepulses of different duration to –10 mV, followed by a fixed test pulse to elicit the remaining current (Fig. 4B). In both protocols, the membrane was maintained at a negative potential between successive trials to allow complete recovery from inactivation before each measurement. The rate of inactivation was estimated by the inactivation time constant (τ) derived from a single exponential decay fit. At all voltages tested, increases of 85–90% in τ were observed in the presence of SNAP. Syx did not affect τ at any of the voltages tested. Recovery from inactivation was studied by a classic two-pulse procedure (Fig. 4C). Following a 25-s depolarizing test pulse to inactivate the current, recovery was assessed by application of a test pulse at a variable interval. The rate of recovery was estimated by the fast and slow time constants derived from a two-exponential rising fit. Neither Syx nor SNAP had any significant effect on the rate of recovery (Fig. 4C, legend). Syx Affects the Voltage Dependence of Activation of Kv2.1—As shown in Fig. 5, Syx affected the activation of a fraction of the channels. The activation curve of Kv2.1 co-expressed with Syx fitted well to a two-component Boltzmann function: one component resembled the conductance (G)-voltage curve of Kv2.1 expressed alone (with the same half-activation voltage (Va ½) and slope factor (a)) and the other component had a negative shift of ∼55 mV in Va ½ and a much smaller slope factor (1 compared with 16, indicating much steeper slope) (Fig. 5A and Table II). The two components probably represent two distinct fractions of channels, the one not affected and the other affected by Syx. The channel activation was not affected at all by SNAP (Fig. 5B and Table II). The combination of SNAP and Syx completely abolished the effect of Syx on channel activation (Fig. 5C and Table II). The maximal channel conductance (G max) was not affected significantly under any of the above conditions (not shown).Table IIEffect of Syx, SNAP, and the combination of Syx and SNAP on the activation of Kv2.1Va 1/2Ia IVa 1/2IIaIImVmVEffect of SyxKv2.19.36 ± 3.3716.87 ± 0.72+ Syx7.73 ± 0.9918.62 ± 0.91-46.81 ± 2.110.92 ± 1.098Effect of SNAPKv2.110.65 ± 0.8613.35 ± 0.69+ SNAP8.91 ± 0.6513.88 ± 0.65Effect of the combination of Syx and SNAPKv2.112.88 ± 1.9512.77 ± 0.77Syx + SNAP13.40 ± 0.6613.35 ± 0.69 Open table in a new tab Association of Syx and SNAP with the Kv2.1 in Oocytes Is Interdependent—Concomitantly with the functional experiments, we examined the physical interactions of Syx and SNAP with the Kv2.1 channel in the oocyte PM (manually dissected (26Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) and IF comprising the rest of the cell. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis in the PM of oocytes from a single batch (Fig. 6A), using antibodies against Kv2.1, Syx, and SNAP, showed strong Syx binding and weak SNAP binding to the channel when Syx and SNAP were each expressed on their own with the channel. Their combined expression resulted in significant reduction in the binding of Syx to the channel (a decrease of ∼2-fold, as indicated by intensity ratios shown in the bar diagrams below the corresponding lanes in the middle panels of Fig. 6A). At the same time, the binding of SNAP to the channel was enhanced in the presence of Syx."
https://openalex.org/W2103079100,"A minimal system of five proteins, hsp90, hsp70, Hop, hsp40, and p23, assembles glucocorticoid receptor (GR)·hsp90 heterocomplexes and causes the simultaneous opening of the steroid binding cleft to access by steroid. The first step in assembly is the ATP-dependent and hsp40 (YDJ-1)-dependent formation of a GR·hsp70 complex that primes the receptor for subsequent ATP-dependent activation by hsp90, Hop, and p23. This study focuses on three aspects of the GR priming reaction with hsp70. First, we have visualized the primed GR·hsp70 complexes by atomic force microscopy, and we find the most common stoichiometry to be 1:1, with some complexes of a size ∼1:2 and a few complexes of larger size. Second, in a recent study of progesterone receptor priming, it was shown that hsp40 binds first, leading to the notion that it targets hsp70 to the receptor. We show here that hsp40 does not perform such a targeting function in priming the GR. Third, we focus on a short amino-terminal segment of the ligand binding domain that is required for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. By using two glutathione S-transferase (GST)/ligand binding domain fusions with (GST/520C) and without (GST/554C) hsp90 binding and steroid binding activity, we show that the priming step with hsp70 occurs with GST/554C, and it is the subsequent assembly step with hsp90 that is defective.

Hsp90 binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the GR, and the steroid binding activity of the GR is absolutely hsp90-dependent (3Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

When the GR is stripped of its associated hsp90, it immediately loses its ability to bind steroid, and steroid binding activity is regenerated when GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are reformed by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (5Morishima Y.

The steroids bind deep in a hydrophobic cleft that appears to be collapsed in the absence of ligand, such that the LBD must change its conformation to allow entry of ligand (7Gee A.C. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The hsp90/hsp70-dependent chaperone machinery carries out the ATP-dependent opening of the binding cleft in the GR LBD such that it can be accessed by steroid. In addition to opening the steroid binding cleft, formation of a complex with hsp90 is accompanied by conformational changes that increase the sensitivity of the GR LBD to attack by thiol-derivatizing agents and trypsin (8Stancato L.F.

Hop, hsp40, and p23) is now used to achieve efficient receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (14Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

The chaperones hsp90 and hsp70 are both essential for opening the steroid binding cleft in the GR LBD, and hsp40, Hop (hsp70/hsp90 organizing protein), and p23 act as co-chaperones to increase the rate or extent of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (16Morishima Y.

Hop binds independently to hsp90 and hsp70 to form an hsp90·Hop·hsp70 complex (17Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Hop is not essential for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, when Hop is present to form a machinery, assembly is much faster (16Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hop does not act solely as a tie rod to bring the essential chaperones together; it also influences the conformational state and function of each protein (18Hernandez M.P. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38294-38304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The hsp90·Hop·hsp70 complexes also contain small amounts of the hsp70 co-chaperone hsp40 (14Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Once the machinery has assembled the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex, p23 binds dynamically (19Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Stepwise assembly experiments with purified proteins are beginning to separate the assembly and cleft opening process into an ordered series of events in which two ATP-dependent steps have been resolved. In the first step, immunoadsorbed receptor that has been stripped of endogenous chaperones is incubated with purified hsp70 and hsp40 (YDJ-1) in the presence of ATP (5Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M.

This produces a receptor·hsp70·hsp40 complex that can be washed free of unbound hsp70 and hsp40 and then incubated with purified hsp90, Hop, and p23. In this first reaction, the receptor is “primed” to bind hsp90 and be activated during the second incubation. Both the initial priming step with hsp70 and the second activating step with hsp90 are ATP-dependent and both are potassium-dependent, showing that there is a continuous requirement for the ATPase activity of hsp70 (5Morishima Y.

Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both the priming step and hsp90 binding are rapid, and it is the subsequent opening of the steroid binding cleft that is rate-limiting (22Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S.

In general, the stepwise assembly observations made with glucocorticoid and progesterone (PR) receptors have defined similar assembly mechanisms, but some differences in models of the priming step do exist. For example, by comparing Coomassie Blue-stained bands in the primed receptor complex, we found an hsp70/GR molar ratio of 1.1:1 (5Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas Hernandez et al. (21Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found an hsp70/PR molar ratio of ∼2:1. Thus, we don't know whether the hsp70 is acting as a monomer or a dimer in the priming step. By amino acid analysis, we find here that the hsp70/GR molar ratio is ∼1.3:1, and by atomic force microscopy of the primed complexes we see a distribution of several sizes, the most common of which reflects a 1:1 molar ratio. A second difference relates to the role of hsp40 (we use the purified yeast homolog YDJ-1) in priming. We have shown that ATP-bound hsp70 binds directly to the hsp90-free, non-steroid binding GR, whereas hsp70 that has been converted to its ADP-bound conformation by preincubation with YDJ-1 does not (23Kanelakis K.C. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33698-33703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we have assumed that hsp70 is the first component of the chaperone machinery to contact the GR, and the role of YDJ-1 in priming is to promote the ATPase activity of GR-bound hsp70. In their studies with the PR, Toft and coworkers (21Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found that YDJ-1 first binds with high affinity to the PR in a 1:1 molar ratio and is required for subsequent hsp70 binding. We show here that this added role of hsp40/YDJ-1 in targeting the receptor for binding of hsp70 does not apply to the GR priming reaction. We have shown previously that a short segment of the GR that lies at the extreme amino terminus of the LBD is required for LBD·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and steroid binding activity (24Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This segment lies at the rim of the ligand binding cleft of the receptor (25Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and mutations within this segment alter both steroid binding activity and transcriptional activity of the GR (25Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Kaul S. Murphy P.J.M. Chen J. Brown L. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36223-36232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although we know that GR LBD mutants lacking this segment do not form heterocomplexes with hsp90, we do not know whether it is the first hsp70-dependent step or the second hsp90-dependent step of assembly that is affected. By using the two-step assembly protocol, we show that a fusion protein lacking the requisite segment for hsp90 binding (GST/554C) forms a primed 554C·hsp70 complex that can bind hsp90/Hop, but hsp90 dissociates during the second assembly step, and no steroid binding activity is regenerated. This suggests that it is the second assembly step with hsp90 that is defective when the segment at the rim of the ligand binding cleft is not present. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). [6,7-3H]Dexamethasone (40 Ci/mmol) and 125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose, goat anti-mouse, and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and monoclonal anti-GST antibody (clone GST-2) were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). The BuGR2 monoclonal IgG antibody against the GR was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The AC88 monoclonal IgG against hsp90, the N27F3-4 anti-72/73-kDa hsp monoclonal IgG (anti-hsp70), and anti-hsp40 polyclonal IgG were from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). TransFast transfection reagent was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Scanning probes were from Veeco Metrology (Sunnyvale, CA). Escherichia coli expressing YDJ-1 was a gift from Dr. Avrom Caplan (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). E. coli expressing Hop was kindly provided by Dr. David Smith (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dart-mouth Medical School). Transformation and Plasmid Purification—Construction of pMTGST520C and pMTGST554C, which contain GST and a thrombin cleavage site linked to the amino-terminal rat GR sequence 520–795 (pMTGST520C) or 554–795 (pMTGST554C), was described previously (24Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into BL21 competent cells (Stratagene) selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown in LB medium. The plasmid DNAs were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Mega kit. Transient Transfection of GST/Fusion Protein—COS-7 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 162-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The cultures were grown to ∼50% confluency, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 5 ml of serum-free medium containing 25 μg of plasmid DNA and 75 μl of TransFast transfection reagent. The transfection medium was replaced with regular medium, and the cell cultures were continued for 48 h. Expression of Mouse GR in Sf9 Cells and Cytosol Preparation— Mouse GR was expressed in Sf9 cells, and cytosol was prepared as described previously (5Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were grown in SFM900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking. Cultures were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection of baculovirus and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (27Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture per 3 ml of buffer, and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant, referred to as “cytosol,” was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –70 °C. Cultures of mouse fibroblast L929 (L cells) and transiently transfected COS-7 cells were harvested by scraping into Hanks' buffered saline solution. Cell pellets were washed, suspended, and ruptured, and cytosol was prepared using the same technique described above for the Sf9 cells. Immunoadsorption of GR—Receptors were immunoadsorbed from aliquots of 50 μl of Sf9 or 100 μl of L cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 18 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 9 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate or purified proteins, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). GR·hsp90 Heterocomplex Reconstitution—For single step assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes, FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with the five-protein assembly system (20 μg of purified hsp90, 15 μg of purified hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.125 μg of purified YDJ-1) adjusted to 55 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5mm dithiothreitol), containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μlofan ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for receptor-associated proteins. For two-step assembly, stripped GR immune pellets were mixed with hsp70, YDJ-1, and the ATP-regenerating system in a final volume of 55 μl adjusted with HKD buffer and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Following this priming reaction, pellets were washed once with TEG buffer and once with 10 mm Hepes buffer. The immunopellets were then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with the purified hsp90, Hop, and p23 adjusted to 55 μl with HKD buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and the ATP-regenerating system. At the end of the second incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for receptor-associated proteins. Assay of Steroid Binding Capacity—Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer plus 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 100 μl of cell cytosol. For supernatants to be assayed for steroid binding, a 50-μl aliquot of supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer plus 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were mixed with dextrancoated charcoal and, after centrifugation, counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/100 μl of cell cytosol. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR or 1 μg/ml AC88, anti-hsp70, anti-hsp40, and anti-GST. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Protein Concentration by Amino Acid Analysis—Stripped GR and hsp70-primed GR immunopellets were washed twice with TEG buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein bands corresponding to the GR and hsp70 were excised and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was analyzed using a model 420H hydrolyzer/derivatizer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) with photometric detection of phenylthiocarbonyl derivatives of amino acids. Quantification was performed in reference to norleucine as an internal standard. The identity of the protein bands was confirmed by Western blotting membranes prepared in duplicate. Peptide Construction and Competition—A peptide consisting of rat GR sequence 407–423 (Ser-Val-Phe-Ser-Asn-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Ser-Pro-Gly-Met-Arg-Pro-Asp-Val-Ser) was synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein Structure Core Facility using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase methodology. Synthesis was performed on a Symphony peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies Incorporated, Woburn, MA). Peptide purity and structure were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The peptide was dissolved in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 100 mm and stored at –70 °C. Immunopellets of GR and associated proteins bound to FiGR-protein A-Sepharose were washed once with TEG buffer and once with Hepes buffer, and the GR and GR-bound proteins were released into the supernatant by incubating the pellets with 1 mm of the peptide in 50 μl of HEM buffer for 5 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, 16.7 μl of HEM buffer was added, and the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged, and 50 μl of the supernatants were collected for analysis. Atomic Force Microscopy—All measurements were made with a Nanoscope IIIa Extended Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope from Digital Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA) using a 120 × 120 μm “JV” scanner and were conducted under fluid in tapping mode. NP-S oxide-sharpened silicon nitride probes with a spring constant of 0.32 newton/m and a cantilever length of 100 μm were used for imaging. Nominal tip radius of curvature for tips was reported to be ≤40 nm by the manufacturer. Fresh mica substrates were prepared by cleaving the mica surface immediately preceding sample deposition. Ten μl of GR and associated proteins released from the FiGR-protein A-Sepharose pellet by peptide competition was deposited on the mica substrate and allowed to adsorb for 2 min, and 120 μl of buffer was added to the fluid cell to ensure tip immersion. Scan parameters were optimized for each sample, with a typical tapping drive frequency of 9 kHz and a scan rate of 1 Hz. Multiple images for each sample were obtained with scan sizes ranging from 500 × 500 nm to 2 × 2 μm. Because the theoretical width of the proteins is significantly smaller than the nominal tip radius, the height of each identified particle is used as a measure of its relative size. This makes it possible to limit the error associated with tip convolution artifacts. Heights of all identified particles were determined with Digital Instruments off-line section analysis routines. Protein Purification—Hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxyapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (28Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human p23 was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography as described (29Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of YDJ-1, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite as described previously (14Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described (30Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as has the expression of human Hop (13Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite. In all cases, the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at –70 °C. Stoichiometry of the Primed GR·hsp70 Complex—The priming and subsequent reactivation of the GR in the two-step assembly protocol we will use throughout this work is illustrated in Fig. 1. When the stripped GR (Str) is incubated with the five-protein purified system (PS) in a single step, twice as much steroid binding activity is generated as in the two-step protocol (cf. conditions 3 and 11). In two-step assembly, priming with hsp70 is absolutely required for binding of hsp90 and generation of steroid binding activity in the second step (cf. conditions 9 and 11). During the second incubation with hsp90, Hop, and p23, the majority of the hsp70 in the primed GR·hsp70 complex dissociates (cf. conditions 7 and 11). We have used L cell cytosol as a source of GR in all of the stoichiometry experiments (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), because ∼100% of the L cell GR is bound to hsp90, and nearly complete GR·hsp90 reassembly and activation of steroid binding activity is achieved when the stripped GR is incubated with the purified assembly system (19Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, only about 13% of the overexpressed mouse GR in Sf9 cytosol is bound by hsp90 and in the steroid binding state (5Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the remainder is in receptor aggregates (31Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5387-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that we have not been able to activate to the steroid binding state with the purified five-protein system. In Fig. 2, the stripped L cell GR was primed with hsp70; the GR and hsp70 bands were resolved (Fig. 2A), and the bands were excised and quantitated by amino acid analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the molar ratio of hsp70 to GR in the primed complex was ∼1.3:1.Fig. 3Release of functional GR from immunopellet. A, illustration of release of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex.

https://openalex.org/W2126210534,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene. We reported recently that complexin II, a protein involved in neurotransmitter release, is depleted from both the brains of mice carrying the HD mutation and from the striatum of post mortem HD brains. Here we show that this loss of complexin II is recapitulated in PC12 cells expressing the HD mutation and is accompanied by a dramatic decline in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of neurotransmitter. Overexpression of complexin II (but not complexin I) rescued exocytosis, demonstrating that the decline in neurotransmitter release is a direct consequence of complexin II depletion. Complexin II depletion in the brain may account for some of the abnormalities in neurotransmission associated with HD.

Although little neurodegeneration is seen in this mouse prior to its premature death (usually at 14–16 weeks), its phenotype has a number of similarities with HD, for example the dominant inheritance and the progressive nature of the neurological deficits (12Carter R.J.

Edwardson J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The proteins studied included the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25, which are known to form the core of a ubiquitous membrane fusion apparatus (20Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and various “accessory proteins,” such as the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and rab3A, and the cytosolic proteins α-SNAP and complexins I and II. These proteins are believed to control SNARE complex assembly and disassembly and thereby modulate neurotransmitter release (20Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). We found that complexin II was specifically and progressively depleted from the brains of R6/2 mice (19Morton A.J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Significantly, the depletion of complexin II was also seen in the striatum of HD brains (23Morton A.J. Faull R.L.M. Edwardson J.M. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 56: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the region most severely affected in HD (2Vonsattel J.-P.G. DiFiglia M.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The depletion was apparent at an early stage (grade 0), before neurodegeneration is seen. Decreases in the levels of synaptobrevin 2 and rab3A were also seen in the striatum, but none of the other proteins tested was significantly affected.In our previous studies, we established a correlation between complexin II depletion and neurological dysfunction in both HD patients and a mouse model of HD. In the present study, we sought to determine whether expression of mutant htt was able to cause complexin II depletion and whether this effect in turn compromised Ca2+-triggered exocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPC12 Cells—PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, containing glucose (4.5 mg/ml), NaHCO3 (3.7 mg/ml), 5% horse serum, and 5% calf serum, in 10% CO2 air at 37 °C. Where appropriate, expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mutant htt fragment via the Tet-On system (Clontech) was induced by treatment with doxycycline (1 μg/ml). For complexin overexpression experiments, the enhanced GFP coding sequence in the vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) was replaced by the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) sequence. cDNAs encoding complexins I and II (24McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) were then subcloned into the vector using EcoRI and BamHI. Both constructs were validated by sequencing before use. Cells were transfected with 50 μg of DNA using a Bio-Rad electroporator set at 250 microfarads and 250 V. Transfected cells were identified through the presence of uniform cyan fluorescence.Real-time Voltammetric Measurement of Neurotransmitter Release from Permeabilized PC12 Cells—Cells were detached and permeabilized by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 3 min; this procedure results in the permeabilization of ∼80% of the cells, as determined by trypan blue staining (25Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were used immediately after permeabilization to avoid rundown in exocytosis. A cell suspension (350 μl containing ∼107 cells), in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EGTA, was added to a temperature-controlled incubation chamber (containing Ag/AgCl reference and platinum auxiliary electrodes) set at 37 °C. A glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (E app = +500 mV versus the reference electrode) was rotated in the cell suspension at 3000 rpm. Once a stable base line was obtained (usually 1 min), a CaCl2 solution was rapidly injected into the suspension to achieve a free Ca2+ concentration of 100 μm. Catecholamine (predominantly dopamine) released from the cells is oxidized at the surface of the rotating disk electrode, and the current generated is directly proportional to the concentration of the species being oxidized.Measurement of [3H]Norepinephrine Uptake into PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were grown on polylysine-coated 24-well plates, and expression of the mutant htt fragment was induced for various times by treatment with doxycycline (1 μg/ml). Over the last 16 h of the induction period, the cells were incubated in medium containing [3H]norepinephrine (Amersham Biosciences; 52 Ci/mmol, 0.4 μCi/ml), sodium ascorbate (0.5 mm), and doxycycline where appropriate. At the end of the incubation, the labeling medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were solubilized in 0.2 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100, and the wells were washed with a further 0.2 ml of the same solution. The cell lysates were transferred to scintillation vials and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Blank wells were treated identically, and the associated radioactivity was subtracted from the experimental values to give values for cell uptake of [3H]norepinephrine.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips in either the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml). After a 72-h induction, the cells were fixed with 3.7% ice-cold formalin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), for 30 min. After three washes with PBS at room temperature, cells were stored in “block solution” (3% deer serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) at 4 °C until use. Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-complexin II antibody (1:1000) in block solution overnight at 4 °C, washed five times at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2000; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed five times and then incubated in Hoechst 33258 dye (5 μg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. After another five washes, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Pro-Long mounting reagent and examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope equipped with a DXM1200 digital camera.Amperometric Detection of Neurotransmitter Release from Single Intact PC12 Cells—Catecholamine was detected as an oxidation current using 5-μm carbon fibers polarized to 650 mV. Current was recorded at room temperature (∼22 °C) with a VA-10 amplifier (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz for computer acquisition with PCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Cells were bathed in 150 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Cells (2 × 105) were plated onto 35-mm dishes coated with collagen I/poly-d-lysine and loaded by bathing overnight in 1.2 mm norepinephrine and 0.4 mm ascorbate 1 day prior to recording. Release was elicited by pressure ejection of 105 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl from a ∼2-μm tipped micropipette positioned within 10 μm of the cell. Cells were transfected by electroporation using an ECM 830 electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA) set at 230 V and 5 ms.RESULTSFor our experiments we used a PC12 cell line stably expressing the first exon of htt with a 74-glutamine repeat and an N-terminal GFP tag, via the Tet-On system (26Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated for various times with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) to initiate expression of the protein. By 24 h, the cells showed a marked increase in GFP expression, which was accompanied by the appearance of GFP-containing aggregates (“inclusions”) in some cells. By 48 h, 62% of the cells had inclusions, and this percentage remained stable thereafter (Fig. 1a). Expression of the htt fragment did not cause significant cell death, up to 120 h (data not shown). To measure neurotransmitter release, cells were permeabilized and exocytosis was triggered by addition of Ca2+ (100 μm). Release of catecholamine neurotransmitter was detected in real time using rotating carbon disc electrode voltammetry (25Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The amount of neurotransmitter released fell progressively after expression of the HD mutation, and was almost undetectable after 72 h (Fig. 1, b and c). Over the same time course, there was no consistent change in the ability of the PC12 cells to take up [3H]norepinephrine (Fig. 1d), indicating that the fall in neurotransmitter release represented a defect in exocytosis rather than a reduction in the neurotransmitter content of the dense-core vesicles. In contrast to the result with the cells expressing the mutant htt fragment, exocytosis was not compromised in doxycycline-treated cells stably expressing the Tet-On vector alone (Fig. 1e).Cells used in the neurotransmitter release assays were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to proteins known to be involved in exocytotic membrane fusion (20Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). There was no time-dependent change in the overall pattern of protein expression, as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2a). There was also no difference between untreated cells and cells that had expressed the mutant htt fragment for 120 h in the levels of the vesicle membrane proteins synaptobrevin 2, synaptotagmin I, synaptotagmin IX, and synaptophysin or in the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the cytosolic protein complexin II was dramatically depleted after 120 h. Over the time course studied, complexin II levels initially rose (at 24 h), and then fell progressively from 48 h onwards, reaching a minimum at 96 h (Fig. 2c). In the same cell samples, levels of synaptotagmin I and syntaxin 1 did not change. Furthermore, consistent with its lack of effect on exocytosis, doxycycline treatment caused no change in complexin II levels in PC12 cells expressing Tet-On vector alone (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2Effects of expression of mutant htt fragment on protein levels in PC12 cells. a, total protein expression pattern of cells expressing mutant htt fragment for various times.

In untreated cells (Fig. 3, a–c), complexin II had a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in cells treated with doxycycline for 72 h (Fig. 3, d–f), complexin II was predominantly present in large aggregates which partially corresponded with inclusions containing GFP-tagged mutant htt fragment, indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3, d and e.Fig. 3Effects of expression of mutant htt fragment on the subcellular distribution of complexin II. The localization of complexin II was determined in untreated PC12 cells (a–c) and in cells in which expression of GFP-tagged mutant htt fragment had been induced for 72 h (d–f), using immunofluorescence microscopy. Mutant htt fragment was visualized through its GFP fluorescence (a and d). Complexin II was visualized using a mouse monoclonal anti-complexin II antibody and an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (b and e). Nuclei were revealed by staining with Hoechst 33258 (c and f). Arrows indicate sites of co-localization of GFP-tagged mutant htt fragment and complexin II (d and e). Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether there was a causal connection between complexin II depletion and inhibition of exocytosis, we tested the ability of complexin II to “rescue” exocytosis in PC12 cells expressing the mutant htt fragment. Initially, we repeated the experiments shown in Fig. 1 and preincubated the permeabilized PC12 cells for 1 min with recombinant His6-tagged complexin II before addition of Ca2+ (100 μm). No increase in neurotransmitter release was seen, irrespective of the duration of expression of the mutant htt fragment (data not shown). Hence, complexin II was not able to rescue exocytosis when provided acutely. We therefore decided to overexpress complexin II over the duration of expression of the mutant htt fragment. Cells were transiently transfected with a bicistronic vector encoding both complexin II and CFP; cyan fluorescence was used to identify transfected cells. Expression of the mutant htt fragment was initiated 24 h after transfection with complexin II/CFP and doxycycline treatment continued for 72 h. Neurotransmitter release from single cells in response to KCl depolarization was measured by carbon fiber amperometry, which is able to detect the release of neurotransmitter from individual dense-core vesicles (27Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the mutant htt fragment, the amperometric recordings showed that vesicular release occurred infrequently (Fig. 4a and d), consistent with our voltammetry results showing reduced release in these cells (Fig. 1). Overexpression of complexin II caused a significant (∼3-fold) increase in the number of release events evoked by depolarization (Fig. 4, c and d) and also increased the fraction of secreting cells from 50 to 85%. In contrast, overexpression of complexin I had the opposite effect (Fig. 4, b and d), reducing the cumulative spike number to about a third of that seen in control cells. However, the fraction of cells showing no secretion remained the same as controls (50%). In wild type PC12 cells, overexpression of complexin II reduced the number of evoked release events by about 50% (Fig. 4e), whereas complexin I overexpression had no effect on spike number.Fig. 4Rescue of neurotransmitter release by complexin II.

The bars indicate the time of depolarization by microapplication of a KCl solution. a, control trace from a PC12 cell expressing the mutant htt fragment for 72 h. b, overexpression of complexin I (CPX I) failed to restore secretion. c, overexpression of complexin II (CPX II) produced a dramatic enhancement of release. d, cumulative spike numbers for cells expressing the mutant htt fragment are plotted versus time, starting with the time of KCl application (indicated by the bar). e, cumulative spike numbers for wild type cells. Where appropriate, transfections were performed 1 day prior to doxycycline treatment. All recordings were made 72 h after doxycycline addition. Three transfections were performed for each data set, with a total of 25, 20, and 33 cells in d and 21, 21, and 25 cells in e, for control, CPX I, and CPX II, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe mechanism underlying polyglutamine-dependent pathogenesis in HD is unknown. Wild type htt exists predominantly in the cytoplasm (29Wilkinson F.L. Man N.T. Manilal S.B. Thomas P. Neal J.W. Harper P.S. Jones A.L. Morris G.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutant htt is also found in the cytoplasm; however, the N-terminal region of mutant htt, and perhaps even the full-length protein, appear to be targeted to the nucleus, at least under some circumstances (30Wheeler V.C. White J.K. Gutekunst C.A. Vrbanac V. Weaver M. Li X.J. Li S.H. Yi H. Vonsattel J.-P. Gusella J.F. Hersch S. Auerbach W. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutant htt is also recruited into abnormal aggregates of protein in nuclei of neurons, both in HD brains and in mouse models of HD. The significance of these neuronal intranuclear inclusions is disputed, and evidence has been presented supporting claims that they are toxic (21Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M.

Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these aggregates have been isolated and shown to contain many other proteins in addition to htt (33Suhr S.T. Senit M.-C. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Cuizon D.B. Gage F.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, it has been suggested that the recruitment of proteins into the inclusions, as a consequence of abnormal interactions with htt, might impact on cell function. Recent evidence has also suggested that mutant htt dysregulates transcription in neurons (34Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.-M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the expression of many genes is known to be altered in mouse models of HD (35Luthi-Carter R. Strand A.D. Hanson S.A. Kooperberg C. Schilling G. La Spada A.R. Merry D.E. Young A.B. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Olson J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we found that the total amount of complexin II in PC12 cells expressing mutant htt fragment initially rose (at 24 h) and then fell below normal levels (from 48 h onwards). The initial rise in complexin II levels was not accompanied by any change in neurotransmitter release; however, the later complexin II depletion was associated with a concomitant fall in neurotransmitter release. In addition to the changes in total amounts of complexin II within the cells, there was an intracellular redistribution of this protein. In particular, at later times (72 h) complexin II appeared to accumulate, at least partially, in the inclusions. Similar changes (both complexin II depletion and recruitment into inclusions) have previously been seen over a much longer time course in the brains of R6/2 mice (19Morton A.J. Edwardson J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Complexin II is also depleted in human HD striatum (23Morton A.J. Faull R.L.M. Edwardson J.M. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 56: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in hippocampus from HD brains, complexin II levels were actually found to be elevated. This effect could represent a physiological rescue of synaptic transmission, since hippocampal function is not affected until late in the course of the disease.The mechanism underlying the changes in complexin II levels seen in the present study is unclear. There was no difference between complexin II mRNA levels in untreated cells and in cells treated with doxycycline for 120 h (data not shown), indicating that effects at the level of transcription are unlikely and that the depletion of the protein at later times reflects an increased rate of degradation. It is possible that the gradual recruitment of complexin II into inclusions, together with the fall in total amount of cellular complexin II, would have resulted in a depletion of this protein from the cytosol and a consequent reduction in its availability at sites of exocytotic membrane fusion. The fact that exocytosis was substantially rescued by co-expression of complexin II supports"

Here, we use suppression subtractive hybridization to identify a previously unrecognized SREBP-enhanced gene in mice. The gene encodes a membrane-bound enzyme that we designate SCALD, for short-chain aldehyde reductase. We expressed SCALD in bacteria, purified it extensively, and studied its catalytic properties in detergent solution. The enzyme specifically uses NADPH to reduce a variety of short-chain aldehydes, including nonanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. The enzyme also reduces retinaldehydes, showing equal activity for all-trans-retinal and 9-cis-retinal. Northern blot analysis indicates that SCALD is expressed most abundantly in mouse liver and testis. In the liver of mice, SCALD is suppressed by fasting and induced by refeeding, consistent with regulation by SREBPs. In testis, SCALD expression is restricted to pachytene spermatocytes, as revealed by visualization of mRNA and protein. SCALD is also expressed in four layers of the retina, including the outer segment of rods and cones, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. SCALD appears to be the mouse ortholog of the human protein that has been designated variously as prostate short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1, retinal reductase 1, and retinol dehydrogenase 11. In view of its ability to reduce short-chain aldehydes in addition to retinals, we propose that SCALD may be induced by SREBP in liver and other tissues to prevent toxicity from fatty aldehydes that are generated from oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids that are synthesized as a result of SREBP activity.

The SREBPs differ from other transcription factors because they are synthesized as membrane-bound proteins, the active fragments of which must be released by proteolysis to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. The proteolytic release is controlled by the lipid content of the cells; release is rapid when cells are depleted of cholesterol, and it is blocked when cholesterol overaccumulates (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 5Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Mammalian cells express three isoforms of SREBP. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are produced from a single gene through the use of alternate transcription start sites, and SREBP-2 is encoded by a separate gene (6Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In vivo, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 are the predominant isoforms, and their physiological roles have been studied in transgenic mice overexpressing the cleaved nuclear form of SREBPs (nSREBPs) in liver (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). In these mice, nSREBP-1c preferentially enhances transcription of genes required for fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty-acid synthetase, long-chain fatty-acyl elongase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. nSREBP-2 preferentially increases the level of mRNAs encoding multiple enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, lanosterol demethylase, and others. As a result of these changes, there is a massive increase in the content of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol in livers of transgenic mice overexpressing nSREBPs (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar) and at lower levels in a variety of other human organs (12Haeseleer F. Jang G.-F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A.G.G. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mRNA was induced 3-fold when prostate adenocarcinoma cells were treated with androgen. The cDNA sequence predicted that the protein was an enzyme of the family of short-chain aldehyde reductases, hence the original name PSDR1. The protein was overexpressed in insect tissue culture cells by cDNA transfection, and this led to an increase in the activity of a membrane-bound enzyme that reduced all-trans-retinal to the corresponding alcohol using NADPH as an electron donor (11Kedishvili N.Y. Chumakova O.V. Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Lapshina E.A. Lin D.W. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The enzyme also reduced 9-cis-retinal and 13-cis-retinal. This led to the renaming of the enzyme as RalR1. A subsequent study using histochemistry demonstrated that PSDR1 is expressed in human and bovine retinal pigment epithelium, and the enzyme was renamed RDH11 (12Haeseleer F. Jang G.-F. Imanishi Y.

The previous publications on the human enzyme did not examine the ability of the enzyme to reduce any aldehydes other than retinals.To determine the substrate specificity of mouse SCALD, we produced the enzyme in bacteria, purified it to near homogeneity, and reconstituted it in active form. Here, we show that the enzyme has activity against short-chain aldehydes such as nonanal in addition to retinaldehydes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can give rise to a variety of aldehydes, including nonanal, when they undergo oxidation (13Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5851) Google Scholar). The promiscuous specificity of SCALD stands in contrast to another aldehyde dehydrogenase (designated photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase (prRDH) (14Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) that we show is specific for retinaldehydes and does not act upon nonanal. Moreover, we show that SCALD is up-regulated by SREBPs, which also up-regulate the expression of the enzymes that synthesize and elongate unsaturated fatty acids (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). Unlike prRDH, which is expressed in rod outer segments but not in eight other tissues (14Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), SCALD is expressed in a wide variety of organs, including testis, liver, and retina. Considered together, these findings suggest that SCALD plays a role in the metabolism of short-chain aldehydes in addition to retinaldehydes, and therefore we propose the less restrictive name SCALD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—We obtained 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal from Cayman Chemical; other aldehydes from Aldrich; steroids from Steraloids; ponasterone A from Invitrogen; Zwittergent 3-16 detergent from Calbiochem; CAPS detergent from Novagen; d-[1-3H]glucose (20 Ci/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.; mouse monoclonal anti-His IgG from Qiagen; and other chemicals and mouse monoclonal anti-Flag IgG from Sigma. The prRDH-His expression plasmid (14Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Jeremy Nathans (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine).General Methods—Lipoprotein-deficient newborn calf serum was prepared as described (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization of total RNA was carried out as described (9Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Filters were exposed to X-Omat blue film (Kodak) with intensifying screens at –80 °C for ∼16 h. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out as described (16Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), using SCALD-specific primers (5′-GCGGCTCGTGAGATCCAA-3′ and 5′-GGCAAAGGCTCGAATAGACTTG-3′). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (17DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.-P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with the use of the Super Signal CL-HRP substrate (Pierce). Filters were exposed to X-Omat blue film for 1–5 min at room temperature.Subtractive Hybridization and Selection of Differentially Expressed Genes—Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from the brown adipose tissue of wild-type and aP2-SREBP-1c transgenic mice (9Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Both the wild-type and transgenic cDNA pools were digested with RsaI. The digested aP2-SREBP-1c “tester” cDNA pool was divided into two groups: one pool was ligated to the supplied adaptor set 1, and the other to adaptor set 2R. After separate melting and hybridization of these pools with wild-type “driver” cDNA, the two tester pools were annealed and subjected to adaptor-specific PCR to yield “forward”-subtracted cDNA. The subtraction was also performed with wild-type cDNA as tester and aP2-SREBP-1c cDNA as driver to produce a “reverse”-subtracted cDNA pool. The forward-subtracted cDNA was subcloned into pT-Adv TA cloning vector (Clontech), and transformed cells were plated onto ampicillin-containing Luria-Bertani-agar plates, generating a subtracted cDNA library. Recombinant colonies were grown in 100-μl Luria-Bertani cultures in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. The cloned inserts were amplified using the PCR-Select differential screening kit (Clontech). The cDNAs were arrayed on duplicate filters and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes derived from the forward- and reverse-subtracted cDNA pools after sequential digestion with RsaI, SmaI, and EagI to remove the adapter sequences. Approximately 350 clones that hybridized specifically with the forward-subtracted probes with a signal intensity of >2-fold relative to the reverse-subtracted probes were each sequenced in their entirety, and 26 clones with novel sequences were identified and further characterized by Northern blots to confirm their differential expression. Four of the twenty-six clones showed a >10-fold higher expression in brown adipose tissue from aP2-SREBP-1c mice versus wild-type mice. All four of these clones corresponded to SCALD.cDNA Cloning of SCALD—A cDNA library ligated to the Marathon cDNA adaptor was prepared from the mouse aP2-SREBP-1c brown adipose tissue poly(A)+ RNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). The 5′-RACE fragment of SCALD was obtained by PCR using the 5′-primer AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) provided by the manufacturer and the 3′-primer based on the 5′ sequence of the SCALD fragment (5′-GTCCAGACCACTGAAGAGCTTTCTC-3′). The 3′-RACE fragment was amplified with the 5′ primer based on the 3′ sequence of the SCALD fragment (5′-GAGAAGGAAGCTCTTCAGTGGTCTGGAC-3′) and the 3′-primer AP1. 5′- and 3′-RACE fragments were sequenced, and the full-length SCALD cDNA was amplified from the cDNA library using primers 5′-GTCTAGGATCAGAAGCCATAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCCCGAGGAAATGGCAAACTCCC-3′ based on 5′- and 3′-RACE fragment sequences, respectively. The 2.7-kb PCR product was subcloned into the pT-Adv TA cloning vector (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated pT-Adv-SCALD and sequenced.Expression Plasmids—pSCALD-Flag and pSCALD-His encode epitope-tagged versions of mouse SCALD and were generated by PCR with pT-Adv-SCALD as a template using the 5′-primer (5′-CTGAGATGTTCGGATTCCTGCTTCTGCTCTCTC-3′) for both plasmids and the 3′-primer (5′-TCACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCCAATCCACTGGGAGGCCCAGCAGGT-3′) for the FLAG-tagged version and the 3′-primer (5′-TTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCCAATCCACTGGGAGGCCCAGCAGGT-3′) for the His-tagged version. The PCR product was cloned into the pTarget vector (Promega) by TA cloning. A similar construct without a COOH-terminal tag was generated by PCR and designated pSCALD. pHis-SCALD encodes a histidine-tagged version of mouse SCALD and was generated by PCR using the 5′-primer (5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTCGGATTCCTGCTTCTGCTC-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-CCTTAAGCATATGTTACCAATCCACTGGGAGGCCCAG-3′) and pT-Adv-SCALD as a template. The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and ligated into a NdeI-digested and dephosphorylated pET-15b vector (Novagen) encoding six consecutive histidines, followed by the cloning site. All expression plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire coding regions and cloning sites.The prRDH-His expression plasmid encodes a His-tagged version of the bovine photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase, as described previously by Rattner et al. (14Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Purification of Detergent-solubilized Recombinant SCALD—The bacterial strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pHis-SCALD and plated on Luria-Bertani-agar containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1% (w/v) glucose to repress basal expression of SCALD. Expression and purification of SCALD was carried out according to the pET System Manual (Novagen). Briefly, after isolation of inclusion bodies by centrifugation, SCALD was solubilized using solubilization buffer (50 mm CAPS at pH 11, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 105 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet the remaining insoluble material. Bovine serum albumin (50 mg/ml solution) was added to the soluble fraction to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, after which the fraction was dialyzed sequentially against buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate at pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for 3 h at 4 °C and buffer B (100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) overnight at 4 °C. The protein was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a cation exchange column (HiTrap™ SP-Sepharose HP from Amersham Biosciences) and buffer B containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (0 to 1 m). Fractions containing SCALD were pooled, and the protein content was estimated by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard.Affinity Purification of Rabbit Polyclonal SCALD Antibody—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse SCALD was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (amino acids 301 to 316 of SCALD) coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For immunoblotting, whole serum was used at a 1:1000 dilution. For immunohistochemistry, the antibody was affinity-purified on a column in which the above synthetic peptide was coupled to agarose beads using a SulfoLink kit (Pierce).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Fractionation—On day 0, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 1, cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pVA1 (18Akusjarvi G. Svensson C. Nygard O. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, the cells were switched to medium A supplemented with 6% (v/v) MBS solution. DNA suspensions (2.5 μg/dish) were incubated with the cells for 3 h at 35 °C under 3% CO2. Monolayers were then switched back to medium A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested on day 2 for preparation of cell fractions.M19 cells are a mutant line of CHO-K1 cells that lack nuclear SREBPs because of a deletion in the Site-2 protease gene (19Rawson R.B.

On day 0, N-BP1a and N-BP2 cells were plated at a density of 7.5 × 105/100-mm dish in medium B (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, 20 μm sodium oleate, and 0.05% (v/v) ethanol. On day 2, the monolayers were switched to medium B supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum in the absence or presence of 1 μm ponasterone A in the case of N-BP1a cells and in the absence or presence of 10 μm ponasterone A for N-BP2 cells (20Pai J.

For Northern blots, tissues were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent extraction of RNA. For immunoblotting, all operations were done at 4 °C. Tissues were homogenized with a Polytron into ∼5 volumes of sucrose buffer (5 mm Hepes at pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A)) and clarified by centrifugation at 103 × g for 10 min. For histology, tissues were harvested from anesthetized mice and fixed via transcardial perfusion with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde (in situ hybridization) or Bouin's fixative (immunohistochemistry). Subsequent paraffin processing, embedding, and sectioning were performed by standard procedures (23Sheehan D.C. Hrapchak B.B. Theory and Practice of Histotechnology. 2nd ed.

Reactions with detergent-solubilized recombinant SCALD were carried out in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer D containing 0.3% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-16 and 1 μg of enzyme. Reactions with transfected microsomal SCALD and prRDH were carried out in the absence of detergent in a final volume of 0.5 ml of buffer D containing either 200 μg of microsomal protein (for reactions with steroids and carbonyl compounds) or 10 μg of microsomal protein (for reactions with retinaldehydes). All reactions were initiated by a 1-μl addition of ethanol containing the indicated concentration of substrate.With steroids and carbonyl compounds as substrates, SCALD activity in detergent-solubilized recombinant protein was measured by monitoring the rate of NADPH oxidation spectrophotometrically at 340 nm during a 5-min incubation at room temperature (∼22 °C) using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). Enzyme activity was calculated based on an absorption coefficient of 6220 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm for NADPH.With steroids and carbonyl compounds as substrates, SCALD and prRDH activity in microsomes from transfected HEK-293 cells was measured by monitoring the production of 3H-labeled products.

https://openalex.org/W2059984964,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a prominent neuropeptide whose actions are mediated by VPAC receptors belonging to class II G protein-coupled receptors. To identify contact sites between VIP and its VPAC1 receptor, an analog of VIP substituted with a photoreactive para-benzoyl-l-Phe (Bpa) at position 22 has been synthesized and evaluated in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the recombinant human receptor. Bpa22-VIP and native VIP are equipotent in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membranes. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the covalent 125I-[Bpa22-VIP]-hVPAC1R complex yielded a single labeled fragment of 30 kDa that shifted to 11 after deglycosylation, most consistent with the 67–137 fragment of the receptor N-terminal ectodomain. Further cleavage of this fragment with V8 endoproteinase and creation of receptor mutants with new CNBr cleavage sites (XàMet), demonstrated that 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] was covalently attached to the short receptor 109–120 fragment (GWTHLEPGPYPI). In a three-dimensional model of the receptor N-terminal ectodomain, this fragment is located on one edge of the putative VIP binding groove and encompasses several amino acids previously shown to be crucial for VIP binding (reviewed in Laburthe, M., Couvineau, A., and Marie, J.

Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

It includes receptors for peptides structurally related to VIP (glucagon, glucagons-like peptides, secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, growth hormone-releasing factor), receptors for other peptides such as parathyroid hormone, calcitonin or corticotropin-releasing factor (7Laburthe M.

Sci. 2000; 25: 284-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) receptors bearing unusually large and complex N-terminal extracellular domains. The VPAC1 receptor is a prototypical class II peptide receptor that has been extensively studied by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular chimerism with respect to characterization of VIP binding domains (for review see Ref. 6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the existence of selectivity filters for low affinity agonists (10Couvineau A.

These studies showed that the N-terminal extracellular domain of hVPAC1 receptor is necessary although not sufficient for high affinity VIP binding (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, microdomains consisting of small clusters of amino acids located in the N-terminal ectodomain (11Du K. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37016-37022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or at the junction of extra loop 1 and transmembrane helix 3 (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were characterized as selectivity filters restricting access of VIP-related peptides to the receptor. A three-dimensional model of a large part of the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor has been recently developed (13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite these extensive studies of the structure-function relationship of hVPAC1 receptor, we do not yet know the physical sites of interaction between VIP and its receptor. In this context, we developed a photoaffinity probe of VIP by substituting para-benzoyl-l-Phe (Bpa) for tyrosine 22. This site of incorporation of the benzophenone group, a photoactivable group of choice for high efficiency covalent labeling of proteins (14Prestwich G.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Marecak D.M. Chaudhary A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was selected for several reasons. (i) Tyr22 is present in the central part of the 28-amino acid VIP, a domain that has been shown previously by alanine scanning to contain several amino acids that are crucial for VIP binding (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). (ii) Alanine scanning showed that Tyr22 itself is not important for the biological activity of VIP (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and we expected that incorporation of Bpa in this position would result in a high affinity probe. (iii) The substitution of Bpa for tyrosine keeps an aromatic residue. We report here the development and characterization of the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] photoaffinity probe for covalent labeling of the hVPAC1 receptor and provide evidence that VIP is in direct contact with the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor. Moreover, we show that amino acid in position 22 of VIP is in the environment of the short sequence 109–120 within this ectodomain when VIP is bound to the receptor. Materials—Restriction enzymes and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen. Eucaryotic expression vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). DNA sequenase kit and radioactive reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Promega. Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. The human VPAC1 receptor cDNA was cloned in our laboratory (16Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A receptor construct containing an inserted FLAG sequence between Ala30 and Ala31 (17Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and fused in the C-terminal position with the green fluorescent protein (18Nicole, P., Maoret, J. J., Couvineau, A., Momany, F. A., and Laburthe, M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 276, 654–659Google Scholar) was used in all of the studies. It has the same phenotype as the wild-type receptor with respect to VIP binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase (17Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Nicole, P., Maoret, J. J., Couvineau, A., Momany, F. A., and Laburthe, M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 276, 654–659Google Scholar). The CHO-F7 clone expressing the human VPAC1 construct (B max, 5 pmol/mg protein; Kd , 0.6 nm VIP) was used in most experiments. VIP and [Ala17, para-benzoyl-l-Phe22]-VIP-28 referred to as Bpa22-VIP were obtained by custom synthesis from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). The substitution of alanine for Met17 does not alter binding affinity for hVPAC1 receptor (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and prevents undesirable cleavage of Bpa22-VIP upon CNBr treatments. Neither is Bpa22-VIP cleavable upon V8 endoproteinase treatments since there is no Glu residue in its sequence. [125I]VIP (radioiodinated on Tyr10) and [125I]cAMP were prepared and purified in our laboratory as described previously (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] was prepared and purified following the method used for native VIP (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All of the highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Cell Transfection—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Identification of the desired mutations was obtained by direct sequencing of the mutated region (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutants were stably transfected in CHO cells as described previously (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation—The CHO-F7 cells expressing the wild-type VPAC1 receptor construct and the CHO cells expressing stably transfected receptor mutants were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were grown to confluency. After removing the culture medium, attached cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with a rubber policeman and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g. The cell pellet was exposed for 30 min at 4 °C to hypoosmotic 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and membranes were obtained as described previously (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein content was measured by the procedure of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Ligand Binding Assay and Measurement of Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—Ligand binding assay was as described previously (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Membranes (100 μg of proteins/ml) derived from transfected CHO cells were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 0.05 nm [125I]VIP in the presence of increasing concentrations of VIP or Bpa22-VIP in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped by transferring the incubation medium to an excess of ice-cold buffer. Bound and free peptides were separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), and membrane pellets were washed twice with 10% (w/v) sucrose in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES. The radioactivity was then assayed in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of [125I]VIP bound in the absence (total binding) and the presence (nonspecific binding) of 1 μm unlabeled VIP. Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program. The concentration of peptides that elicited half-maximal inhibition of specific [125I]VIP binding (Ki) was determined by computer analysis. Adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from clone F7 cells was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of VIP or Bpa22-VIP as described previously (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were fitted, and concentrations of peptides giving half-maximal responses (EC50) were calculated using the Prism software suite (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Photoaffinity Labeling—Transfected cells were incubated in darkness with 10 nm125I-[Bpa22-VIP] in 10 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (w/v) ovalbumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm TLCK. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellets resuspended in 4 ml of 20 mm HEPES with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 mm TLCK. 1 ml of labeled cells was then added to each well of a six-well tissue culture plate, and the photoreaction (λ = 365 nm) was carried out on ice at a distance of ∼2 cm. After 40-min UV exposure, cells were collected into individual 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and washed twice with 10 mm HEPES containing 25 mm glycine, 75 mm NaCl buffer, pH 2.5, and one time with 20 mm HEPES. The photolabeled receptors were then analyzed directly by electrophoresis or after chemical or enzymatic cleavage. Chemical Cleavage of Photoaffinity-labeled VPAC1 Receptor Constructs—The photolabeled receptors in cells were incubated overnight in darkness with 10 mg/ml CNBr in 80% formic acid at room temperature. Cyanogen bromide present in the reaction mixture was then removed by Waters C18 Sep-Pak purification. After extensive washing of the Sep-Pak cartridge with 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CNBr-generated peptide fragments were eluted with 2 ml of 100% acetonitrile. Fractions were counted for radioactivity and evaporated under vacuum (Speed-Vac). The resulting material was either analyzed directly by electrophoresis or after enzymatic treatments (see below). Enzymatic Treatments—For protein deglycosylation, the material obtained after CNBr treatment was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with PNGase F (3 units/ml) as described previously (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). V8 endoproteinase digestion of proteins in this material was obtained by incubation for 6 h at 25 °C in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.01% SDS, 5% acetonitrile, pH 7.8, as described previously (21Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and Autoradiography—Samples were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE performed according to the method of Schägger and Von Jagow (22Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions in the presence of 0.2 m dithiothreitol. The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of the broad range protein markers from BioLabs and the Rainbow™ colored protein molecular weight markers from Amersham Biosciences versus the log values of their masses. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 3–10 days with intensifying screens at –80 °C as described previously (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The synthetic Bpa22-VIP photoaffinity probe developed in this study was first evaluated for its ability to interact with the human VPAC1 receptor stably expressed in CHO-F7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, Bpa22-VIP has the same potency (EC50 = 0.06 nm) and efficacy as native VIP in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes prepared from CHO-F7 cells. Bpa22-VIP and native VIP have also similar affinities for the hVPAC1 receptor in the ligand binding assay (data not shown). Therefore, this probe is relevant for photoaffinity labeling of human VPAC1 receptors in CHO-F7 cells. After radioiodination, the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] probe was incubated with CHO-F7 cells, labeled cells were then exposed to UV, and the labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A 95-kDa labeled band was observed, which was no more present when an excess of cold VIP was added together with the labeled probe (Fig. 2). This molecular mass is in good agreement with the expected mass (92 kDa) considering the previously characterized (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) mass of glycosylated VPAC1 receptor expressed in CHO cells (64 kDa) and the presence of green fluorescent protein (25 kDa) at the C terminus of the construct and of covalently bound Bpa22-VIP (3 kDa). Treatment of the 95-kDa band with PNGase F generated a 70-kDa band (data not shown) in consonance with the previously characterized presence of 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety on each of the three consensus N-glycosylation sites in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the hVPAC1 receptor (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 95-kDa band corresponding to 125I-[Bpa22-VIP]/hVPAC1R conjugate was then subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages to identify the site of the covalent contact between VIP and the receptor. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 95-kDa band generated a 30-kDa labeled band (Fig. 2). This band was further shifted to 11 kDa after treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 2), indicating that it is heavily glycosylated, most probably, at two consensus N-glycosylation sites. Altogether, these data are only consistent with the covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] to the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment (Table I) in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor. This fragment contains two N-glycosylation sites on Asn69 and Asn100 (Table I) previously shown to be occupied by a 9-kDa carbohydrate (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To further validate the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment as the site of attachment of the photoaffinity probe, we created new CNBr cleavage sites within this sequence by substituting methionine for some amino acids e.g. Phe93, Arg99, and Glu108 (Table I). These cleavage sites have been chosen to remove one or two N-glycosylation sites from the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP]-labeled CNBr fragments i.e. glycosylation on Asn69 or Asn100. The three mutants F93M, R99M, and E108M were constructed and stably expressed in CHO cells. They bound VIP had affinities similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3). The Ki values for VIP were 1.5, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.6 nm for the F93M, R99M, E108M mutants, and wild-type receptor, respectively. Following treatment with CNBr, the F93M and R99M mutants yielded, respectively, 18-and 17-kDa bands as compared with the 30-kDa band observed for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). The 12–13-kDa mass difference observed between the wild-type receptor and mutants cannot be simply accounted for by the shortening of the peptide fragment e.g. 3.0 kDa for the 67–93 sequence and 3.6 kDa for the 67–99 sequence. It is consistent with the removal of the 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety known to be linked to Asn69 (see Ref. 20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and Table I). The E108M mutant yielded a 6-kDa band much smaller than that obtained for the wild-type receptor or F93M and R99M mutants (Fig. 4). Again, the 24-kDa mass difference observed between the wild-type receptor and this mutant cannot be simply accounted for by the shortening of the peptide fragment e.g. 4.7 kDa for the 67–108 sequence. It is consistent with the removal of the 9-kDa carbohydrate moieties known to be linked to Asn69 and Asn100 (ref 20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and Table I). Altogether, these data clearly demonstrated that the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment obtained after CNBr cleavage of the wild-type receptor is actually the site of attachment of the photoaffinity probe.Fig. 2CNBr cleavage and PNGase F or V8 endoproteinase digestions of the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP]-labeled wild-type hVPAC1 receptor. Receptors expressed in CHO-F7 cells were photoaffinity-labeled with 125I-[Bpa22-VIP], and cells were subjected to treatment with CNBr (lane 3), CNBr followed by V8 endoproteinase (lane 4), CNBr followed by PNGase F (lane 5), or CNBr followed by both enzymes (lane 6). Control without treatment is shown in lane 1. Inhibition of photoaffinity labeling of hVPAC1 receptor by incubation of the labeled probe in the presence of an excess of cold VIP (1 μm) is shown in lane 2.

MW, molecular mass; wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further delineate the site of covalent binding of the affinity probe, the 30- and 11-kDa (deglycosylated) CNBr-generated fragments (Fig. 2) were digested with endoproteinase V8, which under our experimental conditions cleaves proteins at the C-terminal side of Glu residues with the notable exception of Glu-Pro sequence (21Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As expected, considering the presence of Glu residues in the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment, this cleavage further decreased the apparent molecular mass of the labeled band (Fig. 2). V8 endoproteinase treatment of the 30-kDa band generated a 6-kDa band (Fig. 2). Identical data were obtained by V8 endoproteinase treatment of the 11-kDa band. Given the mass of generated products and the absence of further effect of PNGase F (data not shown) on the migration of the labeled products after V8 endoproteinase digestion, the data support the covalent attachment of the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] probe to the Gly109-Glu133 receptor fragment (see Table I). To further validate the Gly109-Glu133 fragment as the site of attachment of Bpa22-VIP and to precisely determine which subdomain is concerned, we created new CNBr cleavage sites in this sequence by substituting methionine for Ile120 (Table I). The I120M hVPAC1 receptor mutant was constructed and stably expressed in CHO cells. It bound VIP with an affinity identical (Ki = 0.6 nm) to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3). The I120M mutant expressed in CHO cells was photolabeled with 125I-[Bpa22-VIP], yielding a 95-kDa band upon electrophoresis (data not shown) as observed for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). The I120M mutant was then cleaved by CNBr and deglycosylated by PNGase F without or with further cleavage by V8 endoproteinase (Fig. 5). After CNBr treatment, the I120M mutant yielded a 9-kDa band as compared with a 11-kDa band for the wild-type receptor. Although the exact determination of such low molecular masses is clearly difficult by electrophoresis, it is crucial to point out that the band obtained with the mutant is systematically shifted as compared with that obtained for the wild-type receptor over four experiments. This finding strongly supported that the Gly109-Glu133 fragment is actually the site of attachment of Bpa22-VIP. Further cleavage with V8 endoproteinase yielded a 5-kDa band, which was consistently shifted over four experiments as compared with the 6-kDa band observed for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5). Altogether, these data are consistent with the covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] to the Gly109-Ile120 sequence of the hVPAC1 receptor. Since we have previously developed a three-dimensional model for a large part of the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor (13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J.

It is of great interest to consider that this short sequence is within or contiguous to the proposed VIP binding groove (13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M.

The present study was aimed at mapping the cross-linking site for the newly developed photolabile VIP probe 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] in the human VPAC1 receptor. Based on various digestions of the probe-labeled receptor and the construction of receptor mutants, our data indicate that the benzophenone group present on the side chain of Bpa in position 22 of VIP is in close proximity to a small domain within the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor. These data provide the first direct evidence that VIP physically interacts with the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor. They extend previous site-directed mutagenesis and structural modelization studies supporting the crucial role of this domain for VIP binding (reviewed in Ref. 6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The photolabile VIP derivative with substitution of Bpa for tyrosine at position 22 of VIP is a high potency full VIP agonist as shown by its ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO expressing recombinant hVPAC1 receptor. This could be expected from previous alanine scanning studies, which showed that Tyr22 is not important for VIP binding to hVPAC1 receptor and subsequent adenylyl cyclase activation (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On this basis, it is reasonable to assume that the photoaffinity probe adopts a binding mode similar to that taken up by native VIP. The proposed covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] to the Gly109-Ile120 segment within the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor (see Fig. 6) is unambiguously consistent with the photoaffinity labeling results. Following UV irradiation of the complex formed by the receptor construct fused in the C-terminal position with the green fluorescent protein and 125I-[Bpa22-VIP], covalent labeling of a glycoprotein of 95 kDa was observed (see Fig. 2). Upon cleavage with CNBr, the labeled material was shifted to 30 kDa. Extensive studies of hVPAC1 receptor glycosylation have shown that the receptor expressed in COS cells or CHO cells is glycosylated with three N-glycosylation sites on Asn59, Asn68, and Asn100 in the N-terminal ectodomain, each site being occupied by 9-kDa carbohydrates (20Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fact that the 30-kDa band was further shifted to 11 kDa after digestion with PNGase F clearly demonstrated that the labeled receptor fragment was heavily glycosylated, most probably, on two N-glycosylation sites. Altogether, these data were consistent with the labeling of the large Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment, which contains two glycosylation sites on Asn69 and Asn100 (see Table I). Further cleavage with V8 endoproteinase and development of new CNBr cleavage sites by substituting methionine for native amino acids at four different positions in receptor mutants provided clear evidence for the covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] to the Gly109-Ile120 segment of the receptor (see Figs. 4 and 5). Photoaffinity labeling identifies receptor domains in close proximity to the bound photoligand. The other privileged approach to molecular delineation of ligand-receptor interaction, site-directed mutagenesis, identifies domains necessary for function that are not necessarily proximal to the site of that function (24Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As far as the VIP-hVPAC1 receptor interaction is concerned, there is not only a good agreement between photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis experiments but also an exquisite complementarity as discussed further on. (i) The covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] to the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor is consistent with previous experiments in which the receptor has been truncated or mutated. Indeed, deletion of the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor abolishes its ability to bind VIP (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis identified many residues within the N-terminal ectodomain as crucial or important for VIP binding including Glu36, Ser64, Met66, Trp67, Asp68, Trp73, Pro74, Pro87, Phe90, Gly109, Trp110, or Pro115 (6Laburthe M.

These residues have been assumed to be positioned in a tertiary structure (see below) probably stabilized by the formation of three disulfide bonds formed between six cysteine residues, which are strictly conserved in class II G protein-coupled receptors (7Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of all of the six cysteines clearly abolishes VIP binding to the hVPAC1 receptor (28Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). (ii) Site-directed mutagenesis showed that residues that are crucial for VIP binding are dispersed along the primary sequence of the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A structural model of a large part of this domain has been constructed by sequence homology with a yeast lipase whose structure was available in the Protein Data Bank (13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This model confirmed the existence of a signal sequence at the N terminus (see Fig. 6) and showed most importantly that residues that are important for VIP binding are gathered around an electronegative groove with an outspanning shell of three tryptophan residues at one end (13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this context, the fact that 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] covalently attached to the Gly109-Ile120 segment of the hVPAC1 receptor is quite meaningful. Indeed, this segment is located on one side of the groove and encompasses several crucial residues (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

In that respect, the present study provides the first experimental basis for the current view of VIP binding to the hVPAC1 receptor. Indeed, it has been suggested that the central part of VIP with its crucial basic residues (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) may interact with the acidic residues in the electronegative groove in the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor (6Laburthe M.

Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This finding fits well with the fact that Bpa22 in the photoaffinity probe is adjacent to the crucial basic residue Lys21 of VIP (15Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of VIP may also interact with the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor, whereas it has been suggested that the N-terminal domain of VIP interacts with a still poorly characterized binding domain on the core of the receptor that may consist of, at least, the first and second extracellular loops and the upper part of the second transmembrane helix as viewed from the outside of the cell (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In particular, based on dual mutations in VIP and hVPAC1 receptor, it was suggested that Asp3 side chain of VIP penetrates in the transmembrane domain in proximity to basic amino acids from transmembrane helix 2 (29Solano R.M.

The hypothesis that peptide-binding cleft could reside between the hVPAC1 receptor N-terminal ectodomain and the receptor body is reminiscent of the situation described for two other class II receptor, the parathyroid hormone receptor (30Chorev M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Gensure R.C. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. J. Biol.

Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Development of new photoaffinity probes with Bpa substitutions at the N and C termini of VIP are clearly needed to further delineate the sites of interaction of the different part of this 28-amino acid neuropeptide with its receptors. In conclusion, the results of the photoaffinity labeling study of the hVPAC1 receptor provides a contact region between the receptor and the side chain at position 22 of VIP. This represents the first direct evidence for physical proximity between VIP and the N-terminal ectodomain of its receptor in the VIP-receptor complex. The compatibility between the structural model of the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor (6Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the present photoaffinity cross-linking study further validates this model and paves the way of future docking of VIP in its receptor. Additional studies with new photoaffinity probes of VIP are clearly needed to identify anchor points in hVPAC1 receptor for interaction with other parts of the long 28-amino acid VIP. Such studies are currently in progress in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W1996095649,"The Ret finger protein (RFP) is a member of the tripartite motif family, which is characterized by a conserved RING finger, a B-box, and a coiled-coil domain (together called RBCC). Although RFP is known to become oncogenic when its RBCC moiety is connected to a tyrosine kinase domain by DNA rearrangement, its biological function is not well defined. Here we show that ectopic expression of RFP in human embryonic kidney 293 cells causes extensive apoptosis, as assessed by multiple criteria. RFP expression activates Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 kinase and also increases caspase-3-like activity. However, RFP failed to release cytochrome c and, therefore, to increase caspase-9-like activity. RFP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by the caspase-8 inhibitor crmA and dominant negative ASK1 but not by Bcl-2. These results reveal a novel RFP death pathway that recruits mitogen-activated protein kinase and caspases independently of mitochondrial events. Domain mapping showed that the intact RBCC moiety is necessary for the pro-apoptotic function of RFP. Moreover, expression of the RBCC moiety further potentiated the pro-apoptotic activity and resulted in a 7-fold increase of caspase activation compared with that induced by full-length RFP. This suggests that a large number of tripartite motif family members sharing the RBCC moiety may participate in the control of cell survival."

Despite a model consisting of NAD export via connexin 43, extracellular synthesis of cADPr by ecto-CD38, and reimport of cADPR via CD38 or via nucleoside transporters (20Graeff R.M. Franco L.

A soluble ADP-ribosyl cyclase was purified from Aplysia californica ovotestis (19Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and soluble ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities have also been detected in sea-urchin eggs (20Graeff R.M. Franco L. De Flora A.

In the present study, we show that in a cytosolic fraction from pancreatic acinar cells, which is devoid of CD38, an increase in both ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and cGMP accumulation was detected following hormonal stimulation of the cells with acetylcholine (ACh) or cholecystokinin (CCK), whereas bombesin had no effect. The effect of hormonal activation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase could be mimicked by the cGMP analog, dibutyryl-cGMP, indicating involvement of cGMP and a cGMP-dependent kinase in this signaling process. Isolation and Fractionation of Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Pancreata from male Wistar rats (140 g) were cleaned, minced to small pieces, and suspended in 5 ml of “buffer A” (130 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES) supplemented with 0.01% trypsin inhibitor, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4. Digestion with collagenase (type III; Biochrome Germany) was carried out in two steps with 1,000 units and 1,800 units of collagenase for 10 min each at 37 °C under continuous supply of O2. Cells were washed twice with buffer A and were resuspended in buffer A without BSA. Following incubation with agonists, cells were broken by N2 cavitation in a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instruments) with 5,100 kilopascals for 1 min. For preparation of cellular fractions, several centrifugation steps were subsequently carried out (Fig. 1). Unbroken cells, zymogen granules, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was washed in buffer A without BSA. The supernatant of this 13,000 × g centrifugation step was saved for further fractionation. In order to purify “zymogen granules” (23De Lisle R.C. Schulz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J.

Cell Res. 1992; 203: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) from the 13,000 × g pellet, each of these fractions was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min in a 40% Percoll gradient containing in 50 mm MES, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4, 390 mm sucrose supplemented with 0.1 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% BSA (23De Lisle R.C. Schulz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G411-G418PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lopez-Mediavilla C. Orfao A. San Miguel J. Medina J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). “Zymogen granules” formed a ring near the bottom of the centrifugation tube, and “mitochondria” formed a yellow ring in the upper half of the gradient. The material was collected, and the fractions were washed twice in buffer A without BSA by centrifugations at 10,000 × g and careful resuspension. The supernatant of the 13,000 × g centrifugation step was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was defined as “crude membrane fraction.” The 60,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The resulting 100,000 × g pellet was defined as the “plasma membrane fraction,” and the 100,000 × g supernatant was defined as the “cytosolic fraction.” All fractions were resuspended in buffer A without BSA supplemented with 1 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mm leupeptin. The preparation of fractions from the cell homogenate led to a protein recovery of 43.1 ± 5.7% (n = 24) from all fractions as compared with the protein in the total homogenate. Protein of the cytosolic fraction contributed with 21.3 ± 2.1%, crude membranes with 10.7 ± 2.0%, zymogen granules with 5.5 ± 0.7%, mitochondria with 2.2 ± 0.7%, and plasma membranes with 3.3 ± 0.6% to total protein of the homogenate. The purity of the fractions was quantified by determination of the relative enrichment of specific markers in the fraction as compared with the homogenate (Table I). Using the Western blot technique with antibodies against the mitochondrial marker, cytochrome C (purified anti-cytochrome C antibody, BD Biosciences, Europe) we found 2.3-fold enrichments in the mitochondrial fraction. The zymogen granular marker amylase (anti-amylase; Calbiochem) was 2.1-fold enriched in the zymogene granular fraction. Enzymatic detection of the magnesium-dependent Na/K-ATPase (25Scharschmidt B.F. Keeffe E.B. Blankenship N.M. Ockner R.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 93: 790-799PubMed Google Scholar) (plasma membrane marker) showed a 3.8-fold enrichment.Table IRelative enrichment of marker enzymes in cellular fractions as compared with the total homogenateEnzymeHomogenate“Cytosol”Plasma membranesCrude membranesZymogen granulesMitochondriaNa/K-ATPase1ND3.8 ± 0.80.8 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.3Cytochrome c1ND0.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1<0.1 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.2Amylase10.6 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.92.1 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.1CD381ND2.4 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.1<0.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab For measurement of hormone-stimulated cytosolic ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities, it was necessary to shorten the protocol, since hormone-stimulated enzyme activities decreased rapidly during the fractionation procedure. Following the centrifugation step at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was discarded. The supernatant containing cell membranes and mitochondria was centrifuged immediately thereafter at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was defined as “membranes” and the supernatant as “cytosol.” Marker enzymes for other organelles were apparently absent in the “cytosol” of this preparation, similar to the findings shown in Table I. Isolation of Zymogen Granular Membranes from the Zymogen Granule Fraction—Purified “zymogen granular membranes” were obtained by suspending “zymogen granules” in 10 ml of “lysis buffer” (in 0.1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.0 with Tris, supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and were kept on ice for 30 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A without BSA (26Thevenod F. Hildebrandt J.P. Striessnig J. de Jonge H.R. Schulz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3300-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays for ADP-ribosyl Cyclase Activity—ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured fluorometrically in subcellular fractions (27Klebl B.M. Pette D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fractions were adjusted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in buffer A, and 0.1 mm 1,N 6-etheno-NAD+ (ϵ-NAD+) was added at continuous shaking at 37 °C. Enzymatic degradation of ϵ-NAD+ to ϵ-cADPr, ϵ-ADPr, and other metabolites was accompanied by an approximately 10-fold fluorescence increase and was monitored continuously at 410 nm (emission wavelength) and at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, using a Spectro Fluomax fluorometer. Precise analysis of products of ϵ-NAD+ metabolism was carried out by reverse-phase HPLC. Enzymatic degradation of ϵ-NAD+ was stopped by cooling the sample rapidly to 4 °C and subsequent filtration at 13,000 × g for 30–60 min through a 10-kDa cut-off “Microcon Centrifugation Filter” (Millipore). The duration of the enzyme assay was adjusted to obtain linear initial velocities according to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities present in each fraction (e.g. homogenate and membrane fractions 10 min; cytosolic fraction 60 min). Different substrate concentrations (10–500 μm) did not change the substrate/product ratio. Desalting of the cytosolic fraction for removal of endogenous NAD+ did not have any significant influence on the specific ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and was therefore not applied routinely. In several experiments, the pseudosubstrate NGD (100 μm) was used instead of ϵ-NAD+. The techniques were essentially the same as for ϵ-NAD+; however, the specific product generated by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase is cyclic GDP-ribose, which was separated and quantified by HPLC. HPLC Analysis of ϵ-labeled Adenosine Nucleotides—For identification and quantification of different ϵ-adenosine nucleotides that can be generated by NADases (27Klebl B.M. Pette D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), separation of the products was necessary. This was performed by HPLC techniques (28Schweitzer K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) similar to that used to measure endogeneous cADPr (29da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 707: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Samples were immediately analyzed by HPLC or stored at –70 °C for later analysis. For identification of ϵ-cADPr, 200 μl of the filtrate was injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Hypersil BDS C18 column, 5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm). A gradient from reverse phase ion pair buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen phosphate, pH 6.0) to methanol was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (28Schweitzer K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 707: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Methanol concentrations in the gradient were 5% at time 0; 7.5% at 2.5 min; 16% at 4–5 min; 25% at 6.5–17 min; and 5% at 18 min. 1,N 6-Etheno-labeled adenosine nucleotides were detected with a fluorescence detector (410-nm emission and 300-nm excitation wavelength). Identification and quantification of the ϵ-adenosine-labeled nucleotides were performed by comparing the retention time and peak area of our samples with those of known standards. The standards ϵ-NAD+, ϵ-ADP, ϵ-AMP, and ϵ-AD were commercially available. ϵ-cADPr was generated by incubating ϵ-NAD+ (100 μm) with Aplysia californica ADP-ribosyl cyclase (100 units/ml) for 5 min. ϵ-ADPr was generated from ϵ-cADPr by heating to 80 °C for 60 min (28Schweitzer K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 707: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The minimum detection limits of the products in HPLC separation (defined as a 3:1 signal/noise ratio) were 0.85 ± 0.15 pmol for ϵ-cADPr and 3.1 ± 0.48 pmol for ϵ-ADPr. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation of CD38 —For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) in Laemmli minigels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA and incubated with a CD38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. For immunoprecipitation of CD38, 500 μl of cell lysate (adjusted to 1 mg/ml protein with buffer B (10 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.50% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin)) was incubated with a 4-μl stock solution of a CD38 antibody (200 μg/ml; AT-1 antibody; Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C. After the addition of 12 μl of protein G/protein A-Sepharose beads (Oncogene), incubation was continued for 90 min. Subsequently, beads were washed twice with buffer B and finally with buffer B free of Triton X-100. For SDS-PAGE, the pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-loading buffer (10 mm Tris, 1% mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.015% bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. For measurement of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A, and the activity was measured as described above. Determination of cGMP Concentrations in Intact Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Cyclic GMP concentrations were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences RPN 226). Freshly prepared pancreatic acinar cells (2 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in 200 μl of buffer A and incubated for 1 min in the presence of the indicated hormone or of its carrier (control). After centrifugation (3 min, 250 × g at 4 °C) and removal of the supernatant, intracellular cGMP concentrations were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities in different cellular fractions and organelles we used ϵ-NAD+ as substrate. Cleavage of the nicotinamide moiety by enzymatic metabolism of ϵ-NAD+ to nucleotides such as ϵ-AD, ϵ-ADP, ϵ-AMP, ϵ-cADPr, and ϵ-ADPr resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in fluorescence intensity (27Klebl B.M. Pette D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Commercially available ADP-ribosyl cyclase (Aplysia californica, 25 units) converted all ϵ-NAD+ (100 μm) within the first 2 min, whereas different subcellular fractions purified from pancreatic acinar cells showed less pronounced enzyme activities (data not shown). Ectocellular ADP-ribosyl cyclase and/or NADase activities in intact pancreatic acinar cells were detected when ϵ-NAD was present in the extracellular buffer (data not shown). No NADase activity was detected after heat inactivation of proteins (data not shown). In order to determine the specific ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity out of the whole NAD+-metabolizing activities, it was necessary to separate the ϵ-products by HPLC. Fig. 2 shows a typical HPLC separation of ϵ-adenine nucleotides, which were generated by endogenous enzymatic activity in different pancreatic acinar cell fractions. For comparison, separation of standard ϵ-adenine nucleotides is shown. All fractions were incubated with the same amount of ϵ-NAD+. In all fractions, the substrate was converted to different ϵ-adenine nucleotides, indicating that several pathways for NAD+ metabolism are present in pancreatic acinar cells. In all fractions, except the zymogen granules, cADPr was produced although at varying amounts and specific activities. To exclude the possibility that the substrate ϵ-NAD+ behaves different as compared with the natural substrate NAD+, our method was validated by using the pseudosubstrate NGD. NGD has been successfully used as an ADP-ribosyl cyclase pseudosubstrate in several studies (30Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Muller-Steffner H. Augustin A. Schuber F. Adv. Exp. Med.

The kinetics of the enzymatic metabolism of NGD both in cytosolic and membrane fractions were not significantly different from ϵ-NAD+ (data not shown), confirming our data obtained with ϵ-NAD+. The specific ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was determined in each fraction from the amount of ϵ-cADPr obtained by HPLC separation and the protein content. In different fractions, it varied and was highest in mitochondria followed by the plasma membranes, crude membranes, and the cytosol (Table II). The zymogen granules had very low specific ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities. After preparation of zymogen granular membranes from the zymogen granule fraction, it became obvious that practically no ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was present in this fraction as compared with the cell homogenate (Table II).Table IIADP-ribosyl cyclase activities in cellular fractions from pancreatic acinar cellsSubcellular fractionADP-ribosyl cyclase activityRelative ADP-ribosyl cyclase activitynmol/mg protein/min% of homogenateHomogenate0.76 ± 0.09100Mitochondria1.12 ± 0.1121.2 ± 2.6Plasma membranes0.82 ± 0.1012.8 ± 1.9Crude membranes0.51 ± 0.1015.7 ± 5.2Cytosol0.20 ± 0.0626.4 ± 4.8Zymogen granules0.06 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.4Zymogen granular membranes0.03 ± 0.01<0.1 Open table in a new tab The total ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in pancreatic homogenate from one animal resulted in 35.5 ± 4.4 nmol (equal to 100%; 12 preparations) of cADPr production/min. Total ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity located in the cytosol is comparable with that in other fractions (Table II). Enzyme activity in the zymogen granules and their membranes can be neglected (Table II). This indicates that a significant part of total enzymatic activity is present in the cytosol to allow for substantial and rapid cADPr production following hormonal stimulation. It is known that pancreatic acinar cells express the ectoenzyme CD38, which combines ADP-ribosyl cyclase, cADPr-hydrolase, and NAD-hydrolase activities (18Fukushi Y. Kato I. Takasawa S. Sasaki T. Ong B.H. Sato M. Ohsaga A. Sato K. Shirato K. Okamoto H. Maruyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the antibody specific for human CD38 recognized a protein with the expected molecular mass of CD38 (42 kDa) in the plasma membrane fraction, the crude membranes, and mitochondrial fractions. Furthermore, a weak signal was present in zymogen granules. However, in zymogen granular membranes as well as in the cytosolic fraction, CD38 was not detected, even if the amount of protein applied to the SDS-gel was increased 10-fold (data not shown). To further prove the absence of CD38 from the cytosol, we concentrated and purified CD38 by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the anti-CD38 antibody AT-1 precipitated a 42-kDa protein only from the membranes and not from the cytosolic fraction. Since measurement of enzymatic activities might be more sensitive than Western blot analysis, we measured the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in both the precipitate and the supernatant of the first washing step. The precipitate from the membranes showed an ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of 25 ± 5.6% of total activity (Fig. 4B), whereas 57 ± 8.9% remained in the supernatant. For the cytosol, 95 ± 7.9% remained in the supernatant, and no ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was detected in the precipitate (Fig. 4B). This confirms the Western blot data (Fig. 3) and suggests that the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity found in the cytosol is different from CD38. Furthermore, the AT-1 antibody (5 μg/ml) partially inhibited ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in the membranes but failed to alter the cytosolic ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity (Fig. 4B). Heat inactivation (15 min, 80 °C) resulted in a complete loss of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity (Fig. 4B), indicating that cADPr was indeed produced by enzymatic activity. All together, we provide evidence that CD38 is the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity found in plasma membranes and mitochondria, whereas the cytosolic ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity is an enzyme immunologically different from CD38. Ectocellular ADP-ribosyl Cyclase in Pancreatic Acinar Cells—To test whether ecto-CD38 might be hormonally regulated, ϵ-NAD+ (100 μm) was added to intact cells, and its conversion to ϵ-cADPr was measured following the addition of ACh (0.1–10 μm), CCK (0.1–10 nm), or bombesin (1–10 nm). Neither of these hormones changed ecto-CD38 activity obtained by a quick step fractionation procedure from these stimulated cells (Fig. 5A). We therefore conclude that ecto-CD38 activity is not involved in hormonally regulated cADPr production.

The protein 4.1 binding site of hDlg is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon termed I3 (8Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 17Marfatia S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that alternative splicing creates hDlg isoforms with distinct functional properties. Although previous attempts have been made to elucidate the contribution of protein 4.1 binding to the membrane targeting of hDlg/SAP97 in epithelial cells, the role of the I3 insert remains controversial. Lue et al. (18Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a second protein 4.1 binding site within the PDZ1 and -2 domains, and both the I3 insert and the PDZ1-PDZ2 module were found to be sufficient for lateral membrane targeting of hDlg in permeabilized epithelial cells. However, using transient transfection of truncated cDNA constructs, Wu et al. (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N-terminal 1–65 amino acid segment of SAP97 contains the membrane-targeting signal and that the PDZ domains and the I3 insert are neither necessary nor sufficient for membrane targeting. It was later discovered that the N-terminal domain of hDlg/SAP97, named the MRE (MAGUK recruitment) domain, binds to the L27 (Lin-2 Lin-7) domain (20Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of CASK, and this interaction mediates the membrane targeting of hDlg/SAP97 in epithelial cells (21Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The MRE domain of hDlg/SAP97 also binds to DLG2 and DLG3, two MAGUK proteins closely related to CASK, in their conserved L27 domains (22Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MRE domains are found in the splice variants of Drosophila Dlg (23Mendoza C. Olguin P. Lafferte G. Thomas U. Ebitsch S. Gundelfinger E.D. Kukuljan M. Sierralta J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the mammalian PSD-95 (24Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.-H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in a non-MAGUK PDZ protein termed the PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ) (25Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.-J. Shin K.Y. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and these domains appear to play a fundamental role in the membrane targeting of scaffolding proteins. In summary, the precise role of the protein 4.1 binding region and HOOK domain in the membrane targeting of MAGUKs remains uncertain. Another controversial issue pertains to the nuclear localization of hDlg. MAGUK proteins including CASK (26Hsueh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Yang F.-C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and ZO-1 (27Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) are known to translocate to the nucleus and contribute to the transcriptional regulation of specific genes. In the case of hDlg, it has been shown that the truncated constructs of hDlg/SAP97 spanning the SH3-HOOK-GUK domains tend to accumulate in the nuclei of transfected cells (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kohu K. Ogawa F. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, the cluster of basic amino acid residues present in the I3 insert is believed to function as a nuclear localization signal (28Kohu K. Ogawa F. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to this observation, the immunocytochemistry studies using I2- and I3-specific antibodies detected I2 insert-specific antigen in the nucleus and I3 insert-specific antigen in the plasma membrane, thus implicating the I2 insert in the nuclear targeting function (11McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we have expressed two naturally occurring isoforms of hDlg as full-length polypeptides to elucidate the function of I2 and I3 inserts in vitro and in vivo. Under our experimental conditions, we did not observe any significant nuclear localization of either I2- or I3-containing isoforms of hDlg. Our data also indicate that the I3 insert is the sole protein 4.1 binding site within hDlg, and in addition to the MRE domain, the I3 insert is also sufficient for recruiting the full-length hDlg to the lateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. These results implicate a fundamental role of the conserved HOOK domain of MAGUKs in mediating direct binding to the FERM domain of protein 4.1, thus regulating the membrane-targeting properties of the scaffolding complex in epithelial cells. Generation of Expression Constructs and Production of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length hDlg cDNA clone hDlg-I2 contains I1A-I1B-I2-I5, and the hDlg-I3 construct contains I1A-I1B-I3-I5 inserts. Both hDlg-I2 and -I3 clones carry KpnI and SpeI adapters in their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (8Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), making them identical except for the I2 and I3 inserts. The GST-hDlg-I2 and -I3 constructs were produced by cloning the respective cDNAs into a modified pGEX2T vector (17Marfatia S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at KpnI and SpeI sites. The N-terminal half of DLG2 (1–221), which contains two L27 domains and a PDZ domain, was PCR-amplified from mouse DLG2 cDNA clone (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF162685) with EcoRI adapters on both ends and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX2T plasmid. To generate the GFP-hDlg-I2 and -I3 constructs, the respective inserts were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) using KpnI and XbaI sites of the vector. The FERM domain of human protein 4.1R, which starts from the second ATG (nucleotide 801) in exon 4 to phenylalanine in exon 12 (nucleotide 1694), was PCR-amplified from the protein 4.1 cDNA (29Baklouti F. Huang S.-C. Vulliamy T.J. Delaunay J. Benz Jr., E.J. Genomics. 1997; 39: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and cloned into pCITE-2a (Novagen) using EcoRI and NotI adapters. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The double mutation (I38A/I40A) in the GFP-full-length hDlg constructs was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers used were 5′-GTTCCATAGAACGGGTTGCTAACGCATTTCAGAGCAACCTC (sense) and 5′-GAGGTTGCTCTGAAATGCGTTAGCAACCCGTTCTATGGAAC (antisense). In Vitro Protein 4.1 Binding Assay—The FERM domain of human protein 4.1R was expressed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription and translation system STP3 (Novagen) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Binding of radiolabeled FERM domain to the GST fusion proteins was assessed by GST pulldown assay. After the completion of protein synthesis, lysate was diluted 10-fold in the binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100), and the respective GST fusion proteins were added to each tube followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed, and bound radiolabeled protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained by Coomassie Blue and exposed to x-ray film for fluorography at –70 °C. DNA Transfection and Fluorescence Microscopy—MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunofluorescence analysis of subconfluent MDCK cells, the MDCK cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day before transfection to attain a density of ∼40% at the time of transfection. Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the GFP signal was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. All the GFP-positive cells were counted and classified as M (membrane), C (cytosol), or M/C (membrane and cytosol) to distinguish the localization of GFP-hDlg protein in transfected cells. Reported data were collected from two independent experiments. For analysis of confluent polarized MDCK cells, stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the GFP-hDlg proteins were generated. After the transfection, the cells were selected by treating with 0.6 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for more than 2 weeks. After the transfected cells reached confluency and polarized morphology, they were fixed and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Each experiment was repeated three times with identical results. GST Pulldown Assay—COS-7 cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and transiently transfected with respective GFP-hDlg expression plasmids. Cell lysates were prepared 30 h after transfection using the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The GST-DLG2 (1–221) or control GST protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed, and bound proteins were processed for Western blotting using our anti-hDlg monoclonal antibody (2D11). The I3 Insertion of hDlg Contains the Sole Binding Site for Protein 4.1R—To assess the functional diversity of hDlg isoforms, we produced expression constructs of two naturally occurring full-length hDlg isoforms termed hDlg-I2 and -I3 (Fig. 1A). Other than the alternatively spliced exon encoding I2 and I3 insertions in the HOOK region, these two constructs have identical domain composition and amino acid sequence. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of the I2 and I3 inserts in the context of full-length hDlg polypeptides. Both hDlg isoforms were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and used for in vitro protein 4.1 binding using a GST pulldown assay. The 35S-labeled FERM domain of protein 4.1R, which was expressed using the rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription-translation system, bound specifically to the GST-hDlg-I3 beads but not to the GST-hDlg-I2 or control GST beads (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with our previous finding that the I3 insert is the only protein 4.1 binding site in hDlg (17Marfatia S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, our results do not support the presence of the second high affinity protein 4.1 binding site located within the PDZ1-PDZ2 conformational unit as suggested previously (18Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). I3 Insertion Mediates Membrane Targeting of hDlg in Subconfluent Epithelial Cells—Next we examined whether the isoform-specific binding of hDlg to protein 4.1 affects the subcellular localization of hDlg in epithelial cells. Protein 4.1R concentrates at the lateral membrane of epithelial cells (30Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.-C. Hartenstein J.S. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30573-30585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), where the endogenous hDlg is also found (8Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, by virtue of its binding to protein 4.1R, the I3 insertion may provide a mechanism for the localization and stabilization of hDlg at the lateral plasma membrane. We transiently transfected GFP-fused hDlg-I2 and -I3 constructs in subconfluent MDCK cells, and GFP signal was observed by fluorescent microscopy after 24 h when cells were still subconfluent and did not display polarized morphology. The expression of the right size hDlg fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis in separate experiments (data not shown). We found that the GFP-hDlg-I2 isoform distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm with no protein accumulation detectable at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the GFP-hDlg-I3 protein accumulated significantly at the plasma membrane of cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 2B). We introduced a semiquantitative criterion to evaluate the efficiency of hDlg localization in transiently transfected MDCK cells. We counted transfected cells that showed either an exclusive membrane localization (designated as M) or cytoplasmic localization along with significant concentration of the signal at the plasma membrane (designated as M/C), or exclusive localization in the cytoplasm without any membrane signal (designated as C). For example, the I2- and I3-expressing cells shown in Fig. 2, A and B, are classified as C and M/C, respectively. The GFP signal was visualized 24 h after transfection of MDCK cells under subconfluent culture conditions. The results show that the GFP-hDlg-I3 isoform is located predominantly at the plasma membrane with some signal detectable in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the GFP-hDlg-I2 isoform is found mostly in the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that the I3 insertion plays an important role in mediating the targeting of hDlg to the plasma membrane during the formation of initial cell-cell contact sites by non-polarized epithelial cells. It is noteworthy here that the cytoplasmic GFP-hDlg-I2 isoform partially migrates to the plasma membrane when transiently transfected MDCK cells are examined after 48 h post-transfection under conditions where the epithelial cells presumably begin to form mature cell-cell contact sites (data not shown). Two Distinct Domains Are Responsible for Membrane Targeting of hDlg in Confluent MDCK Cells—To determine the subcellular localization of hDlg isoforms in MDCK cells under confluent culture conditions, we generated stable cell lines by selecting transfected cells using G418. When transfected cells became confluent and displayed polarized morphology, they were fixed, and the GFP signal was recorded. Under these conditions, both I2 and I3 isoforms of hDlg localized efficiently to the lateral membrane (Fig. 3, A and B). This result suggests that an I3-independent targeting mechanism exists that mediates membrane targeting of hDlg in confluent MDCK cells and is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the N-terminal MRE domain recruits hDlg/SAP97 to the plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies, it was recently shown that the I2 isoform-specific antibodies detected hDlg in the nucleus, whereas the I3 isoform-specific antibodies detected the signal at the lateral plasma membrane (11McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Occasionally, we have also observed the presence of hDlg isoforms in the nucleus (note the presence of GFP-hDlg-I3 in one of the transfected cells shown in Fig. 2B). However, the nuclear localization of hDlg was not isoform-specific under our experimental conditions. We therefore speculated that there might be an unidentified mechanism that specifically regulates the nuclear localization of hDlg protein in epithelial cells. While searching for potential nuclear targeting and/or nuclear export motifs in the hDlg coding sequence, we noticed a sequence, LRSSI-ERVINI 40, which matches with the nuclear export signal (NES) consensus L X 2–3 L X 2–3 L X L, where L can also be either Val or Ile (Fig. 3E) (31Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 32Gaubatz S. Lees J.A. Lindeman G.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this putative NES motif is located within the N-terminal MRE domain of hDlg/SAP97 that is reported to mediate the membrane targeting of hDlg/SAP97 in polarized epithelial cells (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this putative NES motif regulates the nuclear localization cycle of hDlg, and therefore its disruption might result in the accumulation of hDlg inside the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we mutated two of the conserved isoleucines within the NES-like motif of hDlg to alanines (I38A/I40A), a design consistent with the published mutagenesis approach that disrupts the NES activity in other proteins (32Gaubatz S. Lees J.A. Lindeman G.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The mutant hDlg isoforms were then tested for their localization in confluent MDCK cells. Contrary to our expectations, the I2 and I3 isoforms of hDlg carrying the double I38A/I40A mutation did not accumulate inside the nucleus (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, however, the I2 isoform with the NES mutation almost completely lost its ability to localize to the lateral membrane and distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). Although the precise relationship between the cytoplasmic localization of hDlg and the function of its putative NES sequence is not yet clear, it is conceivable that the double mutation I38A/I40A unexpectedly disrupted a key protein-protein interaction(s). Indeed, the N-terminal MRE domain of hDlg is known to interact with the CASK family of MAGUKs, and this interaction is necessary for targeting of hDlg to the lateral membrane (21Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Importantly, the I3 isoform of hDlg with the I38A/I40A mutation localized efficiently to the lateral membrane of MDCK cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the I3 insertion is sufficient for membrane targeting in the absence of a functional N-terminal MRE domain. Together, our results indicate that the I3 insertion alone can mediate the membrane targeting of full-length hDlg in confluent epithelial cells. Double Mutation I38A/I40A of hDlg Disrupts Its Interaction with DLG2—To test whether the combined I38A/I40A mutation interferes with functional protein-protein interaction(s) of the MRE domain, we examined whether the I38A/I40A mutation of hDlg disrupts its interaction with the CASK family of proteins. The L27 domain is a conserved feature of the CASK subfamily of the MAGUKs, including the DLG2 and -3, which are known to interact with hDlg/SAP97 via a similar mechanism (Fig. 4A) (22Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment of human DLG2 (amino acids 1–221) containing two L27 domains and a PDZ domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 4B), and its interaction with hDlg was measured by a GST pulldown assay. Consistent with a previous report (22Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the DLG2 specifically interacted with GFP-hDlg-I2 expressed in the COS-7 cells (Fig. 4C, upper panel). In contrast, the GFP-hDlg-I2 (I38A/I40A) mutant protein did not bind to DLG2 (Fig. 4C, upper panel). An identical result was obtained with the GFP-hDlg-I3 (I38A/I40A) mutant protein (Fig. 4C, lower panel). Together, these results demonstrate that the combined I38A/I40A mutation introduced in the N terminus of hDlg completely abrogates its interaction with the CASK family of MAGUKs. This fortuitous finding begins to offer a molecular framework for the membrane targeting of hDlg in polarized epithelial cells and underscores the importance of the I3 insertion as an alternate membrane-targeting motif that functions independently of the N-terminal domain of hDlg in polarized epithelia. The data presented in this manuscript provide evidence for the following. (1) Alternatively spliced I3 insert in the HOOK region is the sole protein 4.1 binding site in hDlg; (2) the I3 insert mediates recruitment of hDlg to the plasma membrane at an early stage of cell-cell contact formation in subconfluent epithelial cells; and (3) the I3 insert is sufficient to recruit hDlg to the lateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells by a mechanism that is independent of the membrane-targeting function of the N-terminal MRE domain. These results are summarized in Fig. 5. Alternative splicing produces the I2 and I3 hDlg isoforms that are believed to encode distinct functions. At the initial stage of cell contact formation, only the I3 isoform is recruited to the membrane, presumably via its interaction with protein 4.1R. At the later stages when epithelial cells become polarized and form mature junctional structures, both isoforms of hDlg are recruited to the lateral membrane via an interaction with their N-terminal MRE domain to CASK or related family members. The I3 insert alone is also sufficient to recruit hDlg to the lateral membrane, and this additional binding site might contribute to the formation of a higher order scaffolding complex in the mature cell junctions. It is relevant to emphasize here that our experiments utilized the full-length naturally occurring isoforms of hDlg, which is in contrast to the use of truncated constructs or individual domains used by others to assess their subcellular distribution in epithelial cells (18Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAGUK proteins are multidomain proteins and participate in various intramolecular domain interactions that contribute to the protein stability and regulate their function as effective scaffolding molecules (35McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the truncation of any domain could unexpectedly disrupt one of these intramolecular interactions and lead to an artifactual mislocalization of the expressed protein in heterologous cells. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the targeting of Drosophila Dlg to the synaptic membrane involves a stepwise contribution of various domains in a sequential manner (37Thomas U. Ebitsch S. Gorczyca M. Koh Y.H. Hough C.D. Woods D. Gundelfinger E.D. Budnik V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1108-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Guided by these observations, it is perhaps more prudent to utilize full-length hDlg polypeptides that are capable of participating in all protein-protein interactions at various stages of intracellular transport and targeting processes. Indeed, our recent demonstration of a direct interaction between GAKIN (guanylate kinase domain-associated kinesin) and the GUK domain of hDlg (38Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 39Asaba N. Hanada T. Takeuchi A. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8395-8400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) further underscores the importance of the full-length protein in the intracellular transport of hDlg and its associated partners to correct cellular destinations in mammalian cells. A previous study has shown that the truncated constructs spanning the C-terminal segment of hDlg/SAP97 tend to accumulate in the nuclear compartment (19Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we initially surmised that the N terminus of hDlg might contain a functional NES motif that prevents the accumulation of full-length hDlg in the nucleus. In fact, the presence of a functional NES motif in the N terminus of hDlg would be akin to the case of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein, where the nuclear localization is dynamically regulated by the CRM1-dependent nuclear export system utilizing the NES motifs (33Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, the disruption of the putative NES motif in the N terminus of hDlg did not result in the accumulation of hDlg mutants in the nucleus. One possible explanation of our observation is that the NES-like motif in hDlg does not function as an active nuclear export signal under these experimental conditions.

Therefore, the authenticity of the nuclear localization signal and the possible function of hDlg in the nucleus remain a topic of future investigation. Our results confirm the importance of the N-terminal MRE domain for membrane targeting of hDlg in polarized epithelial cells (21Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this targeting is known to be mediated through its binding to the CASK or other related MAGUKs such as DLG2 (22Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An unexpected finding, however, was our observation that the combined mutation I38A/I40A of hDlg disrupted the DLG2 binding and the MRE domain-dependent membrane targeting of hDlg in epithelial cells. Similar point mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues in the L27 domains are known to disrupt specific protein-protein interactions (22Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol.

The mutant hDlg constructs used in our study are likely to serve as useful experimental tools for elucidating the mode of interactions between the MRE domain and its binding partners and providing a biochemical rationale for future structural studies of this conserved protein domain. In addition, the N-terminal segment of hDlg is known to self-associate into homo-oligomers (41Marfatia S.M. Byron O. Campbell G. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

The availability of full-length hDlg constructs carrying a combined mutation in the N-terminal MRE domain would permit testing of the role of this domain in a myriad of hDlg functions. A notable feature among p55, CASK, and the I3 sequence of hDlg is the conserved cluster of basic amino acid residues (13Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of the FERM domain of protein 4.1R did not reveal any specific pocket of acidic residues within the binding interface of p55 (44Han B.-G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the VAM1/Pals2 protein displays a similar patch of basic residues in the HOOK domain but failed to interact with protein 4.1R in vitro (45Tseng T.-C. Marfatia S.M. Bryant P.J. Pack S. Zhuang Z. O'Brien J.E. Lin L. Hanada T. Chishti A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clearly, more studies are needed to define the precise residues within the HOOK domain that mediate its binding to the FERM domain of protein 4.1R and govern the specificity of binding between various HOOK and FERM domains. In conclusion, our results suggest an important function of the protein 4.1R binding domain in the membrane-targeting events likely to be widely conserved among various MAGUKs. We are grateful to Drs. S.-C. Huang and E. J. Benz, Jr., of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of Boston for sharing the human protein 4.1R cDNA clone."

Mutations in CBF genes are found in leukemias, bone disorders, and gastric cancer. CBFs consist of a DNA-binding CBFα subunit and a non-DNA-binding CBFβ subunit. DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFβ are mediated by the Runt domain in CBFα. Here we report an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the Runt domain that targeted amino acids identified by structural studies to reside at the DNA or CBFβ interface, as well as amino acids mutated in human disease. We determined the energy contributed by each of the DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain to DNA binding both in the absence and presence of CBFβ. We propose mechanisms by which mutations in the Runt domain found in hematopoietic and bone disorders affect its affinity for DNA.

However, no studies have yet systematically determined the energetic contribution of each of the amino acid side chains to DNA binding. Here we report an extensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the Runt domain, targeting those amino acids near the DNA binding interface as well as amino acids mutated in disease. We also measured the energetic contributions of 10 DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain to DNA binding, in the absence and presence of CBFβ. We confirmed that all 10 residues contribute to DNA binding energetically. Among them, we found that amino acid Arg-174, the residue most frequently mutated in AML M0, FPD/AML, and CCD, contributes the greatest binding energy to the interaction with DNA. We confirmed that the Runt domain is very sensitive to amino acid substitutions, and our mutagenesis study provides a rationale for how mutations in the Runt domain affect DNA binding. Overall, the data reported here lend support to and further refine the Runt domain structure determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Site-directed Mutagenesis—We PCR-amplified a fragment encoding the open reading frame of murine Runx1 (amino acids 41–214) using the forward primer 5′-ATC GAATTCCATATG GCC AGC AAG CTG AGG AGC GGC GAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGC CGGATCCTA GTG CGG GCT GAC CCT-3′. We added EcoRI and NdeI restriction sites (underlined) to the 5′ end of the fragment by the forward primer, and a BamHI site (underlined) to the 3′ end by the reverse primer. We then subcloned the PCR-amplified fragment into the pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene) between its EcoRI and BamHI sites. Site-directed alanine replacement mutagenesis (if the amino acid was alanine it was changed to glycine) was performed on this plasmid using the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocols. Yeast One-hybrid and Two-hybrid Assays—We subcloned the mutated Runt domain fragments into the yeast expression vector pGAD424 (Clontech, GAL4 activation domain/LEU2 marker) between the EcoRI and BamHI sites. We transformed the pGAD424 vector containing either the wild type or alanine-substituted Runt domain fragments into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YM4271(HA) or YM4271(MLV) by the lithium acetate/TE protocol of Schiestl and Gietz (52Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Both YM4271(HA) and YM4271(MLV) are derived from YM4271 and contain a lacZ reporter gene under the regulation of three tandem repeats of either a high affinity (HA) Core site (5′-GAATTC(TTTGCGGTTAG)3GTCGAC-3′) or a lower affinity Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) Core site (5′-GAATTC(TCTGTGGTAAG)3GTCGAC-3′) (53Thornell A.

We performed the yeast two-hybrid assay using the same pGAD424 vector containing either the wild type or alanine-substituted Runt domain fragments together with a plasmid based on pGBT9 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain/TRP marker) that contains a cDNA encoding the full-length murine CBFβ protein (55Tang Y.-Y.

Purification of Runt Domain Mutants—We subcloned NdeI-BamHI fragments encoding wild type and mutated Runt domains from either the pBluescript SK+ vector or the pGAD424 vector into the bacterial pET-3c (Novagen) expression vector, and we purified individual 15N-labeled mutant proteins as described previously (44Berardi M.J.

NMR Spectroscopy—All measurements were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded triple resonance probe from Nalorac Corp. We prepared samples of Runt domain and Runt domain-DNA complexes and recorded 15N-1H HSQC spectra at 40 °C as described previously (44Berardi M.J. Sun C. Zehr M. Abildgaard F. Peng J. Speck N.A.

Urea Denaturation Monitored by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—We detected the urea denaturation of the Runt domain by tryptophan fluorescence as described previously (56Crute B.E. Lewis A.F. Wu Z. Bushweller J.H. Speck N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26251-26260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All fluorescence experiments were performed using a protein concentration of 20–40 μm in a total volume of 0.8 ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 μm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). Spectra were recorded in the range of 300–370 nm with an increment of 4 nm and an integration time of 1 s. Two scans were averaged to minimize error, and the background spectrum of the buffer alone was taken first for later subtraction. The samples were excited at a wavelength of 280 nm, and the emission was detected at 340 nm. To follow the denaturation of the Runt domain, individual 0.8-ml solutions of the Runt domain (20–40 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of urea (0–6.0 m), and the samples were equilibrated for 2 h at 4 °C prior to fluorescence measurement. The parameters for the unfolding curves were obtained by nonlinear, least squares fitting using two-state equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) as described previously (57Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W.

We used Origin 5.0 software for non-linear least square fitting. Equilibrium Binding Constant Measurements—We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to measure equilibrium binding constants (K 2 and K 4) of the wild type and alanine-substituted Runt domain proteins and an 18-bp DNA sequence containing the Core site from the SL3-3 murine leukemia virus enhancer (5′-GGATATCTGTGGTTAAGCA-3′) (55Tang Y.-Y.

Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis of the Runt Domain—We performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Runt domain to identify and characterize its DNA-binding and heterodimerization interfaces, and to assess the sensitivity of the Runt domain fold to amino acid substitutions. We chose amino acids to mutate based on five criteria. We first targeted 27 amino acids in the Runt domain that displayed nuclear Overhauser effects between their backbone NH groups and the DNA, because this was the only structural information available to us at the time we began the study (44Berardi M.J.

We also mutated amino acids identified by a chemical shift perturbation analysis of the Runt domain performed in the absence and presence of DNA that similarly examined backbone and side chain NH protons (61Perez-Alvarado G.C. Munnerlyn A. Dyson H.J. Grosschedl R. Wright P.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We mutated DNA-contacting amino acids implicated by the crystal structures of the Runt domain-DNA and the Runt domain-CBFβ-DNA complexes once those structures were available (45Bravo J. Li Z.

Some of the residues implicated by the crystal structures had been identified in the NMR studies, but five (Arg-135, Arg-142, Gly-143, Lys-167, and Arg-174) had not. We made alanine substitutions in all residues thought to reside at the CBFβ interface, as identified by a chemical shift perturbation study (44Berardi M.J. Sun C. Zehr M. Abildgaard F. Peng J.

https://openalex.org/W2049749605,"At least 15 human diseases are caused by the instability of gene-specific (CTG)·(CAG) repeats. The precise mechanism of instability remains unknown, though bacterial and yeast models have suggested a role for aberrant repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using an established primate DSB repair system, we have investigated the fidelity of repair of a DSB within a (CTG)·(CAG) repeat tract. DSB repair substrates were generated from plasmids that are stably replicated in their circular form, permitting us to highlight the effects of DSB repair on repeat stability and minimize the contribution of replication. DSBs were introduced into repeat-containing plasmids using a unique BsmI site, such that the entire repeat tract comprised one free end of the linearized plasmid. Substrates containing 17, 47, and 79 repeats, in either their linear duplex form or containing slipped structures (out-of-register interstrand mispairings at repeat sequences), were transiently transfected into primate cells. Linearized plasmids with repeats were repaired with mildly reduced efficiency, while the presence of slipped structures considerably reduced repair efficiency. The repaired products were characterized for alterations within the repeat tract and flanking sequence. DSB repair induced predominantly repeat deletions. Notably, a polarized/directional deletion effect was observed, in that the repetitive end of the DSB was preferentially removed. This phenomenon was dramatically enhanced when slipped structures were present within the repeat tract, providing the first evidence for error-prone processing of slipped-strand structures. These results suggest the existence of primate nuclease activities that are specific for (CTG)·(CAG) repeats and the structures they form.

D., and Pearson, C. E. (2003) Cytogenet. Genome Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Tracts that are ≥34 can be genetically unstable, and expansions can be as large as 3000 repeats. In affected families there is a common tendency for expansion of the disease allele, although there have been a few DM1 families reported that preferentially transmit repeat contractions to subsequent generations (2Ashizawa T.

Dramatic differences in CTG length variations have been observed in several regions of the brain in DM1, HD, and DRPLA patients when compared with blood of the same patient (1Cleary, J.

While many regions of the cerebral cortex show heterogeneous expansions larger than those observed in blood of the same patient (6Sergeant N. Sablonniere B. Schraen-Maschke S. Ghestem A. Maurage C.A.

Genome Res., in pressGoogle Scholar) patients, suggestive of large somatic contractions in this tissue. The precise mechanism(s) responsible for triplet repeat instability remains to be elucidated. Expansions are dynamic, in that longer repeats tracts are more likely to incur further expansion mutations (1Cleary, J. D., and Pearson, C. E. (2003) Cytogenet. Genome Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). The process of instability is likely to involve DNA slipped/secondary structures (out-of-register interstrand mispairings at repeat sequences). One hypothesis predicts that expansion events arise from errors at DNA replication forks (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Panigrahi G.B. Cleary J.D. Pearson C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13926-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have shown that cis-elements such as the location of replication initiation and fork direction, relative to a repeat tract, can lead to different types and frequencies of repeat instability (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Depending upon the location of replication initiation, (CTG)n·(CAG)n repeat tracts incurred expansions or deletions, or were stably replicated. Repeat instability may be linked to the location of the repeat tract within the single-stranded Okazaki initiation zone of the replication fork. It is possible that the replication fork may become blocked as it passes through the triplet repeat tract (12Samadashwily G.M. Raca G. Mirkin S.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 13Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This blockage may be caused by slipped structures, formed either between the nascent and template strands or between the un-replicated template strands. Elimination of the blockage and subsequent resumption of fork progression may require a double-strand break-mediated recovery mechanism (15Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 16Michel B. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3861-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), which can lead to expansions and/or deletions (18Flores M.J. Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis is that recombination between repeat tracts containing slipped intermediates can yield repeat expansions or deletions as a result of unequal genetic exchange (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Richard G.F. Paques F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). While these and other theories remain plausible, it is apparent that several models involve the presence of a double-strand break (DSB). Mammalian cells are constantly threatened by the occurrence of endogenously or exogenously created DSBs. In human cells, it has been estimated that DSBs arising through the DNA replication process occur at a frequency of ∼10 per cell cycle, and proper repair is essential for genomic stability and cellular survival (15Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Work in bacteria has shown that gene conversion can influence the expansion of CTG·CAG repeats (21Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34087-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments using yeast have indicated that triplet repeat tracts are “fragile,” such that they are susceptible to DSBs, possibly through endonucleolytic cleavage of secondary structures (22Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Jankowski C. Nasar F. Nag D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2134-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The formation of DSBs within or proximal to the repeats is length-dependent. It has been suggested that subsequent repair of the break can lead to instability of the repeat tract, in some cases yielding large deletions of the repeat and flanking sequences (22Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Jankowski C. Nasar F. Nag D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The use of a donor sequence containing (CAG)98 to repair a DSB lead to integration and expansion of the triplet repeat tract (25Richard G.F. Goellner G.M. McMurray C.T. Haber J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, in that study, the initial DSB substrate did not harbor any (CTG)·(CAG) repeats. Thus, what remains to be addressed is the influence and fidelity of DSB repair within a repeat tract upon tract stability. It is also important to determine the effects of both repeat tract length and the presence of alternative DNA structures on the fidelity of DSB repair. Furthermore, it is of interest to utilize primate cells, as yeast and mammalian cells are known to preferentially use homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), respectively (26Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). The differences between these two DSB repair mechanisms may therefore result in distinct repair products. In this study, we have used an established primate DSB repair system (27Runger T.M. Kraemer K.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to investigate the fidelity of repair of a DSB within a (CTG)·(CAG) repeat tract. Following repair of the DSB substrates in primate cells, products were characterized for sequence alterations within the repeat tract length and the flanking sequence. The presence of a DSB within the repeat tract lead to several forms of deletion events, removing either exclusively repeats, non-repetitive flanking sequences, or both. The repeat-containing end of the DSB was preferentially deleted, relative to the non-repetitive end. The presence of intrastrand slipped structures within the repeat tract enhanced this “polarized” deletion effect. Construction of DSB Repair Templates—The (CTG)·(CAG) DSB repair templates were made from a series of (CTG)n clones harboring either 79, 47, or 17 repeats as well as the SV40-ori (Fig. 1A). In their circular form these plasmids have been shown to be stably replicated by primate and bacterial proteins (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), thereby enabling us to highlight the contribution of DSB repair to repeat instability. These clones (pDM79ED, pDM47ED, and pDM17ED; the “ED” has been omitted throughout the text) have been described previously (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, templates contained uninterrupted (CTG)n·(CAG)n derived from the DM1 locus (sites 417–436 and 451–494 from GenBank™ accession number S86455). All clones had the repeat in the stable orientation relative to the uni-directional bacterial ColE1 origin of replication (CAG strand as lagging strand template). The SV40 viral replication origin (viral positions 128 and 5171), which contains the SV40 origin of bi-directional replication (OBR, viral position 5210/5211), is located 229 nt 5′ of the CTG tract, permitting stable replication by primate cell proteins (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Large scale plasmid preparations were prepared from dam+ Escherichia coli cells as previously described (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed with lysozyme (Invitrogen) and a detergent solution of 1% Brij 58 (Sigma) and 0.4% deoxycholate (Sigma). Plasmids were treated with RNase A and T1 (Sigma), phenol-extracted, and purified twice by cesium chloride/ethidium bromide centrifugation. Template Linearization—The linearization of (CTG)n-containing plasmids was performed by BsmI restriction digestion (New England Biolabs). The completion of linearization was verified through visualization on a 1% agarose gel, where only a single band (linearized DNA) was observed. Linearized templates were also transformed into E. coli cells and yielded no colonies, confirming the poor ability of E. coli to rescue (re-circularize) linear plasmids (28Conley E.C. Saunders V.A. Jackson V. Saunders J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8919-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Heteroduplexing/Reduplexing—The induction of slipped structures in the repeats was performed as described previously (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Pearson C.E. Ewel A. Acharya S. Fishel R.A. Sinden R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For reduplexing (S-DNA), only the pDM79 plasmid was treated (5 μg), and for heteroduplexing (SI-DNA), equal quantities of pDM47 and pDM79 were mixed (2.5 μg each). Briefly, the DNAs were denatured for 5 min in denaturing solution (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 13), diluted 50-fold in modified 5× TE (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.2755 m NaCl), and renatured at 68 °C for 3 h. The relative amounts of DNA containing slipped structures were determined by densitometric analysis of electrophoretic patterns of radiolabeled repeat-containing DNAs (Fig. 1C). Cell Culture/Transfections—COS1 cells, which express SV40 T-antigen (T-Ag) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were plated to a confluency of 20% in 100-mm dishes, 1 day prior to transfection. The following day, cells at 40% confluency were incubated according to the manufacturers protocol (Stratagene) with 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA and 50 μl of Lipotaxi transfection reagent in 4 ml of DMEM lacking FBS. The amount of DNA used per cell was such that any given cell was transfected with only one plasmid. After4hof incubation, 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS was added. The medium was replaced with fresh DMEM (10% FBS) following 24 h of incubation. Episomal DNAs were then extracted 48 h after the addition of DNA, as described (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.6% SDS. DNA was purified with multiple phenol/chloroform extractions, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA). Measuring Efficiency of DSB Repair—Intersubstrate DSB repair efficiencies (Fig. 2) were determined as follows. The linear repeat-containing repair templates pDM79, pDM79-S-DNA, and pDM47×79-SI-DNA (linearized with BsmI) were each mixed with the control SV40-ori plasmid (pJM1), which is void of repeats, and these mixtures were co-transfected into COS1 cells. Following DSB repair and replication, purified products were linearized with XhoI, and unrepaired material eliminated by DpnI digestion. Products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel to resolve the pDM and pJM1 repair products, and Southern blotted using a 32P-labeled SV40-ori probe. The relative amounts of pre-transfection starting mixtures and repaired material were determined by densitometric analysis. The efficiency of DSB repair was determined by the relative differences in the amounts of repeat-containing plasmids compared with control plasmid. The repeat-containing plasmids replicated with equal efficiency to the control pJM1 plasmid. Analysis of Stability/STRIP Assay—Repeat stability was assessed using the Stability of Trinucleotide Repeats by Individual Product analysis (STRIP assay). This assay has been described in detail (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Panigrahi G.B. Cleary J.D. Pearson C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13926-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, DSB repair products in the Hirts lysate were digested with 10 units of DpnI (New England Biolabs) to eliminate unrepaired and unreplicated parental templates. DpnI-digested material was transformed into DH5α-mcr E. coli, and only the DpnI-resistant material gave rise to colonies. Individual bacterial colonies, each representing an individual product of primate DSB repair and replication, were picked and cultured. Primate replication-mediated instability was minimized as the starting templates are stably replicated (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Bacterial contribution to repeat length alterations was minimized by: 1) having the (CTG)·(CAG) repeat in the stable orientation relative to the bacterial ColE1 replication origin, 2) the limited colony growth time (≤6 h), and 3) bacterial strain selection. Through the use of these strict specifications, 255 CTG repeats can be stably maintained in bacteria (31Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Miniprep DNA was analyzed for repeat instability through analysis of the migration pattern of BamHI/HindIII fragments on high resolution 4% polyacrylamide gels (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The magnitude of repeat length changes were ascertained by electrophoretic sizing of the repeat-containing fragments relative to starting length material and a size marker. All expansions and samples of each deletion type were confirmed through sequence analysis. Double-strand Break Assay and Substrates—To test whether the repair of DSBs within trinucleotide repeat tracts affected repeat stability in primate cells, we used a plasmid recovery system based on SV40-mediated DNA replication. This is essentially a modification of a previously described assay for the fidelity of DNA ligation and DSB repair (27Runger T.M. Kraemer K.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Linear SV40 templates are incapable of DNA replication, and only those templates that are re-circularized by DSB repair are capable of primate cell-mediated replication. As a result, DNA replication can be used as an indicator of DSB repair. To highlight the effects of DSB repair on repeat stability, we used as DSB repair substrates linearized plasmids (pDM79ED, pDM47ED, and pDM17ED), which we have previously shown to be stably replicated in their circular form by primate and bacterial proteins (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As a result, the DSB-repaired (re-circularized) DNAs would be stably replicated and any repeat alterations would have been incurred predominantly through erroneous DSB repair. Therefore, in using linearized pDM substrates containing 17, 47, and 79 repeat units (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as pDM17, pDM47, and pDM79, respectively, we were able to emphasize the effects of DSB repair on repeat stability by minimizing the effects of primate and bacterial replication. The analysis of repeat stability is described in a later section, titled STRIP Assay. DSBs were produced by linearizing the pDM plasmids with the class II-S restriction endonuclease BsmI. The unique cleavage site for this enzyme is located in the first CTG unit of the repeat tract (Fig. 1A) as shown in Sequence I, thereby causing the complete repeat tract to comprise one free end of the linearized plasmid (Fig. 1B). In order to be “rescued,” there were limitations to the deletion sizes that could be tolerated by the DSB templates without jeopardizing their ability to replicate in either primate or bacterial cells (Fig. 1B). Linearized pDM47 and pDM79 plasmids were also denatured and renatured under conditions that induce the formation of slipped structures within the repeat tract (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Pearson C.E. Ewel A. Acharya S. Fishel R.A. Sinden R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Slipped homoduplexes (S-DNA), containing the same number of repeats on each strand, and slipped intermediate heteroduplexes (SI-DNA), containing a different number of repeats on each strand, have been characterized (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Pearson C.E. Ewel A. Acharya S. Fishel R.A. Sinden R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The amount of slipped structures formed was determined by densitometric analysis of the electrophoretic pattern of radiolabeled repeat-containing DNAs (Fig. 1C). S-DNAs alone amounted to 70% of the repeat-containing fragments (middle lane). Together, the amount of sister SI-DNAs, containing an excess of CTG or CAG repeats, represented 50% of the repeat-containing fragments (right lanes). The visualization of each product within the heteroduplex mixture was facilitated by uniquely radiolabeling either the (CTG)47 or the (CTG)79 strands, indicated by an asterisk. These relative amounts are consistent with our previous studies (19Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Pearson C.E. Ewel A. Acharya S. Fishel R.A. Sinden R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Double-strand Break Repair Efficiency—To determine potential differences in DSB repair efficiency, which may be caused by the presence of (CTG)·(CAG) repeats or slipped structures, the degree of repair of repeat-containing substrates was compared with that yielded by an identical linear plasmid lacking a repeat tract (pJM1). Repeat-containing substrates and the control plasmid were mixed at equimolar concentrations (Fig. 2, “starting material”), co-transfected and repaired/replicated material was isolated 48 h later. DNA from the starting plasmid mixtures was electrophoresed along with the repaired material, and relative concentrations determined through densitometric analysis (Fig. 2). It was found that the pDM79 substrate, with the repeats in their linear, Watson-Crick form, was repaired with 91% percent efficiency relative to the non-repetitive control plasmid (pJM1). The presence of homoduplex SDNA structures decreased the DSB repair efficiency, with the pDM79-S-DNA substrate being repaired at 76% efficiency relative to pJM1, and 83% relative to the linear form of the repeats. The pDM47×79-SI-DNA substrate was repaired at 71% efficiency relative to pJM1, and 78% efficiency relative to the linear form of the repeats. The differences observed are due to variable efficiencies of DSB repair, as the presence of repeats does not affect the efficiency of replication (data not shown). These values suggest that the presence of both the repeat sequence and slipped DNA structures reduced the efficiency of DSB repair. The STRIP Assay—To address the effect of DSB repair on (CTG)·(CAG) repeat instability, we modified an assay we have developed to determine the role of primate DNA replication on the STRIP assay (10Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Wang Y.H. Pearson C.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Following enzyme-induced linearization, repeat-containing plasmids were transfected into COS1 cells, and the DSB-repaired (re-circularized) products were recovered as replicated DNAs using Hirts lysis and DpnI digestion. To reduce contributions to DSB repair by homologous recombination, the transfections were performed such that any cell contained a single plasmid (“Experimental Procedures”). The DpnI-resistant material was transformed into bacterial cells to generate individual colonies, each derived from a single product of DSB repair. Plasmids of each colony were analyzed for repeat length alterations by restriction digestion and visualization on polyacrylamide gels. Classification of Repeat Instabilities—As a means of determining repeat stability, the plasmids isolated from individual colonies were digested with BamHI and HindIII to release both the repeat tract (BamHI-HindIII) and the SV40-ori (BamHI-BamHI) (Fig. 3A). An assessment of stability was then made through electrophoretic comparison of the BamHI-HindIII and BamHI-BamHI fragments to the starting material. As previously observed, several rescued plasmids contained insertions of either genomic or plasmid DNA (27Runger T.M. Kraemer K.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and yielded aberrant restriction digestion patterns. The occurrence of these recombinants did not correlate with either repeat tract length or the presence of slipped structures (data not shown). As in previous studies, these recombinants were not considered for our results. In general, rescued recombinant plasmids could be broadly classified as having sustained deletions or expansions of repeats. Yet due to the location of the DSB at the extreme 5′-end of the repeat, deletion events could potentially remove flanking regions as well, and therefore a more elaborate classification system was established (Fig. 3A). Repeat Expansions—Rescued plasmids that had experienced no sequence alterations were termed “stable” (Fig. 3, A–i) and displayed BamHI-HindIII and BamHI-BamHI restriction fragments, containing the CTG repeat and the SV40-ori, respectively, that co-migrated with"

Here we demonstrate that Gβγ interaction with tubulin down-regulates this signaling pathway. Purified Gβγ, alone or with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), inhibited carbachol-evoked membrane recruitment of tubulin and Gαq transactivation by tubulin. Polymerization of microtubules elicited by Gβγ overrode tubulin translocation to the membrane in response to carbachol stimulation. Gβγ sequestration of tubulin reduced the inhibition of PLCβ1 observed at high tubulin concentration. Gβ1γ2 interacted preferentially with tubulin-GDP, whereas Gαq was transactivated by tubulin-GTP. Prenylation of the γ2 polypeptide was required for Gβγ/tubulin interaction. Both confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed the spatiotemporal pattern of Gβγ/tubulin interaction during carbachol stimulation of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. In resting cells Gβγ localized predominantly at the cell membrane, whereas tubulin was found in well defined microtubules in the cytosol. Within 2 min of agonist exposure, a subset of tubulin translocated to the plasma membrane and colocalized with Gβ. Fifteen min post-carbachol addition, tubulin and Gβ colocalized in vesicle-like structures in the cytosol. Gβ/tubulin colocalization increased after pretreatment of cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent, colchicine, and was inhibited by taxol. Taxol also inhibited carbachol-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. It is suggested that Gβγ/tubulin interaction mediates internalization of membrane-associated tubulin at the offset of PLCβ1 signaling. Newly cytosolic Gβγ/tubulin complexes might promote microtubule polymerization attenuating further tubulin association with the plasma membrane. Thus G protein-coupled receptors might evoke Gα and Gβγ to orchestrate regulation of phospholipase signaling by tubulin dimers and control of cell shape by microtubules.

Binding of agonists to G protein-coupled receptors causes receptors to interact with specific G protein α-βγ heterotrimers, which, in turn, triggers the replacement of GDP for GTP on the α subunit and the functional dissociation and activation of both α and βγ subunits. Gα and Gβγ are then able to activate effectors and initiate signal transduction. Tubulin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms microtubules (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) causes microtubule depolymerization and association of tubulin with plasma membrane proteins in living cells. Upon binding to the plasma membrane tubulin transactivates Gαq, which, in turn, activates PLCβ1 (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, continued accumulation of tubulin at the membrane inhibits PLCβ1 as that tubulin binds to the PLCβ1 substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) (9Popova J.S. Greene A.K. Wang J. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the product of PLCβ1-directed PIP2 hydrolysis, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), mobilizes stored calcium that evokes microtubule depolymerization (11Weisenberg R.C. Science. 1972; 177: 1104-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), feedback inhibition of PLCβ1 may be caused by increased concentration of tubulin dimers in regions close to the plasma membrane (9Popova J.S. Greene A.K. Wang J. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both G protein α and βγ subunits regulate the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton in vitro. Although Gα activates tubulin GTPase and increases microtubule dynamics (12Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Gβγ promotes microtubule polymerization and stabilizes microtubules in vitro (13Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31576-31581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Post-translational isoprenylation of Gγ appears important to this process, because the mutant β1γ2(C68S), which is isoprenylation-deficient, and β1γ1, which is farnesylated, rather than geranylgeranylated, do not support microtubule formation. Although this Gβγ effect on in vitro microtubule assembly has been shown, the potential impact of a tubulin-Gβγ interaction in the cell and its effect on intracellular signaling has not been investigated. Interaction of Gβγ and PIP2 with the G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) assists GRK2 membrane translocation and the subsequent phosphorylation of the activated β-adrenergic receptor (14Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Gβγ might be similarly instrumental in translocation of tubulin to its membrane-associated signaling partners. Regulated interactions of tubulin with either Gα or Gβγ might differentially affect cellular signaling, because these subunits reciprocally regulate tubulin polymerization. By promoting microtubule polymerization in response to a signal, Gβγ might sequester cytosolic tubulin and inhibit tubulin involvement in the regulation of intracellular signaling. This report investigates the interaction of tubulin with Gβγ and the effect of this interaction on the interplay between agonist-evoked PLCβ1 signaling and microtubule assembly. It is suggested that agonist stimulation recruits tubulin to the membrane, where it transactivates Gαq. Subsequent to PLCβ1 activation, tubulin sequesters with Gβγ, and this complex internalizes to the cytosol. In vitro membrane association/microtubule polymerization experiments suggest that such complexes might seed microtubule polymerization. Data from transactivation, coimmunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments in vitro, as well as those from confocal immunofluorescence microscopy or coimmunoprecipitation in cells, indicate a direct functional relationship between G protein-coupled receptor signaling and the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton. This report provides first direct evidence for agonist-evoked and Gβγ-mediated cross-regulation between G protein signaling and the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Such a mechanism could be instrumental in the regulated reorganization of cytoskeletal elements or other cellular rearrangements leading to synapse formation, cell motility, and cell shape. Cell Culture—Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf-900 II SFM media as described previously (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol.

Baculovirus-directed Protein Expression in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were simultaneously infected with baculoviruses bearing m1 muscarinic receptor, Gαq, and/or PLCβ1 cDNA as described previously (7Popova J.S.

The construction of these recombinant baculoviruses was described earlier (15Boguslavsky V. Rebecchi M. Morris A.J. Jhon D.Y. Rhee S.G. McLaughlin S.

Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—Sf9 or SK-N-SH cells were sonicated in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and membrane pellets were prepared as described (7Popova J.S.

Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford dye-binding assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression of receptors, G proteins, and PLCβ1, was determined by immunoblotting. Membrane proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore Corp.) were probed with antisera specific for the m1 muscarinic receptor (#71, from G. Luthin), Gαq/11 (#0945, from D. Manning, Philadelphia, PA), or PLCβ1 (K-32-3, monoclonal, from S. G. Rhee, Bethesda, MD) at a dilution of 1:500. Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs were used as secondary antisera, respectively, followed by ECL detection of the corresponding protein bands. Expression levels were estimated by densitometry of the bands (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences). They varied by no more than 10% for a given recombinant protein. Receptor binding studies using [3H]QNB as a ligand were performed to monitor m1 muscarinic receptor expression (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with Gαq and PLCβ1 in the Sf9 cells, m1 muscarinic receptor density was estimated at 240 fmol/mg of membrane protein (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). SK-N-SH cells have a high density of m3 muscarinic receptors (500 fmol/mg of membrane protein) coupled to phosphoinositide turnover (19Fisher S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 414-422PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fisher S.K. Heacock A.M. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 984-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Fisher S.K. Snider R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 81-90PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Proteins—Microtubule proteins were isolated as described previously (22Shelanski M. Gaskin F. Cantor C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Microtubule-associated proteins were removed by phosphocellulose chromatography, and the remaining pure tubulin fraction was termed PC-tubulin (23Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10957-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PC-tubulin was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Replacement of GTP in β-tubulin was performed as described previously (5Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GTP was removed from PC-tubulin by charcoal pretreatment followed by incubation of tubulin with 150 μm guanine nucleotide (GDP or [32P]AAGTP) for 30 min on ice. Prior to use, these samples were passed through Bio-Gel P6DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad) twice to remove the unbound nucleotide. This procedure yields 0.4–0.6 mol of guanine nucleotide bound per mol of tubulin dimer. Tubulin-guanine nucleotide concentrations used throughout the study were based on the protein concentration. Gβ1γ2, purified from Sf9 cell membranes, was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kozasa (24Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Gβ1γ1, purified from bovine retina, was a generous gift from Dr. H. E. Hamm. Mutant Gβ1γ2(C68S) was generously provided by Drs. J. Hepler and A. G. Gilman. Purified Gβγ subunits were also kindly provided by Dr. P. Casey. Gβγ preparations were exchanged for the buffer used in the experiments (in most cases 100 mm Pipes buffer, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 (buffer A)) through a rapid spin column (Bio-Gel P6DG, Bio-Rad) immediately prior to use (25Roychowdhury S. Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4955-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Microtubule Assembly—PC-tubulin (1.5 mg/ml) was incubated with SK-N-SH membranes (0.3 mg/ml) and/or Gβγ (0.13 mg/ml), both in the presence and absence of 100 μm carbachol in polymerization buffer (100 mm Pipes, 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.9). (When tested, Gβγ was preincubated with tubulin for 30 min on ice.) The assembly reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 37 °C was performed, followed by separation of the pellets and the supernatants. Pellets were resuspended in identical amounts of cold polymerization buffer, kept on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, to separate membranes from depolymerized tubulin polymer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). The results were analyzed in a Storm 840 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). When tested, carbachol had no effect on tubulin polymerization in the absence of SK-N-SH membranes. Photoaffinity Labeling with AAGTP—Cell membranes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of tubulin-[32P]AAGTP in the presence or absence of carbachol and/or Gβγ (at a protein ratio with tubulin of 1:5) and/or PIP2 in buffer A as described previously (26Rasenick M.M. Talluri M. Dunn III, W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). (When tested, PIP2 was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, sonicated for 5 min in buffer A on ice, and preincubated with tubulin for 15 min at 4 °C in a bath sonicator.) Following incubation, tubes were UV-irradiated, and the reaction was quenched with ice-cold Pipes buffer, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the membrane pellets were washed with buffer A and dissolved in SDS Laemmli sample buffer with 50 mm DTT as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the samples was performed, and the gels were either stained (Coomassie Blue) or subjected to Western blotting, followed by autoradiography (Kodak XAR-5 film) or phosphor image analysis (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences). Membrane Association of Tubulin in SK-N-SH Cells—SK-N-SH cells were pretreated with 330 nm colchicine or 330 nm taxol, as described. Cells were collected and washed three times with PBS, and aliquots of 1 × 107 cells were distributed in plastic tubes on ice. Carbachol (100 μm) was added, and the samples were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 °C with constant shaking. Samples were transferred on ice and immediately sonicated, as described (3Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each sample was centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C (P1 pellets). Supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C (P2 pellets), and the P2 pellets were washed thoroughly with buffer. SDS-PAGE of the P2 pellet and cytosolic fractions was followed by immunoblotting, using anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). The results were analyzed in a Storm 840 image system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Purified Gβγ subunits (Gβ1γ2, Gβ1γ1, and Gβ1γ2 (68S)) and PC-tubulin in a GTP- or GDP-bound form, or devoid of nucleotide, as well as extracts from SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, were tested for tubulin/Gβγ coimmunoprecipitation. Purified Gβγ subunits and the different PC-tubulin species were tested at a protein ratio of 1:2. When tested, SK-N-SH membranes were extracted with 1% sodium cholate in buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C with constant stirring. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the isolated membrane extracts (0.5 mg/ml membrane protein) were incubated with the indicated tubulin species (1 μm). Incubations were carried out in buffer A for 30 min at 24 °C and constant shaking. After preclearing (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), each sample was incubated overnight with appropriate specific antiserum or preimmune serum (1:20 dilution) at 4 °C with constant shaking. Note, that dimeric tubulin has a very low GTPase activity, which is activated upon polymerization at temperatures higher than 24 °C. In addition, no tubulin (or possible aggregates), or Gβγ, were immunoprecipitated without specific antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin, and each immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting and ECL detection of the protein bands. Polyclonal anti-tubulin (raised against the β-tubulin C-terminal region of 422–431 amino acids) (3Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-Gβ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antisera were utilized. No cross-reactivity between these antisera was observed. Chemical Cross-linking—The method of Tucker and Goldstein (28Tucker C. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9481-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, PC-tubulin, in its GDP-bound form, and purified Gβ1γ2 subunits (at a protein ratio of 2:1) were incubated in buffer A for 30 min at 25 °C. The cross-linking agent EDC (Pierce) was added to the reaction mixture at the final concentration of 0.20 mm (concentration that limits nonspecific cross-linking), and the incubation was carried out for 2 h at 25 °C (28Tucker C. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9481-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting and ECL detection of the protein bands. Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) and polyclonal anti-Gβ antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were used for immunodetection. PLCβ 1 Assay—20 μg of Sf9 membrane protein was incubated with a [3H]PIP2 substrate mixture (30 μm final concentration) as described (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 10 μl of each GTPγS, tubulin-GDP, Gβ1γ2, and carbachol was added at appropriate concentrations to a final volume of 120 μl as indicated. When tested, GTPγS was preincubated with the membranes for 30 min on ice. Gβ1γ2 subunits were also preincubated with tubulin for 30 min on ice before the experiment. The tubes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with constant shaking, as described previously (7Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). [3H]inositol trisphosphate ([3H]IP3) production was measured as described (29Popova J.S. Dubocovich M.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Analysis of Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis in SK-N-SH Cells—SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were grown in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. 24 h before the experiment, inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 2 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol was added. The cells were washed three times with Locke's buffer, containing 10 mm LiCl, and incubated for 1 h with or without 330 nm taxol in the same buffer. After triplicate wash with Locke's buffer, 100 μm carbachol was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Carbachol effects were routinely controlled for by addition of 10 μm atropine. The reaction was stopped with ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the cells were scraped from wells with a rubber policeman and transferred to tubes. After sonication (as described above) and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C), the supernatants were extracted with water-saturated ether and neutralized with 1 m NH4HCO3. Ion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG 1-X8 resin, formate form, Bio-Rad) of the samples was performed as described (29Popova J.S. Dubocovich M.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total [3H]inositol phosphates were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The inositol phosphate content of SK-N-SH cells at the start of the experiment (0% increase) was 0.98 ± 0.31 × 103 dpm per 106 cells. Microscopy—SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 12-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 330 nm colchicine or taxol. After a PBS wash the cells were treated for the indicated times with 100 μm carbachol, 10 μm atropine, or both. After washing with PBS buffer the cells were immediately fixed in –20 °C methanol for 3 min and washed three times, 10 min each, in PBS, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked for 40 min in PBS, containing 5% milk, and washed in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a polyclonal rabbit anti-Gβ antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) at a dilution of 1:100. Following a PBS wash, a secondary FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (EY Labs) was applied for 1 h at a dilution of 1:100. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer, containing 10 μg/ml rabbit IgG. Subsequently a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma) was applied for 1 h at a dilution of 1:500. Following a PBS wash, secondary Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:100 dilution) was applied for 1 h, followed by washing and mounting of the coverslips. Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Ziess LSM 510) equipped with a ×63 water immersion objective. A 488-nm beam from an argon-krypton laser was used for the excitation of FITC, whereas a 543-nm beam was used for Texas Red excitation. Emission from FITC was detected through a BP505 filter, whereas emission from Texas Red was detected through a LP560 filter. Areas of antibody colocalization appeared in yellow. Differential interference contrast images of the cells were regularly acquired as well. Coverslips were examined at random. For each experimental condition a total of 80 randomly selected cells over six consecutive experiments were evaluated for Gβ and tubulin distribution and colocalization. Final image composites were created using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. No specific FITC or Texas Red labeling was observed in cells treated with mouse or rabbit preimmune serum instead of anti-tubulin or anti-Gβ antisera, respectively. Texas Red labeling was not observed when the anti-tubulin antibody was preincubated overnight at 4 °C with PC-tubulin (1:1 ratio), and FITC labeling was not detected when the anti-Gβ antiserum was preincubated with purified Gβγ, both conditions tested at the same antibody dilutions (1:100) afterward. Materials—[α-32P]GTP was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. [32P]AAGTP and AAGTP were synthesized as described (26Rasenick M.M. Talluri M. Dunn III, W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). p-Azidoaniline was synthesized by Dr. W. Dunn (University of Illinois at Chicago). [3H]PIP2 was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. [3H]QNB was from Amersham Biosciences. GTPγS, GTP, and GDP were from Roche Applied Science. Carbachol, atropine sulfate, and PIP2 were from Sigma Chemical Co. The cross-linking agent EDC was from Pierce, and Bio-Gel P6-DG was from Bio-Rad. P11 cellulose phosphate was from Whatman. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Microtubule Stabilization Inhibits Agonist-induced PLCβ 1 Activation—To verify the physiological significance of tubulin regulation of PLCβ1 signaling in vivo, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were treated with the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol before stimulating the cells with the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol (Fig. 1). Because taxol increases the formation of microtubule polymers and inhibits microtubule dynamics, the pool of dimeric tubulin available for regulation of PLCβ1 is decreased. As seen in Fig. 1, the normal 6-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited by carbachol (610 ± 67% (±S.D.)) was reduced by half in taxol-pretreated cells (350 ± 26% (±S.D.)). Agonist-evoked Membrane Association of Tubulin Is Not Assisted by Gβγ Subunits—It has been previously shown that both Gα and Gβγ subunits interact with tubulin and these interactions reciprocally regulate microtubule polymerization in vitro (12Roychowdhury S.

https://openalex.org/W2033060497,"Whether the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) of the MyoD family can discriminate among the muscle gene targets for the proper and reproducible formation of skeletal muscle is a recurrent question. We have previously shown that, in Xenopus laevis, myogenin specifically transactivated muscle structural genes in vivo. In the present study, we used the Xenopus model to examine the role of XMyoD, XMyf5, and XMRF4 for the transactivation of the (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) nAChR genes in vivo. During early Xenopus development, the expression patterns of nAChR subunit genes proved to be correlated with the expression patterns of the MRFs. We show that XMyf5 specifically induced the expression of the δ-subunit gene in cap animal assays and in endoderm cells of Xenopus embryos but was unable to activate the expression of the γ-subunit gene. In embryos, overexpression of a dominant-negative XMyf5 variant led to the repression of δ-but not γ-subunit gene expression. Conversely, XMyoD and XMRF4 activated γ-subunit gene expression but were unable to activate δ-subunit gene expression. Finally, all MRFs induced expression of the α-subunit gene. These findings strengthen the concept that one MRF can specifically control a subset of muscle genes that cannot be activated by the other MRFs.

Myogenesis is regulated by four transcription factors, MyoD, Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin, known as the muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) 1The abbreviations used are: MRFs, myogenic regulatory factors; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DN, dominant-negative; RT, reverse transcription; X, Xenopus.1The abbreviations used are: MRFs, myogenic regulatory factors; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DN, dominant-negative; RT, reverse transcription; X, Xenopus. of the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins (1Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). From genetic studies, distinct roles have been proposed for each MRF in muscle differentiation. MyoD and Myf5 are essential in establishing the muscle lineage, whereas myogenin and MRF4 control the terminal differentiation of myofibers (2Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 3Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 18: 747-783Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The four MRFs form heterodimers with E-protein family members and bind to a consensus DNA sequence, CANNTG, also called the E-box, to activate transcription of muscle-specific genes (4Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A largely unexplored question is whether active MRFs can discriminate among the different muscle gene targets or activate transcription at all E-box-containing promoters. Many molecular details have been worked out for individual MRFs, but no global study has been done with all four factors. A recent study by Bergstrom et al. (5Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) focused on MyoD, which serves as a paradigm for the MRF mode of function. Regarding the question whether a single gene or an array of genes is under the transcriptional control of an individual MRF, using the Xenopus model, we have recently shown that, among the MRFs, myogenin played a unique role in the transactivation of several structural genes of the contractile apparatus, e.g. β-tropomyosin and myosin heavy chain (6Charbonnier F. Gaspera B.D. Armand A.S. Van der Laarse W.J. Launay T. Becker C. Gallien C.L. Chanoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1139-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, whether such specificity applies to other MRFs still remains controversial. Xenopus laevis muscle development provides an attractive model to address this question since, in this system, primary myogenesis occurs in the absence of myoblast fusion and is devoid of myogenin expression (7Nicolas N. Gallien C.L. Chanoine C. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thus allowing comparison of the role of MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4 in the control of early gene expression. Myogenesis is characterized by the sequential expression of specific gene families, including those that mediate communication between motor neurons and muscle. Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction is mediated through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a pentameric complex of four homologous subunits with a molar stoichiometry of α2, β, δ, and γ or ϵ (8Raftery M.A. Hunkapiller M.W. Strader C.D. Hood L.E. Science. 1980; 208: 1454-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Expression of the nAChR subunits and the distribution of the receptors among muscular fibers is developmentally regulated. nAChR mRNA levels are highest during myogenic differentiation. Motor innervation inhibits nAChR expression by repressing transcription of the nAChR subunit genes, whereas denervation results in reaccumulation (9Buonanno A. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11452-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nAChR γ-to ϵ-subunit switch allows the expression of two types of channel, namely an embryonic channel composed of α-, β-, δ-, and γ-subunits, distributed throughout the fiber, and an adult channel containing α-, β-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits, exclusively expressed at the motor endplate (10Mishina M. Takai T. Imoto K. Noda M. Takahashi T. Numa S. Methfessel C. Sakmann B. Nature. 1986; 321: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 11Shieh B.H. Ballivet M. Schmidt J. Neuroscience. 1988; 24: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The accumulation to a high density of one type of nAChR at the neuromuscular junction is the result of transcriptional activation of AChR subunit genes in subsynaptic muscle nuclei. Members of the MyoD gene family are likely to play a central role in the regulation of nAChR subunit expression. All the genes coding for nAChR subunits contain one or more E-boxes in their regulatory regions, which the MRFs indifferently recognized and bound (12Liu S. Spinner D.S. Schmidt M.M. Danielsson J.A. Wang S. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41364-41368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each MRF is capable of increasing specifically nAChR subunit promoter activity in transient cotransfection assays (13Piette J. Bessereau J.L. Huchet M. Changeux J.P.

Res. 1993; 36: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date, no in vivo study has directly addressed the individual role of each MRF in patterning nAChR subunit expression. In the present study, we compared the expression patterns of MRFs and nAChR subunit genes during early Xenopus development, showing that these expression patterns are temporally correlated. We then compared the in vivo abilities of MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4 to trigger the expression of each nAChR subunit gene. Among the MRFs, only XMyf5 specifically induced expression of the δ-subunit gene in cap animal assays and in endoderm cells of Xenopus embryos, whereas it was unable to activate expression of the γ-subunit gene. In addition, overexpression of a dominant-negative XMyf5 variant led to repression of normal δ-subunit gene expression in embryos. The β- and γ-subunit genes also discriminated among MRFs for their transactivation in contrast to the α-subunit gene, whose expression was induced by all MRFs tested. Adult X. laevis were maintained at 22 °C in tap water and fed once a week. For expression in Xenopus embryos, the clones pSP64T-XMyoD, pSP64T-XMyf5, and pSP64T-XMRF4 have already been described (16Hopwood N.D. Gurdon J.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Hopwood N.D. Pluck A. Gurdon J.B. Development. 1991; 111: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jennings C.G.B. Dev.

MRF-FLAG constructs were obtained by a variant of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using forward primers, 5′-CAGCACCATCTATCACGTCTTAGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAG-3′, 5′-CCGACCAATCTACCATGTGTTAGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAG-3′, and 5′-TATACAGGAGCTGGTAGAGAATGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAG-3′ for XMyoD, Xmyf5, and XMRF4, respectively, and reverse primer 5′-TGAGGCTGGTTTAGTGGTAACCCTTGTCATCGTCTTTATAATC-3′. FLAG sequence was added in-frame with the last coding codon of each MRF just before the stop codon. The fidelity of all sequences amplified by the polymerase chain reaction was verified by DNA sequencing. The dominant-negative XMyf5-DN was constructed as described previously (19Steinbach O.C. Ulshofer A. Authaler A. Rupp R.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 891-bp fragment coding for amino acid residues 2–298 of the Drosophila repressor engrailed domain was inserted between the last coding codon and the stop codon by directed cloning (20Geiser M. Cèbe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a PCR method also developed in our laboratory. The primers used were 5′-TTGCCGACCAATCTACCATGTGTTAGCCCTGGAGGATCGC-3′ and 5′-TGAGGCTGGTTTAGTGGTAACCTTAGGATCCCAGAGCAGA-3′. The fidelity of the sequence amplified by PCR was verified by DNA sequencing. A FLAG epitope tag introduced at the C terminus of the MRF constructs was used as a control of the translation efficiency of the synthetic mRNAs. Five MRF-FLAG-injected embryos were homogenized at stage 8 in 100 μl of buffer containing 25% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml–1 aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml–1 leupeptin. Proteins were extracted after two rounds of centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). Briefly, the membranes were blocked with TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dried milk for 1 h at room temperature; incubated with a 1/2000 dilution of 5 μg/ml M2 in TBS-T with 5% dried milk for 1 h at room temperature; washed and finally incubated with a 1/4000 dilution of anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Transduction Laboratories) in TBS-T with 5% dried milk. Antibody binding was revealed using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Capped mRNAs of XmyoD, Xmyf5, XMRF4, XEF1-α, and XMyf5-DN (dominant-negative Xmyf5) were synthesized in vitro from linearized plasmids (XbaI restriction enzyme, New England BioLabs) using the SP6 Message Machine kit (Ambion). Injections were performed using an oil-based microinjector (nanoject, Drummond). Xenopus embryos were placed in Modified Marc's Ringer solution with 4% Ficoll. Embryos were initially bilaterally injected with 2 or 6 ng of capped mRNA (MRFs) or with 7.5 ng of capped mRNA (Xmyf5-DN) at the two-cell embryo stage. Injected embryos were transferred to Modified Marc's Ringer solution with antibiotics. The animal cap assay was performed as described previously (17Hopwood N.D. Pluck A. Gurdon J.B. Development. 1991; 111: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). Cap animals were dissected at the blastula stage (stage 10) and cultured until sibling embryos reached stage 14–15. Total RNA was extracted from five pooled animal caps, and expression of the Xenopus AChR subunit genes was detected by RT-PCR. To determine by in situ hybridization the ability of MRFs to activate expression of nAChR subunit genes in nonsomitic cells, 32-cell stage embryos were co-injected with 2 ng of MRF mRNA and 2.5 ng of nβ-galactosidase RNA into the D1 blastomere. To determine in situ the effect of Xmyf5-DN, two-cell stage embryos were unilaterally injected with 7.5 ng of Xmyf5-DN and 2 ng of capped green fluorescent protein mRNA as a cell tracer. Following injection, embryos were incubated in 20% Steinberg's solution until the appropriate stage was reached. Total RNA was isolated from Xenopus embryos as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63019) Google Scholar). Embryos and larvae were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (22Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNAs with oligo(dT) priming using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. PCR assays were performed as described elsewhere. 1 μCi of [32P]dCTP was added to each PCR sample, and the PCR products were resolved electrophoretically on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. The expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was first examined as a control for equal amplification of cDNAs. The primers used for RT-PCR were 5′-GTCAATGATGGAGTGTATGGATC-3′ and 5′-GTGCTCAGGAGAGCGGAATGGA-3′ (ODC), 5′-TCCTTCTGGAATACACTGGA-3′ and 5′-ACTCGCCATGAAGTTGCTCA-3′ (AChR α), 5′-ATGGCAATGTCACGTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-TGGAGTTCTTGCGGGACGAGC-3′ (AChR β), 5′-ACGTCTTGATAAGCAGTGAT-3′ and 5′-TGCTAATGAGTGGAATGGCA-3′ (AChR δ), 5′-ATGTCCTCGTGTACAATACA-3′ and 5′-ATGCTTGACTTTGGTGCTCAG-3′ (AChR ϵ), 5′-GATGGTTCCATGTACTGGCTT-3′ and 5′-GTAAGAAATAGACGAGAATGCT-3′ (AChR γ), 5′-AACTGCTCCGATGGCATGATGGATTA-3′ and 5′-ATTGCTGGGAGAAGGGATGGTGATTA-3′(XMyoD), 5′-ACTACTACAGTCTCCCAGGACAGA-3′ and 5′-AGAGTCTGGAATAGGGAGGGAGCA-3′ (XMyf5), 5′-CTTTTACCTGGATGGAG-3′ and 5′-TGGTGGAGCTAAGACAT-3′ (XMRF4). RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription in the presence of 50 μCi [35S]UTP at 1,200 Ci·mmol–1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Unlabeled UTP was omitted from the reaction medium to achieve synthesis of RNA probes with a specific activity of ∼109 cpm·μg–1. AChR δ and γ templates were obtained by cloning the RT-PCR fragments into pGEMT (Promega), linearized using SpeI (Roche Applied Science) and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). cRNA probes were used as described previously (7Nicolas N. Gallien C.L. Chanoine C. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Hybridization signals were quantified with a computerized image analysis system (Visiolab, 2000, Biocom, Paris, France). The relative density of silver grains/mm2 was determined in the somites of five unilaterally injected embryos. Relative density was measured on an average of 10 sections for each embryo. RT-PCR—Quantification of band “volume” (summed pixel density) was performed using Image Tool software (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA)). A standard curve was created by plotting the pixel density for each dilution of the standard sample as a function of the relative amount loaded. The relative amount of DNA in each test sample was then calculated based on this standard curve. Comparison of the Expression Patterns of nAChR Subunits and MRFs during Early Xenopus Development—Although a number of studies have already described the expression of either the nAChR subunits or the MRFs during the development of several species including Xenopus (23Baldwin T.J. Yoshihara C.M. Blackmer K. Kintner C.R. Burden S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Kullberg R.W. Zheng Y.C. Todt W. Owens J.L Fraser S.E. Mandel G. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar, 25Murray N. Zheng Y.C. Mandel G. Brehm P. Bolinger R. Reuer Q. Kullberg R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 865-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these expression patterns were never investigated together in the same set of experiments. To compare the expression patterns of the genes for the nAChR subunits and MRFs during early Xenopus development, we performed a time course analysis with RNA samples from developmentally staged embryos (Fig. 1). The onset of appearance of the nAChR subunit mRNAs followed the time course of the MRF mRNAs. All subunit genes, except the ϵ-subunit, were expressed as early as stages 12–15, i.e. starting 8 h after the appearance of XMyoD and XMyf5 transcripts, suggesting a direct gene activation (5Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Comparison of MRF and nAChR expression at later stages of development proved to be more complex. mRNA expression decreased from stage 19 for XMyoD and XMyf5 and from stage 22 for XMRF4, and MRF mRNAs became undetectable at stage 28. The decrease in the expression of the α-, δ-, γ-subunit genes followed the decreasing expression of the MRF genes, albeit at different rates. Indeed, δ-subunit gene expression became undetectable after stage 24, whereas α- and γ-subunit expression persisted until stage 30. Interestingly, the γ-subunit gene displayed a biphasic expression pattern with peaks of expression at stage 17 and stage 22. Finally, β- and ϵ-subunit gene expression persisted throughout early development. Selective nAChR Subunit Gene Activation by MRFs—To determine whether the pattern of transcription of each nAChR subunit gene during development can be attributed to differences in transactivation by MRFs, we compared the specificity of each MRF for transactivation of nAChR subunit genes, using the Xenopus animal cap assay. In this assay, two-cell stage embryos were bilaterally injected at the animal pole with 2 ng of synthetic XMyoD, XMyf5, or XMRF4 RNA. The same FLAG epitope tag was inserted at the C terminus of each MRF coding sequence to permit evaluation of the relative amount of each MRF injected (Fig. 2C). Animal poles were dissected at the blastula stage and cultured until the late gastrula stage for molecular analysis. The animal caps were analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of nAChR α, β, δ, γ, and ϵ mRNAs. Since cultured animal pole explants normally form epidermis, any expression of a muscle gene in these cells solely reflects the activity of the transcription factor gene injected. As shown in Fig. 2, mRNAs for the nAChR subunits were detected only in the MRF-RNA-injected samples, and no signal was obtained following injection of control XEF1α mRNA. A specific activation of δ-subunit mRNA was observed after XMyf5 injection (Fig. 2A). No signal was detected for δ-subunit gene expression with either XMyoD or XMRF4. β-subunit transcription was activated by XMyf5 or XMyoD, but not by XMRF4, whereas γ-subunit transcription was activated by XMyoD and XMRF4, but not by XMyf5. α-subunit mRNA was found to be activated in all animal caps except in the control XEF1α. In contrast, expression of the ϵ-subunit gene was not induced by any of the MRFs injected. To detect a possible dose effect for the gene activation specificity, we examined the expression of the nAChR subunit genes in embryos injected with 6 ng of synthetic MRF RNAs. Although the differences between the MRF transactivation potentials were less marked, we fully confirmed the data obtained with the 2 ng-injected embryos. In particular, γ-subunit gene expression was activated by each MRF (Fig. 2B). In addition, the preferential role of XMyf5 for transactivation of the δ-subunit gene, as well as of XMyf5 and XMyoD for transactivation of the β-subunit gene, were confirmed in these conditions. Finally, expression of the ϵ-subunit gene was not detected at any dose of MRF injected. In Vivo δ-Subunit Gene Activation by XMyf5—To confirm that MRFs could discriminate between the nAChR subunit targets in vivo, XMyf5 was overexpressed in a predetermined blastomere. In the 32-cell stage embryo, the cells derived from the D1 blastomere mainly give rise to endodermal structures (26Dale L. Slack J.M.W. Development. 1989; 99: 527-551Google Scholar). XMyf5 and nβ-galactosidase RNAs or XMyoD and nβ-galactosidase RNAs were injected into the D1 blastomere of 32-cell stage embryos. At stage 35, the injected embryos were assayed for the presence of δ- or γ-subunits of the nAChR mRNAs, respectively activated by XMyf5 and by XMyoD, in endodermal tissue. In situ hybridization analysis revealed a discrete but significant expression of δ-subunit transcripts in some of the endoderm cells derived from the XMyf5-injected blastomere (Fig. 3). No hybridization signal was detected in endoderm cells with the nAChR-γ probe, neither in the embryos injected with XMyf5 nor in the embryos injected with XMyoD. In contrast, the myotomal tissue of all the injected embryos displayed high levels of hybridization with the nAChR-γ and -δ probes (data not shown). δ-Subunit Gene Repression by a Dominant-negative Myf5 Variant—To provide additional evidence for the role of XMyf5 as a preferential regulator of the δ-subunit gene, we tested by in situ hybridization analysis whether a dominant-negative mutant of XMyf5 (XMyf5-DN) could selectively suppress δ-subunit expression in vivo without perturbing γ-subunit expression. Upon unilateral injection into two-cell stage embryos, XMyf5-DN efficiently reduced δ-subunit gene expression (Fig. 4), when this gene is normally activated in the mesoderm. The reduction of δ-subunit gene expression was correlated spatially with the expression of the co-injected lineage tracer green fluorescent protein. In contrast, the level of γ-subunit mRNA was not affected by overexpression of XMyf5-DN. As shown by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5), Xmyf5-dependent induction of δ-subunit mRNA was significantly reduced by XMyf5-DN, whereas expression of the γ-subunit was unaffected. In these experiments, two-cell stage embryos were bilaterally injected with XMyf5-DN or with XEF1α as a control. Taken together, these results provided additional evidence that δ-subunit expression was specifically regulated by XMyf5 protein activity.Fig. 5Defects in the developmental pattern of δ-subunit mRNA expression induced by inhibition of XMyf5. The expression patterns of the δ- and γ-subunit genes were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR of total RNA (cDNA) isolated from embryos bilaterally injected with XMyf5-DN or with XEF1α. The embryonic stages are indicated. The level of δ-subunit gene expression was significantly reduced in XMyf5-DN embryos, whereas γ-subunit gene expression remained unaffected. All PCRs were made on the same samples. ODC was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A central and recurrent question in the biology of the MyoD family factors is whether each of them has evolved specialized functions or whether they can compensate for each other's function in the precise orchestration of muscle-specific gene expression during myogenesis. Few studies directly addressed this question by comparing the MRF transactivation potentials for specific muscle gene targets. Using the Xenopus model, we have previously shown that Xmyogenin controls a particular set of muscle structural genes, which cannot be activated by the other MRFs (6Charbonnier F. Gaspera B.D. Armand A.S. Van der Laarse W.J. Launay T. Becker C. Gallien C.L. Chanoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1139-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our present study demonstrates that, in vivo, the factors of the MyoD family present in muscle when the neuromuscular junction begin to differentiate, XMyoD, XMyf5, and XMRF4, display different specificities for the transactivation of the genes encoding the different subunits of the nAChR. High specificity was observed for activation of the δ-subunit gene by XMyf5. β- and γ-subunit gene activation was less specific, excluding only one MRF from their activator panel. Finally, activation of the α-subunit gene implies a nonspecific effect of the different MRFs. Overexpression of any nAChR subunit gene in the cap animal assay is controlled by at least one determination MRF factor, i.e. MyoD or Myf5. This MRF activation was concomitant with the onset of nAChR transcription, as revealed by comparing the respective expression patterns. Furthermore, expression of the nAChR subunit genes was shown to be dependent on the expression of their corresponding MRF activators since injection of a dominant-negative XMyf5 altered δ-subunit gene expression. These observations reinforce the role of the MRFs in the initiation of nAChR gene transcription during early development, with the notable exception of the ϵ-subunit gene. However, no valid prediction can be made on the specific role of MyoD, Myf5, or the combination of both in promoting the transcription of nAChR genes. Since no difference could be detected in the expression patterns of the nAChR subunits that could account for the number and identity of their relevant MRF activators, it can be speculated that when the two determination factors have an activating capacity, as for the α- and β-subunits, gene activation arises from a competition toward the E-box targets. In this regard, it should be emphasized that the specificity of the initiation of nAChR gene expression by the determination MRFs is dose-dependent, as was shown for the expression of the γ-subunit and to a lesser extent the δ-subunit. Consistent with these data, no difference in the expression of the nAChR genes was reported in MyoD and Myf5-null mice (27Arnold H.H. Braun T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). In later developmental steps, each nAChR subunit gene seems to adopt a unique strategy for the maintenance of its transcriptional activation. Activation of the δ-subunit gene during differentiation requires a major activation by XMyf5, as shown by 1) the results of the cap animal assay, 2) the results of the in vivo injection in 32-cell embryos, and 3) the comparison of the expression patterns during development (Fig. 6A). In vivo activation of the other subunit genes may require additional factors, which are likely to be MRF family members in the case of the α- and γ-subunits (Fig. 6B) or other factors in the case of the β- and ϵ-subunits. A functionally significant finding from this study is that XMRF4 most likely has a cooperative function with XMyoD for the activation of α- and γ-subunit gene expression at subsequent developmental steps. The data from the cap animal assays, showing an activation by XMRF4 only in the case of an activation by XMyoD, were highly consistent with the relative expression profiles of α- and γ-subunit genes and the expression profiles of XMyoD and XMRF4. All together, these results suggest that XMRF4 maintains the expression rate of α- and γ-subunit genes, whose activation is initiated by XMyoD. Thus, XMyoD and XMRF4 functions may overlap for the transactivation of the nAChR α- and γ-genes. Furthermore, overexpression of XMyoD in the 32-cell embryos failed to activate γ-subunit expression in endoderm cells in vivo. This might be interpreted as a consequence of an absence of XMRF4. Thus, a working hypothesis, to be tested, is that expression of the γ-subunit gene, effectively triggered by XMyoD in these conditions, required activation by XMRF4 to display a normal expression level detectable by in situ hybridization. Our results suggest a functional overlap of XMyoD and XMRF4 and substantiate the results obtained with the knockout mice. In contrast to either a MyoD-ora MRF4-null mutant, which exhibited nearly normal muscle differentiation, MyoD –/–/MRF4 –/– mouse embryos have severe muscle defects similar to those seen in myogenin mutants (28Rawls A. Valdez M.R. Zhang W. Richardson J. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather than a critical level of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins insufficient to completely trigger the myogenic program, it can be proposed, in the light of the present study, that the terminal differentiation process relies in part on the correct activation of a particular set of genes, specifically activated by differentiation factors that may act solitarily, such as myogenin, or in tandem, such as MyoD and MRF4. This hypothesis is strengthened by the results reported by Cornelison et al. (29Cornelison D.D. Olwin B.B. Rudnicki M.A. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 122-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), who examined the genetic requirements for MyoD for successful satellite cell myogenesis. These authors have described the dependence of MRF4 expression on MyoD in adult satellite cells. Severe defects in the muscle regenerating process could be observed in the absence of both of these MRFs. In contrast, MyoD –/– embryos were phenotypically normal and, interestingly, displayed a significant expression of MRF4 at a level indistinguishable from wild type (30Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). As a conclusion, differentiation defects likely resulted from a simultaneous deficiency in MyoD and MRF4 activities. Besides, this model accounts for the observation that, in contrast to myogenin, MyoD and MRF4 possess a functionally interchangeable helix III domain implicated in the efficient targeting of endogenous responsive genes (31Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast to the observation by Liu et al. (12Liu S. Spinner D.S. Schmidt M.M. Danielsson J.A. Wang S. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41364-41368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that MRF4 bound the ϵ-subunit promoter, no MRF was able to trigger ϵ-subunit gene expression in the cap assay. Thus, these data might reflect a discrepancy between the DNA binding at nAChR promoters and the efficiency of the transcriptional activity. In this regard, studies using heterologous systems have already shown such a discrepancy between MRF binding and transactivation. For instance, several muscle gene promoters, including creatine kinase, myosin light chain 1/3, and troponin I, that bound MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 (4Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) were not efficiently activated by MRF4 (32Mak K.L. To R.Q. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the myogenin promoter to which MRF4 binds but does not activate (33Zhang W. Behringer R.R. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This feature applied for all the MRFs since Liu et al. (12Liu S. Spinner D.S. Schmidt M.M. Danielsson J.A. Wang S. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41364-41368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that the MRFs indifferently bind to the promoters of AChR subunit genes. Control of nAChR gene transcription is crucial to the development and maintenance of synapses in muscle. The myogenic factor proteins of the MyoD family are essential molecules in regulating the ongoing rates of nAChR gene transcription during early myogenesis in a specific and reproducible manner. In Xenopus, this precise orchestration of nAChR gene activation occurs with a target specificity. Our results further substantiate the concept that an individual MRF can control a subset of muscle genes that cannot be activated by the other MRFs or with dramatically lower efficiency. This concept opens new ways to assign, at the gene level, a particular role to each MRF in myogenesis. We thank Dr. J.B. Gurdon for Xenopus MyoD and Myf5 cDNA and Dr. C. G. B.

The Runt domain contains several regions that are likely to equilibrate between at least two conformations in the free state, including the βC-D, βE′-F, and βG-G′ loops. CBFβ appears to stabilize a specific conformation of the Runt domain. The most dramatic change occurs in the βG-G′ loop that assumes two conformations in the free and complexed state crystal structures and has been referred to as the “S-switch” (32Bäckström S.

The dramatic change in the βG-G′ loop and the changes in the βC-D loop are in agreement with an earlier study by NMR chemical shift perturbation that showed dramatic changes in the Cα chemical shift for residues in the βG-G′ loop indicative of a significant conformational change (28Tang Y.-Y.

Here we determine the energetic contribution of the amino acids in the Runt domain that contact CBFβ to heterodimer formation. In doing so we identify two energetic hot spots at the heterodimerization interface involving Runt domain residues Asn-109 and Thr-161, and we discuss the importance of these contacts in terms of the overall ternary complex structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—We introduced alanine substitutions into a cDNA encoding the murine Runx1 Runt domain and subcloned the cDNA sequences into the bacterial pET-3c (Novagen) expression vector as described by Li et al.

We transformed the resulting plasmid pET3c-CBFβ141 into Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) and overexpressed the CBFβ (141) protein at 37 °C. We harvested cells from a 1-liter culture and resuspended them in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 25% sucrose. We then sonicated the cells, collected the insoluble inclusion body by centrifugation, and denatured it with 7 m urea. We passed the denatured protein through a 50-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) column in the presence of 7 m urea, collected the protein fractions, and refolded the CBFβ (141) protein by serial dialysis in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 1, 0.5, and 0 m urea.

We pooled and concentrated the fractions of interest, which contained a single protein band on SDS-PAGE gels as visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (not shown).NMR Spectroscopy—We performed all measurements on a Varian Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded triple resonance probe from Nalorac Corp. We prepared samples of Runt domain-DNA complexes and recorded 15N-1H HSQC spectra at 40 °C as described previously (23Berardi M. Sun C. Zehr M. Abildgaard F. Peng J. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H.

We performed all fluorescence experiments using a protein concentration of 20–40 μm in a total volume of 0.8 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 μm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). We incubated individual 0.8-ml solutions of the Runt domain with increasing concentrations of urea (0–6.0 m) and equilibrated the samples for 2 h at 4 °C prior to fluorescence measurement to follow the Runt domain denaturation. We excited the samples at a wavelength of 280 nm and detected the emission at 340 nm. We took background spectra of the buffer alone for later subtraction. We then recorded spectra in the range of 300–370 nm with an increment of 4 nm and an integration time of 1 s, and averaged two scans to minimize error. We obtained the parameters for the unfolding curves by nonlinear, least squares fitting using two-state equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) as described elsewhere (38Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the TCRβ(core)-LUC plasmid which contains the same fragment with mutations in the three CBF-binding sites in the enhancer (45Sun W. Graves B.J. Speck N.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to detect Runx1 activity. We constructed both reporter plasmids by isolating a BamHI fragment containing the TCRβ enhancer fragments from the previously described pTCRβCAT plasmids (45Sun W. Graves B.J. Speck N.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), filling in the overhangs with Klenow polymerase and ligating the fragment into the SmaI site of pT81-LUC (46Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar).We seeded P19 cells at 2 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates the day before transfection, and we performed transient transfections with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, we mixed 1 μg of the TCRβ-LUC reporter plasmids, 2 μg of the pcDNA/Runx1 expression vectors, and 2 ng of transfection efficiency control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) with 250 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then added LipofectAMINE 2000 (7.5 μl) with 250 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. We then added the plasmid DNA mixture to the LipofectAMINE 2000 mixture and incubated for 30–45 min at room temperature. We rinsed P19 cells with 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media and added another 2 ml of the same media to each well. The DNA/LipofectAMINE 2000 mixture was then added, and the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and then 350 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 70% fetal calf serum was added to each well. We prepared cell lysates 48 h post-transfection, and we measured their luciferase activity following instructions provided in the manual accompanying the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). We used pRL-SV40, which carries the Renilla luciferase gene, to monitor the transfection efficiency for each sample, and we used P19 cells that were transfected in the absence of DNA as blanks. We calculated the reporter activity as follows: reporter activity = (firefly luciferase activity – Blank)/(Renilla luciferase activity – Blank).RESULTSPreparation of Alanine-substituted Runt Domain Proteins and Assessment of Their Structural Integrity—Crystal structures of the Runt domain-CBFβ complex (31Warren A.J.

Eight of these amino acids in the Runt domain (Asn-69, Met-106, Tyr-113, Ser-14, Thr-149, Pro-156, Pro-157, and Thr-161) make side chain contacts to CBFβ that involve atoms beyond the CB carbon. To determine which of these Runt domain side chains are energetically important for the interaction with CBFβ, we substituted all but the two prolines with alanine (Fig. 1) (35Li Z. Yan J.

Substitution with alanine should remove interactions involving atoms beyond the CB of an amino acid side chain (47Wells J.A.

Alanine substitution, on the other hand, will not allow us to examine the energetic contribution of main chain atoms or the CB moieties to heterodimerization. We also substituted Asp-66 and Val-159 with alanines as controls. Asp-66 and Val-159 make backbone contacts to CBFβ, and Asp-66 also makes a CB contact. Alanine substitution of these residues should not affect heterodimerization unless the Runt domain structure is perturbed. We substituted Asn-109, which makes backbone O, C, and CA contacts with CBFβ with alanine because Asn-109 maps to a previously defined energetic hot spot at the heterodimerization interface identified in a similar analysis of CBFβ (33Tang Y.-Y.

The p50 protein is incorporated within the N-terminal portion of p105 and is a unique product of proteasomal processing. Because proteasome-mediated proteolysis generally results in complete degradation of the substrate, how p50 survives the proteasomal processing remains unknown. Survival of proteasomal processing has also been observed recently for the yeast transcription factors SPT23 and MGA2, but the mechanism is also unclear. Here we show evidence that stability of the Rel homology domain (RHD) within the N-terminal portion of the NF-κB 1 protein is required for p50 generation. We demonstrated that proteolysis initiated at an internal location of the NF-κB 1 protein, which normally generates p50, degrades the N-terminal portion of the NF-κB 1 protein when the RHD is destabilized.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Abnormal NF-κB activities have often been implicated in many disease states such as cancers, AIDS, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative conditions (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene ablation studies in mice indicate that maintaining a normal ratio of NF-κB 1 proteins, p50 and p105, is physiologically important. Mice lacking the nfkb1 gene (hence lacking both p50 and p105), develop normally except having abnormal immune responses to pathogen infections (3Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 4Snapper C.M. Zelazowski P. Rosas F.R. Kehry M.R. Tian M. Baltimore D. Sha W.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). However, mice expressing p50 but lacking p105 suffer severe defects that include lymphocyte infiltration in multiple organs and a lack of normal cytokine expression in macrophages, leading to their high postnatal fatality (5Ishikawa H. Claudio E. Dambach D. Raventos-Suarez C. Ryan C. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An abnormally high level of p50 homodimer activity was detected in cells lacking p105 (6Ishikawa H. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 255-263PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that p105 plays a regulatory role on p50 homodimer formation. A high p50/p105 ratio was also observed in skin carcinomas and laryngeal papilloma tissues (7Budunova I.V. Perez P. Vaden V.R. Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Jorcano J.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Vancurova I. Wu R. Miskolci V. Sun S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1533-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), linking abnormal homeostasis of p50/p105 to these pathological conditions. Regulation of p50/p105 homeostasis includes p50 biogenesis and p105 degradation, and both processes are mediated by the proteasome. In resting cells, the ratio of p50/p105 is relatively stable, and p50 biogenesis is the major factor that determines the ratio of the two proteins (9Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, when the cell is stimulated, the cellular ratio of p50/p105 is adjusted through degradation of p105 (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This stimuli-induced p105 degradation is mediated via phosphorylation of the C terminus of p105 by the IKK kinase complex, and the subsequent recruitment of SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex to this region (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell.

The binding of the SCFβTrCP complex to p105 was originally attributed to enhancement of p50 generation upon stimulation (14Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that the level of p50 remains unchanged in the IKK-knockout lymphocytes as in the wild type counterparts (12Salmeron A. Janzen J. Soneji Y. Bump N. Kamens J.

Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), suggesting that stimulation of the cell has little, if any, to do with p50 generation. NF-κB 1 (p105 and p50) and NF-κB 2 (p100 and p52) are closely related proteins, and p52 generation also requires the proteasome (17Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike p50 generation, stimuli induce processing of p100 and increase p52 levels, and the C terminus of p100 was found to regulate stimuli-induced p100 processing (19Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Our previous studies (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that p50 generation occurs during translation of the nfkb1 gene. Although this co-translational model is consistent with the kinetics pattern of p50 generation, and may explain the steady cellular ratio of p50/p105 in resting cells, it is unclear how p50 survives proteasomal processing, as the proteasome normally degrades proteins to small oligopeptides (22Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that yeast proteins, SPT23 and MGA2, are synthesized as endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear membrane-bound precursor proteins but are processed to transcription factors by the proteasome (23Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that nfkb1 genes carrying point mutations or small deletions affecting p50 dimerization fail to generate p50 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Lee et al. (24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) also found that mutations that destabilize the Rel homology domain (RHD) in p105 also lead to failure of p50 production. However, it is not clear how the stability of the RHD is related to p50 biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that proteasome-mediated proteolysis degrades the N-terminal RHD when it is destabilized by mutations. We show that in addition to the previously identified cis-element, a glycine-rich region (GRR), residues 400–475 of murine p105, is also involved in p50 production. By using prokaryote ATP-dependent proteases ClpAP/XP, we also recapitulate p50 generation and degradation of the destabilized RHD in vitro. Our studies establish the importance of the structure of the RHD in p50 biogenesis and may provide mechanistic insights for other proteosomal processing events. Plasmids, Antibodies, Enzymes, and Other Reagents—All NF-κB 1 derivatives (point mutations, deletions, and chimeric proteins) were constructed by PCR, using nfkb1 cDNA and other cDNAs as templates. p105 carrying the Y267D/L269D composite mutation was a gift from Gourisankar Ghosh (University of California, San Diego). All constructs were either restriction enzyme-mapped or sequenced to confirm their correctness. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-gp10 antibodies were obtained from Novagen, and anti-p50(NLS) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Tax antibodies were provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Purified ClpA, ClpX, and ClpP were generous gifts from Michael Maurizi (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Transfection, Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—CHO-CD 14 cells (a kind gift from Peter Tobias, The Scripps Research Institute) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation, cells were metabolic labeled, lysed, and immunoprecipitated or were otherwise lysed for Western blotting. These methods were described previously (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation and ClpAP/XP Proteolysis Assays—In vitro translation was performed as described previously (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A 497-residue NF-κB 1 fragment or the same fragment carrying Y267D/L269D mutations was cloned into a modified pET3 vector so that the expressed protein is attached with a T7 gp10 epitope tag at the N terminus and with an ssrA degradation signal for ClpAP/XP at the C terminus. ClpAP/XP degradation assays were performed according to Lee et al. (24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, (NH4)2SO4-precipitated translation lysates were resuspended in degradation buffer containing an energy-regeneration system (24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the purified ClpA or ClpX (0.66 μg/ml) and ClpP (0.33 μg/ml) were added. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for the time indicated. At each time point, a portion of reaction mixture was precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were collected by centrifugation and were resuspended in SDS loading buffer. The samples were then resolved with SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. For detecting the resistant fragments in the N-terminal portion, the N-terminal 497-residue fragment carrying Y267D/L269D composite mutations was translated and immunoprecipitated with anti-gp10 antibodies and protein A beads. The beads were then washed and equilibrated with degradation buffer and incubated with ClpAP at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of ELB buffer (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the beads were collected by centrifugation. The N-terminally bound fragments were extracted from protein A beads by boiling with SDS loading buffer and were resolved with SDS-PAGE. Detection of Proteolysis-resistant Fragments in the N-terminal Portion of p105—Lee et al. (24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) demonstrated in vitro, using purified ClAP/XP, that a sufficiently stable protein domain survives energy-dependent protease degradation as a resistant core attached with additional residues. This discovery is a reminiscence of p50 generation: proteasomal degradation, like ClpAP/XP, requires ATP, and p50 can be viewed as the RHD (as the resistant core) attached with 80–90 residues. The RHD consists of two structurally similar subdomains, sd1 and sd2, linked by a short loop (25Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 26Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Because mutagenesis studies found that mutations affecting stability/dimerization of the RHD are all located within the sd2 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we reasoned that an intact sd1, which is proximal to the sd2 at N terminus, might retain residual resistance to proteolysis when sd2 is destabilized by mutations (Fig. 1). To demonstrate that resistance to proteolysis by the unique structure of the RHD is the major mechanism underlying survival of the p50 protein during processing, we attempted to detect proteolysis-resistant fragments within the RHD, using an nfkb1 gene carrying composite mutations (Y267D/L269D) (27Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Datta S. Huang D.B. Anderson E. Braswell E.H. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that fails to generate p50 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If proteolysis leading to p50 production initiates from downstream of the RHD, such mutations may allow proteolysis to proceed into the RHD when the sd2 is destabilized. A priori, residual proteolysis-resistant fragments containing the sd1 may be detected in this mutant. CHO-CD14 cells transfected with the wild type nfkb1, the Y267D/L269D mutant, or a deletion mutant (Δ302–310) were labeled with [35S]methionine/cystine for 1 h and chased with normal media for 1 h followed by immunoprecipitation of the lysates. Because all fragments were tagged with a T7 gp10 epitope at their N termini, anti-gp10 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation should detect all fragments that contain intact N termini. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 2 and 3), expression of either nfkb1(Y267D/L269D) or nfkb1(Δ302–310) does not generate p50. A prolonged exposure of the gel to the film, however, revealed several putative proteolysis-resistant fragments from the mutants (Fig. 2B). Most notably, two fragments slightly larger than the sd1 were detected (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), they contain sd1 (as the proteolysis-resistant core) with additional attached residues. This is similar to the typical phenomenon of proteolysis resistance demonstrated by Lee et al. (24Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) in their in vitro studies. There were additional sd1-containing, proteolysis-resistant fragments, possibly generated by the remaining RHD structures. None of these fragments were detected in the wild type protein, suggesting that they originated from the mutants rather than being cellular proteins brought down by immunoprecipitation.Fig. 2Proteolysis of the RHD leads to failure of p50 production. A and B, detection of the low abundant proteolysis-resistant fragments in the N-terminal portion of p50. The immunoprecipitated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. A, 8-h exposure. B, 2-day exposure of the same gel. ns, a nonspecific fragment. The putative sd1-containing fragments are marked with asterisks (lanes 2 and 3). sd1 was expressed independently as a control, and 1/20 volume of the sample was loaded (lane 4). C, the proteasome is responsible for generation of the N-terminal resistant fragments. The transfected cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132, and the inhibitor was also included during labeling (1 h) and chase (15 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the proteasome is required for the generation of the proteolysis-resistant fragments, we used the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in the labeling experiments. When the cells were treated with MG132, no proteolysis-resistant fragments were detected even after prolonged exposure of the gel (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the detected fragments are products of proteasomal processing, rather than contaminants. Together, the results suggest that stability of the RHD, which is also inherently required for dimerization, is critical for p50 generation. The peculiar structure of the RHD confers its strong resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in p50 production. When the stable structure of the RHD is abrogated by mutations, its resistance to proteolysis is significantly compromised, leading to major destruction of the N-terminal portion and generation of only low abundance of sd1-containing resistant fragments. The RHD Also Resists Proteolysis by ClpA/XP—Our previous studies (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) showed that co-translational processing of the NF-κB 1 polypeptides is stochastic; only a portion of the NF-κB 1 polypeptides are captured by the proteasome during translation, and those that are not captured complete their synthesis to form the full-length p105 proteins. Therefore, the level of the full-length unprocessed p105 mutant proteins (i.e. p105 mutant that are not captured for processing) remains similar to that of the wild type counterpart (Fig. 2). To demonstrate that NF-κB 1 fragments, once captured, can be completely processed to p50, and that the RHD is indeed resistant to energy-dependent proteases, we established an in vitro system, using prokaryotic protease ClpAP or ClpXP. ClpAP/XP degrades proteins in a manner similar to eukaryotic proteasome. ClpA and ClpX, whose function is similar to the proteasome 19 S components, recognize a degradation signal, ssrA, attached to the C terminus of the substrate and unfold the substrate from this signal. The unfolded protein is then transported into the channel of ClpP oligomer protease for degradation (28Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T.

This in vitro system provides an experimental bypass of ubiquitination steps, which may be required for the in vivo processing of NF-κB 1 proteins, and allows us to assess the mechanism of processing directly. A 497-residue of NF-κB 1 N-terminal portion does not generate p50 either in vivo or in vitro, probably due to the conformation of this fragment that precludes the access of cellular processing machinery (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, incubation of ClpXP with this 497-residue fragment containing an ssrA signal at its C terminus promotes efficient processing, and all substrates are converted to p50 (Fig. 3A). The processing is dependent upon the degradation signal, as a mutated ssrA (29Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) does not direct the processing (Fig. 3B). When the RHD carries the Y267D/L269D composite mutations, ClpXP degrades the entire protein without generating p50 (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that the RHD universally resists energy-dependent protein degradation. Similar results were obtained when ClpAP was used (data not shown). If ClpAP/XP processes NF-κB 1 proteins using a mechanism similar to that of the proteasome, it is expected that in Y267D/L269D mutant, a small portion of sd1-containing N-terminal fragments will survive the proteolysis as seen in Fig. 2. To investigate whether processing of the Y267D/L269D mutant by ClpAP also generates sd1-containing fragments, we immunoprecipitated in vitro translated, gp10-tagged p-497(Y267D/L269D) with anti-gp10 antibodies and incubated the precipitants with ClpAP. After incubation, the bound proteins were extracted from protein A beads by boiling with SDS loading buffer. Although the majority of mutant NF-κB 1 proteins were completely degraded (Fig. 3C), a small portion of sd1-containing peptides survived and was detected by prolonged exposure of the film (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the observations shown in Fig. 2, B and C, and further affirm that the stability of the RHD is required for its own survival during proteolytic processing by energy-dependent proteases.Fig. 4ClpAP/XP-mediated proteolysis of mutated RHD also generates sd1-containing fragments. In vitro translated, gp10-tagged 497-residue fragment carrying Y267D/L269D mutations were immunoprecipitated with anti-gp10 antibodies first, and the precipitants were incubated with ClpAP for 1 h at room temperature. The bound fragments were then eluded with SDS loading buffer and resolved with SDS-PAGE.

Gonen H. Bercovich B. Cohen S. Fajerman I. Israel A. Mercurio F. Kahana C. Schwartz A.L. Iwai K. Orian A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One is at the vicinity of the putative C terminus of p50 (i.e. in the middle of p105) (31Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is at the C terminus of p105 (14Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies demonstrated that the latter location promotes complete degradation of p105 induced by stimuli, rather than p50 generation. During stimulation, p105 is degraded without generating p50 (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additional evidence obtained from lymphocytes lacking the IκB kinases (IKKs) further supports this notion (12Salmeron A. Janzen J. Soneji Y. Bump N. Kamens J. Allen H. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22215-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G.

Unlike NF-κB 2 p52, which is induced to a higher level by stimuli through the IKK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent processing of p100 (19Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), p50 expression in IKK-knockout lymphocytes is normal (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), suggesting that p50 generation is essentially a constitutive, rather than an induced, event. The C terminus of p105 contains an IKK phosphorylation target site, and phosphorylation of this consensus site leads to recruitment of SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. These features of p105 correlate with the findings that extracellular signals resulting in rapid degradation of IκBs also induce degradation of p105 (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) whose function in the cell is similar to that of IκB (32Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that proteolysis leading to p50 generation initiates at the internal site of the p105 protein, we expressed the N-terminal 530 residues of p105 in the cell. Previously, we demonstrated that this 530-residue fragment is necessary and sufficient for p50 generation (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). If this portion of p105 contains all elements required for p50 generation, we should also detect proteolysis-resistant fragments from this 530-residue fragment when its sd2 harbors mutations that disrupt the stability of the protein. Both the wild type p-530 and p-530(Y267D/L269D) were expressed in the cells, and similar metabolic labeling experiments as in Fig. 2 were performed. As shown in Fig. 5, p-530(Y267D/L269D) exhibits similar proteolysis-resistant fragments as nfkb1(Y267D/L369D), suggesting that the proteolysis signal is at the upstream of residue 530. Residues 400–475 of Murine p105, in Addition to the GRR, Are Also Important for p50 Generation—Although Orian et al. (31Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that residues 441–454 in human p105 are important for p50 generation, the sequences within this region, unlike the C-terminal IKK target region, are not well conserved among the p105 proteins from humans and mice (34Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 35Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F. Le Bail O. Urban M.B. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P.A. Israel A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Replacement of a large portion of p105 starting from the end of the GRR with either IκBα or bacteriophage T7 capsid protein gp10 does not affect p50 production (36Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation leads to the initial conclusion that the GRR is sufficient for directing processing, and the entire C-terminal portion of p105 is not required for the process (36Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar replacements with other proteins, such as human T cell leukemia viral protein Tax, do not lead to p50 production (Fig. 6B, lane 2), suggesting that the GRR is a necessary but insufficient element for p50 production (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that generation of p50 from gp10 or IκBα-containing chimeric proteins may be due to the contribution of cis-elements from these two proteins that, together with the GRR, enhance instability of the chimeric proteins. These elements may compensate for the loss of necessary cis-elements in p105 when the protein is fused to the GRR directly. Linking proteins that are relatively stable (such as Tax) to the GRR may not result in p50 production, probably due to lack of necessary cis-elements or degradation signals that may contribute to degradation of this protein. To test whether adding additional sequences that were identified as putative degradation signals for p50 processing (31Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would lead to degradation of the C-terminal fusion protein and production of p50, we linked Tax to residue 475 of p105 (Fig. 6A). Expression of this p50(475)/Tax chimera in the cell leads to effective production of p50 (Fig. 6B, lane 3), confirming that other cis-elements, in addition to the GRR, are also important for p50 generation. Anti-Tax antibodies immunoprecipitated the full-length p50(475)/Tax only (Fig. 6C, lane 2), suggesting that generation of p50 from this chimeric molecule is not due to a proteolytic cleavage that leaves the C-terminal Tax portion intact. We also used MG132 to confirm that, like the wild type p105, the processing of this chimeric protein is also mediated by the proteasome (Fig. 6D). Similar results were obtained when the C-terminal portion of p105 was replaced by human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 oncoprotein (data not shown). Removal of the C-terminal IKK and SCF β TrCP Target Sequences Does Not Significantly Enhance p50 Generation—Removal of the C-terminal portion of NF-κB 2 p100 containing the IKK and SCFβTrCP target sequences enhances p52 production in resting cells, suggesting that the C terminus of p100 negatively regulates p52 production (19Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Fig. 7A). Although the C-terminal counterpart of p105 is not required for p50 generation, it is not clear whether removal of this region will actually enhance p50 production. To test this possibility, we expressed a p105 deletion mutant (Δ800–971), which lacks the binding sites for IKK and SCFβTrCP complexes, and we compared the level of p50 generated from this mutant with that from the wild type. The level of p50 generated from the mutant and from the wild type p105 was virtually the same (Fig. 7B). This observation, together with studies performed in transfected cells and the IKK-knockout cells (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Beinke S. Belich M.P. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24162-24168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 36Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that the C-terminal degradation signal does not play a significant role for p50 biogenesis. In this report, we used both in vivo and in vitro approaches to demonstrate that the inherent structures of the RHD are important for p50 to survive the proteasomal processing. By using NF-κB 1 proteins carrying either composite point mutations or small deletions, we showed that when the RHD is destabilized by these mutations, the processing fails to generate p50. Detection of the low abundance of sd1-containing fragments from the mutants suggests that such failure is due to degradation of the entire N-terminal portion that normally survives to become p50. Generation of p50 was also being successfully recapitulated in vitro, using the ClpAP/XP system. These studies imply that it is the unique stable structures of the RHD, rather than the specificity of the proteasome, that is critical for p50 to survive the processing. At present, it is not clear how the RHD resists proteolysis. It is possible that the structures of the RHD render its resistance to the prerequisite step of the unfolding mediated by the energy-dependent proteases. It is also possible that the RHD can be unfolded but is rapidly refolded, precluding the domain from the proteolytic core. Future studies will be directed to resolve these questions. Our work further confirmed that proteolysis leading to p50 production initiates at an internal site, rather than at the C terminus of the p105 protein. First, a 530-residue of the N-terminal portion is sufficient to generate p50 (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the sd1-containing fragments are detected when this 530-residue fragment carries the Y267D/L269D mutations (Fig. 5). Second, besides the GRR, which is within the p50 protein, additional downstream sequences that span beyond the “cleavage site” are also important (Fig. 6). Although the sequences within this region are not well conserved among the p105 proteins of mice and humans, their function on regulation of p50 generation is likely to be similar. In addition to the chimeric protein experiments shown in Fig. 6 of this report, previous work (18Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) on domain swapping between p105 and p100 also helps to reach the same conclusion. NF-κB p52, unlike p50, is generated at a very low level in resting cells. However, replacing sequences downstream of the GRR in p52 with that of p50 enhances p52 production (18Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with previous finding in human p105 (31Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GRR, together with its downstream sequences, may serve as the processing “initiation site” where cellular factors bind and target this portion to the proteasome. Alternatively, this portion may be natively disordered and may directly interact with the proteasome, promoting its gating and the subsequent processing (20Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 37Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 38Rape M. Jentsch S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E113-E116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The findings that processing initiates at an internal location of the NF-κB 1 polypeptide, and that the C-terminal cis-elements do not contribute to p50 generation (Fig. 7), are consistent with our co-translational p50 biogenesis hypothesis. Eukaryotic polypeptides fold and form correct conformation cotranslationally (39Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Prior to completion of the p105 synthesis, the N-terminal RHD may have already folded into sufficiently stable structures that resist proteolysis. Because the cis-elements within p105 that render proteasomal processing are available before translation is completed, it is conceivable that processing may occur during translation of the NF-κB 1 polypeptide. Furthermore, the recent discovery of endoproteolytic activity of the proteasome (37Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) also suggests that processing a protein from an internal location is highly possible. The interaction of the N-terminal RHD and the C-terminal ankyrin repeats may block the access of cellular factors or the proteasome to this location (30Ciechanover A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Cohen S. Fajerman I. Israel A. Mercurio F. Kahana C. Schwartz A.L. Iwai K. Orian A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, de novo processing to generate p50 from p105 must have a mechanism that allows reaccess to this internal region of p105. Phosphorylation of the C terminus of p105 by the IKKs promotes mainly degradation of p105 and does not significantly contribute to p50 biogenesis. Although phosphorylation of the C terminus of p100 promotes p52 production (19Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), the C terminus of p100 does not serve as the initiation site for processing. p100 lacking the last 152 residues that include the binding sites for IKK and SCFβTrCP complexes exhibits elevated p52 production in resting cells (19Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal degradation signal negatively regulates p52 production. Therefore, it appears that phosphorylation of the C terminus of p100 may induce a conformational change of the protein that allows access of the cellular machinery to its internal processing initiation site. Although in this report we have not studied the RHD of p52, given that the NF-κB 1 and 2 proteins share extensive homologies and generation of p50 and p52 both require the proteasome, it is likely that the stability of p52 RHD is also critical for p52 biogenesis.
