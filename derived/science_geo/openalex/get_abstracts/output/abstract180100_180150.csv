https://openalex.org/W2077686302,"Carbon nanotubes weave their way into a range of imaginative macroscopic applications. The creation of continuous yarns made out of carbon nanotubes would enable macroscopic nanotube devices and structures to be constructed1,2. Here we show that carbon nanotubes can be self-assembled into yarns of up to 30 cm in length simply by being drawn out from superaligned arrays of carbon nanotubes, and that the strength and conductivity of these yarns can be enhanced by heating them at high temperatures. Our findings should help to translate the remarkable mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes to a macroscopic scale."

https://openalex.org/W2069071523,"Carbon monoxide (CO), a reaction product of the cytoprotective gene heme oxygenase, has been shown to be protective against organ injury in a variety of models. One potential mechanism whereby CO affords cytoprotection is through its anti-apoptotic properties. Our studies show that low level, exogenous CO attenuates anoxia-reoxygenation (A-R)-induced lung endothelial cell apoptosis. Exposure of primary rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells to minimal levels of CO inhibits apoptosis and enhances phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in A-R. Transfection of p38α dominant negative mutant or inhibition of p38 MAPK activity with SB203580 ablates the anti-apoptotic effects of CO in A-R. CO, through p38 MAPK, indirectly modulates caspase 3. Furthermore, we correlate our in vitro apoptosis model with an in vivo model of A-R by showing that CO can attenuate I-R injury of the lung. Taken together, our data are the first to demonstrate in models of A-R that the anti-apoptotic effects of CO are via modulation of p38 MAPK and caspase 3."

https://openalex.org/W2095912071,"We attempted establishing an in vitro coculture system by using human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) from androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and keratinocytes (KCs) to explore the role of androgens in hair growth regulation. Androgen showed no significant effect on the growth of KCs when they were cocultured with DPCs from AGA. Because the expressions of mRNA of androgen receptor (AR) decreased during subcultivation of DPCs in vitro, we transiently transfected the AR expression vector into the DPCs and cocultured them with KCs. In this modified coculture, androgen significantly suppressed the growth of KCs by approximately 50%, indicating that overexpression of AR can restore the responsiveness of the DPCs to androgen in vivo. We found that androgen stimulated the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in the cocultured DPCs. ELISA assays demonstrated that androgen treatment increased the secretion of both total and active TGF-beta1 in the conditioned medium. Moreover, the neutralizing anti-TGF-beta1 antibody reversed the androgen-elicited growth inhibition of KCs in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that androgen-inducible TGF-beta1 derived from DPCs of AGA is involved in epithelial cell growth suppression in our coculture system, providing the clue to understand the paradoxical effects of androgens for human hair growth."

These cords closely imitate the solid pre-capillary cords of embryonic angiogenesis, raising interesting questions about underlying mechanisms. Studies described here identify a critical mechanism beginning with collagen I ligation of integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by suppression of cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A, and marked induction of actin polymerization to form prominent stress fibers. In contrast to collagen I, laminin-1 neither suppressed cAMP nor protein kinase A activity nor induced actin polymerization or changes in cell shape. Moreover, fibroblasts did not respond to collagen I with changes in cAMP, actin polymerization, or cell shape, thus indicating that collagen signaling, as observed in endothelial cells, does not extend to all cell types. Pharmacological elevation of cAMP blocked collagen-induced actin polymerization and formation of cords by endothelial cells; conversely, pharmacological suppression of either cAMP or protein kinase A induced actin polymerization. Collectively, these studies identify a previously unrecognized and critical mechanism, involving suppression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and induction of actin polymerization, through which collagen I drives endothelial cell organization into multicellular pre-capillary cords.

This process has been studied extensively in the embryo, establishing that an early stage of angiogenesis involves transition of endothelial precursor cells to a spindle-shape morphology (1Drake C.J. Little C.D. J. Histochem.

Moreover, these cord-like structures are interconnected to form a polygonal network (1Drake C.J. Little C.D. J. Histochem.

Solid pre-capillary cords have also been observed during angiogenesis in the adult (5Aloisi M. Schiaffino S. Virch. Arch. Abt. B Zellpath. 1971; 8: 328-341PubMed Google Scholar). These solid cords subsequently mature into tubes with hollow lumens for the transport of blood (1Drake C.J. Little C.D. J. Histochem.

Within hours after addition of collagen I to confluent cultures, ECs partially retract and exhibit a spindle-shaped morphology, together with re-alignment to form solid cords organized in a polygonal pattern (6Delvos U.

Subsequently, over the course of several days, these structures mature to form tubes with hollow lumens through a process involving development and coalescence of intracellular vacuoles (11Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).Consistent with the importance of collagens in regulating EC shape and multicellular organization into pre-capillary cords, there exists considerable evidence that interactions between collagens and ECs are highly relevant in vivo. For example, in the developing embryo, blood vessels arise from the organization of EC precursors within an extracellular matrix rich in collagens. Furthermore, during angiogenesis in the adult, ECs within existing blood vessels degrade basement membrane (12Pettersson A. Nagy J.A. Brown L.F. Sundberg C. Morgan E. Jungles S. Carter R. Krieger J.E. Manseau E.J. Harvey V.S. Eckelhoefer I.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M. Mulligan R.C. Dvorak H.F. Lab.

Invest. 1991; 65: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the importance of collagen/EC interactions for angiogenesis, we reported previously that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces microvascular ECs (MVECs) to express integrins α1β1 and α2β1(14Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Both of these integrins are key collagen receptors on MVECs, and antagonism of these two integrins inhibits dermal and tumor angiogenesis in vivo (14Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 15Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Streit M. Koteliansky V.E. de Fougerolles A.R. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), consistent with the importance of interactions between collagens and ECs. Also, recent analyses of genes expressed in human tumor endothelium demonstrated that ECs isolated from tumors express >10-fold more transcripts encoding collagens type I and III than ECs isolated from corresponding control tissue, indicating that tumor ECs express their own interstitial collagens (16St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the interesting possibility that interstitial collagen expression by tumor ECs is conducive for angiogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, expression of collagen I by isolated EC clones in vitro closely correlates with spontaneous multicellular organization into cords (17Fouser L. Iruela-Arispe L. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18345-18351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Iruela-Arispe M.L. Hasselaar P. Sage H. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 174-186PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, neovascularization was inhibited in animal models both by proline analogues, which interfere with collagen triple helix assembly, and by β-aminopropionitrile, which inhibits collagen cross-linking (19Ingber D. Folkman J. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 44-51PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that collagens play a crucial role in angiogenesis.Despite the abundant evidence indicating that interstitial collagens and their receptors are important for angiogenesis, little is known regarding the signaling events and mechanisms through which collagen regulates EC morphology and multicellular alignment into cords. Therefore, we designed experiments to identify key mechanisms involved. Our studies identify a series of critical steps beginning with collagen binding to integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by α1β1- and α2β1-mediated suppression of cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and induction of actin polymerization.DISCUSSIONCollagen I provokes MVECs in vitro to assume a spindle-shaped morphology and to align into solid cord-like assemblies. These cords, which are organized in polygonal arrays, closely imitate the polygonal patterns of embryonic pre-capillary cords that precede the formation of mature blood vessels with lumens in vivo(1Drake C.J. Little C.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Drake C.J. Brandt S.J. Trusk T.C. Little C.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Vernon R.B. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar, 29Drake C.J. Hungerford J.E. Little C.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Experiments described here identify a previously unrecognized and critical mechanism through which collagen stimulates formation of cords. Specifically, these studies establish that collagen I drives MVECs to assemble into cords through ligation of integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by suppression of cAMP and suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA. Suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA induces actin polymerization and the formation of prominent F-actin stress fibers, which are required for cellular re-alignment into cords. Furthermore, collagen-induced actin polymerization in MVECs coincides with large reductions in G-actin, indicating that collagen I drives substantial polymerization of the free actin pool. Thus, by establishing a previously unrecognized and important connection between suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA and the induction of F-actin and MVEC alignment into cords, studies described here provide new understanding of the collagen-signaling mechanisms that regulate EC morphogenesis and multicellular organization.Our finding that cAMP negatively regulates actin polymerization and EC assembly into pre-capillary cords implicates cAMP as a key gatekeeper of EC organization during angiogenesis. Importantly, cAMP has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo (30Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), however, the possibility that cAMP functions in regulating multicellular organization of ECs during angiogenesis has not been considered previously. Moreover, our findings suggest the possibility that elevation of cAMP and PKA may provide for clinical control of neovascularization by interfering with the early organizational stages of blood vessel formation.Previously, the α2β1 integrin alone had been implicated in mediating collagen-induced cord formation by umbilical vein ECs (8Jackson C.J. Knop A. Giles I. Jenkins K. Schrieber L. Cell Biol. Int. 1994; 18: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) The apparent discrepancy between those findings and our observations, which also implicate integrin α1β1, is attributable to the fact that umbilical vein ECs do not express integrin α1β1 and that both α1β1 and α2β1are prominent collagen receptors on MVECs (14Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 31Defilippi P. van Hinsbergh V. Bertolotto A. Rossino P. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This distinction is important, because MVECs are derived from the small capillaries of the microvasculature, whereas umbilical vein ECs are derived from large veins. Thus, experiments described here indicate that both α1β1 and α2β1mediate collagen-induced morphogenesis in microvascular endothelium, whereas such function may be limited to the α2β1 integrin in large vessel endothelium, which does not express integrin α1β1.Although dermal fibroblasts express both the α1β1 and α2β1integrins, these cells did not respond to collagen I with changes in cAMP, actin polymerization, or cell shape. These findings illustrate marked differences in collagen signaling among cell types. Interestingly, such differences in collagen signaling may relate to the fact that fibroblasts normally reside within a collagen-rich matrix, whereas the MVECs of mature blood vessels are sequestered from interstitial collagen by basement membrane. Moreover, we found that laminin-1, a member of the laminin family of proteins which are major components of basement membranes (32Engvall E. Wewer U.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), did not suppress cAMP or initiate cord formation by MVECs, indicating that the responses of MVECs to collagen and laminin are distinctly different.Stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with collagen I also has been reported to suppress intracellular cAMP (34Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin, which prevents inhibition of adenylate cyclase by heterotrimeric Gi proteins, blocked collagen suppression of cAMP in these cells, implicating Gi proteins in the mechanism (34Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we found that collagen I suppressed cAMP substantially in MVECs treated with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml, preincubated overnight) even though pertussis toxin elevated baseline cAMP in these cells (data not shown). Thus, we found no evidence that collagen I suppresses cAMP in MVECs through activation of Gi, and therefore it seems likely that collagen I regulates cAMP in MVECs differently than in smooth muscle cells. The possibility remains that collagen I suppresses cAMP in MVECs through activation of phosphodiesterases. Integrin α6β4 has been shown to activate phosphodiesterase activity in carcinoma cells (35O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and other integrins may also stimulate degradation of cAMP through this mechanism. Alternatively, collagen receptors may regulate cAMP metabolism through other mechanisms, consistent with the complexity of integrin signaling (36Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 37Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 39Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Finally, data presented here raise the interesting question of how cAMP exerts negative control over actin polymerization in MVECs. The answer to this question may prove complex, because cAMP-dependent PKA regulates the activities of numerous proteins, including several that are implicated in cytoskeletal regulation (40Iyengar R. Science. 1996; 271: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Regardless, experiments described here identify a previously unrecognized regulatory role for cAMP in controlling actin polymerization and cord formation by microvascular endothelium.In conclusion and summary, experiments described here identify an important mechanism through which collagen I provokes MVECs to form solid cord-like structures. These cords closely imitate the solid pre-capillary cords that appear during the early stages of angiogenesisin vivo. The signaling events through which collagen induces cord formation by MVECs begins with ligation of integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by suppression of cAMP and cAMP-dependent PKA. In turn, suppression of PKA induces actin polymerization, which is required for EC alignment and organization into cords. In contrast to dermal MVECs, dermal fibroblasts do not respond to collagen I with changes in cAMP, F-actin, or cell shape, underscoring important distinctions in collagen signaling among cell types. Although it has long been recognized that collagen I provokes ECs to initiate a morphogenetic program leading to the formation of pre-capillary cords, underlying signaling mechanisms had not been defined. Collectively, studies reported here identify a critical mechanism, and they identify cAMP as a key regulator of EC morphogenesis and multicellular organization. During angiogenesis, proliferating endothelial cells (ECs)1 organize to form new three-dimensional capillary networks. This process has been studied extensively in the embryo, establishing that an early stage of angiogenesis involves transition of endothelial precursor cells to a spindle-shape morphology (1Drake C.J.

Experiments described here identify a previously unrecognized and critical mechanism through which collagen stimulates formation of cords. Specifically, these studies establish that collagen I drives MVECs to assemble into cords through ligation of integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by suppression of cAMP and suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA. Suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA induces actin polymerization and the formation of prominent F-actin stress fibers, which are required for cellular re-alignment into cords. Furthermore, collagen-induced actin polymerization in MVECs coincides with large reductions in G-actin, indicating that collagen I drives substantial polymerization of the free actin pool. Thus, by establishing a previously unrecognized and important connection between suppression of cAMP-dependent PKA and the induction of F-actin and MVEC alignment into cords, studies described here provide new understanding of the collagen-signaling mechanisms that regulate EC morphogenesis and multicellular organization.Our finding that cAMP negatively regulates actin polymerization and EC assembly into pre-capillary cords implicates cAMP as a key gatekeeper of EC organization during angiogenesis. Importantly, cAMP has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo (30Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), however, the possibility that cAMP functions in regulating multicellular organization of ECs during angiogenesis has not been considered previously. Moreover, our findings suggest the possibility that elevation of cAMP and PKA may provide for clinical control of neovascularization by interfering with the early organizational stages of blood vessel formation.Previously, the α2β1 integrin alone had been implicated in mediating collagen-induced cord formation by umbilical vein ECs (8Jackson C.J. Knop A. Giles I. Jenkins K. Schrieber L. Cell Biol. Int. 1994; 18: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) The apparent discrepancy between those findings and our observations, which also implicate integrin α1β1, is attributable to the fact that umbilical vein ECs do not express integrin α1β1 and that both α1β1 and α2β1are prominent collagen receptors on MVECs (14Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 31Defilippi P. van Hinsbergh V. Bertolotto A. Rossino P. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This distinction is important, because MVECs are derived from the small capillaries of the microvasculature, whereas umbilical vein ECs are derived from large veins. Thus, experiments described here indicate that both α1β1 and α2β1mediate collagen-induced morphogenesis in microvascular endothelium, whereas such function may be limited to the α2β1 integrin in large vessel endothelium, which does not express integrin α1β1.Although dermal fibroblasts express both the α1β1 and α2β1integrins, these cells did not respond to collagen I with changes in cAMP, actin polymerization, or cell shape. These findings illustrate marked differences in collagen signaling among cell types. Interestingly, such differences in collagen signaling may relate to the fact that fibroblasts normally reside within a collagen-rich matrix, whereas the MVECs of mature blood vessels are sequestered from interstitial collagen by basement membrane. Moreover, we found that laminin-1, a member of the laminin family of proteins which are major components of basement membranes (32Engvall E. Wewer U.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), did not suppress cAMP or initiate cord formation by MVECs, indicating that the responses of MVECs to collagen and laminin are distinctly different.Stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with collagen I also has been reported to suppress intracellular cAMP (34Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin, which prevents inhibition of adenylate cyclase by heterotrimeric Gi proteins, blocked collagen suppression of cAMP in these cells, implicating Gi proteins in the mechanism (34Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we found that collagen I suppressed cAMP substantially in MVECs treated with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml, preincubated overnight) even though pertussis toxin elevated baseline cAMP in these cells (data not shown). Thus, we found no evidence that collagen I suppresses cAMP in MVECs through activation of Gi, and therefore it seems likely that collagen I regulates cAMP in MVECs differently than in smooth muscle cells. The possibility remains that collagen I suppresses cAMP in MVECs through activation of phosphodiesterases. Integrin α6β4 has been shown to activate phosphodiesterase activity in carcinoma cells (35O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and other integrins may also stimulate degradation of cAMP through this mechanism. Alternatively, collagen receptors may regulate cAMP metabolism through other mechanisms, consistent with the complexity of integrin signaling (36Hynes R.O.

Finally, data presented here raise the interesting question of how cAMP exerts negative control over actin polymerization in MVECs. The answer to this question may prove complex, because cAMP-dependent PKA regulates the activities of numerous proteins, including several that are implicated in cytoskeletal regulation (40Iyengar R. Science. 1996; 271: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Regardless, experiments described here identify a previously unrecognized regulatory role for cAMP in controlling actin polymerization and cord formation by microvascular endothelium.In conclusion and summary, experiments described here identify an important mechanism through which collagen I provokes MVECs to form solid cord-like structures. These cords closely imitate the solid pre-capillary cords that appear during the early stages of angiogenesisin vivo. The signaling events through which collagen induces cord formation by MVECs begins with ligation of integrins α1β1 and α2β1, followed by suppression of cAMP and cAMP-dependent PKA. In turn, suppression of PKA induces actin polymerization, which is required for EC alignment and organization into cords. In contrast to dermal MVECs, dermal fibroblasts do not respond to collagen I with changes in cAMP, F-actin, or cell shape, underscoring important distinctions in collagen signaling among cell types. Although it has long been recognized that collagen I provokes ECs to initiate a morphogenetic program leading to the formation of pre-capillary cords, underlying signaling mechanisms had not been defined. Collectively, studies reported here identify a critical mechanism, and they identify cAMP as a key regulator of EC morphogenesis and multicellular organization. Collagen I provokes MVECs in vitro to assume a spindle-shaped morphology and to align into solid cord-like assemblies. These cords, which are organized in polygonal arrays, closely imitate the polygonal patterns of embryonic pre-capillary cords that precede the formation of mature blood vessels with lumens in vivo(1Drake C.J.

Fibrillin assembly involves complex multistep mechanisms to result in a periodical head-to-tail alignment in microfibrils. Impaired assembly potentially plays a role in the molecular pathogenesis of genetic disorders caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (Marfan syndrome) and fibrillin-2 (congenital contractural arachnodactyly). Presently, the basic molecular interactions involved in fibrillin assembly are obscure. Here, we have generated recombinant full-length human fibrillin-1, and two overlapping recombinant polypeptides spanning the entire human fibrillin-2 in a mammalian expression system. Characterization by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy after rotary shadowing, and reactivity with antibodies demonstrated correct folding of these recombinant polypeptides. Analyses of homotypic and heterotypic interaction repertoires showed N- to C-terminal binding of fibrillin-1, and of fibrillin-1 with fibrillin-2. The interactions were of high affinity with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range. However, the N- and C-terminal fibrillin-2 polypeptides did not interact with each other. These results demonstrate that fibrillins can directly interact in an N- to C-terminal fashion to form homotypic fibrillin-1 or heterotypic fibrillin-1/fibrillin-2 microfibrils. This conclusion was further strengthened by double immunofluorescence labeling of microfibrils. In addition, the binding epitopes as well as the entire fibrillin molecules displayed very stable properties.

Although it is clear that one of the basic functions of fibrillins is the formation of the microfibrillar backbone through a complex multistep assembly mechanism, the functional importance for the associated proteins is presently obscure.Fibrillins consist of characteristic extracellular repetitive domains such as the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains (cbEGF) also found in many other extracellular proteins, and the 8-cysteine-containing domains (8-CYS) found exclusively in fibrillins and LTBPs (4Zhang H.

Based on this homology, one would predict a similar mechanistic basis and architecture for the supramolecular assembly of both fibrillins. Whether fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 have intrinsic properties to self-assemble into homotypic or heterotypic microfibrils or both is not clear at present. Based on developmental studies, it is intelligible that adult tissues chiefly contain homotypic fibrillin-1 microfibrils, because fibrillin-2 generally is expressed early during mammalian embryogenesis and tends to disappear later (14Zhang H., Hu, W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, during development fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 often coincide in many tissues such as skin, lung, heart, aorta, central nervous system anlage, but are individually expressed in certain regions of kidney, liver, rib anlagen, and elastic cartilage (4Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D., Hu, W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 15Quondamatteo, F., Reinhardt, D. P., Charbonneau, N. L., Pophal, G., Sakai, L. Y., and Herken, R. (2002) Matrix Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In situations where both fibrillins are expressed simultaneously, it is theoretically possible that each fibrillin isoform forms separate homotypic fibrils or both isoforms together form heterotypic microfibrils. Different organization of fibrillins in tissues have different functional consequences that may be relevant in pathological situations.Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) on chromosome 15 and fibrillin-2 (FBN2) on chromosome 5 are responsible for the genetic disorders Marfan syndrome (MFS, MIM no. 154700) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (MIM no. 121050), respectively (for recent reviews, see Refs. 16Robinson P.N. Godfrey M. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and 17Milewicz D.M. Urban Z. Boyd C. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although these autosomal dominant disorders share some skeletal complications such as arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and chest deformities, the cardiovascular and ocular features characteristic for MFS are typically absent in congenital contractural arachnodactyly. How mutant fibrillin-1 and -2 molecules exert dominant negative effects in these disorders is presently unknown. Certain lines of evidence point to the possibility that fibrillin assembly mechanisms are compromised. For instance, pulse-chase and immunofluorescence experiments have revealed reduced amounts of mutant fibrillin-1 deposited into the extracellular matrix of many fibroblast strains obtained from individuals with MFS (18Milewicz D.

These data suggest that many mutations in fibrillin-1 impair the ability to assemble into microfibrils. Similar analyses of fibrillin-2 mutations in cell culture are presently lacking.Aggregation of small N-terminal regions of fibrillins in recombinant systems has suggested that homotypic dimerization is involved in the multistep assembly mechanism of fibrillins (22Ashworth J.L.

Despite the unresolved controversy whether fibrillin molecules are arranged in a nonstaggered or in a staggered fashion, common to all models is a head-to-tail arrangement of fibrillin molecules originally proposed by Sakai and co-workers in 1991 (25Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mapping of monoclonal antibody epitopes in fibrillin-1 molecules and correlation with the epitopes in microfibrils revealed that the N- and the C-terminal ends of the fibrillin molecules are located in or close to the bead structures (25Sakai L.Y.

However, it is not clear whether microfibrillar backbone formation requires fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 to directly interact with themselves and with each other, or requires adapter molecules to connect fibrillin molecules in a head-to-tail fashion.Here, we have analyzed in detail the spectrum of homotypic and heterotypic molecular interactions of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. The results demonstrate direct head-to-tail interactions of fibrillin-1 alone, and of fibrillin-1 with fibrillin-2. However, fibrillin-2 alone was not able to self-interact in a N- to C-terminal fashion, indicating a different assembly mechanism for fibrillin-2. The results presented suggest that fibrillins are able to form microfibrils in a direct head-to-tail fashion without the aid of adapter molecules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Human Fibrillin-2 cDNAHuman fibrillin-2 cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of total RNA isolated from MG-63 cells (American Type Culture Collection) using the antisense (as) primers specified below. The obtained cDNAs were used as templates for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using the same antisense primers in combination with appropriate sense (s) primers (see below) and the high fidelity polymerase Pfx (Invitrogen). The 5′ fragment rFBN2–0s (nt 1–1782) was synthesized by PCR amplification using primers 0s (5′-ATTACCGCTAGCAACGGCTCGGCATCATGGGGAGAAGACGGAGGC-3′) and 0as (5′-ATCTGAGTTCACGCATCGACC-3′), which introduced a Kozak sequence and a NheI recognition site for cloning at the 5′ end. Primer pairs 5s (5′-TAGACACTAATGAGTGTGTCGC-3′) and 8as (5′-GAGGTTGAACTTCATGTTGACG-3′); 1s (5′-GGAAGCTTCAAATGCCGTTGC-3′) and 4as (5′-GACAGATGCATCTGAAGGATCC-3′); and 9s (5′-ACCTGTCACTGGATACAGAGG-3′) and 9as (5′-TTCAAAGTCTAAGACAGGGAGG-3′) were used to amplify fragment rFBN2–1g (nt 6041–8424), rFBN2–4a (nt 3277–6127), and rFBN2–9s (nt 8288–8872), respectively. All PCR products were cloned into the pCR-BluntII plasmid (Invitrogen). The remaining portions (nt 432–3317) of the fibrillin-2 cDNA originated from a construct (pBS-UPΦ22–3) described previously (30Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cDNAs from these constructs were combined to a full-length fibrillin-2 construct in several steps within the pBluescript II SK(+) plasmid using appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc.). The resulting plasmid, pBS-rFBN2full, contained fibrillin-2 cDNA positions 1–8872. The entire sequence of the fibrillin-2 cDNA was obtained by commercial sequencing (Agowa, Berlin, Germany). Differences to the published fibrillin-2 sequence (NM_001999; Refs. 4Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D., Hu, W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J.

For homology comparisons of amino acid sequences, GenBank NM_000138 (human fibrillin-1) and AB053450 (human fibrillin-3) have been used (shaded letters). Open table in a new tab Construction of Expression PlasmidsFibrillin-2 ConstructsTo construct an expression plasmid for the C-terminal half of human fibrillin-2 (rFBN2-C, positions 1531–2771), the NheI-NotI 9028-bp fragment from pBS-rFBN2full was subcloned into theNheI-NotI-restricted expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pcDNA-rFBN2full. To add a sequence for a 6-histidine tag and a stop codon at the 3′ end, template rFBN2–1g was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 7s (5′-TTTTGGGTCCTATGAATGCACG-3′) and 14as (5′-ATCCGAATCAGCGGCCGCTCACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTTAGAATAGCCGTTGATTTTGC-3′). The 1483-bp Bsu36I-NotI fragment of the resulting PCR product was ligated into theBsu36I-NotI-restricted pcDNA-rFBN2full, resulting in plasmid pcDNA-rFBN2full-his. The 6-histidine tag and the stop codon replaced the sequence for part of the C-terminal unique domain from position 2772 to 2911. To modify the 5′ end of the construct, template rFBN2–4a was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 15s (5′-CGTAGCTAGCAGATATTGATGAGTGTGCAGATCC-3′) and 15as (5′-CTGCTACTCGAGAGCGGCCGCTCACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATGCAGTTGTGGCCTCCATTGACC-3′). A 460-bp BbvCI-NheI fragment of the PCR product was ligated into theBbvCI-NheI-restricted pcDNA-rFBN2full-his, resulting in plasmid pcDNA-rFBN2-C-his. TheXbaI-NheI-restricted sequence from plasmid pBS-BM40 coding for the signal peptide of the human BM40 protein, which confers efficient expression and secretion of the expressed protein, was fused via the NheI site at the 5′ site of the construct. The resulting plasmid was designated pDNSP-rFBN2-C. Expression and processing resulted in the secretion of a protein (rFBN2-C) with additional 4 N-terminal and 6 C-terminal amino acid residues preceding and following the authentic domains (Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp1531–Lys2771-(His)6).To prepare the plasmid coding for the N-terminal half of human fibrillin-2 (rFBN2-N, position 1–1732), the PCR product described above for the C-terminal construct was restricted by XhoI (479 bp) and inserted into the XhoI-restricted plasmid pcDNA-rFBN2full-his, resulting in pcDNA-rFBN2-N. Expression of this plasmid resulted in a protein (rFBN2-N) that includes the sequence for the authentic fibrillin-2 signal peptide and a 6-histidine tag at the C-terminal end (Met1–Met1732-(His)6). The most likely prediction for the cleavage site of the signal peptide in fibrillin-2 is between position 28 and 29 (Thr-Ala-Gly28↓Gln29-Pro) (32Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Therefore, the secreted protein likely starts at position 29. Correct ligation of all constructs have been verified by DNA sequencing.Fibrillin-1 ConstructsThe expression plasmids to express the N-terminal half (pDNSP-rF16) and the C-terminal half (pcDNA-rF6H) of human fibrillin-1 have been described in detail previously (33Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both plasmids have been utilized to construct an expression vector for full-length human fibrillin-1 as follows. A 3869-bp NotI-ApaI fragment was excised from plasmid pcDNA-rF6H and subcloned intoNotI-ApaI-restricted pDNSP-rF16. A 320-bp duplicated fragment was removed by restriction with PmlI, followed by religation of the plasmid. The resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA-rFBN1 and produces a secreted polypeptide (rFBN1) with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Ser19–Lys2725-(His)6. The correct DNA sequences at the restriction sites utilized have been verified by DNA sequencing.Transfection of Cells and Identification of Recombinant ClonesFor stable expression, the expression plasmids were linearized by PvuI restriction and transfected into human embryonic kidney cell 293 (American Type Culture Collection) using established methods (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). 10 h after transfection, selection was started with 500 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) and continued for 1 week. Thereafter, the concentration of G418 was reduced to 250 μg/ml. After ∼4 weeks, individual clones were transferred into 24-well plates and propagated to confluence. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the wells were incubated with serum-free culture medium (1 ml) for 2 days. Identification of clones expressing the recombinant proteins was achieved by conventional gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies against the expressed proteins. Typically, 50–80% of the analyzed clones stably expressed the recombinant proteins.Production of Recombinant ProteinsStably transfected cell clones were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For large scale production, the clones were propagated in triple layered flasks (Nalge Nunc International) to confluence; washed twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2; and incubated with serum-free culture medium for 48 h. The conditioned medium (2–2.5 liters) was harvested, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fluka), and concentrated to ∼50 ml by ultrafiltration (YM30 membranes, Millipore). After dialysis against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mNaCl (equilibration buffer), the medium was passed over a High-Trap chelating column loaded with Co2+ (1-ml column size,Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column with equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient in equilibration buffer (0–250 mm imidazole in 30 ml) and fractioned in 1-ml aliquots. The fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and by Western blot analyses. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS).Quantification of Protein ConcentrationsAliquots (50 μl) were supplemented with 450 μl of 6.67m guanidine HCl in TBS and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance at 280 nm was determined on a Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Calculation of the molar extinction coefficient followed an established method (ε =n Trp × 5500 + n Tyr × 1490 + n Cys-S-S-Cys × 125 [m−1 × cm−1]) (35Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar).Alternatively, protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analyses. The proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl under N2 for 24 h at 110 °C, and the amino acid composition was determined on a Biochrom 20 analyzer (Biochrom).Circular Dichroism MeasurementsThe purified recombinant proteins in TBS were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Spectra from 190 to 260 nm were recorded at 20 and 100 °C in a 1-mm quartz cuvette on a Jasco J-715 instrument.Electron MicroscopyPurified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 100 mm NH4HCO3 and adjusted to concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml. The samples were diluted with 0.05% (v/v) acetic acid to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml and mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) glycerol. The samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica from a distance of 25 cm and dried under vacuum for 2–3 h in an Edwards Auto 306 vacuum coater (Edwards). Rotary shadowing was performed by platinum evaporation for 15 s, 50 mA, 2.5 kV at an angle of 5° and a distance of 12 cm, followed by carbon evaporation for 2 s, 100 mA, 2.5 kV at an angle of 90°. The replicas were floated onto a very clean surface of distilled water and then supported using 400-mesh copper grids. Replicas were examined at 100 kV in a transmission electron microscope (Zeiss TEM 109).AntibodiesPolyclonal antisera were produced in rabbits commercially (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany) against the recombinant polypeptides rFBN2-N, rFBN2-C, and an ∼110-kDa N-terminal fragment of human fibrillin-2, rF37, described previously (30Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The antisera were characterized by a standard ELISA technique. Generation and properties of anti-human fibrillin-1 polyclonal antisera B9543 and α-rF6H, as well as the specificity of monoclonal anti-human fibrillin-2 antibody mAb 48 have been described elsewhere (36Pereira L.

Sakai (Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland, OR).Protein Interaction AssaysSolid Phase Binding AssayMultiwell plates (96 wells, MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc International) were coated overnight with purified recombinant proteins (10 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in TBS at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS. Each of the following incubations was performed in TBS/5% nonfat milk including either 5 mm CaCl2or 10 mm EDTA at room temperature (∼ 20 °C) and was followed by three washes with TBS including 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Coated proteins were incubated with serial dilutions (1:3) of the soluble ligands (0.14–100 μg/ml) for 2 h. Incubation (1.5 h) with the primary polyclonal antibodies (1:200–1:1250 diluted) against the soluble ligands was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:800 diluted; Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h. Color development was performed with 1 mg/ml 5-aminosalicylic acid (Sigma) in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8, including 0.1% H2O2 for 3–5 min and stopped by adding 2m NaOH. Color yields were determined at 492 nm using a Microplate EL310 (Bio-Tek Instruments).To determine the stability of fibrillin interaction epitopes, the immobilized or the soluble binding ligands were heat-treated in discrete steps between 20 and 95 °C for 10 min and then used in the above described solid phase binding assay.Kinetic Binding StudiesFor kinetic binding studies of recombinant fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 fragments by surface plasmon resonance, a Biacore biosensor was used (Biacore 3000; Biacore AB). Purified recombinant fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 fragments were biotinylated using activated NHS-LC-biotin as instructed by the supplier (Pierce). Biotinylated fragments were coupled in TBS to a streptavidin sensor chip SA (Pioneer), which resulted in 1000–2500 response units. Binding studies were performed with soluble recombinant fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-2 fragments in concentrations of 12.5–1000 nm in TBS at flow rates of 10 μl/min. The binding sites of the immobilized ligands were regenerated by injection of a mixture of detergents (0.075% (v/v) each of CHAPS, Zwittergent 3–12, Tween 80, Tween 20, Triton X-100) after each cycle. After subtraction of the blank curves, representing binding to bovine serum albumin, the association and dissociation rate constants were determined by separateka/kd fitting all curves at once with the 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation software version 3.0, Biacore AB). Although this model produced the best fits, the observed interactions probably diverge somewhat from the 1:1 binding model because kavalues slightly decreased with increasing concentrations of the soluble ligands. Mass transfer limitations were not apparent.ImmunofluorescencePrimary dermal fibroblasts from a 1-year-old individual and primary osteoblasts from a 42-year-old individual were cultivated in the first (fibroblasts) or fourth (osteoblasts) passage using culture conditions as described above for the recombinant cell clones. Confluent cells were trypsinized and seeded at densities of 7.5 × 104 cells/well of a 8-well chamber slide (Permanox; Nalge Nunc International). After 4 days, the cells were washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% (v/v) methanol, 30% (v/v) acetone for 5 min, and rehydrated in PBS. The nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1:10 diluted normal goat serum for 30 min. The cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-fibrillin-2 antibody mAb 48 (1:200) and the polyclonal anti-fibrillin-1 α-rF6H (1:400) in PBS for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS. After incubation with 1:200 diluted goat anti-rabbit fluorescein conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), the fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 networks were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with a Axioplan microscope (Zeiss). Digital images were recorded using a 3CCD color video camera (Sony) and AxioVision software version 3.0 (Zeiss).RESULTSTo generate recombinant human fibrillin-2 fragments, the human fibrillin-2 cDNA was cloned from MG-63 cells.

To determine how the chondrocyte-specific expression of the COL9A1 gene is regulated, we have begun to characterize the upstream chondrocyte-specific promoter region of the human COL9A1 gene. Transient-transfection analyses performed in rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells, human chondrosarcoma (HTB) cells, and NIH/3T3 cells showed that the COL9A1 promoter was active in RCS cells but not HTB or NIH/3T3 cells. Inclusion of the first intron had no effect on promoter activity. In transient-transfection analyses with promoter deletion constructs, it was found that full promoter activity in RCS cells depended on the region from −560 bp to +130 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (+1). Sequence analysis of the region from −890 bp to the transcriptional start predicted five putative SOX/Sry-binding sites. Mutation analysis revealed that two of three putative SOX/Sry binding sites within the −560 to +130 bp region are responsible for most of the COL9A1 promoter activity in RCS cells. Co-transfection experiments with a SOX9 expression plasmid revealed that a construct containing the five putative SOX/Sry-binding sites was transactivated 20- to 30-fold in both HTB and NIH/3T3 cells. Further co-transfection experiments showed that two of the SOX/Sry-binding sites located within the −560 to +130 bp region were required for full transactivation. However, mutation and deletion analyses indicated that a region from −560 to −357 bp, which does not contain any other conspicuous SOX9 sites, is also important for full promoter activity.

Sry-type HMG box electrophoretic mobility-shift assay rat chondrosarcoma human chondrosarcoma The chondrocyte is responsible for the precise production of several different types of cartilage tissues in the developing vertebrate; including growth plate cartilage, articular cartilage, and the cartilage of the ear and trachea. In each of these situations, the elaboration of a complex and extensive extracellular matrix, which is the main functional component of cartilaginous tissues, is crucial. The expression of extracellular matrix molecules by chondrocytes must, therefore, be tightly and coordinately controlled at the level of both synthesis and degradation to ensure that the matrix is properly constructed and maintained. Part of this control occurs at the level of the regulation of chondrocyte-specific gene expression. The best studied gene in this regard is the COL2A1 gene, which gives rise to the main fibrillar collagen in the cartilage matrix. The expression of the COL2A1 gene is controlled through transcription factors that interact with both the promoter and the chondrocyte-specific enhancer located within the first intron (1Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B.

Despite the wealth of information concerning the control of expression of the COL2A1 gene, relatively little is known about the transcriptional regulation of other chondrocyte-specific collagen genes, including those encoding collagens that interact with type II collagen, such as types IX and XI (11Mendler M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Collagen IX is a member of a subfamily of collagens termed fibril-associated collagens with interrupted-triple helices (FACITs) that also include collagens XII, XIV, XVI, and XIX (13Shaw L.M. Olsen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Olsen B.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Collagen IX is a heterotrimeric molecule composed of three polypeptide chains (α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX)) each containing three collagenous domains (COL1–3) interrupted by four non-triple-helical domains (NC1–NC4) (15Van der Rest M.

Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, New York1987: 195-221Google Scholar). The NC1, NC2, and NC3 domains are of similar size in all three chains, whereas the NC4 domain of the α1(IX) chain is much larger than in the α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains (17Kimura T. Mattei M.G.

Biochem. 1990; 192: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indeed, the NC4 domain of the α1(IX) chain is encoded by exons 1–8 in the COL9A1 gene, which are expressed through the use of the cartilage-specific promoter region studied in the present work (19Muragaki Y.

A second promoter, located between exons 6 and 7, is utilized in other tissues to express a short form of the α1(IX) chain that lacks the large NC4 domain (19Muragaki Y. Nishimura I. Henney A.

Interestingly, mice that lack type IX collagen develop normally but exhibit a late-onset form of joint degeneration similar to osteoarthritis, suggesting a stabilizing role for type IX collagen in cartilage (21Fassler R.

The purpose of this study was to examine the regulatory elements located within the proximal promoter region of the humanCOL9A1 gene in chondrocytic cells. We found that a 976-bp promoter fragment from the human COL9A1 gene was able to drive expression of reporter genes in RCS cells. We also found that this promoter region can be transactivated to high levels by SOX9 in nonchondrocytic NIH/3T3 and human chondrosarcoma cells (HTB). We show that the SOX9 transactivation depends on two of five putative SOX/Sry-binding sites by mutational analysis and that a third region that does not contain any obvious SOX/Sry-binding sites is also important for full promoter activity. Finally, we provide evidence that SOX9 can interact with one of the functionally active aforementioned SOX/Sry-binding sites. Rat chondrosarcoma cells (RCS) were a kind gift from Dr. Benoit de Crombrugghe (23Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). HTB human chondrosarcoma cells (SW1353) and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high glucose), 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). Cells were split at 70–80% confluence, and the medium was replaced every 3–4 days. The human COL9A1proximal promoter region and first intron were obtained by PCR using a P1 phage clone (P1-A) that contains the 5′ region of the humanCOL9A1 gene (a kind gift from Dr. Lena Ala-Kokko; ref. 20Pihlajamaa T.

For the promoter region: primer DS37, 5′-GATCGAATTCAGTAGGGGGCTTGATGTTA-3′ (forward) and primer DS38, 5′-GATCCTCGAGTTCCCAGTTGATTTTCTTTG-3′ (reverse), and for the first intron: primer DS39, 5′-GATCGTCGACAAGACAATAACCCTGGAAAGA-3′ (forward) and primer DS40, 5′-GATCAAGCTTTGAAACAGGAGTCCCCGCAGA-3′ (reverse). The primers for the promoter region contained an EcoRI and aXhoI site, respectively, and the primers for the first intron contained a SalI and a HindIII site, respectively, to facilitate cloning. The PCR-generated promoter fragment (976 bp) contained the region from −846 to +130 relative to the transcriptional start site, and the first intron fragment (807 bp) contained from position +1037 to +1843 in the human COL9A1gene sequence (excluding the splice-site sequences) (20Pihlajamaa T. Vuoristo M.M. Annunen S. Perala M. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The promoter fragment was cloned into the NheI-XhoI sites of the pGL3basic luciferase-reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the full-length 846Luc promoter construct. To generate the 846LucInt construct, the intron fragment was cloned into theHindIII-SalI sites of 846Luc. The variousCOL9A1 promoter-deletion constructs were generated by PCR using different forward primers (see below) in combination with the same reverse primer (DS38, see above). For construct 588Luc, 5′-AATGATTGTTGGGTGTTAGAC-3′; for construct 560Luc, 5′-GATCGCTAGCCTTTGATACCTCATTT-3′; for construct 357Luc, 5′-GTGGGCACATTTTTACTGGA-3′; for construct 167Luc, 5′-TTCCCCTGTAAATCCCTCCTTC-3′, and for construct 107Luc, 5′-GATCGCTAGCCTGGGCTCAGAGCGCT-3′. In the case of the primers for constructs 560Luc and 107Luc, NheI sites were placed into the 5′ end to facilitate cloning. The deletion-PCR products for 588Luc, 357Luc, and 167Luc were cloned into the SmaI-XhoI sites of pGL3basic, and the PCR products for 560Luc and 107Luc were cloned into the NheI-XhoI sites of pGL3basic. For the pGL3ProC construct, an 85-bp PCR product encompassing the region from −559 to −475 was cloned into the pGL3promoter vector (Promega), which contains the SV40 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene. The pGL3ProD construct was made in a similar manner by inserting a 96-bp PCR fragment encompassing the region from −356 to −261 into the pGL3promoter vector. All PCR products were verified by sequencing on an ABI automatic DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Seven to ten μg of the various COL9A1 reporter constructs, 2 μg of the SOX expression vectors (a kind gift from Dr. Veronique Lefebvre, 6), and 2 μg of the pCMVβ reporter vector (Clontech), as a control for transfection efficiency, were co-transfected into either RCS, HTB, or NIH/3T3 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using the Profection kit (Promega). The cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 10 cm2 dish. The DNA-CaPO4 precipitate was left on the cells for 16–18 h, after which the cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of fresh media. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested and luciferase assays were performed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Turner Designs TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). β-Galactosidase assays were performed spectrophotometrically with a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Protein concentrations in the cell lysates were determined using the Coomassie Blue protein assay (Pierce). Luciferase activity was normalized to both β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration. Transfection data represent at least two independent experiments each performed in triplicate, except where indicated. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nuc. Acid. Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) using the CellLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, cells were placed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES [pH 7.9], 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Igeapal CA-630 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3,300 ×g for 30 s at 4 °C and extracted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgC12, 0.2 mmEDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4 °C by gentle shaking. The extract was then centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, 1.4 pm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido [4-guanidinobutane], 130 pm bestatin, 1 μmleupeptin, and 0.3 pm aprotinin; Sigma-Aldrich). Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as previously described with minor modifications (25Stokes D.G. Liu G. Dharmavaram R. Hawkins D. Piera-Velazquez S. Jimenez S. Biochem. J. 2001; 340: 461-470Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions consisted of 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50–100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg poly(dG-dC), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 ng of 32P-end labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, and 10–15 μg of nuclear protein. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 21 °C and then loaded onto 4% acrylamide-0.25× Tris borate-EDTA gels and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2 h. For competition analyses, 50-fold excess of cold-competitor probe was included in the binding reaction. For super-shift analyses, 3 μl of a rabbit polyclonal anti-SOX9 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Veronique Lefebvre; Ref. 6Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) was included in the binding reaction. A luciferase reporter gene construct (846Luc) containing a 976-bpCOL9A1 gene fragment that includes 846 bp of the promoter and 130 bp of the first exon (up to but not including the ATG initiation codon) (Fig. 1 A) was transfected into RCS, HTB chondrosarcoma, and NIH/3T3 cells to determine the relative promoter activity as compared with the pGL3basic vector (no promoter). The 846Luc construct exhibited a high level of promoter activity in the chondrocytic RCS cells (∼18-fold over the vector alone, Fig. 1 B), however, in HTB and NIH/3T3 cells, the COL9A1 promoter activity was substantially lower (Fig. 1 B). To examine whether the first intron of the humanCOL9A1 gene contains transcriptional regulatory elements, an 807-bp fragment containing the first intron (excluding the splice-site sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends) was inserted into the 846Luc construct to obtain 846LucInt. The two constructs, 846Luc and 846LucInt, were then separately transfected into RCS cells. As can be seen in Fig. 1 C, inclusion of the COL9A1 first intron fragment did not result in any significant difference in promoter activity. SOX transcription factors have been shown to be important for the regulation of chondrocyte-specific gene expression. Sequence analysis of the proximal promoter region of the human COL9A1 gene with the MatInspector program (26Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) revealed five putative SOX/Sry-binding sites (Fig. 2 A), whereas analysis of the first intron did not reveal any recognizable SOX/Sry-binding sites. To determine whether SOX9 regulates the activity of the COL9A1gene, either the 846Luc or the 846LucInt construct were co-transfected with a SOX9 expression construct into HTB and NIH/3T3 cells. SOX9 overexpression in these cells activated the 846Luc and 846LucInt constructs by ∼25- to 30-fold (Fig. 2, B andC). However, there was no difference in activation between the two constructs in response to SOX9, indicating that the observed transcriptional activation depends on the proximal-promoter region and that the first intron did not have any influence on the transcriptional activity of the gene under these conditions. To delineate which regions of the COL9A1 promoter region are responsible for promoter activity and SOX9 transactivation, a series ofCOL9A1-promoter-luciferase 5′-deletion constructs were employed (Fig. 3 A). The deletion constructs were generated such that the five putative SOX/Sry-binding sites, designated A–E, were sequentially removed (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). To determine the effect of the deletions on promoter activity, the full-length construct (846Luc) and the five deletion constructs (588Luc, 560Luc, 357Luc, 167Luc, and 107Luc) were transfected into RCS cells (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of up to 286 bp from the 5′ end, including the two distal putative SOX/Sry-binding sites (588Luc and 560Luc, sites A andB in Fig. 3 A) did not result in any substantial changes in activity in RCS cells (Fig. 3 B). However, when the region containing the three distal putative SOX/Sry sites was removed (357Luc, sites A–C in Fig. 3 A), the promoter activity was reduced to 20% of control (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of the region encompassing the four distal sites (167Luc, sites A–D in Fig. 3 A) resulted in slightly increased expression as compared with the 357Luc construct (sites A–C deleted) and an overall expression level of 31% of control (Fig. 3 B). Finally, deletion of the region encompassing all five sites (107Luc in Fig. 3 A) resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in promoter activity (9% of control, Fig. 3 B). We conclude that the region encompassing the SOX/Sry-binding sites C–E is important for full promoter activity in RCS cells. To determine which of the putative SOX/Sry sites within the proximal promoter region were responsible for the observed transactivation by SOX9, the various deletion constructs were co-transfected into NIH/3T3 cells along with a SOX9 expression vector. Fig. 4 A shows the results of this experiment. All of the deletion constructs except for the 107Luc construct, which does not contain any SOX/Sry-binding sites, were transactivated by SOX9 overexpression. The full-length 846Luc construct displayed the strongest response to SOX9 co-transfection, exhibiting a ∼30-fold increase in activity, whereas the deletion constructs that contained at least one putative SOX/Sry-binding site (588Luc, 560Luc, 357Luc, and 167Luc) displayed a 15- to 20-fold increase in activity over control. Two other SOX proteins, l-SOX5 and SOX6 have been shown to cooperate with SOX9 in the transcriptional activation of theCOL2A1 gene through the intronic enhancer region (6Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To determine whether l-SOX5 and SOX6 play a role in the activation of the COL9A1 proximal promoter region, the 846Luc construct was co-transfected into NIH/3T3 cells withl-SOX5, SOX6, and SOX9 expression constructs. Fig. 4 B demonstrates that neither l-SOX5 or SOX6 alone or in combination activate the COL9A1 proximal promoter. Interestingly, when l-SOX5, SOX6, and SOX9 were co-transfected together with the 846Luc construct, transactivation of the promoter was attenuated as compared with co-transfection with SOX9 alone (Fig. 4 B). To define more precisely the role of the putative SOX/Sry-binding sites within the COL9A1proximal promoter region, point mutations were introduced into sites C, D, and E (Fig. 5 A). In each case, a 4-bp change was introduced into the core SOX/Sry-binding sites employing PCR-based mutagenesis. The intact (wild-type) promoter construct (846Luc) and each of the mutant constructs (CmutLuc, DmutLuc, and EmutLuc) were transfected separately into RCS cells to assess the effect of the mutations on promoter activity. Fig. 5 Bdemonstrates that mutations in site C had no effect onCOL9A1 promoter activity. In contrast, mutations in sites D and E reduced the promoter activity to 17 and 36% of control, respectively. Similarly, in co-transfection experiments with a SOX9 expression vector, the wild-type 846Luc and CmutLuc constructs were transactivated ∼30- to 35-fold over control (Fig. 5 C), whereas the DmutLuc and EmutLuc constructs were activated to only 1/3 of those levels (10- to 12-fold, Fig. 5 C) by SOX9 co-transfection. These results demonstrate that the SOX/Sry-binding sites D and E are necessary for full promoter activity in RCS cells and for full transactivation by SOX9 in NIH/3T3 cells. Although the results from the deletion analysis indicated that the region encompassing site C was important for full activity (construct 357Luc, Fig. 3 B), the mutational studies were contradictory because they showed that site C itself was dispensable for promoter activity (CmutLuc construct, Fig. 5, B and C). To clarify these results, either an 85-bp fragment encompassing site C or a 96-bp fragment encompassing site D (seebrackets in Fig. 2 A) were inserted into the pGL3promoter vector, which contains the SV40 promoter (pGL3proC and pGL3proD, Fig. 6 A). When these constructs were transfected into RCS cells, the pGL3proC construct displayed essentially the same activity as the pGL3promoter vector alone, whereas the pGL3proD construct was ∼16-fold more active (Fig. 6 B). We conclude that along with SOX/Sry binding sites D and E, there must be another positive-acting element within the promoter region from −560 to −357 relative to the transcriptional start site that is necessary for full promoter activity in RCS cells. To determine whether SOX9 interacts with the putative SOX/Sry-binding site-D, nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH/3T3 cells that had been transfected with SOX9 expression constructs, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. Fig. 7 A shows the sequence of the SOX/Sry-binding site D probe used in these experiments. Fig. 7 B shows that specific binding to probes containing SOX/Sry-binding site D or to a probe containing the SOX binding sites from the COL2A1 gene enhancer region were detected only in NIH/3T3 cells that had been transfected with a SOX9 expression construct and not in control cells. Competition analysis revealed that a specific DNA-protein complex forms with SOX/Sry-binding site-D in nuclear extracts from RCS cells, and this complex can be competed for with excess wild-type SOX/Sry-binding site-D probe and excess probe containing the SOX-binding sites from the human COL2A1 gene but not with a mutant SOX/Sry-binding site-D probe (Fig. 7 C). Finally, the DNA-protein complex that forms with the wild-type SOX/Sry-binding site-D probe and nuclear extract from NIH/3T3 cells transfected with a SOX9 expression construct can be supershifted with anti-SOX9 antibodies (Fig. 7 D). We demonstrate here that the proximal-promoter region of the humanCOL9A1 gene can drive expression of a reporter gene in chondrocytic RCS cells but not in the nonchondrocytic HTB and NIH/3T3 cell lines. We also showed that the COL9A1 proximal-promoter region can be transactivated by SOX9 and that the transactivation depends, in part, on two SOX/Sry-binding sites (sites D and E). Also, full promoter activity depends on a region located between −560 to −357 relative to the transcriptional start site. Further work revealed that SOX9 can specifically bind to at least one of the two sites (SOX/Sry-binding site-D) as demonstrated by EMSA competition and supershift analyses. Our results strengthen the notion that SOX9 is a master regulatory factor for chondrocyte-specific gene expression. An interesting difference between the regulation of theCOL9A1 versus the COL2A1 promoter was observed when the l-SOX5 and SOX6 expression constructs were included in the co-transfection experiments. l-SOX5 and SOX6 did not stimulate the transcriptional activity of ourCOL9A1 promoter construct either alone or in combination. Even more intriguing was the finding that when the l-SOX5 and SOX6 vectors were co-transfected along with the SOX9 expression vector, the activity of the COL9A1 promoter was attenuated. In contrast to this, l-SOX5 and SOX6 have been shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the COL2A1enhancer either alone or in combination (6Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whenl-SOX5 and SOX6 are expressed along with SOX9 in co-transfection assays, the activity of the COL2A1 gene was stimulated in an enhancer-dependent fashion to higher levels than that observed with the individual SOX factors (6Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that this might be a mechanism by which the chondrocyte could achieve different levels of COL9A1 andCOL2A1 gene expression utilizing the same transcription factors. Indeed, a similar type of regulation has been observed with respect to the COL2A1 gene. The transcription factor cKrox was shown to interact with multiple sites within the enhancer region, resulting in up-regulation of the gene in differentiated chondrocytes, whereas cKrox-binding sites located in the promoter were responsible for down-regulation of the gene in de-differentiated chondrocytes (2Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J-P. Galera P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the COL2A1 gene is also regulated by other negatively acting transcription factors. The transcription factor δEF1 has been shown to repress COL2A1 gene expression through sites in the promoter region in limb-bud mesenchymal cells before differentiation occurs (3Murray D. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton W.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3610-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The zinc-finger transcription factor αA-crystallin binding protein-1 is also a negative regulator of theCOL2A1 gene, acting through sites located in the enhancer region (4Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Certainly, more work is needed to elucidate the complex network of control mechanisms involved in chondrocyte-specific gene expression. The structure of the promoter for COL9A1 is reminiscent of that of the COL11A2 gene. A cluster of five SOX/Sry-binding sites were also characterized in the proximal promoter region of theCOL11A2 gene, located between −742 bp and the transcriptional start site (27Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These sites were found to bind a specific protein complex in RCS nuclear extracts that contained SOX9 and also were able to direct reporter gene expression to cartilaginous tissues in transgenic mice (27Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Other work has implicated a 60-bp segment within the first intron that is important forCOL11A2 gene expression. This segment was also shown to interact with SOX9 and promote cartilage-specific expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice (28Liu Y., Li, H. Tanaka K. Tsumaki N. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12712-12718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SOX/Sry sites located in the COL11A2 proximal promoter region differ from the sites studied in the present work in that they are much closer to one another. Furthermore, we found that the first intron of theCOL9A1 gene did not augment the activity of the promoter region. However, our experiments do not rule out a role for the first intron in regulating COL9A1 gene expression in vivo because we have not investigated the activity of theCOL9A1-reporter constructs in the context of transgenic mice. As mentioned above, the arrangement of the SOX/Sry-binding sites within the COL9A1 proximal-promoter region differ from those found in the COL11A2 promoter and also from the SOX/Sry-binding sites located in the COL2A1 intronic enhancer (5Lefebvre V.

In the case of the COL11A2 gene, the five SOX/Sry-binding sites are found within a region of ∼130 bp (27Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

However, the distal three sites are within 45 bp, and the proximal two sites are separated by only 3 bp. Similarly, the four SOX/Sry-binding sites within the COL2A1 intronic enhancer are spaced over a 48-bp region (5Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to this, the five SOX/Sry-binding sites within the COL9A1 promoter span a region of 565 bp. The transient-transfection studies presented here rule out sites A and B as being important for full promoter activity; however, the remaining three SOX/Sry-binding sites are scattered over a 415-bp stretch, still substantially less compact than the COL11A2 andCOL2A1 genes. Whether this arrangement has any bearing on the relative levels of expression of these genes or the developmental timing of their expression remains to be determined, as does the placement of the SOX/Sry-binding sites within the proximal-promoter region versus an enhancer region or both."

They are expressed in central and sensory neurons where they are involved in neuromodulation and in pain perception. Recently, the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase) has been shown to interact with ASIC1a and ASIC2a, raising the possibility that protein kinase C (PKC) could regulate ASICs. We now show that the amplitude of the ASIC2a current, which was only modestly increased (∼+30%) by the PKC activator 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG, 50 μm) in the absence of PICK1, was strongly potentiated (∼+300%) in the presence of PICK1. This PICK1-dependent regulatory effect was inhibited in the presence of a PKC inhibitory peptide and required the PDZ domain of PICK1 as well as the PDZ-binding domain of ASIC2a. We have also shown the direct PICK1-dependent phosphorylation of ASIC2a by [32P]phosphate labeling and immunoprecipitation and identified a major phosphorylation site, 39TIR, on the N terminus part of ASIC2a. The OAG-induced increase in ASIC2a current amplitude did not involve any change in the unitary conductance of the ASIC2a channel, whether co-expressed with PICK1 or not. These data provide the first demonstration of a regulation of ASICs by protein kinase phosphorylation and its potentiation by the partner protein PICK1.

In the central nervous system, an important role for ASICs in neuromodulation of the synaptic transmission has been proposed (18Krishtal O.A. Osipchuk Y.V. Shelest T.N. Smirnoff S.V.

Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 485-494Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This hippocampal ASIC-like current was co-activated by zinc acting on ASIC2a-containing channels (22Baron A. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol.

A role for ASICs in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory processes has been proposed recently (24Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman J.H., Jr. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). ASICs could also be involved in pathological situations such as brain ischemia and epilepsy that both produce significant extracellular acidification (25Ohno M. Obrenovitch T.P. Hartell N. Barratt S. Bachelard H.S. Symon L. Neurol. Res. 1989; 11: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Nedergaard M. Kraig R.P. Tanabe J. Pulsinelli W.A. Am. J.

Although ASIC currents can be recorded in virtually all types of neuronal cells, their physiological regulation by mediators, transduction pathways, or protein kinases is unknown, although several putative phosphorylation sites can be predicted from the ASIC protein sequences. Recently, two PDZ domain-containing partner proteins have been isolated by yeast two-hybrid cloning: CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain-containing protein), which interacts with the ASIC3 C terminus (29Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase), which interacts with the ASIC1a and ASIC2a C terminus (30Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CIPP was shown to increase the ASIC3 current membrane density (29Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but no functional effect of PICK1 on ASIC currents has been reported so far. PICK1 was originally isolated by its ability to bind the C terminus of protein kinase C (PKC) via its single PDZ domain (32Staudinger J., Lu, J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5417-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although PICK1 has only one PDZ domain, it can multimerize through its coiled-coil region and therefore cross-link two different partners (32Staudinger J., Lu, J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,33Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), thus providing a molecular mechanism for the targeting of PKC to specific proteins regulated by phosphorylation. ASIC1a and ASIC2a co-localize with PICK1 at the peripheral sensory endings of dorsal root ganglia neurons as well as at the synapses and cell bodies of some central neurons, such as pyramidal hippocampal neurons (30Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,31Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This work analyzes the regulation of ASIC2a by PKC. It shows that the ASIC2a current amplitude is increased by PKC phosphorylation and that PICK1 potentialized this regulation. Mouse PICK1 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM008837; 96% amino acid identity with rat PICK1 and identical PDZ domain) was amplified by PCR from mouse brain cDNA, sequenced, and subcloned into the bicistronic vector pCI-IRES-CD8 (36Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) for expression in COS cells. The PICK1ΔPDZ mutant was obtained by replacing the27KD28 residues by two alanines in the PDZ domain (35Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The rat ASIC2a coding sequence (GenBank™ accession numberU53211) was subcloned into pCI vector (Promega) for expression in COS cells. The potential PKC phosphorylation site, 39TIR, was suppressed by the introduction of the T39G or T39D point mutations. In another mutant, named ASIC2aΔC, the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain was suppressed by deletion of the last three residues (30Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Point mutations and deletions of rASIC2a and mPICK1 were performed by PCR strategies and entirely sequenced. ASIC2a and PICK1 wild-type and mutant proteins corresponding to the cDNAs used in the present work are schematically described in Fig. 1. COS cells, at a density of 20,000 cells/35-mm diameter Petri dish, were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method with a mix of pCI-rASIC2a, pCI-rASIC2aΔC, pCI-rASIC2aT39G, pCI-rASIC2aT39D with pCI-IRES-CD8, pCI-PICK1-IRES-CD8, pCI-PICK1ΔPDZ-IRES-CD8 (1:10 ratio). Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements for 1–3 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to fix CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal A. S., Oslo, Norway). Ion currents were recorded using the whole cell and the outside-out modes of the patch clamp technique (37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). Data were sampled at either 500 Hz or 10 kHz for whole cell and outside-out recordings, respectively, and low pass-filtered at 3 kHz using the pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Off-line low pass 1-kHz gaussian filtering and analysis of currents were performed using pClamp (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The statistical significance of differences between sets of data was estimated by the Student'st test. The pipette solution contained 140 mmKCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), and the bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). MES or acetate was used instead of HEPES to buffer the bath solution pH ranging from 6 to 5 and from 4.5 to 3, respectively. Changes in extracellular pH were induced by shifting one out of eight outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), the cell-permeable diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), and protein kinase C 19–36 inhibitory peptide (PKC-I) were all from Sigma. P100 dishes containing 3 million COS cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCI-rASIC2a with or without 5 μg of pCI-PICK1-IRES-CD8 using Exgen500 (Euromedex) following the supplier's protocol. Cells were serum-deprived for 24 h, phosphate-deprived for 2 h, and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 3 h. PDBu stimulation was carried out for 20 min (2 μm). Cell numbers in the different conditions were checked to be equivalent. After phosphate-buffered saline wash, confluent cell layers were scraped in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After centrifugation, the membrane pellets were resuspended in TNEN buffer (TNE containing 1% Nonidet P-40) and sonicated. After a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatants were precleared with protein-A-Sepharose and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of rabbit anti-rat ASIC2a antibody (Alomone Laboratories). Protein-A-Sepharose was added for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with TNEN. Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in SDS buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide). The gel was vacuum-dried and analyzed with a BAS-1500 Fujifilm phosphorimaging device and Tina 2.0. When co-expressed with ASIC2a, PICK1 did not significantly modify the pH dependence of the current (Fig. 2 A), the inactivation time constant, nor the time-to-peak of the current (TableI, lines 1 and 2). Also, the ASIC2a current density was not increased in the presence of PICK1 (Fig. 2 B), unlike the situation observed with ASIC3 after its interaction with another PDZ domain-containing partner protein CIPP (29Anzai N.

A slight decrease of the ASIC2a current density was observed in the presence of PICK1 (27 ± 3 pA/pF versus33 ± 5 pA/pF with and without PICK1, respectively), but it was not significant (p = 0.30).Table IEffects of PICK1 and OAG treatment on ASIC2a current kineticsτ inactivationTime-to-peakcontrol+OAGpvaluecontrol+OAGp valuessssASIC2a5.53 ± 0.85 (n = 10)5.63 ± 0.65 (n = 10)0.691.59 ± 0.26 (n = 10)1.57 ± 0.80 (n = 10)0.82ASIC2a + PICK14.68 ± 0.55 (n = 18)5.09 ± 0.81 (n = 18)0.572.28 ± 0.26 (n = 20)2.07 ± 0.34 (n = 20)0.34ASIC2aΔC + PICK14.34 ± 0.36 (n = 5)4.63 ± 0.41 (n = 5)0.202.21 ± 0.41 (n = 5)2.24 ± 0.41 (n = 5)0.82ASIC2a + PICK1ΔPDZ5.66 ± 1.12 (n = 6)5.87 ± 1.26 (n = 6)0.853.31 ± 0.13 (n = 6)3.12 ± 0.22 (n = 6)0.56ASIC2aT39G + PICK14.43 ± 0.63 (n = 8)4.71 ± 0.77 (n = 8)0.522.43 ± 0.49 (n = 10)2.50 ± 0.58 (n = 10)0.70ASIC2aT39D + PICK17.74 ± 0.72 (n = 14)7.22 ± 0.38 (n = 6)0.651.92 ± 0.32 (n = 14)1.68 ± 0.58 (n = 6)0.71Time-to-peak values were measured, and inactivation time constant (τ) values were determined by mono-exponential fits of the currents in control and after OAG treatment (10 min, 50 μm). The statistical significance of differences between control and OAG-treated data was estimated by the Student t-test, and p values were given. Open table in a new tab Time-to-peak values were measured, and inactivation time constant (τ) values were determined by mono-exponential fits of the currents in control and after OAG treatment (10 min, 50 μm). The statistical significance of differences between control and OAG-treated data was estimated by the Student t-test, and p values were given. When 50 μm OAG, the cell-permeable analog of the endogenous PKC activator diacylglycerol, was applied extracellularly, it induced a 1.35 ± 0.08-fold (n= 12) increase of ASIC2a current amplitude (Fig. 3, A (○) and B(bar 2)), significantly different from the basal variation of ASIC2a current amplitude (0.98 ± 0.08, n = 5, Fig. 3 B, bar 1, ⋆; p < 0.05). This effect was strongly potentiated in the presence of PICK1 with a 3.90 ± 0.54-fold increase (n = 20) of the ASIC2a current induced by OAG (50 μm) (Fig. 3, A(●) and B (bar 3, ∗; p < 0.05)). Similar results were obtained when the phorbol ester PDBu (2 μm) was used instead of OAG to stimulate PKC (not shown). Fig. 3 C shows that the OAG-induced increase of the ASIC2a current in the presence of PICK1 was dependent on the initial ASIC2a current density. The lower the current density, the greater the OAG-induced increase factor. The OAG treatment did not significantly modify the ASIC2a current kinetics, whether co-expressed with PICK1 or not (Table I, lines 1 and 2). The interaction between PICK1 and ASIC2a was found to require the PDZ domain of PICK1 and the last four amino acids of ASIC2a (30Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When PICK1 was co-expressed with ASIC2aΔC or when PICK1ΔPDZ was co-expressed with ASIC2a, the OAG-induced increase of ASIC2a current (1.46 ± 0.17-fold, n = 5, and 1.55 ± 0.20-fold, n = 6, Fig. 3 B, bars 4 and 5, respectively) was not significantly different from the OAG effect on ASIC2a without PICK1 (1.35 ± 0.08,n = 12, Fig. 3 B, bar 2) but still significantly different from the basal variations of ASIC2a current level (⋆; p < 0.05). This suggests that the direct association of the C terminus of ASIC2a with the PDZ domain of PICK1 is necessary for the full OAG-induced increase of ASIC2a current, even if a small part of the OAG effect remains when the association between PICK1 and ASIC2a is disrupted. Table I (lines 3 and4) shows that the kinetics of the ASIC2aΔC + PICK1 and of the ASIC2a + PICK1ΔPDZ currents are similar to those of the ASIC2a current and are not modified by the OAG treatment. To specifically inhibit PKC, we used the 19–36 PKC peptide (PKC-I), acting as a pseudosubstrate on the active site of PKC (38House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In the presence of this PKC-I (50 μm), in the pipette solution, the OAG-induced increase of ASIC2a current in the presence of PICK1 was reduced to a 1.56 ± 0.23-fold increase (n = 8, Fig. 3 B, bar 6, not significantly different from the basal variations of ASIC2a current,p = 0.08), thus showing the specific involvement of PKC in the effect of PICK1-dependent OAG-induced stimulation of ASIC2a current. An analysis of the ASIC2a sequence revealed a putative PKC phosphorylation site, 39TIR, matching the conventional consensus (S/T)*X(K/R) motif (single amino acid codes with X corresponding to any amino acid and * corresponding to the phosphorylated amino acid) (39Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) in the cytoplasmic N terminus fragment, just before the first transmembrane domain. The ASIC2aT39G and ASIC2aT39D mutants produced currents similar to wild-type ASIC2a, but the OAG effect in the presence of PICK1 was greatly reduced to 1.68 ± 0.30-fold (n =11) and 1.18 ± 0.90-fold (n = 6), respectively (Fig. 3 B, bars 7 and 8), which was not significantly different from the OAG-induced increase of ASIC2a current in the absence of PICK1 (1.35 ± 0.08, Fig. 3 B, bar 2; p = 0.27 andp = 0.23, respectively). Neither was significantly different from the basal variations of ASIC2a current (bar 1; p = 0.14 and p = 0.41, respectively). The OAG-induced increases in ASIC2aT39G and ASIC2aT39D current amplitudes were not significantly different (p= 0.4). The kinetics of the two ASIC2a mutants co-expressed with PICK1 were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from those of ASIC2a and were not affected by the OAG treatment (Table I,lines 5 and 6). In the ASIC2aT39D mutant, one could expect that the aspartic residue mimics a phosphorylated threonine, thus constitutively stimulating the current. The mean current density of the ASIC2aT39D mutant expressed with PICK1 (40.93 ± 12.49 pA/pF, n = 14) was slightly higher but not significantly different from the mean current density of the ASIC2a current expressed with PICK1 (26.53 ± 3.37 pA/pF, n = 59, p = 0.12). As we do not know whether the cellular expressions are similar for the wild-type and the mutated channel, it is thus difficult to postulate upon the fact that the T39D mutation mimics a phosphorylated residue. The inhibition of the PICK1-dependent OAG-induced increase of the ASIC2a current by both the T39D and the T39G mutations shows that the39TIR site is necessary for the OAG-induced increase of ASIC2a current and strongly suggests a direct phosphorylation of ASIC2a by PKC. To determine whether ASIC2a was directly phosphorylated by PKC, we performed an in vivo [32P]phosphate labeling and immunoprecipitation on ASIC2a-transfected cells with or without PICK1 after treatment with PDBu (2 μm, 20 min). A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3 D. There is a small basal phosphorylation of ASIC2a (Fig. 3 D, lane 3), which is unchanged by the PKC activator PDBu (Fig. 3 D,lane 4). When ASIC2a is co-transfected with PICK1 cDNA, ASIC2a phosphorylation markedly increases when cells are treated with PDBu (∼4-fold increase, Fig. 3 D, lanes 1–2). We recorded ASIC2a channels in outside-out patches from COS cells expressing ASIC2a channels (Fig. 4 A), ASIC2a channels co-expressed with PICK1 (Fig. 4 B), and ASIC2a channels co-expressed with PICK1 after a 10-min treatment by 50 μmOAG (Fig. 4 C). The outside-out mode recording was necessary to activate the channels by an extracellular pH drop but prevented the comparison of the channel activity before and after OAG-induced PKC activation on the same membrane patch. ASIC2a channels were activated by a small pH drop to pH 6 or pH 5.5 to limit the channel activity and allow the measurement of single openings. Fig. 4 shows that neither the PICK1 co-expression nor the OAG treatment in the presence of PICK1 increases the channel conductance (10.93 ± 1.22 picosiemens between −80 and 0 mV). Taken together with results in the Fig. 2 B that do not show any PICK1-induced increase in cellular current density, these data suggest that the PICK1-dependent PKC-induced phosphorylation most probably increases the ASIC2a open probability rather than the number of functional channels. This study provides the first evidence for a regulation of an ASIC current by a protein kinase and for a potentiation of this regulation by a partner protein. It shows that the amplitude of the ASIC2a current is increased by PKC phosphorylation and that PICK1 is required for a potent activation (a factor of 3.9-fold), probably by allowing an optimal interaction between the kinase and its target channel. We demonstrate the involvement of the PDZ domain of PICK1 and of the PDZ-binding domain of ASIC2a in this regulatory effect and identify39TIR as a major phosphorylation site. Indeed, the PICK1-dependent OAG-induced increase of the ASIC2a current was highly reduced by the T39D and T39G mutations. However, it is not clear whether the T39D mutation mimics a phosphorylation of the threonine residue, thus constitutively stimulating the current, as the mean current density of the ASIC2aT39D mutant is not significantly different from that of ASIC2a. In vivo phosphorylation experiments confirm that PKC activation induces phosphorylation of ASIC2a in the presence of PICK1 (Fig. 3 D) and correlates well with patch clamp experiments. The PICK1-dependent PKC-induced phosphorylation does not change the kinetics, pH dependence, and unitary conductance of ASIC2a channels but probably induces an increase of the channel open probability. The other known partner protein for ASICs isolated by yeast two-hybrid experiments is CIPP, another PDZ domain-containing protein (29Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has also been shown to regulate ASICs; however, the physiological relevance of this regulation is not known (40Ji H.L. Jovov B., Fu, J.

ASIC2a was described to co-localize with PICK1 both at peripheral sensory endings of dorsal root ganglia neurons as well as at synapses and cell bodies of some central neurons (30Duggan A.

https://openalex.org/W2035244104,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis multiplies within the macrophage phagosome and requires iron for growth. We examined the route(s) by which intracellular M. tuberculosis acquires iron. During intracellular growth of the virulent Erdman M. tuberculosis strain in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), M. tuberculosisacquisition of 59Fe from transferrin (TF) provided extracellularly (exogenous source) was compared with acquisition when MDM were loaded with 59Fe from TF prior to M. tuberculosis infection (endogenous sources). M. tuberculosis 59Fe acquisition required viable bacteria and was similar from exogenous and endogenous sources at 24 h and greater from exogenous iron at 48 h. Interferon-γ treatment of MDM reduced 59Fe uptake from TF 51% and TF receptor expression by 34%. Despite this, intraphagosomal M. tuberculosis iron acquisition in IFN-γ-treated cells was decreased by only 30%. Macrophages from hereditary hemochromatosis patients have altered iron metabolism. Intracellular M. tuberculosis acquired markedly less iron in MDM from these individuals than in MDM from healthy donors, regardless of the iron source (exogenous and endogenous): 36 ± 3.8% and 17 ± 9.6% of control, respectively. Thus, intraphagosomal M. tuberculosis can acquire iron from both extracellular TF and endogenous macrophage sources. Acquisition of iron from macrophage cytoplasmic iron pools may be critical for the intracellular growth ofM. tuberculosis. This acquisition is altered by IFN-γ treatment to a small extent, but is markedly reduced in macrophages from hemochromatosis patients."

Previous work established that the multidomain meprin subunits (each ∼80 kDa) form disulfide-bridged homo- and heterodimers, and differ in substrate and peptide bond specificities. The work herein clearly demonstrates that meprin dimers differ markedly in their ability to oligomerize. Electrophoresis, light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy were used to characterize quaternary structures of recombinant rat meprins. Meprin B, consisting of meprin β subunits only, was dimeric under a wide range of conditions. By contrast, meprin α homodimers formed heterogeneous multimers (ring-, circle-, spiral-, and tube-like structures) containing up to 100 subunits, with molecular masses at protein peaks ranging from ∼1.0 to 6.0 MDa. The size of the meprin α homo-oligomers was dependent on protein concentration, ionic strength, and activation state. Meprin αβ heterodimers tended to form tetramers but not higher oligomers. Thus, the presence of meprin β, which has a transmembrane domain in vivo, restricts the oligomerization potential of meprin molecules and localizes meprins to the plasma membrane. By contrast, the propensity of secreted meprin α homodimers to self-associate concentrates proteolytic potential into high molecular mass multimers and thus allows for autocompartmentalization.

Their activities and localities, however, must be highly regulated because of their destructive potential. Regulation of proteases is accomplished through several mechanisms including zymogen formation, inhibition, localization to specific compartments, and transcriptional regulation. The structures of proteases themselves have revealed mechanisms to regulate proteolytic activity, and this has been amply demonstrated in the high molecular mass oligomeric structures of the proteasome, tripeptidyl peptidase II, and the tricorn protease (2Groll M.

These multimeric serine and threonine proteolytic complexes are homo- or hetero-oligomeric, have molecular masses of 0.7–9 MDa, and are found intracellularly. The structures serve to restrict, localize, and concentrate proteolytic activity. Proteases at the cell surface are known to form transient oligomeric complexes, such as those between membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 that lead to the activation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (5Toth M.

However, stable secreted, multimeric proteolytic complexes were not described until recently, when homo-oligomers of meprin A were found to form multimers of ∼0.9 MDa (6Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T. Benkovic S.J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23207-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations established meprin A as one of the largest known secreted proteases. Meprins, zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases of the “astacin family” and “metzincin superfamily,” consist of multidomain, evolutionarily related α and β subunits (7Bond J.S. Beynon R.J.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The subunits are 42% identical at the amino acid level, highly glycosylated, and form disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers (7Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18) is a hetero-oligomer of α and β subunits or a homo-oligomer of α subunits; meprin B (EC 3.4.24.63) is a homo-oligomer of β subunits (10Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1222-1229Google Scholar). The nascent subunits each have a signal peptide that directs the protein to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during biosynthesis, and a propeptide that inhibits activity (11Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28126-28132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Each subunit has an astacin-like catalytic domain, and several protein interaction domains including a meprin/A5 protein/protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (MAM),1 a meprin and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) homology (MATH), and an “after MATH” (AM) domain (12Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The MAM and MATH domains are found in cell-adhesion superfamily proteins and in adapter proteins in signal transduction, respectively, and permit homo- and heterophilic selective associations with self and other proteins (13Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Uren A.G. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 244-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAM, MATH, and AM interaction domains are essential for the biosynthesis of active, stable meprins (12Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The nascent meprin subunits are both synthesized with COOH-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, putative transmembrane-spanning domains, and short cytoplasmic tails. However, the nascent meprin α subunit, but not the β subunit, has a 56-amino acid inserted domain between the AM and EGF-like domains, and the presence of this domain allows for a proteolytic event during maturation that liberates the meprin α subunit from the membrane (15Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because of this COOH-terminal processing, homo-oligomers of meprin A are secreted proteins, whereas hetero-oligomers of meprin A and homo-oligomers of meprin B are membrane-bound. In mammals, meprins A and B are highly concentrated in kidney and intestinal brush border membranes, e.g. these proteins are estimated to compose 5% of the mouse brush border membrane of proximal tubule juxtamedullary nephrons (16Craig S.S.

Further, membrane-bound and secreted meprins are expressed in leukocytes and cancer cells, implicating these enzymes in inflammation and tumor biology (17Lottaz D. Hahn D. Muller S. Muller C.

The homo-oligomeric form of meprin A is found in rodent urine and the media of transfected cell lines and colon cancer cells (18Lottaz D. Maurer C.A. Hahn D. Buchler M.W. Sterchi E.E.

Although meprin B and hetero-oligomeric meprin A are predominantly membrane-bound proteins in vivo, there is some evidence that the membrane-bound form of human and rat meprin β can be shed from the cell surface (9Marchand P.

Recent studies demonstrated that the individual subunits have marked differences in their peptide bond and substrate specificities and conditions for optimal activity (26Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The meprin β subunit has an acidic pH optimum, prefers low ionic strength, and has a distinct preference for acidic residues flanking the scissile bond in substrates. In contrast, the meprin α subunit has a neutral to alkaline pH optimum, prefers small or hydrophobic residues flanking the scissile bond, and has a stronger preference for proline residues proximal but not flanking the scissile bond. These substrate and activity differences imply different functions for the meprin isoforms. Although it is known that dimerization of meprin A is important for stability and activity toward protein substrates, little is known about the propensities of meprin subunits to oligomerize (21Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recent finding that secreted mouse homo-oligomeric meprin A was primarily decameric contrasted with previous observations that indicated hetero-oligomeric meprin A isolated from mouse kidney was primarily tetrameric (6Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T. Benkovic S.J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23207-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the structure of meprin B, partially because only small amounts have been available. In addition, to date there has not been an accurate determination of the molecular masses of meprin subunits, or oligomeric forms. The work herein was conducted to determine definitively meprin subunit masses and to characterize the oligomeric forms of meprin A and B. For these studies, truncated and histidine-tagged recombinant rat meprin subunits were prepared, allowing for the secretion and subsequent large scale production of meprins. The recombinant proteins were found to have similar properties to the native enzymes (28Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Meprins were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by transfecting cells with pcDNA 3.1 (+) expression vectors containing meprin sequence using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Recombinant rat meprin α was truncated at the putative mature carboxyl terminus (Arg-603 of the AM domain), and a histidine tag was added to the carboxyl terminus. Meprin β was truncated at Lys-648, which is at the EGF-transmembrane border, and a GGGS linker and histidine tag were added to the carboxyl terminus (28Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The truncation of meprin proteins at Arg-603 and Lys-648 resulted in the secretion of the subunits into the media, and the addition of histidine tags allowed for a facile purification scheme. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography was used to purify meprins. Homo-oligomeric meprin A and B were produced by transfecting cells with meprin α or β cDNA alone. A third cell line was transfected with both cDNAs to allow for the production of hetero-oligomeric meprin A. All proteins were secreted into the media as proenzymes. Active forms of meprins were produced by limited digestion of the purified latent meprin with trypsin as described (28Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Meprin was treated with a 1:20 w/w ratio of trypsin to meprin, and meprin activity was monitored over time. Trypsin was inhibited with a 20-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor when meprin activity no longer increased. Trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor were subsequently removed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superose 6 column. Meprin protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to assess purity and verify complete activation. Protein samples, boiled in sample buffer with SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, were routinely subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% Ready gels (Bio-Rad) unless indicated. For native PAGE, 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels in the absence of SDS and reducing agent were used (Invitrogen). Individual meprin α and β subunits were detected using the subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies, HMC52 and PSU56, respectively, that were developed by our laboratory. HMC52 and PSU56 antibodies did not cross-react with the incorrect subunit with the amounts used in these studies. Two female rats were placed in metabolic cages, and urine was collected for 6 h. Urine was kept on ice. After collection, urine was filtered through a 0.2-μm cellulose acetate filter to remove particles. The filtered urine (6 ml) was buffer exchanged into 8 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, using Econo-Pac 10 DG chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) and then concentrated to 600 μl using a Centriplus YM-50 concentrator (Millipore). Purified recombinant rat latent and active meprins in the presence or absence of 10 mm dithiothreitol were used for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy studies. Molecular masses were determined using a Voyager-DE RP/Pro BioSpectrometry work station (PerSeptive Biosystems). The machine was set in the linear, delayed positive mode. The accelerating voltage was 25,000 V, grid voltage 89%, guide wire 0.15%, and extraction delay time 1200 ns. At least 32 laser shots were taken per spectra, and at least 5 spectra were used to give the molecular mass. Proteins were diluted in a saturated matrix solution of sinapinic acid (Sigma) in 30% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in water and then spotted on a stainless steel plate (PerSeptive Biosystems). Standards were the Sequazyme bovine serum albumin and IgG1 mass standard kits (PerSeptive Biosystems). The low mass gate was set at 10 kDa. Data were analyzed using Data Explorer software version 4.0.0.0 (Applied Biosystems). The molecular masses of native meprin proteins were determined using SEC-LS in the HHMI Biopolymer Facility and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory by Ewa Folta-Stogniew as described (29Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100-μg sample of each form of meprin in a 500-μl volume was filtered through a 0.22-μm Durapore membrane (Millipore). The filtrate was applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column upstream of Dawn DSP LS (Wyatt Technology), model 733 variable wavelength KRATOS UV (Applied Biosystems), and OPTILAB DSP refractive index (Wyatt Technology) detectors. The column was equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The weight average molecular masses (Mw) of rat meprins were calculated at peak maxima using three independent analyses, the two- and three-detector method, and ASTRA analysis. A second order Berry fit was used for latent and active homo-oligomeric meprin A, and a zero order Debye fit was used for the other meprins. The Mw was estimated throughout the entire eluting peak at 5-μl intervals using ASTRA software. Computations were performed as described (29Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For analysis of meprin molecular masses under different conditions, a Superose 6 10/30 HR column was calibrated using the molecular mass data obtained from the SEC-LS analyses. The column was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. For electron microscopic analyses, samples of purified recombinant rat latent and active hetero-oligomeric meprin A and homo-oligomeric meprin A and B were diluted to 10 μg/ml with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with or without 150 mm NaCl. Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and imaged at absolute magnifications of 50,000 or 63,000. For image analyses, micrographs were digitized on an Agfa Duoscan flatbed scanner at an optical resolution on the image scale corresponding to either 4.06 or 3.22 Å/pixel, respectively. Composites of typical fields and galleries of individual images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Statistics of individual particle measurements were compiled from enlarged prints on a digitizing tablet using SigmaScan (Jandel). All image analysis was performed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (31Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J., Li, Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional averaging, each data set of untilted images was processed by reference-free alignment and hierarchical ascendant classification using principal component analysis. Three-dimensional volumes were calculated by iterative back projection. Those for activated meprin B and latent hetero-oligomeric A were constructedde novo from tilt pairs of micrographs. These volumes were used as references for determining reconstruction angles by projection mapping for the volumes of latent meprin B and activated hetero-oligomeric A, respectively. The numbers of images in each data set were: 7382 for latent meprin B, 5850 for active meprin B, 4366 for latent hetero-oligomeric meprin A, and 4470 for active hetero-oligomeric meprin A. In all instances, the number of images was limited so that angular coverage would be as even as possible. There were no significant areas of missing information for any of the volumes. Resolution limits were determined from the 50% cut-off of the Fourier shell coefficient between volumes of half data sets. Volume surfaces were created using IRIS Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group). They are shown after filtering to their resolution limits and at the threshold for 100% mass, as calculated using the molecular masses shown in Table I and a partial specific volume of 0.71 g/cm3. 2F.

Noncovalent interactions between subunits were disrupted because of the presence of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid. The means of at least five spectra and the standard deviations are reported for each protein. ND, not determined. All forms of meprin proteins were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1,left panel). The latent meprin β used in these studies is predicted to be larger than meprin α because of the presence of the EGF-like and a portion of the AM domain in meprin β, and indeed it appeared to be larger by SDS-PAGE. Meprin bands were diffuse as previously published and as expected for highly glycosylated proteins (9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat meprin β has eight potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites compared with six in the rat meprin α sequence; additional glycosylation in the meprin β subunit could contribute to the higher molecular mass compared with meprin α as well as the occurrence of the more diffuse band. The band for the latent hetero-oligomeric meprin A migrated between that of homo-oligomeric meprin A and B. In some instances two bands were visible under reducing conditions corresponding to each subunit. However, the subunits in the hetero-oligomeric protein did not resolve well on the gels (Fig. 1,left panel). To obtain more accurate molecular masses, MALDI-TOF was employed (Table I). Using MALDI-TOF the molecular masses of latent meprin β and α subunits were found to be 85.5 and 77.7 kDa, respectively. Quantitative Western analysis was employed to determine the ratio of the meprin α and β subunits in the purified rat hetero-oligomeric meprin A (21Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Subunit-specific antibodies were used to quantify the amount of each subunit present. Known amounts of purified homo-oligomers were used as standards, run on the same gels, and calibration curves were constructed. The amount of each standard and meprin subunit in each sample was determined by densitometry. The protein consisted of an approximately equal amount of subunits; a 1:1.2 ratio of the meprin β and α subunits was calculated. The activation of meprin subunits by trypsin resulted in mobility shifts by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, left panel). The molecular mass losses were 3.4 and 9.4 kDa for the meprin α and β subunits, respectively, as determined by MALDI-TOF (Table I). Trypsin treatment removes the propeptide of both subunits (11Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28126-28132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

The greater loss of molecular mass in the meprin β subunit is probably the result of the additional loss of amino acids within the EGF domain. Indeed, trypsin is used to remove meprin β subunits from brush border membranes (32Butler P.E. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13419-13426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All six forms of recombinant meprins were subjected to PAGE in the presence of SDS and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol to ensure that histidine-tagged proteins were also able to covalently dimerize in a similar manner to wild-type meprins (9Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13505-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All forms of meprins migrated in a manner consistent with the formation of disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 1, right panel). The molecular masses of homo-oligomeric latent meprin A and B were 156 and 171 kDa, respectively (Table I). The hetero-oligomeric form of latent meprin A had a molecular mass of 166 kDa. The molecular mass and densitometry data are consistent with a disulfide-linked heterodimer of meprin α and β subunits as expected (33Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13505-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular masses of 148, 154, and 152 kDa were determined for the active forms of homo-oligomeric meprin A and B and hetero-oligomeric meprin A, respectively (Table I). Coomassie staining of native PAGE gels indicated that the latent and active forms of homo-oligomeric meprin A had a molecular mass considerably greater than 669 kDa (Fig. 2). Therefore, the activated homo-oligomer of recombinant rat meprin A forms high molecular mass complexes, analogous to the mouse homologue (6Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T. Benkovic S.J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23207-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The latent homo-oligomeric meprin A was not able to enter the gel, indicating that it was larger than the active counterpart. PAGE in the presence of SDS and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol yielded dimers (Fig. 1,right panel). Therefore, the formation of the large complexes was dependent on noncovalent interactions. In contrast, the latent and activated forms of homo-oligomeric meprin B had electrophoretic mobilities that corresponded to molecular masses of ∼200 kDa, consistent with the formation of dimers (Fig. 2). Analytical ultracentrifugation studies also demonstrate that rat meprin B exists as a dimer.2 Dimers were also formed under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1, right panel). Therefore, rat meprin β subunits do not interact noncovalently to form larger complexes under these conditions. The active form of meprin B was slightly smaller than the latent form as assessed by native PAGE as expected. For hetero-oligomeric meprin A, two bands were visible for both the latent"

We generated transgenic mice expressing a soluble FGF receptor (FGFR-HFc) under conditional control of the lung-specific surfactant protein C promoter (SP-C-rtTA), to inhibit FGF activity at various times in late gestation and postnatally. Although expression of FGFR-HFc early in development caused severe fetal lung hypoplasia, activation of the transgene in the postnatal period did not alter alveolarization, lung size, or histology. In contrast, expression of the transgene at post-conception day E14.5 decreased lung tubule formation before birth and caused severe emphysema at maturity. FGFR-HFc caused mild focal emphysema when expressed from E16.5 but did not alter alveolarization when expressed after birth.

Although expression of FGFR-HFc early in development caused severe fetal lung hypoplasia, activation of the transgene in the postnatal period did not alter alveolarization, lung size, or histology. In contrast, expression of the transgene at post-conception day E14.5 decreased lung tubule formation before birth and caused severe emphysema at maturity. FGFR-HFc caused mild focal emphysema when expressed from E16.5 but did not alter alveolarization when expressed after birth. Although FGF signaling was required for branching morphogenesis early in lung development, postnatal alveolarization was not influenced by FGFR-HFc. fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor transgenic mice expressing a soluble FGF receptor cytomegalovirus phosphate-buffered saline thyroid transcription factor-1 surfactant proteins B and C platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 bromodeoxyuridine reverse transcriptase embryonic day postnatal day reverse tetracycline transactivator The lung buds evaginate from the foregut endoderm and undergo stereotypic branching to form conducting and peripheral airspaces critical for gas exchange after birth. In humans and mice, the alveoli are formed primarily in the postnatal period, during which the numbers of alveoli increase and the alveolar capillary gas exchange area expands. Lung morphogenesis is dependent upon autocrine-paracrine signaling between the splanchnic mesenchyme and the endodermally derived lung buds that form the developing respiratory epithelium. A number of growth factors and transcription factors, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs),1 plays important roles during lung morphogenesis, regulating cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Refs. 1Costa R.H.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) comprise a family of low molecular weight polypeptides that are involved in the morphogenesis of many organs, including the lung (4Goldfarb M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). At least seven FGFs are expressed in the developing lung, including aFGF, bFGF, FGF-7, FGF-9, FGF-10, and FGF-18 (5Han R.J. Kiu K. Post M. Ped.

Likewise, all of the known FGF receptors (FGFR1–5) are expressed in the lung (13Horlick R.A. Stack S.L. Cooke G.M.

Gene ( Amst. ). 2001; 271: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of the FGFR consist of three immunoglobulin-like domains (D1, D2, and D3). Ligand binding is mediated by the C-terminal portion of the D3 domain. Classification of the FGFRs is dependent upon differences in the D3 domain. Three discrete subgroups of D3domains have been identified, each representing variably spliced isoforms (4Goldfarb M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although all FGFRs are expressed in fetal and postnatal lung, the temporal-spatial distribution of each receptor and ligands varies. FGFR2 is restricted to the epithelial cells of the developing lung buds at the onset of lung organogenesis at E9.5 (19Orr-Urterger A. Bedford M.T. Burakova T. Arman E. Zimmer Y. Yayon A. Givol D. Lonai P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The FGFR2 becomes increasing restricted to the peripheral lung buds during branching morphogenesis. FGFR2IIIb is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas FGFR2IIIc is distributed in mesenchymal cells of the lung (16Peters K.G. Werner S. Chen G. Williams L.T. Development. 1992; 114: 233-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Orr-Urterger A. Bedford M.T. Burakova T. Arman E. Zimmer Y. Yayon A. Givol D. Lonai P. Dev.

Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The important role of FGF signaling during formation of the lung was revealed by both in vitro and in vivoexperiments. FGF-7 caused cystic dilation of the fetal lung and cell proliferation in the postnatal lung (21Zhou L. Graeff R.W. McCray P.B., Jr. Simonet W.S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L987-L994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A number of in vitro and in vivo experiments support the concept that FGF-10 production by lung mesenchyme is critical for early lung morphogenesis. FGF-10 gene-targeted mice failed to develop limbs or lungs (23Min H. Danilenko M. Scully S.A. Bolon B. Ring B.D. Tarpley J.E. DeRose M. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 24Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Ito N. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Likewise, FGF-10 enhanced cell proliferation and chemotaxis of respiratory epithelial cells of the fetal lung in vitro (7Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Park W.Y. Miranda B. Lebeche D. Hashimoto G. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The finding that FGFR2b gene-targeted mice had a phenotype similar to that seen in the FGF-10 (−/−) mice suggests that FGF-10 binds and activates the FGFR2 receptor (20De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajihosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of either Sprouty-2 or a fusion protein consisting of the FGFR-D2 and D3 domains and the mouse immunoglobulin Fc fragment blocked lung morphogenesis by inhibiting FGF signaling in vivo (27Mailleux A.A. Tefft D. Ndiaye D. Itoh N. Thiery J.P. Warburton D. Bellusci S. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Celli G. LaRochelle W.L. Mackem S. Sharp R. Merlino G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1642-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Taken together, FGF-10 and FGFR2IIIb are required for early lung-branching morphogenesis. In contrast, double gene targeting of FGFR3 and FGFR4 did not alter prenatal lung development but caused defects in alveolarization in the postnatal lung (29Weinstein M., Xu, X. Ohyama K. Deng C. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because deletion of either FGF-10 or inhibition of FGFR2 activity blocked lung formation, FGF signaling plays a critical role in early lung morphogenesis. However, because lung formation fails to occur in these gene-targeted mice, it is unclear if FGF receptor signaling is required only for the initiation of lung morphogenesis or functions later in development. Because most of lung growth and alveolarization occurs postnatally, it is not known whether FGF signaling plays a role after the embryonic period and whether the postnatal emphysema seen in the FGFR3/4 (−/−) mice is mediated by events occurring prenatally. To assess the role and timing of FGF signaling in perinatal and postnatal lung morphogenesis, we generated transgenic mice that express a soluble dominant-negative FGFR2 (FGFR-HFc) under conditional control of doxycycline using the reverse tetracycline transactivator system. Inhibition of FGF signaling in the late gestation, but not postnatally, inhibited cell proliferation and caused emphysema that was evident at maturation. FGFR-HFc consists of the extracellular domain of mouse FGFR2b and the heavy chain hinge and Fc domain of mouse immunoglobulin (28Celli G. LaRochelle W.L. Mackem S. Sharp R. Merlino G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1642-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FGFR-HFc cDNA was inserted between the (tetO)7-CMV minimal promoter and the 3′-untranslated region of the bovine growth hormone gene as previously described (22Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.K. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Transgenic mouse lines bearing the (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc were established in the FVB/N strain after oocyte microinjection of the (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc construct. Heterozygous (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc mice were viable and had no malformations. Five independent mouse lines bearing the FGFR-HFc were generated. Mice transmitting the (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc were mated with SP-C-rtTA mice that express the rtTA activator under control of the human 3.7-kb SP-C promoter, selectively directing expression of transgenes in respiratory epithelial cells of the lung (22Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.K. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by using PCR primers specific for each transgenes. Severe lung hypoplasia was observed in double transgenic offspring from five independent founder lines when the dam was maintained on doxycycline throughout pregnancy. Transgenic line 5.9 was then chosen for further analysis. Transgenic mice were kept in the pathogen-free vivarium according to institutional guidelines. Gestation was estimated by the detection of vaginal plug and correlated with average fetal weight at the time of sacrifice. Doxycycline was administered in the drinking water at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml or in the food pellets at concentration of 25 mg/g (Harlan Teklar, Madison, WI) for described time periods. Drinking water that contained doxycycline was changed three times per week because of light sensitivity. Activity of the doxycycline in the food pellets was stable for up to 6 months. Mice were killed by lethal injection of anesthetic reagent (ketamine, xylasine, and acepromasine). Lungs were inflation-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 25-cm water pressure and immersed in same fixative. Tissue was fixed overnight, washed with PBS, dehydrated through a series of ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, orcein, or trichrome for histology. Immunohistochemistry for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Dako Corp., Carpenteria, CA), mature surfactant protein-B (SP-B) (AB3426, Chemicon, Inc., Temecula, CA), and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) were performed as previously described (31Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Blood was flushed from the lungs by infusion of heparinized saline through a catheter in the main pulmonary artery. A barium gelatin heated at 70 °C was injected at 70 mmHg pressure until the vessels were filled uniformly filled with barium. Lungs were then inflation fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 25-cm water pressure. Tissues were fixed overnight and washed with PBS and dehydrated through a series of ethanol. The left lobe was excised and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and barium-filled pulmonary arteries counted. At least 12 sections were counted per animal. Lung fields containing large airways or major vessels were excluded. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 1 mg/g weight) and killed 2 h thereafter. BrdUrd-labeled cells were detected by immunostaining using mouse monoclonal antibody in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Cells were counted in randomly selected fields, n = 4 animals per group. Lung tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), and RNA were extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was treated with DNase prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed and analyzed by PCR for FGFR-HFc mRNA. Primers for the FGFR-HFc were designed as follows: The forward primer was located in the coding region of extracellular domain of FGFR2 (5′-CAG GCC AAC CAG TCT GCC TGG C-3′), and the reverse primer was located in the coding region of the Fc domain of immunoglobulin (3′-CCT CCA CGT GTG TCG AGT CTG C-5′). Surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D cDNA were quantitated by real-time PCR of whole lung cDNA after optimization of primers and conditions using the Smart Cycler®. The mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA. Lung buds were isolated from mouse embryos at E11–13.5 obtained from the breeding of SP-C-rtTA and (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc mice. Lung buds were cultured with or without doxycycline (1 μg/ml) on 13-mm diameter, 8.0-μm pore size Track-Etch membranes (Whatman 110414). Each well contained 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. Human recombinant FGF-7 (Pepro Tech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) was diluted in PBS and added to each well at final concentrations of 0.625–20 ng/ml. Lung buds were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-95% air incubator. Photographs were taken with a stereoscopic microscope. Double and single transgenic mice of all genotypes survived normally and no abnormalities in lung histology were observed in the absence of doxycycline. To determine the effects of doxycycline on the expression of FGFR-HFc, adult SP-C-rtTA, (tetO)7-CMV-FGFR-HFc double transgenic and single transgenic mice were treated with doxycycline for 3 days. FGFR-HFc RNA was detected only in double transgenic mice treated with doxycycline (Fig. 1 B). When the dams were maintained on doxycycline from conception, severe lung hypoplasia was observed in all double transgenic pups at E18, demonstrating that the expression of the FGFR-HFc markedly abrogated lung morphogenesis during the embryonic period (Fig. 2). To determine the temporal requirements for FGF signaling during lung morphogenesis, the dams or pups were treated with doxycycline at various developmental time periods (Fig. 3 A). When pups were treated from PN0 to PN25, no abnormalities in lung growth or histology were observed (Fig. 3, A and E). Double transgenic mice treated with doxycycline from E14.5 developed severe, diffuse emphysema when assessed at PN25 or at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 3,B and F) and data not shown. In contrast, less extensive, focal emphysema was observed when the mice were exposed to doxycycline from E16.5 to PN25 (Fig. 3, C and G). The severity of emphysema was similar in double transgenic mice treated from E14.5 to PN0 (removed from doxycycline thereafter) (Fig. 3,D and H) and those treated with doxycycline from E14.5 until killing at PN25 (Fig. 3, B and F). After treatment from E14.5, percent airspace, determined by lung morphometry, was significantly increased (78.2 ± 1.9, mean ± S.E., n = 5, p < 0.006) compared with controls (69.9 ± 0.69, n = 4) and was less affected when the mice were treated from E16.5 (74.5 ± 1.7,p = 0.08, n = 5) by ANOVA when assessed at PN25. Lung pathology consisted of airspace enlargement without evidence of inflammation, cellular infiltrates, or fibrosis (as assessed by trichrome and orcein staining, data not shown), suggesting that the lesions represent abnormalities in morphogenesis rather than inflammatory remodeling. At E18.5, the lung weight to body weight ratio was decreased when dams were treated from E14.5–18.5 but was not altered when assessed at PN25 (TableI).Table IEffect of FGFR-HFc on lung body weight ratio at E18.5AgeGenotypeBody weight (g)Lung weight (g)Lung/body weight ratio × 100E15.5dControl (n = 16)0.44 ± 0.0110.01 ± 0.0012.89 ± 0.121FGFR-HFc (n = 11)0.43 ± 0.0090.01 ± 0.0012.54 ± 0.104p value0.70.10.1E18.5dControl (n = 16)1.22 ± 0.0250.05 ± 0.0023.79 ± 0.133FGFR-HFc (n = 10)1.26 ± 0.0310.03 ± 0.0012.40 ± 0.104pvalue0.4<0.0001<0.0001PN25dControl (n = 7)16.5 ± 0.80.11 ± 0.0040.68 ± 0.029FGFR-HFc (n = 5)14.4 ± 0.80.10 ± 0.0020.71 ± 0.029pvalue0.10.10.5Body and lungs were assessed at E15.5, E18.5, and PN25.

Differences (mean ± S.E.) between FGFR-HFc-expressing mice and controls were compared by Student's t test. At E18.5, differences in lung weight and lung body weight ratio were statistically significant. To assess whether FGFR-HFc altered epithelial or vascular differentiation, lung sections from double transgenic mice that were treated from E14.5 to PN25 were stained with antibody against mature SP-B, TTF-1, and/or PECAM, respiratory epithelial and pulmonary vascular cell markers, respectively (Figs. 4 and5). Although the numbers of alveoli and peripheral vessels were decreased, there were no differences in the intensity of staining for PECAM (Fig. 4, C andF). The proportion of SP-B-positive cells in the peripheral lung were significantly decreased in double transgenic mice (Figs. 4and 5). Morphometric analysis and pulmonary arteriograms demonstrated decreased pulmonary vessel density, consistent with emphysema. A significant reduction in pulmonary vessels was observed in adult mice that had been treated with doxycycline from E14.5 to 6 weeks of age (Fig. 6, A and B). Despite the loss of pulmonary vascularity, combined and right ventricular weights were not different in these mice at 8 months of age. TTF-1 was detected in the nuclei of respiratory epithelial cells in both transgenic mice and controls (Fig. 4, B andE).Figure 5Emphysema and decreased numbers of type II epithelial cells in FGFR-HFc-expressing mice.

On embryonic day 16.5, the numbers of respiratory tubules were reduced in lungs of the double transgenic fetuses (Fig. 7). No differences in the intensity of TTF-1 immunostaining or BrdUrd labeling (Figs. 7 and 8) were observed. At E18.5, numbers of respiratory saccules were significantly decreased in the double transgenic mice (Fig. 8). Airspaces were larger than those seen in control fetuses (Fig. 8, A and D). The proliferation index, as assessed by BrdUrd labeling, was reduced at E18.5 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 9). However, no statistical differences were observed in the proliferation index on E16.5 despite the arrest of sacculation observed histologically (Figs. 7 and 9). There was no evidence of cell necrosis, nuclear fragmentation, or condensation, suggesting that widespread cell injury or apoptosis did not account for the observed emphysema or lung hypoplasia.Figure 8Effect of FGFR-HFc on lung histology at E18.5. Dams were treated with doxycycline from E14.5, and lung sections were prepared at E18.5. Tissues were stained by H&E (A and D), immunostained for TTF-1 (Band E), or labeled with BrdUrd (C andF) and stained to assess cellular proliferation. Air spaces of FGFR-HFc-expressing mice were larger than controls. Numbers of lung tubules were decreased in FGFR-HFc mice. No differences in the distribution of TTF-1 immunostaining were observed.

At E16.5, SP-B mRNA was decreased in double transgenic mice. No significant differences in SP-B mRNA were detected on E18.5. Quantification of TTF-1 mRNA in PN25-old lungs after treatment with doxycycline also revealed no differences (data not shown). Lung explants from E11.5 embryos were cultured in the presence and absence of doxycycline (Fig. 10). Doxycycline did not alter lung growth or branching in controls. In contrast, lung branching was not altered in tissue from double transgenic mice in the absence of doxycycline (data not shown). Branching of lung tubules from double transgenic mice was inhibited by doxycycline (1 μg/ml) (Fig. 10). To assess whether FGFR-HFc inhibited responses to ectopic FGF-7 in vitro, lung explants from double transgenic mice (E13.5) were treated with FGF-7 in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 11). FGF-7 caused cystic dilation of the lung buds in control tissues, as previously described (21Zhou L. Graeff R.W. McCray P.B., Jr. Simonet W.S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L987-L994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, doxycycline inhibited cyst formation in the lungs from the double transgenic pups in vitro, demonstrating the ability of the FGFR-HFc to block FGF-7-induced swelling (Fig. 11).Figure 11FGFR-HFc-inhibited effects of FGF-7 in vitro. Fetal lung explants were placed in tissue culture at E13.5. Lungs were cultured in media containing doxycycline (1 μg/ml). FGF-7 was added (15 ng/ml) after 12 h of culture. Tissue was imaged from 0 to 60 h. Controls were maintained without (A, D, G, and J) or with (B, E, H, and K) FGF-7. Double transgenic mice were treated with FGF-7 (C,F, I, and L). Bar = 1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conditional expression of FGFR-HFc in respiratory epithelial cells of the developing fetal lung caused emphysema in the postnatal period. The effects of FGFR-HFc were time-dependent. Severe, permanent emphysema was observed in mature mice when the transgene was activated from E14.5 to birth. Milder lung abnormalities were noted when expressed from E16.5 to birth and thereafter. The effects of FGFR-HFc during late fetal lung development contrasted with the lack of effects of the transgene when expressed only in the postnatal period. Because most of the lung growth and alveolarization occur postnatally, most pulmonary morphogenesis occurs by pathways that are not influenced by the FGFR-HFc transgene. Once established, emphysema persisted despite the removal of the mice from doxycycline, demonstrating the irreversibility of the architectural abnormalities. Emphysema in the FGFR-HFc transgenic mice was not associated with inflammation, fibrosis, or cellular infiltrates, consistent with defects in lung morphogenesis rather than inflammation. Likewise, expression of the FGFR-HFc did not cause necrosis or cell injury, and there was no evidence of nuclear fragmentation. Taken together, these findings support the concept that FGFR-HFc inhibited expansion of precursor cells that require FGF signaling in the pseudoglandular-canalicular period of development (E12.5–E16.5). Thereafter, lung morphogenesis proceeded relatively normally despite the expression of the FGF receptor inhibitor. The FGFR-HFc is a known inhibitor of FGF signaling, binding various FGF ligands, including FGF-10, FGF-1, and FGF-7. Widespread expression of this chimeric gene under control of the murine mammary tumor virus promoter caused abnormalities in the skeleton, limbs, skin, kidney, endocrine organs, and lung (28Celli G.

Because FGFR2IIIb and FGF-10 are both required for early lung morphogenesis, the presently observed effects of the FGFR-HFc are consistent with inhibition of FGF signaling in epithelial cells of the peripheral lung tubules during their formation. The SP-C promoter is highly active in the fetal and postnatal respiratory epithelium, directing expression of transgenes in a temporal-spatial pattern similar to that of the FGFR2 (32Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of lung morphogenesis was observed when the SP-C promoter was used to express a membrane-associated FGFR2 mutant, the present findings are consistent with the requirement of FGF signaling in a subset of respiratory epithelial cells that are critical for morphogenesis of the peripheral lung. Interestingly, in FGFR-HFc, FGFR2 mutant-expressing and FGF-10 (−/−) gene-targeted mice, some elements of the proximal trachea were formed (23Min H. Danilenko M. Scully S.A. Bolon B. Ring B.D. Tarpley J.E. DeRose M. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 28Celli G. LaRochelle W.L. Mackem S. Sharp R. Merlino G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1642-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 33Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of FGFR2IIIb resulted in failure of formation of trachea and main stem bronchi (20De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajihosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, maintenance of trachea and main bronchi may indicate that their development is independent of the FGFR-HFc or that the SP-C promoter was not active in the proximal regions of the forming lung buds. Thus, some aspects of proximal lung tubule formation may be independent of FGF-10 but dependent on other FGF signaling, perhaps mediated by other FGF ligands. Recent cell lineage studies demonstrated that proximal and peripheral airways are distinguished early in embryogenesis and that the members of progenitor cells forming the lung periphery were highly restricted at the tips of main bronchi at E12.5–13.5 (34Perl A.K.T. Wert S.E. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The present findings support the concept that FGF signaling to this subset of precursors is required between E12.5 and E14.5 for their survival and expansion during formation of the lung periphery, with their loss causing severe lung hypoplasia. We hypothesize that partial loss of these progenitors later (E14.5–E16.5) results in a partial loss of progenitor cells and resultant emphysema. Thus, FGF activity may be required at precise times for survival and/or expansion of only subsets of progenitor cells that are critical for the formation of the peripheral lung. In contrast to the severe effects of FGFR-HFc on fetal lung formation, postnatal alveolarization proceeded independently of the expression of the transgene. This result is not likely related to developmental changes in the expression of the SP-C-dependent transgene, which is known to be expressed at high levels in the postnatal period (32Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Perl A.K. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The SP-C promoter is increasingly active in late gestation and in the postnatal period. SP-C promoter-driven rtTA was expressed throughout the peripheral lung prenatally and perinatally in the SP-C-rtTA line used in the present study (32Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Perl A.K. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previous in situ hybridization studies utilizing this same SP-C-rtTA transgenic line with several (tetO)7 target constructs demonstrated that target gene expression was readily detected and is highly inducible, the latter being expressed in subsets of acinar and alveolar regions of the postnatal lung (22Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W.

In the present study, FGFR-HFc RNA was readily detected in the adult lung after exposure to doxycycline. Thus the lack of effect of FGFR-HFc on alveolarization in the postnatal period is not likely related to changes in expression of the transgene but to the lack of a requirement for FGF signaling after birth. Despite the emphysema, proximal-distal patterning of respiratory epithelial cell morphology and mRNAs were maintained in the FGFR-HFc-expressing mice. Both TTF-1 and SP-B mRNAs were expressed at sites similar to these observed in control mice. The emphysematous lungs of the affected mice contained fewer type II epithelial cells and pulmonary vessels, findings likely related to airspace enlargement. Although the lung-body weight ratio was reduced at E18.5 in FGFR-HFc-expressing mice, the ratio was not different at PN25, despite the presence of severe emphysema. This observation may indicate that compensatory growth has occurred during the postnatal period. The relative content of SP-B and TTF-1 mRNAs was similar at E18.5 and thereafter. Maintenance of SP-B expression is consistent with postnatal survival of the FGFR-HFc-expressing mice, because severe deficiency of SP-B causes lethal respiratory distress at birth (26Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, abnormalities of alveolar structures were associated with decreased vascularity. Morphometric analysis demonstrated decreased numbers of peripheral blood vessels seen after barium labeling of whole mount preparations. Thus, the paucity of endodermally derived respiratory epithelial cells was correlated with a failure to form vascular tissues, perhaps mediated by decreased production of angiogenic and vasculogenic factors. It is also possible that the FGFR-HFc directly inhibited FGF signaling to alter vascular development. In summary, these studies demonstrate a precise temporal requirement for FGF signaling for formation of the lung during the pseudoglandular-canalicular period of development. Although inhibition of FGF signaling during this period caused irreversible emphysema, postnatal alveologenesis proceeded normally despite expression of the FGFR inhibitor. In human infants, lung hypoplasia is associated with a number of clinical syndromes, including oligohydramnios, renal agenesis, and diaphragmatic hernia. The severity of lung hypoplasia and respiratory dysfunction in these syndromes is strongly influenced by the timing of the initiating events, the human lung being most vulnerable during the canalicular period of development. These clinical observations and the present transgenic model support the concept that perturbation of progenitor cells at critical times during lung morphogenesis can cause irreversible emphysema in the postnatal period.

In addition, at their N termini, all four family members contain a cysteine-rich domain similar to the R-type carbohydrate recognition domains of ricin. However, despite the common presence of multiple lectin-like domains, these four endocytic receptors have divergent ligand binding activities, and it is clear that the majority of these domains do not bind sugars. Here the functions of the lectin-like domains of the most recently discovered family member, Endo180, have been investigated. Endo180 is shown to bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner to mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine but not to galactose. This activity is mediated by one of the eight CTLDs, CTLD2. Competition assays indicate that the monosaccharide binding specificity of Endo180 CTLD2 is similar to that of mannose receptor CTLD4. However, additional experiments indicate that, unlike the cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor, the cysteine-rich domain of Endo180 does not bind sulfated sugars. Thus, although Endo180 and the mannose receptor are now both known to be mannose binding lectins, each receptor is likely to have a distinct set of glycoprotein ligands in vivo.

The four members of the family share a common structural organization. Each receptor is a type I transmembrane receptor with an extracellular region containing an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain similar to the galactose-binding domains of ricin, a fibronectin type II (FNII)1 domain, and either 8 (mannose receptor, phospholipase A2 receptor, and Endo180) or 10 (DEC-205) C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). The short cytoplasmic domain of each receptor mediates internalization of the receptor into the cell and recycling back to the plasma membrane (4Kruskal B.A. Sastry K. Warner A.B. Mathieu C.E.

These common features and the fact that the mannose receptor functions in the clearance of glycoproteins, initially suggested that a main function of each of these receptors would be to mediate cellular uptake of glycosylated ligands. However, although each receptor contains multiple lectin-like domains, the majority of these domains do not bind sugars. CTLDs are found in a wide variety of proteins and are characterized by a sequence motif that specifies a conserved fold (9Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). They were initially described in C-type lectins such as serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A) and the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which bind sugars in a Ca2+-dependent manner. However, it has become clear that many of these domains lack the residues required for Ca2+-dependent sugar binding and are thus predicted to have other functions. The majority of CTLDs within proteins of the mannose receptor family have not conserved the key amino acids required for coordination of Ca2+ ions and sugar residues, and on this basis none of the CTLDs within the phospholipase A2 receptor and DEC-205 are predicted to bind sugar (2Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-viiiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Indeed, sugar binding activity of DEC-205 has never been demonstrated, and the phospholipase A2 receptor binds a nonglycosylated protein ligand, phospholipase A2. The mannose receptor does mediate Ca2+-dependent sugar binding, but this activity appears to be is restricted to only two of the eight CTLDs (11Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the CTLDs, all four receptors in the mannose receptor family contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain with homology to the R-type carbohydrate-recognition domains found in ricin, some glycosyltransferases, and bacterial hydrolases (12Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor binds oligosaccharides terminating in GalNAc-4-SO4, such as those found on the pituitary hormones lutropin and thyrotropin (13Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C.

J. 1999; 2: 403-411Crossref Google Scholar). However, again this activity is unlikely to be shared with other members of the family. DEC-205 does not bind lutropin (15Leteux C. Chai W. Loveless R.W. Yuen C.T. Uhlin-Hansen L. Combarnous Y. Jankovic M. Maric S.C. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. Ten F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis predicts that the phospholipase A2 receptor and Endo180 will also not bind sulfated sugars (3East L. Isacke C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Endo180 was originally identified in a monoclonal antibody screen for novel fibroblast cell surface receptors and demonstrated to be an endocytic recycling glycoprotein (17Isacke C.M. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Trowbridge I.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2606-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Isolation of murine and human cDNAs revealed it to be the fourth member of the mannose receptor family (1Wu K. Yuan J. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

In contrast to the phospholipase A2 receptor and DEC-205, but in common with the mannose receptor, preliminary studies have demonstrated that Endo180 from cultured cell lysates binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner to immobilized GlcNAc (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the roles of the multiple lectin-like domains in sugar binding activity of Endo180 have been investigated using a combination of mutational analysis and expression of isolated domains. Restriction enzymes and other DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Nitriloacetic acid-agarose, monosaccharides, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Na125I and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were from AmershamBiosciences. Mannose30-BSA was purchased from E.-Y. Laboratories and iodinated by the chloramine-T method (20Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Immulon 4 96-well microtitre plates were obtained from Dynex Technologies. GlcNAc-, galactose-, mannose-, and fucose-Sepharose were prepared by the divinyl sulfone method (21Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Lutropin was purified from bovine pituitaries following the method of Papkoff and Gan (22Papkoff H. Gan J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 136: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). The generation of the human Endo180-specific monoclonal antibody A5/158 is described elsewhere (17Isacke C.M. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Trowbridge I.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2606-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second layer antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch. The cloning of Endo180 and generation of the pcDNA3-Endo180 expression construct has been previously described (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate Endo180-Fc fusion proteins in which the Endo180 was truncated after CTLD4 or CTLD2 (ΔCTLD5–8-Fc and ΔCTLD3–8-Fc, respectively; see Fig. 1), PCR was performed with ExpandTM long polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and pcDNA3-Endo180 as a template with a 5′ modified T7 primer (5′-CTGGCTTATCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA-3′) and the following 3′ primers, 5′-GTCTCGAGTTGAGGGCTGTCGTCGGGCTCC-3′ for ΔCTLD5–8-Fc and 5′-GTCTCGAGCCGGCTGCCATGGTCCTCCTCG-3′ for ΔCTLD3–8-Fc, where the underlined bases indicate anXhoI restriction site. Amplified DNA was digested withHindIII and XhoI and ligated into the pIgplus vector (R & D Systems) digested with the same enzymes. Mutation of Asn472 to an aspartic acid residue within ΔCTLD5–8-Fc was generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis method (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides 5′-GGCACCCCTTTGAGCCCGACAAACTTCCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGGAAGTTGTCGGGCTCAAAGGGGTGCC-3′, where the underlined bases indicate changes from the wild type sequence. pIgplus-Endo180-Fc constructs (100 μg) were transfected into 50–75% confluent COS-1 cells with 400 μg/ml DEAE/dextran, 100 μm chloroquine diphosphate in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 10% Me2SO osmotic shock medium for 2 min. The osmotic shock medium was replaced with 25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. 24 h later the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The supernatant was harvested after a 7-day period. The portion of the human Endo180 cDNA (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding for CTLD2 (nucleotides 1259–1651) was cloned into the expression vector pIN-IIIompA-2 (23Ghrayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to fuse the 5′ end of the cDNA to the codons specifying theompA signal sequence and to add a stop codon at the 3′ end. The integrity of the final expression plasmids was checked by DNA sequencing using an ABI prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. Luria-Bertani medium (1 liter) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 30 ml of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli strain JA221 containing the CTLD2 expression plasmid. The culture was grown with shaking at 25 °C to an A 550 of ∼1. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and CaCl2 were then added to final concentrations of 50 μm and 100 mm, respectively. After growth for a further 18 h at 25 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman JS-4.2 rotor. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JA14 rotor. The bacteria were sonicated in 30 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2 (loading buffer). Lysed bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed over a 10-ml GlcNAc-Sepharose column equilibrated in loading buffer. The column was washed with 30 ml of loading buffer and eluted with 10 × 2 ml of elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and CTLD2 was identified by N-terminal sequencing on a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Fractions containing pure CTLD2 were pooled, and protein was assayed using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with BSA as standard. The yield of pure CTLD2 ranged from about 0.5 to 1 mg/liter. The portion of the human Endo180 cDNA (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding for the cysteine-rich domain (nucleotides 236–643) was cloned into the expression vector pIN-IIIompA-2. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to fuse the 5′ end of the cDNA to the codons specifying the ompA signal sequence and to add codons specifying six histidine residues and a stop codon at the 3′ end. For protein expression, growth and induction ofE. coli strain JA221 containing the cysteine-rich domain plasmid was as described above for production of CTLD2, except that no CaCl2 was added at the time of induction. The bacteria were harvested as described above, resuspended in 100 ml of N1 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 20 mm imidazole, and lysed by sonication. Lysed bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed down a 1-ml column of nitriloacetic acid-agarose that was preloaded with 5 ml of 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated in N1 buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 10 ml of N1 buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and eluted with N1 buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the cysteine-rich domain was identified by N-terminal sequencing. For Endo180-Fc chimeras, 100 μl of COS-1 tissue culture supernatant in 900 μl of loading buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus 25 or 10 mm CaCl2) was loaded onto 2-ml columns of mannose-, GlcNAc-, fucose-, or galactose-Sepharose. The flow through was collected, and the columns were washed with 7 × 1 ml of loading buffer followed by 7 × 1 ml of elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm EDTA). For assay of Endo180 from Flow2000 fibroblasts, the cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2. Lysate (containing ∼20 μg of protein) was added to 1 ml of loading buffer containing 0.15% Triton X-100 and applied to the columns. The columns were washed in loading buffer plus 0.15% Triton X-100 and eluted in elution buffer plus 0.15% Triton X-100. The fractions were precipitated by incubation with 40 μg of BSA and 0.5 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g. The pellets were washed twice in 1:1 ethanol ether, air dried for 10 min, and resuspended in 40 μl of nonreducing sample buffer. The samples (10 μl) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Endo180 was detected using monoclonal antibody A5/158 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. The blots were developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Plastic microtitre plates with removable wells (Immulon 4) were coated with CTLD2 (50 μl/well of a 100 μg/ml solution of CTLD2 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2). Following incubation overnight at 4 °C, the wells were washed three times with cold washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by filling the wells with 5% (w/v) BSA in washing buffer and incubating for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the wells three times with cold washing buffer, aliquots (100 μl) of a range of concentrations of monosaccharide in washing buffer containing 125I-Man-BSA (1 μg/ml) and 5% BSA were added to the wells in duplicate. Following incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the wells were washed three times with cold washing buffer and counted on a γ counter. The values for K i (the inhibitor concentration that gives 50% inhibition of125I-Man-BSA binding) for each inhibitor were determined by fitting the data to the following equation for simple competitive inhibition: fraction of maximal binding =K I/(K I + [Inhibitor]). Previous studies have demonstrated that Endo180 solubilized from cultured cells displays Ca2+-dependent binding to immobilized GlcNAc (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts that this activity is likely to be mediated by CTLD2 because it is the only Endo180 CTLD that contains all of the five residues that ligate two hydroxyl groups of a monosaccharide and a Ca2+ in other sugar-binding CTLDs (Fig. 1). In addition, the presence of the sequence EPN (amino acids 470–472) at the position equivalent to the principal Ca2+-binding site of MBP-A and other mannose-specific C-type lectins predicts that Endo180 CTLD2 will ligate sugars with equatorial three and four hydroxyl groups, including GlcNAc and mannose (24Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To define the roles of the different domains of Endo180 and to investigate further the specificity of the receptor, the sugar binding activity of several different Endo180 expression constructs has been assessed. Soluble Endo180 constructs were generated as chimeric proteins fused to the Fc portion of human Ig. The presence of the Fc tail enables detection using anti-human Fc antibodies and, if required, purification of constructs on protein G columns. Endo180-Fc constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for their ability to bind to immobilized monosaccharides. In these assays, monosaccharide-Sepharose columns were loaded with expressed Endo180-Fc protein in Ca2+-containing buffer. After washing with the Ca2+-containing buffer, the columns were eluted with buffer containing EDTA to detect proteins bound to the column in a Ca2+-dependent manner. For initial studies, an Fc chimera containing Endo180 deleted after CTLD4 (Endo180ΔCTLD5–8-Fc; Fig. 2) was employed. A significant fraction of this Endo180-Fc construct is retained on columns of GlcNAc-, mannose-, and fucose-Sepharose but not on galactose-Sepharose and is eluted in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3 A). The results indicate that Endo180 has specificity for mannose and fucose as well as GlcNAc and that CTLDs 5–8 are not required for Ca2+-dependent binding of these monosaccharides.Figure 3Specificity of Endo180 binding to immobilized monosaccharides. Tissue culture supernatant containing Endo180ΔCTLD5–8-Fc construct (A) or Flow2000 cell lysate (B) was loaded onto GlcNAc-, mannose-, fucose-, or galactose-Sepharose columns. The columns were washed with loading buffer (containing 25 mm Ca2+) and then elution buffer. The fractions (Wash 1–7 and Elute 1–7) were analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that the increased size of the Fc construct results from Fc-mediated dimerization on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a previous, preliminary study of sugar binding by Endo180, only binding to immobilized GlcNAc and not to immobilized mannose and fucose was detected (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent selectivity for GlcNAc was somewhat surprising because C-type lectins that bind GlcNAc, including the mannose receptor and MBP-A, generally bind mannose and fucose as well (24Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The discrepancy in these data does not result from the use in this current study of chimeric constructs that are dimerized via their Fc tails because native Endo180 from Flow2000 cell lysates was also demonstrated to bind to mannose-Sepharose (Fig. 3 B), and identical binding profiles were obtained with a soluble Endo180 construct generated without an Fc tail (data not shown). Differences in the monosaccharide resins used are the most likely explanation for the difference between the results obtained here and those reported previously (18Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, monosaccharides were conjugated to Sepharose in the laboratory using a procedure that has been used to produce resins for study of sugar binding by other C-type lectins. It is likely that these resins contain a higher ratio of attached sugar compared with the commercial monosaccharide-agarose matrices used previously and consequently provide more effective substrates for lectin binding. Analysis of an Endo180-Fc chimera deleted after CTLD2 (Endo180ΔCTLD3–8-Fc; Fig. 2) indicates that CTLDs 3 and 4 are also not required for Ca2+-dependent sugar binding. Like the construct deleted after CTLD4, this truncated construct binds to mannose-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A) and GlcNAc-Sepharose (data not shown). The involvement of Endo180 CTLD2 in sugar binding was assessed further by mutation of key residues in Ca2+ site 2. In the first construct, Glu470 and Asn492 (Fig. 1) were each changed to alanine. However, this protein could not be expressed, suggesting that these two residues are required for the correct folding and stability of CTLD2. Because this unstable protein could not be assessed for sugar binding, a second construct was generated in which Asn472, another of the residues predicted to be involved in ligation of sugar and Ca2+ to CTLD2, was mutated. In MBP-A and E-selectin, the amide nitrogen of the equivalent asparagine residue forms a hydrogen bond to a sugar hydroxyl group, whereas the carbonyl oxygen forms a coordination bond with the Ca2+ ion that is also ligated to the sugar. Mutation of this Asn residue to Asp in the CTLDs of MBP-A (25Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and E-selectin (26Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M., Li, S. Huang K.S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) abolishes sugar binding activity because of a loss of the hydrogen bond to the sugar hydroxyl group. Asn472 in CTLD2 was mutated to aspartic acid in the context of the Endo180-Fc chimera containing Endo180 deleted after CTLD4 (Endo180ΔCTLD5–8(N472D)-Fc; Fig. 2). Binding of the mutated Endo80 construct to mannose-Sepharose is observed in the presence of 25 mm Ca2+, but this binding is reduced compared with the wild type construct (Fig. 4 B). However, at 10 mm Ca2+, the mutated construct does not bind to mannose-Sepharose, whereas binding of the wild type construct is not affected by the reduction in Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained when the constructs were tested on GlcNAc-Sepharose (data not shown). The assays were initially carried out at 25 mmCa2+, because this concentration has typically been used for assaying other C-type lectins and C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (25Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 27Burrows L. Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measured affinities of C-type carbohydrate recognition domains for Ca2+ are in the range 0.2–1.0 mm, and as long as Ca2+ is saturating, varying Ca2+ concentration does not affect sugar binding (29Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Weis W.I. Crichlow G.V. Murthy H.M. Hendrickson W.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that the mutated Endo180(N472D) construct shows no sugar binding activity at 10 mm Ca2+ indicates that the Ca2+ binding affinity of CTLD2 has been substantially reduced by the mutation and that the mutated construct would not have sugar binding activity at physiological Ca2+ concentration. These results indicate that Asn472 of CTLD2 is likely to be involved in ligation of sugar and Ca2+ and that CTLD2 is responsible for the sugar binding activity of the Endo180 construct deleted after CTLD4. The experiments with deletion constructs give a strong indication that CTLD2 is the domain responsible for mediating Ca2+-dependent binding of mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose to Endo180. To allow direct assessment of sugar binding activity by CTLD2, this domain was expressed in bacteria using an expression system that has been successful for producing other C-type domains (27Burrows L. Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,29Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CTLD is expressed as a fusion protein with the ompA signal sequence, which directs the protein into the periplasm where conditions are favorable for folding. Expressed CTLD2 was purified from the bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography on GlcNAc-Sepharose. Like the Endo180-Fc construct truncated after CTLD4, isolated CTLD2 binds to GlcNAc-, mannose-, and fucose-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner but does not bind to galactose-Sepharose (Fig. 5). The specificity of CTLD2 was further investigated using a competition assay in which monosaccharides compete for binding of125I-Man30-BSA to immobilized CTLD2. Unlike the column binding assays, which can only give a qualitative indication of specificity, this assay allows quantitative assessment of binding of different monosaccharides to CTLD2. Representative inhibition curves are shown in Fig. 6, with inhibition constants given in Table I. In agreement with the results obtained with monosaccharide resins, mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose are effective inhibitors of125I-Man30-BSA binding to CTLD2. The weak inhibition seen with galactose is likely to be due to interaction with the anomeric hydroxyl of the free sugar, because α-methylgalactoside does not inhibit binding of 125I-Man30-BSA. Such nonphysiological binding of galactose has been seen with other mannose-specific C-type lectins (28Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 32Ng K.K. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol.

The results suggest that Endo180 CTLD2 distinguishes between monosaccharides in a manner similar to that of other C-type lectins through recognition of the C-3 and C-4 hydroxyls and that like other mannose-speci"

Here we investigate the origin of the plasticity that governs this acquired ability by repeatedly exposing one nostril of non-detecting subjects to androstenone and then testing the unexposed nostril. We find that the exposed nostril and the naive nostril can both learn to recognize the smell, effectively doubling detection accuracy.

Amino acids not specified by the genetic code are common in native proteins and can be essential to both structure and function. Proteins that contain novel non-natural amino acid analogues, furthermore, are of value in structure and function studies and may possess beneficial therapeutic properties. Noncoded amino acids in proteins arise either by enzymatic modification of a transfer RNA (tRNA) aminoacylated with one of the 20 coded amino acids (e.g. selenocysteine from serine) or by post-translational modifications. Reproduction of these reactions when recombinant proteins are being expressed in heterologous hosts is often either inefficient or not possible. Because of these difficulties, many proteins that contain noncoded amino acids are not available in quantities sufficient for detailed biophysical and biochemical studies. Current methodology to make proteins that contain noncoded amino acids in in vitro systems is limited to the production of relatively small amounts of protein. Use of in vitroacylated suppressor tRNAs to insert amino acid analogues at termination codons in genes translated in vitro results in site-specific incorporation (1Mendel D. Cornish V.W. Schultz P.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) but suffers from inefficiency and low yield. These problems occur in part because of limitations in producing acylated tRNA, constraints in achieving appropriate concentrations of other translational components, and variability in suppression efficiency.In vivo approaches that use an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with both altered amino acid and tRNA recognition and suppressor tRNAs are promising (2Liu D.R. Magliery T.J. Pastrnak M. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10092-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Köhrer C. Xie L. Kellerer S. Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L.

A. 1999; 96: 4780-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but experimental hurdles inherent to this approach have not yet been fully overcome. In a general strategy to produce proteins containing novel amino acids, the use of DNA coding triplets to insert the amino acid analogue should be more efficient than use of termination codons. If an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is sufficiently promiscuous, it will aminoacylate cognate wild-type tRNA with an amino acid analogue, and the misacylated-tRNA can be used as usual by the translational machinery. This phenomenon has been exploited to produce proteins in prokaryotic systems that contain, for example, analogues of phenylalanine (5Yoshikawa E. Fournier M.J. Mason T.L. Tirrell D.A. Macromolecules. 1994; 27: 5471-5475Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and tryptophan (6Hogue C.W.V. Rasquinha I. Szabo A.B. MacManus J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two requirements must be met for success in these experiments: (1) the analogue must be acylated onto a tRNA at a demonstrable rate, and (2) the analogue must accumulate in the cell at concentrations high enough to give adequate acylation. The first requirement can, in theory, be met either by exploiting the promiscuity of a wild-type synthetase or through mutagenesis to alter the substrate specificity of a wild-type synthetase. The second requirement, although it is a prerequisite for analogue incorporation, is only beginning to be addressed (4Liu D.R. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4780-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS)1 is particularly intriguing with respect to these considerations. ProRS will activate several proline analogues, and some of these can be incorporated into heterologously produced proteins in E. coli. These analogues include l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (7Deming T.J. Fournier M.J. Mason T.L. Tirrell D.A. Macromolecules. 1996; 29: 1442-1444Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Fowden L.

In general, proline analogues demonstrated to be incorporated in vivo into proteins are activatedin vitro by ProRS at a rate approaching that of proline (11Papas T.S. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the proline analogues listed above,trans-4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) has been reported not to be activated by ProRS (11Papas T.S. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and incorporation of Hyp into E. coli-produced proteins has not been demonstrated (10Deming T.J. Fournier M.J. Mason T.L. Tirrell D.A. Polym. Mater. Sci. Eng. Proc. 1994; 71: 673-674Google Scholar). In none of these cases has the intracellular concentration of the analogue necessary to support expression and incorporation into protein been determined. Here we demonstrate that wild-type ProRS can be exploited to incorporate co-translationally trans-4-hydroxyproline efficiently in vivo into recombinant proteins. We reasoned that even a minimal rate of misactivation and misacylation of Hyp by ProRS would be sufficient for incorporation if high intracellular concentrations of Hyp could be achieved. We focused our attention, therefore, on manipulation of E. coli proline transport systems to effect the intracellular accumulation of Hyp. We show that a simple change in E. coli culture conditions results in the intracellular accumulation of Hyp to levels that support synthesis of Hyp-containing recombinant proteins. The initial goal was to produce, in E. coli, Hyp-containing human Type I collagen and collagen-like proteins. In addition to the collagens, our results should make it possible to insert Hyp into any protein synthesized inE. coli and furthermore may have applicability to other amino acid analogues. The gene for prolyl-tRNA synthetase was cloned fromE. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by polymerase chain reaction with primers designed from the published gene sequence (GenBanktm accession no. X55518). The 5′ primer added a flanking NcoI recognition site and the 3′ primer a flanking HindIII recognition site. The PCR product was digested with both NcoI and HindIII and ligated into NcoI/HindIII-digested pTrc99+ expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). After expression, ProRS was purified to homogeneity according to published procedures (12Liu H. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12708-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The gene for the Type I α1 collagen polypeptide was cloned by polymerase chain reaction of the gene from mRNA isolated from human foreskin cells (HS27/ATCC 1634) with primers designed from the published gene sequence (GenBanktm accession no.

The gene was cloned into theEcoRI/HindIII site of plasmid pBSKS+ (Stratagene), four mutations corrected using the ExSite kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the sequence confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and finally the EcoRI/XhoI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pGEX-4T.1 (Amersham Biosciences).

The plasmids were a generous gift from Dr. Jane Brokaw. Mannose-binding protein was expressed from plasmid pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). GST was expressed from plasmid pGEX-4T.1. ATP-PPi exchange assays were performed at 2 mm ATP as described (16Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorg. Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The second order rate constant (k cat/K m) for activation of Hyp by E. coli ProRS was calculated from the slopes of plots of the initial activation rates at Hyp concentrations between 5 and 50 mm and an enzyme concentration of 5 nm. The reported value is an average of three determinations. Because radioactively labeled hydroxyproline of sufficient specific activity is not available, we could not determine the kinetics of the aminoacylation of tRNAPro with Hyp. E. colistrain JM109 was cured of its proline auxotrophy-complementing episome by treatment with acridine orange (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Loss of the episome was confirmed by the inability of JM109 (F−) to grow on minimal medium that lacked proline. In expression experiments, cultures of JM109 (F−) that harbored the expression plasmid in Luria broth (LB) media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp) were grown overnight. Cultures were centrifuged and the cell pellets washed twice with M9 minimal media that contained 100 μg/ml Amp and supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 100 μg/ml of all amino acids except glycine and alanine, which were at 200 μg/ml and contained no proline. The cells were finally resuspended in the above media. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, hydroxyproline, proline, osmolyte, or IPTG was added when appropriate. After 3–4 h, aliquots of the cultures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A saturated culture of JM109 (F−) that harbored plasmid pGST-D4 in LB and contained 100 μg/ml Amp was used to inoculate 20 ml cultures of LB/Amp to A 600 nm of <0.1 absorbance unit. The cultures were grown with shaking at 37 °C toA 600nm between 0.7 and 1.0 absorbance units. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 10 ml of M9 media. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of M9/Amp media supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 100 μg/ml of all of the amino acids except proline. Cultures were grown at 37 °C for 30 min to deplete endogenous proline. After outgrowth, NaCl was added to the indicated concentration, Hyp was added to 40 mm and IPTG to 1.5 mm. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells from three 5-ml aliquots of each culture were collected separately on polycarbonate filters and washed twice with 5 ml of M9 media that contained 0.5% glucose and the appropriate concentration of NaCl. Cells were extracted with 1 ml of 70% ethanol by vortexing for 30 min at room temperature. Extract supernatants were taken to dryness, resuspended in 100 μl of 2.5 n NaOH, and assayed for Hyp by the method of Neuman and Logan (18Neuman R.E. Logan M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 184: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce) after cell lysis by three sonication/freeze-thaw cycles. The data are the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments. For purification of protein D4, crude GST-D4 was dissolved in 0.1 m HCl in a round-bottom flask with stirring. After the addition of a 2–10-fold molar excess of BrCN, the flask was evacuated and filled with nitrogen. Cleavage was allowed to proceed for 24 h, at which time the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a Vydac C4 reverse phase-HPLC column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μ, 300 Å). D4 eluted as a single peak at 26% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid during a gradient of 15–40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid during a 45-min period. Cleavage with BrCN in 70% formic acid resulted in extensive formylation of D4, presumably at the hydroxyl groups of the Hyp residues. Formylation of BrCN/formic acid-cleaved proteins has been noted previously (19Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was carried out at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT) on a Beckman ion exchange instrument with post-column derivatization. N-terminal sequencing was performed at this facility on an Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC system. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained with a VG Biotech BIO-Q quadropole analyzer by M-Scan, Inc. (West Chester, PA). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Yale University, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Department). A 1-mm path-length quartz suprasil fluorimeter cell was used. After a 10-min incubation period at 4 °C, standard wavelength spectra were recorded from 260 to 190 nm using 10-s acquisition times and 0.5-nm scan steps. For thermal melts, the temperature was raised in 0.5 °C increments from 4 to 85 °C with a 4-min equilibration between steps. Data were recorded at 221.5 nm. The thermal transition was calculated using the program ThermoDynaCD version 0.9.8, (written by P. Predki). We reasoned that two requirements were necessary to exploit the promiscuity of E. coli ProRS to misacylate tRNAPro so that insertion of Hyp at proline codons would occur during translation. The first requirement was the ability of ProRS to activate Hyp and subsequently charge tRNAPro with Hyp. We therefore examined the activation of Hyp by ProRS and found that hydroxyproline is a substrate for activation by E. coliProRS (Fig. 1 a). TheK m for Hyp is estimated to be at least 500 mm. It was not practical to assay for activation at hydroxyproline concentrations sufficiently above this concentration for a more accurate determination of the K m. The specificity constants (k cat/K m) for activation of hydroxyproline and proline by ProRS are 0.007 s−1·mm−1 and 450 s−1·mm−1 (11Papas T.S. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The ratio of these two constants, 1.5 × 10−5, is a measure of the fitness of hydroxyproline as a substrate compared with proline (20Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985Google Scholar). Thus, Hyp is activated in vitro by E. coli ProRS ∼5 orders of magnitude less efficiently than proline. At 100 mm amino acid concentration, the rate of activation of alanine by ProRS is comparable with that of Hyp (Fig. 1 a). The selectivity of E. coli ProRS for prolineversus Hyp and alanine in the activation step is comparable with that exhibited by other E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that activate noncognate amino acids (21Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of experimental limitations, we were not able to measure directly the transfer of activated Hyp to tRNAPro. In several cases of misacylation, synthetase-mediated editing removes the incorrectly activated or tRNA-esterified amino acid before insertion into a protein. E. coli ProRS can edit alanine misacylated tRNAPro (22Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) but does not edit misacylated cysteine-tRNAPro (23Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Editing has not been demonstrated for Hyp, and because E. coli ProRS is generally promiscuous and Hyp is not naturally present in E. coli, we proceeded on the assumption that E. coli ProRS would aminoacylate tRNAPro with Hyp and would not edit either Hyp adenylate or Hyp-tRNAPro. A second requirement must be met by in vivo approaches to amino acid analogue substitution; intracellular concentrations of the analogue sufficient to drive misacylation of the tRNA must be achieved. Because Hyp is activated poorly in vitro by ProRS compared with proline, we anticipated that high in vivoconcentrations of hydroxyproline would be necessary to result in enough Hyp-charged tRNAPro to support protein synthesis. To achieve this goal, we took advantage of the phenomenon that proline and other “compatible” solutes are actively accumulated intracellularly in response to hyperosmotic shock in E. coli and other prokaryotes (24Wood J.M. J. Membrane Biol. 1988; 106: 183-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Glaasker E. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 575-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proline porters encoded by the putP,proP, and proU genes mediate accumulation. BothproP and proU are up-regulated in response to osmotic shock (24Wood J.M. J. Membrane Biol. 1988; 106: 183-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 434-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 331-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulation of Hyp byE. coli has not been reported, although Hyp does partially block proline uptake by E. coli under normosmotic conditions (28Rowland I. Tristram H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 871-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to expect that E. coli would accumulate Hyp in lieu of proline if cultured in hyperosmotic media. Indeed, in media that lack proline but contain 40 mm Hyp,E. coli proline auxotrophic strain JM109 (F−) accumulates Hyp when cultured in increasing concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 1 b). The intracellular hydroxyproline concentration is proportional to the external NaCl concentration as high as ∼600 mm. At concentrations higher than 600 mm,accumulation plateaus, possibly because of saturation of the proline porters. Using a typical value for the volume of an E. colicell (1 × 10−15 liters), the intracellular concentration of hydroxyproline at 450 mm NaCl is ∼150 mm. This concentration represents an ∼4-fold increase over the extracellular concentration of 40 mm and is comparable with the increases typically found for proline under osmotic shock conditions (29Milner J.L. McClellan D.J. Wood J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1851-1860PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, this concentration approaches the estimated lower limit for the K m of hydroxyproline activation by ProRS. The question remained whether the intracellular hydroxyproline level in hyperosmotically shocked JM109 (F−) resulted in an adequate amount of hydroxyproline mischarged tRNAPro to support synthesis of a recombinant protein. To address this question, we tested expression of a fragment of the human Type I α1 collagen chain (Fig. 2, D4) fused to the C terminus of GST in JM109 (F−) under conditions of hyperosmotic shock. The collagen fragment comprises the C-terminal 193 amino acids of the triple helical region and the 26-amino acid C-terminal nonhelical telopeptide. To preclude the possibility that expression of the highly repetitive D4 gene would be limited by differences in codon usage inE. coli compared with humans, we synthesized the D4 gene from synthetic oligonucleotides designed to reflect optimal E. coli codon usage (30Wada K.-n. Wada Y. Ishibashi F. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20, (suppl.): 2111-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 31Grosjean H. Fiers W. Gene. 1982; 18: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Protein GST-D4 is efficiently expressed in JM109 (F−) in minimal media lacking proline but supplemented with Hyp and NaCl (Fig. 3). At a fixed NaCl concentration of 500 mm, expression is minimal at Hyp concentrations less than ∼10 mm, whereas the expression level plateaus at Hyp concentrations greater than 20 mm(Fig. 3 a). Likewise, at a fixed Hyp concentration of 40 mm, NaCl concentrations less than 300 mm result in little protein accumulation, and expression decreases at concentrations greater than 700–800 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 b). The sodium chloride concentrations that allow for the greatest accumulation of GST-D4 roughly correspond to those that cause the intracellular concentration of hydroxyproline to increase, which suggests that expression is limited in this range by the intracellular accumulation of hydroxyproline. Either sucrose or KCl can be substituted for NaCl as the osmolyte (Fig. 3 b). Thus, the osmotic shock-mediated intracellular accumulation of Hyp is the critical determinant of expression rather than the precise chemical identity of the osmolyte. Despite the large number of prolines (14 in GST and 52 in D4) in GST-D4, its size (46 kDa), and nonoptimal growth conditions, it is expressed at ∼10% of the total cellular protein. Expressed proteins of less than full-length that were indicative of aborted transcription or translation or mRNA instability were not detected.Figure 3Expression of Hyp-containing GST-D4 in JM109 (F−). a, dependence of expression of GST-D4 on hydroxyproline.

To confirm this, GST-D4 was cleaved with BrCN at methionines within GST and at the unique methionine at the N-terminal end of D4, and D4 was purified by reverse phase HPLC. Electrospray mass spectroscopy of this protein gave a single molecular ion corresponding to a mass of 20,807 Da. This mass is within 0.05% of that expected for D4 if it contains 100% Hyp in lieu of proline. Proline was not detected in amino acid analysis of purified D4, a finding again consistent with complete substitution of Hyp for proline. To confirm further that Hyp substitution had only occurred at proline codons, we sequenced the N-terminal 13 amino acids of D4. The first 13 codons of D4 specify the protein sequence H2N-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly-Leu- Ala-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly-Glu-Ser-Gly. The sequence found was H2N-Gly-Hyp-Hyp-Gly-Leu-Ala-Gly-Hyp-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Ser-Gly. Taken together these results indicate that Hyp was inserted only at proline codons and that the fidelity of the E. colitranslational machinery was not otherwise altered by either the high intracellular concentration of Hyp or hyperosmotic culture conditions. One of our goals was to develop the methodology to produce Hyp-containing collagen polypeptides in E. coli. The defining feature of the collagens is the Gly-X-Y repeating tripeptide. In vertebrate fibrillar collagens, Hyp in the Yposition is critical for the formation of a stable triple helical structure and subsequent fibrils (32Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar).Trans-4-hydroxyproline is not typically found in theX position in vertebrate collagens, but is found in this position in collagens from certain invertebrate species. The peptide (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10, which contains Hyp only in theX position, does not form triple helices under conditions in which (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 does (33Inouye K. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the influence of Hyp on triple helix stability is context-dependent, and the peptide Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 does form a triple helix (34Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our methodology does not discriminate between proline codons and will insert Hyp at any proline codon in either theX or Y position. Given these considerations, we were interested in the structural consequences of having Hyp in both the X and Y positions as found in D4. In neutral pH phosphate buffer D4 exhibits a CD spectrum characteristic of a triple helix (Fig. 4) (35Bhatnagar R.S. Gough C.A. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 183-199Crossref Google Scholar). A negative ellipticity at 198 nm and a positive ellipticity at 221 nm characterize this spectrum. When D4 was heated to 85 °C for 5 min before the CD spectrum was obtained, the magnitude of the absorbance at 198 nm was decreased and the absorbance at 221 nm was abolished (Fig. 4). This behavior is typical of the triple helical structure of collagen (35Bhatnagar R.S. Gough C.A. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 183-199Crossref Google Scholar). A thermal melt profile of D4 in phosphate buffer showed a melting temperature of 29 °C. A fragment of the C-terminal region of the bovine Type I α1 collagen chain comparable in length to D4 forms homotrimeric helices with a melting temperature of 27 °C (36Rossi A. Zuccarello L.V. Zanaboni G. Monzani E. Dyne K.M. Cetta G. Tenni R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6048-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, despite global Hyp for proline substitution in both the Xand Y positions, D4 forms triple helices of stability similar to comparably sized fragments of bovine collagen containing Hyp at the normal percentage and only in the Y position. These results support the notion that Hyp in the X position does not significantly destabilize the triple helix a priori but may, in specific situations, contribute to triple helix stability. Because Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 forms a triple helix but (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 does not, Pro in the Yposition may counteract the otherwise stabilizing effect of Hyp in theX position (34Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). D4 contains Gly-X-Ytriplets that place Hyp in multiple contexts with respect to neighboring amino acids; however, because of global Hyp for Pro substitution no triplets occur with contiguous Hyp and Pro. This fact, along with the overall increase in Hyp content in D4, may also contribute to its triple helix stability. The full-length human Type I α1 and α2 collagen polypeptides (ColECol(α1) and ColECol(α2), Fig. 2), although more than four times the size of D4, also express as N-terminal fusions with GST in JM109 (F−) in Hyp/NaCl media (Fig. 5 a). Like D4, the genes for the collagen portions of these proteins were constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides designed to mimic codon usage in highly expressedE. coli genes. In contrast, expression from a GST-human Type I α1 gene fusion (GST-HCol), identical to GST-ColECol(α1) in coded amino acid sequence but containing the human codon distribution, could not be detected in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates of induced JM109 (F−)/pHCol cultures (Fig. 5 a). Thus, sequence or structural differences between the genes for ColECol(α1) and HCol are critical determinants of expression efficiency in E. coli. This fact is likely the result of codon distribution in these genes and ultimately of differences in tRNA isoacceptor levels in E. coli compared with humans. However, additional effects on other transcription or translation steps cannot be excluded definitively. Interestingly, neither GST-ColECol(α1), GST-ColECol(α2), GST-D4, nor GST-HCol accumulates in either hyperosmotic shock media containing only proline or in rich media (data not shown). GST-ColECol(α1), GST-ColECol(α2), and GST-D4 are insoluble when expressed in Hyp-containing media at either 37 or 30 °C, and insolubility may segregate them from degradation pathways. Alternatively, the Hyp-containing proteins may escape degradation because they adopt a protease-resistant structure, whereas the proline-containing proteins do not. The large number of codons nonoptimal for E. colifound in the human gene and the instability of proline-containing collagen polypeptides in E. coli may, in part, explain why expression of human collagen in E. coli has not been reported previously. We sought to generalize our observations further by determining the expression of other proteins in Hyp/NaCl-containing media (Fig. 5 b). In addition to GST, mannose-binding protein, the mature TGF-1 polypeptide, a 70-kDa fragment of human fibronectin, a chimera of fibronectin and the mature TGF-β1 polypeptide, and a chimera of fibronectin and the mature bone morphogeneic protein 2 polypeptide are expressed in JM109 (F−) in Hyp/NaCl. In each case, expression is dependent on NaCl and Hyp. The number of prolines in these proteins varies between 9 (TGF-β1) and 32 (FN-TGF-β1). These results, along with successful expression of GST-ColECol(α1) containing 255 prolines, suggest that any number of prolines can be substituted with hydroxyproline, provided the protein accumulates inE. coli. Incorporation does not depend on the post-translational enzymatic oxidation of proline to hydroxyproline, and as expected for a mechanism operating at a translational rather than post-translational level, successful substitution does not depend on the precise sequence, structure, or activity of the recombinant protein. In media that contain a mixture of proline and hydroxyproline, the choice of which of these two amino acids is inserted at a given proline codon during translation should depend on the relative efficiency of ProRS-catalyzed aminoacylation of tRNAPro with the amino acid. Thus, selection of the appropriate ratio of proline to hydroxyproline in the growth media should make it possible to express proteins that contain any desired amount of hydroxyproline. To determine whether this is the case, we expressed GST in JM109 (F−) in media containing a fixed amount of hydroxyproline (40 mm) but increasing amounts of proline (Fig. 6). In medium containing either no proline or 1 μm proline, the migration positions of GST are identical, suggesting that these proteins contain comparable amounts of hydroxyproline. At 2.5 mm proline, GST migrates at the same position as GST expressed in media containing proline but no Hyp. At intermediate proline concentrations in the range of 1 to 30 μm, the migratory position of the protein is between these two extremes, which suggests that these proteins contain variable amounts of Hyp and proline. We estimate that 50% substitution of hydroxyproline for proline occurs at 10 μm or less proline in media containing 40 mm Hyp. The ratio of proline to hydroxyproline in the extracellular media at this concentration is 2.5 × 10−4. This ratio is close to the ratio of thein vitro specificity constants for activation of these two amino acids by ProRS (see above), which suggests that, in the absence of editing, the incorporation selectivity reflects the in vivo kinetics of activation and/or aminoacylation. Precise control of the degree of hydroxyproline substitution, coupled with genetic approaches to insert site-specific Hyp at theY-position of the Gly-X-Y repeat, may make it possible to produce human collagens with any desired Hyp composition. This system is an experimentally simple and robust way to insert Hyp into any proline-containing protein that can be synthesized in E. coli. The power of the method results from the use of DNA coding triplets and the wild-type amino acid synthetase/tRNA pair. In the general case, it is likely that only modest misacylation of a tRNA with an analogue is required, provided a sufficient intracellular concentration of the amino acid analogue can be achieved. Manipulation of amino acid transport systems to achieve intracellular accumulation of the analogue may be of general use and may be feasible with amino acid analogues other than Hyp. Other organisms, includingSaccharomyces cerevisiae (37Norbeck J.. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), alter metabolism in response to environmental stresses, and conditions may be found in these systems to promote the cellular uptake, accumulation, and incorporation of novel amino acid analogues. Strategically placed prolines can increase protein thermostability, and isomerization of proline residues can be the rate-limiting step in protein folding (38Watanabe K. Masuda T. Ohashi H. Mihara H. Suzuki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 39Lang K. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) suggests that inductive effects of electronegative substituents on the proline ring affect the rate and equilibrium position ofcis-trans isomerization and, consequently, triple helix stability. These effects are not likely to be specific to collagen and suggest that hydroxyproline may enhance stability or affect the rate of protein folding in noncollagenous proteins. The ability to produce large quantities of Hyp-containing proteins inE. coli should make possible biophysical and biochemical approaches to these areas and may open the door to novel proteins with unique therapeutic, biomaterial, or bioengineering applications.

Initial experiments using purified human Gα13 and the PKA catalytic subunit established that PKA directly phosphorylates Gα13. The location of this phosphorylation site was next investigated with a new synthetic peptide (G13SRIpep) containing the PKA consensus sequence (Arg-Arg-Pro-Thr203) within the switch I region of Gα13. G13SRIpep produced a dose-dependent inhibition of PKA-mediated Gα13 phosphorylation.

Such regulation can impact cellular signaling at multiple levels including enzymatic activity, protein structure, protein translocation, and protein-protein interactions, among others. Regarding seven-transmembrane receptors, evidence has been provided that phosphorylation of specific sites can serve to alter receptor-G protein coupling, initiate receptor internalization, and ultimately modulate cross-membrane receptor signaling (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Whereas such effects of receptor phosphorylation have been well documented, considerably less is known regarding the prevalence or the possible signaling consequences of G protein phosphorylation (2Sagi-Eisenberg R.

Nevertheless, several reports have provided evidence that G protein phosphorylation can alter heterotrimer complex formation and downstream signaling events. Specifically, Kozasa and Gilman (4Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vitro phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gαz by PKC1 results in conformational changes that inhibit interaction of the Gα and Gβγ subunits. A similar PKC-mediated phosphorylation effect on Gα-Gβγ interaction was observed by Fields and Casey (3Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for Gαzand by Murthy et al. (6Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30211-30219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for Gαi1/2. Offermanns et al. demonstrated that a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 occurred when human platelets were activated by thrombin, the TXA2 mimetic U46619, or the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (7Offermanns S., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26044-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Collectively, the above results therefore suggest that different Gα subunits can indeed serve as substrates for PKC. Whereas the functional consequences of such phosphorylation remain largely unknown, the strategic position of G proteins in the signaling cascade suggests that phosphorylation-mediated changes in G protein conformation or activity could serve as a significant regulatory point in the signaling process. In this connection, we recently provided evidence that TXA2receptor-coupled Gα13 is phosphorylated through a PKA-mediated process (8Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results represented the first demonstration that a platelet Gα subunit is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase and provided a possible explanation for the high sensitivity of TXA2 receptor signaling to increased cAMP levels. The present studies extend these findings by characterizing the specific PKA phosphorylation site in Gα13 and identifying the molecular and functional consequences of this phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that PKA phosphorylates Gα13 at Thr203, which is situated within the functionally important switch I region of the Gα subunit (9Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S.

This phosphorylation results in stabilization of Gα13 coupling to TXA2 receptors and destabilization of Gα13 coupling to its βγ subunits. Separate experiments also provided evidence that a functional consequence of this phosphorylation is decreased basal Rho activation levels. Thus, PKA-mediated Gα13 Thr203phosphorylation appears to represent a novel mechanism for the regulation of signaling through the Gα13 pathway.

For phosphorylation of purified Gα subunits, 5 pmol of Gα subunit was added to 20 mm [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol), PKAcat (protein kinase A, catalytic subunit (50 ng; 60 units) or PKA vehicle (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm EDTA, 50% ethylene glycol) in phosphorylation buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a total reaction volume of 115 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and were visualized by silver staining (19Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography. COS-7 cells and CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected when the cells were 80–90% confluent in 100-mm culture dishes. The medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using 10 μg of DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE per transfection. After 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was supplemented with 1 volume of 20% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with cDNAs for Gα13, Gβ1, and Myc-tagged Gγ2subunits was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections in CHO cells with human Gα13 wild type (Gα13-WT) or Gα13-T203A mutant plasmids were performed as described above. After 3 days of transfection, G418 (500 μg/ml) was added for selection. After 3–5 weeks, the stable cell lines were established and confirmed by Western blot. The transfected cells were washed three times with cold PBS and were harvested with lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the BCA protein assay method. The protein concentration of each lysate was adjusted to be equal within an experiment and was typically 0.50–2.0 mg/ml. Aliquots of 0.6 ml were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml Gα13antibody and were subsequently incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (55 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexed beads were washed once with lysis buffer and were supplemented with resuspension buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.014% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 85 μl of protein-bound beads were then incubated with 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 150 ng of PKA, 1 mm cAMP, and the indicated concentration of blocking peptide in a total volume of 125 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, after which time the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with resuspension buffer. The beads were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer plus resuspension buffer, and immune complexes were eluted by boiling. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and autoradiography. Phosphorylated proteins on autoradiograms were quantified using a densitometer (Protein Databases, Inc., Huntington Station, NY), and values were normalized for the amount of silver-stained protein on the gel. Gα13 was cloned from a human adenocarcinoma LoVo cell line and was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector. The Gα13 mutation with the substitution of Ala for Thr203 was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. 12 units of outdated human platelets were pooled and incubated with 3 mm aspirin for 45 min. Solubilized platelet membranes were then prepared as previously described (8Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), yielding a typical protein concentration of 4.5 mg/ml. Solubilized membranes were phosphorylated and purified by ligand affinity chromatography, as described (8Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized proteins were incubated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or vehicle (H2O), 100 μl of ATP, 60 mmCaCl2, and incubation medium (45 mm histidine HCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm NaF, 120 mm KCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylated samples were supplemented with 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm CHAPS and were incubated on the ligand affinity columns overnight at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were washed with buffer D (20 mm Tris base, 10 mmCHAPS, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin, pH 7.4) supplemented with 20 mm NaF and 2 mm orthovanadate. TXA2 receptor-G protein complexes were eluted from the column with the TXA2antagonist BM13.177 in buffer D at a flow rate of 0.125 ml/min. A 3-ml elution fraction was collected, dialyzed in 10 mmNH4HCO3, and then lyophilized. Proteins were reconstituted into 150 μl of H2O and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Rho activation was determined as previously described (20Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). CHO-Gα13-WT and CHO-Gα13-T203A mutant cells were seeded on six-well plates, grown to 80% confluence, and serum-starved for 24 h. Following treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) at 37 °C for 15 min, the cells were washed once with PBS and harvested with 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 1 min and incubated with 20 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-Rho binding domain fusion protein conjugated with glutathione beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. Bound RhoA was detected by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against RhoA. Data were analyzed according to the analysis of variance using Dunnett's multiple comparison post-test or Student's t test, as indicated, using GraphPad PRISM statistical software (San Diego, CA). Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05, p < 0.01, orp < 0.002, as indicated. Whereas we previously demonstrated that cAMP induces phosphorylation of TXA2 receptor-coupled Gα13 in human platelets (8Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these results did not determine whether the observed phosphorylation is directly mediated by PKA or whether additional kinases are involved. In order to address this question, additional studies were performed using human Gα13 purified from Sf9 cells (16Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcat). Electrophoretic separation and silver staining of these samples revealed the presence of a single protein at 44 kDa corresponding to Gα13 (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1 and 2) but no such band in the presence of PKA alone (Fig. 1 a, lane 3). Analysis of this gel by autoradiography revealed substantial phosphorylation of Gα13 (at 44 kDa) when PKA is added (Fig. 1 b,lane 1) but no phosphorylation (Fig. 1 b, lane 2) in the absence of PKA. These experiments therefore establish that PKA alone is sufficient to phosphorylate Gα13. The specificity of this Gα13 phosphorylation was examined in parallel experiments by assaying a separate platelet G protein, Gαi (purified from Sf9 cells as previously described) (17Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 aillustrates a single protein band (lanes 4 and5) corresponding to Gαi. However, it can also be seen (Fig. 1 b, lanes 4 and5) that no phosphorylation of Gαi was observed in either the presence or the absence of PKA. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PKA directly phosphorylates Gα13and that this reaction does not require intermediate kinases or other co-factors. A 14-amino acid synthetic peptide (G13SRIpep) corresponding to the specific Gα13 amino acid sequence Leu197–Tyr209 was initially used to locate the PKA phosphorylation site of Gα13. This amino acid region was selected because analysis of the primary structure of the Gα13 subunit revealed only one PKA consensus sequence represented by Arg-Arg-Pro-Thr203. On this basis, G13SRIpep, which encompasses this region, was used to probe the Leu197-Tyr209 region for potential phosphorylation. Thus, it was reasoned that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Gα13 would be blocked or reduced by a competing peptide substrate (G13SRIpep) containing an amino acid sequence that is identical to that contained within Gα13. In these experiments, human wild type Gα13 was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS-7 cell using protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to an anti-peptide antibody directed against the N terminus of Gα13(G13-N IgG). The α subunit-antibody-bead complex was then incubated with PKAcat and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of G13SRIpep. Following incubation, the proteins were eluted from the beads and were subjected to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. It can be seen that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation was comparable for each Gα13-transfected COS-7 cell sample (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–6). It can also be seen that PKA induced a substantial Gα13 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 b, lane 1). Furthermore, upon the addition of G13SRIpep, there was a dramatic dose-dependent inhibition of this PKA-mediated effect (Fig. 2 b, lanes 2–5). Quantitation of this peptide inhibition is illustrated in Fig. 2 c, where it can be seen that Gα13 phosphorylation was significantly blocked at a peptide concentration of as little as 50 μm, and was completely inhibited at a peptide concentration of 500 μm. Fig. 2 a, lanes 7 and8, demonstrate that the vector-transfected COS-7 cells do not reveal detectable amounts of Gα13 under these conditions, and consistent with this finding, there was no observed PKA-induced phosphorylation in the 44-kDa region of the immunoprecipitated protein samples (Fig. 2 b,lanes 7 and 8). These findings using transfected COS-7 cells therefore confirm our previous results in platelets showing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Gα13and suggest that the PKA phosphorylation site of Gα13 is contained within the Leu197–Tyr209 sequence. However, since it is possible that the ability of G13SRIpep to block phosphorylation was due to a nonspecific peptide effect, a control peptide was evaluated in subsequent experiments. Specifically, it was reasoned that the most appropriate control would employ a peptide with an amino acid sequence identical to that of G13SRIpep, the only difference being substitution of a phosphorylated Thr in the peptide sequence. Thus, the phosphorylated peptide should serve as a poor substrate for PKA. On this basis, G13SRIpepP was synthesized and tested for its ability to affect PKA-mediated phosphorylation under the same experimental conditions as those used for G13SRIpep. As can be seen in Fig3 a, lanes 1–4, equal amounts of Gα13 protein were immunoprecipitated under each experimental condition. It can also be seen (Fig. 3 b, lane 1) that PKA addition again resulted in substantial Gα13phosphorylation. However, in contrast to the effects of G13SRIpep, the addition of G13SRIpepP was completely ineffective in blocking this PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 3 b,lanes 2 and 3), even at a concentration (500 μm) that resulted in complete inhibition by G13SRIpep. The quantitative analysis of these phosphorylation profiles is illustrated in Fig. 3 c. Since Gα13 contains only a single PKA consensus sequence within Leu197–Tyr209, these findings therefore suggest 1) that G13SRIpepspecifically acts to block PKA-induced phosphorylation of Gα13; 2) that the location of the PKA phosphorylation site is contained within the Leu197–Tyr209sequence of Gα13; and 3) that Thr203 serves as the phosphorylation site within this sequence.Figure 3No Inhibition of PKA-induced phosphorylation of Gα13 by G13SRI-P peptide. a, silver stain of immunoprecipitated Gα13 protein. b, autoradiogram of phosphorylated Gα13; c, quantitative analysis of PKA-induced phosphorylation; n = 4. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to provide independent confirmation that Thr203 is in fact the residue phosphorylated by PKA, a mutant Gα13 (Gα13-T203A) was produced in which Thr203 was changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. In these experiments, the Gα13-T203A mutant (or wild type Gα13) was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS-7 cells using the G13-N antibody, and the α subunit-antibody-bead complex was subjected to phosphorylation, as described earlier. It can be seen (Fig. 4 a, lanes 1–4) that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation was comparable for both wild type and mutant protein. However, a comparison of the phosphorylation profiles reveals that substitution of Thr203 with Ala resulted in a complete loss of PKA-mediated Gα13 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 b). In this regard, some experiments revealed a minor phosphorylation in the mutant with or without PKA. However, this apparent phosphorylation was not found to be significantly different from vector control, and no detectable phosphorylation was observed in the mutant autoradiogram (Fig. 4 b, lanes 3 and 4). The complete absence of PKA-induced phosphorylation in the T203A mutant, in combination with the previous results, therefore provides evidence that PKA phosphorylates a single site at Thr203contained within switch I region of Gα13. The next series of experiments investigated the molecular consequences of this PKA-mediated Thr203 phosphorylation. Because phosphorylation is known to alter protein conformation and function, it is possible that Thr203 phosphorylation may change the conformational or chemical characteristics of Gα13 and thereby alter its normal function in the receptor-coupled signaling process. Indeed, this possibility might be anticipated for two reasons: 1) Thr203 resides within switch I region of the Gα13 subunit, and 2) the switch I region is considered important for modulating activation of the α subunit and for regulating its affinity for the βγ subunits (16Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we examined whether PKA phosphorylation of the switch I region Thr203 residue affects the stability of the Gαβγ13 heterotrimeric complex. In these studies, COS-7 cells were transfected with either wild type or mutant Gα13 (Gα13-T203A) as well as with β and Myc-tagged γ2. The βγ subunits were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. It can be seen that co-transfection of β and Myc-tagged γ2 cDNAs alone (without Gα13) showed no Gα13 protein in either the lysate or the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5, row a,lane 3, and row b,lane 3). As expected, Gα13 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5 row a, lane 2) and present in the lysate (Fig. 5, row b, lane 2) when the cells were co-transfected with β, Myc-tagged γ2 cDNAs, and wild type Gα13. On the other hand, no such Gα13 immunoprecipitation was observed (Fig. 5,row a, lane 1) when the co-transfection was done with Gα13-T203A mutant. Furthermore, Western blotting of total cell lysates demonstrated that both constructs of Gα13 were expressed at the same levels (Fig. 5, row b, lanes 1 and2), suggesting that the inability of mutated Gα13 to complex with β1γ2 was not due to insufficient expression. These findings therefore suggest that mutation of Gα13 at Thr203 disrupts heterotrimer stability. The next series of experiments extended the above finding and investigated possible consequences of Gα13 Thr203 phosphorylation on stability of the receptor-Gα13 complex. To this end, affinity purification of the receptor-G protein complex was employed. This technique has previously been used to co-purify native TXA2receptors with their associated Gα proteins (21Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Djellas Y. Manganello J.M. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol.

Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, solubilized platelet membranes were prepared and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP plus [γ-32P]ATP. The TXA2 receptor-G protein complexes were then purified by affinity chromatography (8Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the column eluate was assayed for TXA2 receptor, Gα13, Gαq, and β subunits by immunoblotting. It can be seen that in the absence of 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 6 a,lane 1) TXA2 receptors co-purified with their associated G protein heterotrimeric complexes. Thus, the TXA2 receptor elute fractions yielded positive immunoreactivity for the Gα13, Gαq, and Gβ subunits. It can also be seen, however, that 8-Br-cAMP treatment produced a significant shift in this elution profile (i.e. a substantial increase in co-eluted Gα13 and a substantial decrease in co-eluted Gβ) (Fig. 6 a, lane 2). On the other hand, 8-Br-cAMP treatment produced no change in the amounts of either Gαq or TXA2receptor (Fig. 6 a, lanes 1 and2). Quantitation of these results is illustrated in Fig. 6 b.

Another group of caspases that have long prodomains include caspase-1, -2, -4, -5, -9, -11, -12, and -13, each of which contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (17Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J.

Cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and caspase-9 form the apoptosome leading to caspase-9 activation (19Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

By contrast, caspases with short prodomains, including caspase-3, -6, -7, and -14 are believed to be downstream effector caspases that depend on the upstream initiator caspases for full processing and activation (2Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The induced proximity model suggests that adaptor-mediated clustering of initiator caspase zymogens leads to their autoprocessing to form active caspases (22Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the evidence that oligomerization of procaspases is sufficient to cause caspase activation (23Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Moreover, high local concentrations of recombinant caspases in bacteria extracts lead to spontaneous caspase processing (26Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

Therefore, high local concentrations of caspase-8 and caspase-10 in the DISC and caspase-9 in the apoptosome may lead to caspase activation through dimer formation. Comparisons between the crystal structures of procaspases and active caspases suggest that conformational changes lead to exposure of the protease active sites in active caspases (18Shi Y. Mol.

Therefore, dimer formation may activate caspases by inducing conformational changes that facilitate proteolytic processing of caspase zymogens into active protease subunits. Although dimerization is sufficient to activate caspases, the exact mechanism of caspase activation in the dimer has not been resolved. It is possible that one procaspase cleaves an adjacent procaspase by an intermolecular processing mechanism. Alternatively, each procaspase in the oligomer may cleave itself by an intramolecular processing mechanism. In this study, we provide evidence that the formation of a stable dimeric intermediate induces caspase activation by an intramolecular processing mechanism. A synthetic rapamycin analog, AP20840 (Ariad Pharmaceutics), was used as the chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) to induce dimer formation between one FK506-binding protein containing a F36V mutation (FV) and one FKBP rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of the FKBP rapamycin-associated protein. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HA1.1 antibodies were obtained from Convance (Berkeley, CA). Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 was from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. FKBP containing an FV has been described (32Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L., Lu, X. Cerasoli F., Jr. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The FRB domain used in this study contains FKBP rapamycin-associated protein amino acid residues 2025–2114 with a threonine to leucine mutation at amino acid 2098. A single copy of FV or FRB was used to construct fusion proteins to ensure that each fusion protein has only one binding site for the rapamycin analog, AP20840. Part of the prodomain and the entire protease domain of caspase-8 (amino acid residues 207–479), caspase-10 (amino acid residues 210–522), or caspase-9 (amino acid residues 139–415) were fused in frame to the C terminus of FV or FRB. The entire coding region of caspase-3, caspase-6, or caspase-7 was fused to the C terminus of FV or FRB. An HA or FLAG tag was fused to the N terminus of each Fv and FRB construct, respectively. The cysteine residues in the QACQG protease active site of caspase-8 (amino acid residue 360) and caspase-10 (amino acid residue 415) or the QACGG protease active site of caspase-9 (amino acid residue 315) were mutated to serine by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The frozen mutant of caspase-8 (caspase-8DD/AA) was generated by mutating amino acid residues 374 and 384 from aspartate into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis according to the protocol of the supplier (Stratagene). Plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing, and those free of errors were used for experiments. HeLa cells in 6-well plates were transfected with wild type and cysteine to serine mutation (C/S) mutant caspase constructs at the indicated amounts plus 1 μg of pcDNA3-lacZ by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). 18 h after transfection the cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were then stained by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml X-gal, 5 mm ferricyanide, 5 mm ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 0.01% SDS at 37 °C. Jurkat T cells were transfected with 10 μg of both FV and FRB fusion constructs plus 3 μg of a GFP plasmid by electroporation (Bio-Rad). After an 8-h culture, live cells were purified by Ficoll gradient separation, and 200 μl cells (2.5 × 105/ml) were added to 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. The cells were incubated with CID at the indicated concentrations. 24 h later the cells were harvested and stained with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated annexin V propidium iodide (Sigma). Propidium iodide−, annexin V−, and GFP+ cells were quantitated by flow cytometry. Percentage of cell loss (% apoptosis) was calculated as described previously (33Wang J. Lobito A.A. Shen F. Hornung F. Winoto A. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To detect caspase processing, 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of different fusion constructs by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche). The cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h and treated with 100 nm CID for different periods. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1:1 protease inhibitor mixture from Roche, and 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp) and used for Western blot analysis using anti-HA1.1 (Convance) or anti-FLAG antibody and developed by the chemiluminescent method (Pierce). Different constructs were transfected into 293T cells by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche). 18 h later the cells were incubated with or without 100 nm CID at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp, and 1:1 protease inhibitor mixture from Roche). The cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibodies or for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG. Protein G beads (AmershamBiosciences) coated with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) were incubated with cell lysates at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-HA1.1 (Convance). The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (AmershamBiosciences) and developed by the chemiluminescent method (Pierce). Crystal structural and biochemical studies suggest that procaspases dimerize prior to proteolytic activation (18Shi Y. Mol.

A protease-deficient caspase could potentially form a dimer with a wild type caspase and thereby dominantly inhibit the activation of the wild type caspase. To examine the potential dominant negative effects of caspase mutants that contain a mutated protease active site, we examined their interactions with wild type caspases in HeLa cells. As expected, expression of wild type caspase-8, caspase-9, or caspase-10 induced significant apoptosis in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Protease-deficient mutants with a C/S in the protease active site caused no detectable apoptosis (Fig. 1). We then co-transfected the wild type and C/S mutants of these caspases. However, the caspase-C/S mutants displayed no inhibitory effects on wild type caspases in inducing apoptosis (Fig. 1). We also observed no dominant inhibitory effects when 3-fold more mutant caspases than wild type caspases were used in the experiments (data not shown). By contrast, baculovirus p35 significantly inhibited apoptosis induction by these caspases (Fig. 1). Similar data were observed in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, caspases containing mutated active sites are inefficient inhibitors of their wild type counterparts. The puzzling observations that C/S mutants are incapable of inhibiting the functions of wild type caspases prompted us to study the molecular mechanism of caspase activation. Because caspases can undergo dimer-dependent activation, we set out to examine how enzymatically inactive C/S caspases interact with wild type caspases after their dimerization. Chemically induced homodimerization has been successfully used to study caspase activation (23Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 24Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present study, we adapted a system for chemically induced heterodimerization. Because rapamycin is a bivalent agent that binds to both FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and the FRB domain of FKBP rapamycin-associated protein simultaneously (34Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), FKBP12 and FRB domains can be fused to distinct proteins for rapamycin-dependent heterodimer formation. For improved specificity, we used a FKBP12 variant, FV (32Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L., Lu, X. Cerasoli F., Jr. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), containing a phenylalanine to valine mutation at amino acid residue 36 and the FRB domain of FKBP rapamycin-associated protein (amino acid residues 2025–2114) containing a threonine to leucine mutation of amino acid 2098. A synthetic rapamycin analog, AP20840, was used throughout this study as a CID. Only one FV or one FRB domain was used in each fusion protein so that each fusion protein has only one CID interacting domain. We replaced the prodomain of caspase-8 with either FV or FRB. To test whether the system is suitable for studying caspase activation, we measured apoptosis induction after dimer formation between FV-caspase-8 and FRB-caspase-8 in Jurkat T cells. CID did not induce apoptosis in cells expressing FV or FRB only (Fig. 2 A). CID also failed to cause apoptosis in cells expressing FV and FRB-caspase-8 or FV-caspase-8 and FRB (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, significant apoptosis was induced by dimer formation between FV-caspase-8 and FRB-caspase-8. Therefore, two caspase-8 molecules are required for caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induction. We also observed similar data with caspase-9 (Fig. 2 B) and caspase-10 (Fig. 2 C). We also tested caspase-8 containing a cysteine to serine mutation in the conserved proteolytic active site (caspase-8C/S) that abolishes the protease activity. As expected, CID-induced dimer formation between FV-caspase-8C/S and FRB-caspase-8C/S caused no apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, homodimerization of caspase-9C/S or caspase-10C/S also induced no apoptosis (Fig. 2,B and C). To investigate why protease-deficient caspases are poor inhibitors of wild type caspases, we measured apoptosis induction by dimerization between wild type caspase-8 and caspase-8C/S. Surprisingly, CID-induced dimer formation between FV-caspase-8 and FRB-caspase-8C/S caused significant levels of apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). Dimerization between FV-caspase-8C/S and FRB-caspase-8 also induced significant apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). However, the levels of apoptosis induced by one wild type and one C/S mutant of caspase-8 were slightly lower than the levels induced by two wild type caspases-8. We also observed a similar phenomenon between wild type and C/S mutant of caspase-9 (Fig. 2 B) or caspase-10 (Fig. 2 C). Apoptosis induced by dimerization between a wild type caspase and a C/S mutant may explain the difficulties in using protease-deficient caspases as dominant negative molecules to inhibit wild type caspases (Fig. 1). Although dimerization is sufficient to activate caspases, the exact model of caspase activation has not been resolved. It is still unclear whether each caspase in the dimer cleaves itself by intramolecular processing or cleaves the other caspase by intermolecular processing. If intermolecular processing were responsible for caspase activation, dimerization between wild type caspase-8 and caspase-8C/S would lead to processing of the mutant by wild type caspase-8 (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand the intramolecular processing model would predict that dimerization between wild type caspase-8 and caspase-8C/S results in autoprocessing of wild type caspase-8 but not caspase-8C/S (Fig. 3 A). To distinguish between these models, we examined caspase processing after dimerization between caspase-8 and its C/S mutant. As expected, dimerization between FV-caspase-8 and FRB-caspase-8 resulted in the processing of both caspase-8 molecules (Fig. 3 B, panels a and e). Also, CID-induced dimer formation of FV with FRB-caspase-8 or FV-caspase-8 with FRB caused no caspase processing (data not shown). Therefore, two caspase-8 molecules are required for caspase activation to occur. Interestingly, FV-caspase-8 was processed after dimerization with FRB-caspase-8C/S (Fig 3 B, panel b). Therefore, caspase-8C/S contributes to the activation of wild type caspase-8 in a dimer. Similarly, FRB-caspase-8 was processed after dimerization with FV-caspase-8C/S (Fig. 3 B, panel g). Because caspase-8C/S does not have a functional protease active site, it cannot cleave itself or the other caspase in the dimer (Fig. 3 B, panels d and h). Therefore, it is likely that the wild type caspase-8 had cleaved itself by intramolecular processing (Fig. 3 A). Because caspase-8C/S has no functional proteolytic site, its homodimerization caused no caspase processing (Fig. 3 B,panels d and h). However, caspase-8C/S was cleaved following dimer formation with enzymatically active caspase-8 (Fig. 3 B, panels c and f). Wild type caspase-8 is likely to be responsible for the processing of caspase-8C/S. Wild type caspase-8 may cleave caspase-8C/S before its intramolecular processing. Alternatively, wild type caspase-8 may undergo intramolecular processing first before acquiring the ability to process other caspases in trans. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we mutated the two aspartate residues that are required for processing between the large (p20) and the small (p10) subunits of the caspase-8 protease domain. Unlike wild type caspase-8, this “frozen” aspartate to alanine (DD/AA) cleavage mutant failed to undergo intramolecular processing between p20 and p10 after dimerization with caspase-8C/S (Fig. 4,panel f versus panel h). We then tested whether the DD/AA mutant retains the ability to confer intermolecular processing after dimerization with another caspase-8. Caspase-8DD/AA can support the processing of a wild type caspase-8 after its dimerization (Fig. 4, panel c). However, caspase-8DD/AA failed to induce the processing of caspase-8C/S after its dimerization (Fig. 4, panel d). Therefore, the caspase-8DD/AA that lacks the potential for intramolecular processing cannot cleave caspase-8C/S following dimerization. This suggests that intramolecular processing is the first step in the cleavage of initiator caspase after dimer formation. In the absence of intramolecular processing, intrans processing does not take place efficiently. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 can both be recruited into the DISC (15Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M.

However, we found that heterodimerization between caspase-8 and caspase-10 did not induce apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). We also failed to observe caspase processing between caspase-8 and caspase-10 after dimerization (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). This suggests that caspase-8 and caspase-10 induce apoptosis independently, although they may come into close proximity in the DISC and may activate similar downstream pathways. We next tested whether apoptosis and caspase processing occur after dimerization between caspase-8 and caspase-9 or with effector caspases, including caspases-3, -6, and -7 (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, we detected no caspase activation or apoptosis in each case when two different caspases were dimerized (Fig. 5, A andB, lanes 3–12). Therefore, dimer-mediated caspase activation specifically takes place between the same procaspases. One possible explanation for the stringent requirement for homotypic processing is that two different caspases may not be able to achieve a stable dimeric structure for caspase activation. Therefore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the caspase dimers. We immunoprecipitated FRB-caspase-8 and analyzed the associated FV-caspase-8 by Western blot. As expected, FV-caspase-8 was co-precipitated with FRB-caspase-8 (Fig. 6 A, upper panel,lane 2). Moreover, the majority of the associated FV-caspase-8 in the immunoprecipitate was processed (Fig. 6 A, upper panel, lane 2). The association between FV-caspase-8 and FRB-caspase-8 is most likely through caspase-8 protease domains because FV and FRB cannot stably associate in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). In contrast, we observed no stable dimer formation between FRB-caspase-8 and FV-caspase-9, FV-caspase-10, or FV-caspase-3 (Fig. 6 A, upper panel, lanes 4, 6, and 8). Thus, caspase-8 cannot form stable dimers with the protease domains of other caspases. This may explain the failure of these different caspases to activate each other. We also tested the interactions of caspase-9 with other caspases by co-immunoprecipitation. Because dimerization between two wild type caspases-9 leads to rapid cleavage and disappearance of caspase-9 (data not shown), we used the C/S mutant of caspase-9 in this immunoprecipitation study. We found that FRB-caspase-9C/S can co-precipitate FV-caspase-9C/S but not FV-"
https://openalex.org/W2032286103,"The electrostatic interaction of the charge cluster of an amphipathic peptide antibiotic with microbial membranes is a salt-sensitive step that often determines organism specificity. We have examined the correlation between charge clusters and salt insensitivity and microbial specificity in linear, cyclic, and retro-isomeric cystine-stabilized β-strand (CSβ) tachyplesin (TP) in a panel of 10 test organisms. Cyclic tachyplesins consisting of 14 and 18 amino acids are constrained by an end-to-end peptide backbone and two or three disulfide bonds to cross-brace the anti-parallel β-strand that approximates a “β-tile” structure. Circular dichroism measurements of β-tile TPs showed that they displayed ordered structures. Control peptides containing the same number of basic amino acids as TP but lacking disulfide constraints were highly salt sensitive. Cyclic TP analogues with six cationic charges were more broadly active and salt-insensitive than those with fewer cationic charges. Reducing their proximity or number of cationic charges, particularly those with three or fewer basic amino acids, led to a significant decrease in potency and salt insensitivity, but an increased selectivity to certain Gram-positive bacteria. An end-group effect of the dibasic N-terminal Lys of TP in the open-chain TP and its retroisomer was observed in certain Gram-negative bacteria under high-salt conditions, an effect that was not found in the cyclic analogs. These results suggest that a stable folded structure together with three or more basic amino acids closely packed in a charged region in CSβ peptides is important for salt insensitivity and organism specificity.

Reducing their proximity or number of cationic charges, particularly those with three or fewer basic amino acids, led to a significant decrease in potency and salt insensitivity, but an increased selectivity to certain Gram-positive bacteria. An end-group effect of the dibasic N-terminal Lys of TP in the open-chain TP and its retroisomer was observed in certain Gram-negative bacteria under high-salt conditions, an effect that was not found in the cyclic analogs. These results suggest that a stable folded structure together with three or more basic amino acids closely packed in a charged region in CSβ peptides is important for salt insensitivity and organism specificity. cystine-stabilized β-strand acetamidomethyl N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dichloromethane N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide N,N-diisopropylethylamine dimethylformamide dimethylsulfoxide N-hydroxybenzotriazole matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry MeBzl, methylbenzyl minimal inhibition concentration protegrin-1 reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography retention time rhesus theta defensin tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine trifluoroethanol tachyplesin-1 trypticase soy broth t-butyloxycarbonyl lipopolysaccharide A common feature shared among the 500 antimicrobial peptides found in nature is their tendency to form amphipathic structures that cluster basic and hydrophobic amino acids into distinctive regions (1Zasloff M.

This family is richly represented by defensins, protegrins, and tachyplesins that generally possess a cluster of three or more basic amino acids in their charged regions. These CSβ peptides exhibit various degrees of salt sensitivity.

However, the importance of basic amino acids present in a charge cluster of an amphipathic antimicrobial peptides under physiological conditions is poorly understood.

TP-1 exhibits a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and fungi with minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values in the submicromolar range under high salt conditions that may render some antimicrobial peptides inactive. Furthermore, TP-1 has also been shown to play a role in the proinflammatory response because it forms complexes with bacterial lipopolysaccharides that neutralize the factor C-activating activity of LPS in a manner similar to that of anti-LPS factor (8Nakamura T.

They are similar in structure and activity profile to protegrins (11Kokryakov V.N. Harwig S.S. Panyutich E.A. Shevchenko A.A. Aleshina G.M. Shamova O.V. Korneva H.A. Lehrer R.J.

Because of their potency and relatively small sizes, these peptides are attractive targets for structure-activity studies that may lead to therapeutics to treat infections.Cyclic CSβ antimicrobial peptides known as cyclotides have also been discovered in plants and animals (12Gustafson K.R.

These end-to-end constrained peptides include the Rhesus theta defensin (RTD-1) that has been identified from Rhesus monkey leukocytes (17Tang Y.-Q. Yuan J. Ösapay G. Ösapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). RTD-1, an 18-amino acid and salt-insensitive cyclic peptide, contains a β tile-like structure with a two β-strand framework constrained by three evenly spaced cross-bracing disulfide bonds that partition RTD-1 into a four ring-like structure (Fig. 1). Because the structures and TP-1 are relatively similar, the stable β-tile template of RTD-1 can be exploited for structure-activity study (18Tam J.P., Lu, Y.-A. Yang J.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Tam J.P., Wu, C. Yang J.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3289-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Previously, we have replaced the hydrophobic amino acids with glycine in β-tile tachyplesin analogues and found that they retain most of their antimicrobial activity and salt insensitivity (20Tam J.P., Lu, Y.-A. Yang J.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that the constraint elements of the β-tile design that provide the conformational stability are sufficient to exert activity in high salt conditions.The topology of charge cluster in tachyplesins and the CSβ antimicrobial peptides is due to their folded structure. Their electrostatic interactions with the microbial surfaces can be weakened under high salt conditions of 100 mm NaCl similar to physiological ionic conditions. In tachyplesins, most of the charged residues are clustered on one side of the β-tile structure. By maintaining a β-tile structure that provides a stable structure, we reasoned that it may be possible to correlate the number of basic amino acids in tachyplesin analogues to salt sensitivity. In cyclic peptides, there appears to be a correlation between the number of charges and salt sensitivity. Cyclic peptides having about 30 residues such as plant cyclotides that include kalata and circulin A and B as well as cyclopsychotride (12Gustafson K.R. Sowder II R.C. Henderson L.E. Parsons I.C.

Biol. 1994; 1: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are salt sensitive and are far less basic than the salt-insensitive tachyplesins, protegrins, and RTD-1 that contain six cationic charges.The charge cluster in an amphipathic peptide may also be a result of the side chain and the N-terminal amines of a dibasic amino acid. The open-chain CSβ structures in tachyplesins, protegrins, and bactenecin-1 contain an invariable basic amino acid, Lys or Arg, at their N terminus and a carboxamide at their C terminus. The end group effect in providing localized cationic charges to confer salt insensitivity can be conveniently examined by comparing TP-1 with its retroisomer that maintains similar amino acid compositions as TP-1 but contains transposed N-terminal Lys and C-terminal Gly in its sequence. Furthermore, the end-group effect of the open-chain TP-1 can be compared with cyclic TP-1, which does not have end groups.In this report, we describe the correlation of cationic charges with activity spectra and salt sensitivity using linear, cyclic, and retroisomeric tachyplesin-1 analogs. In particular, we have exploited the β-tile design to constrain 14- and 18-residue tachyplesin analogs with an up-and-down arrangement of side chains (Fig. 1). Our results show that the number, proximity, and topology of charged amino acids are important contributions to organism specificity and salt sensitivity.DISCUSSIONWe have exploited the β-tile template based on the cyclic cystine-stabilized β-strand structure of RTD-1 to study the importance of charge clusters in the full-length and truncated tachyplesin to salt sensitivity and organism specificity. The β-tile has an advantage to maintain a stable structure due to its multiple intramolecularly constraints. Our previous study has shown that the 18-residue β-tile peptides display stable β-strand structures (18Tam J.P., Lu, Y.-A. Yang J.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Tam J.P., Wu, C. Yang J.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3289-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Tam J.P., Lu, Y.-A. Yang J.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conformational stability in a folded structure appears to be an important factor contributing to salt insensitivity. These β-tile peptides with four or more cationic charges are generally broadly active and salt insensitive whereas the linear or cyclic control peptides with six cationic charges as TP-18 but without disulfide constraint are found to be considerably less active and more salt sensitive. These results are in agreement with previous structure-activity studies that focus on the role of the disulfide bonds of tachyplesins. Deletion of two disulfide bridges has caused a significant decrease in all activities (35Matsuzaki K. Nakayama M. Fukui M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Bessho K. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11704-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Matsuzaki K. Yoneyama S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Yamada K. Kirino Y. Anzai K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9799-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although Rao (37Rao A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophy. 1999; 361: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) has found that antimicrobial activity can be retained when all four cysteines are simultaneously substituted with other amino acids suggesting that disulfide-bonded β-strand structure may not be absolutely essential for antimicrobial activity, it is likely that the study by Rao is performed under low salt conditions in which linear tachyplesins retain significant antimicrobial activity as observed in our control peptides.The topological clusters of cationic charges in CSβ-stabilized antimicrobial peptides can be roughly classified into two categories, mono-cluster and bi-cluster. Tachyplesins belong to the mono-cluster with four or more of the cationic charges clustered on one side of the amphipathic surface. The mono-cluster arrangement is also found in the one-disulfide bactenecin-1 with four cationic charges clustered at one end of a CSβ structure. RTD-1 is also mono-clustered with all its cationic charges distributed fairly uniformly on the top face of the β-strands. In contrast, protegrins are bi-clustered with three cationic charges distributed on each end of the anti-parallel strands separated a hydrophobic region. Similar observation can be made for α-helical peptides that are known to be salt-insensitive. Both cercopins from silk moth and magainins from frogs contain monoclusters of cationic residues contributed by four or more basic amino acids. Taken together, they suggest the cationic charge region in a monocluster amphipathic structure of an antimicrobial peptide may require four or more basic amino acids to be broadly active and salt insensitive.The minimal number of basic amino acids in a charge cluster of the β-tile tachyplesin analogs appears to be four to afford broad organism specificity and salt insensitivity. TP-18, cTP-18, and their retroisomers containing a cluster of six basic amino acids are broadly active against four Gram-negative and three Gram-positive bacteria as well as three fungi, exhibiting MIC values in a narrow range, and generally, under 1 μm in low and high salt conditions. Truncating the 18- to 14-member ring and retaining a cluster of six basic amino acids in cTP-14a and cTP-14c does not appear to be critical in affecting their broad spectrum activity spectra, but generally lead to an increase in salt sensitivity. A possible explanation is that the ring truncation deletes hydrophobic amino acids and alters the hydrophobicity of these analogs that also contribute to salt sensitivity and organism specificity. For example, both cTP-14a and its retroisomer rcTP-14b are broadly active. Under low salt conditions, cTP-14a missing the four hydrophobic residues in the D ring of cTP-18 (Cys7,12, Tyr8, and Ile11) but retaining six cationic amino acids shows comparable antimicrobial activity (within 2-fold difference) of cTP-18 in eight of ten test organisms with E. coli and E. faecalis being exceptions. Under high salt conditions and again comparing to cTP-18, cTP-14a shows a selective decrease of 3–9-fold in potency against three of the four test Gram-negative bacteria but only one of the three Gram-positive bacteria (Table III). The activity profile of rcTP-14b, the retro analog of cTP-14a, also shows increased salt sensitivity similar to cTP-14a. Interestingly, the activity profiles of cTP-14a and cTP-14b are fairly similar to RTD-1, which is generally more active in low than in high salt conditions.The separation of basic amino acids in a cluster also contributes to organism specificity and salt sensitivity. An advantage of the β-tile design is that their proximity can be readily adjusted by shortening the ring size. The β-tile ccTP-18 differs from cTP-18 and contains a cluster of four basic amino acids and an additional constraint, a cystine replacing two Arg in cTP-18. Consequently, it is less cationic but more hydrophobic than cTP-18, and also significantly less potent than cTP-18 and TP-18. Thus, the ccTP-14 peptides designed to increase the proximity of the charge cluster and to restore the charge/hydrophobic balance as TP-18 are generally more active than ccTP-18. The antimicrobial activity ccTP-14a lacking the D ring of ccTP-18 increases 3-fold in low salt and almost 5 fold in high salt conditions. The importance of increasing the proximity of charge clusters is evident in ccTP-14c containing only three charged amino acids that are 2-to-3-fold more active than ccTP-18 in both low and high conditions. Furthermore, the decrease of cationic charges also leads organism specificity. They are generally more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacterial and fungi. The ccTP-14d containing two cationic charges increases its selectivity to Gram-positive bacteria with MICs 1–3.8 μm and is considerably less active against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi with MICs of 7–112 μm. It loses significant activity againstP. aeruginosa and is nearly inactive against C. kefyr.Another effect of increasing proximity of charge clustering is placing a dibasic amino acid as a part of a cationic cluster at the N terminus of an open-chain peptide. Dibasic amino acids such as Arg or Lys are commonly found at the N termini of many antimicrobial peptides. TP-18 has a dibasic Lys at the amino terminus and the Gly at the C terminus. Thus, TP-18 contains both α- and ε-amine at amino position not found in the retroisomer rTP-18. We show that the presence of an N-terminal Arg or N-terminal Lys in a cationic cluster may also contribute to salt insensitivity. When TP-18 and rTP-18 are compared under high salt conditions, TP-18 is found to be 6-, 4-, and 2-fold more potent than rTP-18 in three of the four tested Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. oxytoca, respectively. The end-group effect also has an adverse effect on M. luteus, one of three Gram-positive bacteria being tested. Under high-salt conditions and comparing with TP-18, the MIC values of rTP-18 decrease 10-fold from 0.1 to 1 μm. Because of the close-chain arrangement, cyclic peptides do not have the end-group problem seen in the open-chain peptides. Consequently, the end-group effect on the Gram-negative bacteria is not observed in the corresponding set of cyclic peptides cTP-18 and rTP-18. Our results are consistent with the antimicrobial effects of known retroisomers that contain open-chain peptides with helical or β-strand structures. Merrifield et al. (38Merrifield R.B. Juvvadi P.

Soc. 1996; 118: 8989-8997Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have reported that retroisomers of the α-helical cecropin-melittin hybrids are as active as the parent peptide against five test bacterial strains, only one bacterial strain is resistant to the retroisomer.Although the retroisomers of TP-18, cTP-18, or cTP-14 and their parents have the same calculated hydrophobicity values, their experimental values as determined by RP-HPLC show small variations (Table I). In each pair, the retention time of a retroisomer is found to elute 0.5–2.5 min longer than its parent peptide. These results suggest that the direction of amide backbone may also play a subtle role in their interactions with microbial surfaces of interactions.Based on the models on the mechanism of actions of antimicrobial peptides (2Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 3Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 4Yang L.

J. 2000; 79: 2002-2009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), their initial interactions with microbial membranes heavily populated by negatively charged phospholipids are believed to be electrostatic. Thus, increasing ionic strength under the high salt conditions will likely weaken the electrostatic charge interactions and the activity of the antimicrobial peptides. Our results suggest that the topology and quantity of a charge cluster may provide low affinity molecular recognition to microbial surfaces and confer organism specificity and salt insensitivity. The principle of clustering cationic and hydrophobic regions of antimicrobial peptides has inspired the design of novel antimicrobials with β- and γ-peptide backbones (40Liu D. DeGrado W.F J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7555-7559Google Scholar) as well as dendrimeric peptides with δ- and ε-peptide backbones (41Karig G. Fuchs A. Busing A. Brandstetter T. Scherer S. Bats J.W. Eschenmoser A. Quinkert G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2000; 83: 1049-1050Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies in the requirements of cationic clusters in the amphipathic design may further the understanding and lead to the development of antimicrobial peptides with high specificity and potency that are useful as therapeutic agents. A common feature shared among the 500 antimicrobial peptides found in nature is their tendency to form amphipathic structures that cluster basic and hydrophobic amino acids into distinctive regions (1Zasloff M.

https://openalex.org/W2039709265,"The Grb2 adaptor protein is best known for its role in signaling to the small GTPase p21 ras , mediated through its interaction with the SOS guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Here, we demonstrate that Grb2 also signals to Rab5, a small GTPase that plays a key role in early endocytic trafficking. Grb2 functions through association with RN-tre, a GTPase-activating protein for Rab5. Grb2 and RN-tre associate both in vitro and in vivo, with interaction mediated by both SH3 domains of Grb2 and extended proline-rich sequences in RN-tre. Association between Grb2 and RN-tre is constitutive and occurs independently of Eps8, a previously identified binding partner of RN-tre. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates recruitment of RN-tre to the EGF receptor (EGFR) in a Grb2-dependent manner. Grb2 and the EGFR are internalized and co-localized in endocytic vesicles in response to EGF. Overexpression of RN-tre blocks the internalization of both proteins, consistent with its function as a negative regulator of Rab5 and endocytosis. Strikingly, RN-tre does not block EGF-induced internalization of a Grb2 mutant deficient in RN-tre binding. These results 1) suggest that the ability of RN-tre to inhibit internalization of the EGFR requires Grb2-mediated binding to the receptor and 2) identify Grb2 as a critical regulator of Rab5 and EGFR endocytosis. The Grb2 adaptor protein is best known for its role in signaling to the small GTPase p21 ras , mediated through its interaction with the SOS guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Here, we demonstrate that Grb2 also signals to Rab5, a small GTPase that plays a key role in early endocytic trafficking. Grb2 functions through association with RN-tre, a GTPase-activating protein for Rab5. Grb2 and RN-tre associate both in vitro and in vivo, with interaction mediated by both SH3 domains of Grb2 and extended proline-rich sequences in RN-tre. Association between Grb2 and RN-tre is constitutive and occurs independently of Eps8, a previously identified binding partner of RN-tre. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates recruitment of RN-tre to the EGF receptor (EGFR) in a Grb2-dependent manner. Grb2 and the EGFR are internalized and co-localized in endocytic vesicles in response to EGF. Overexpression of RN-tre blocks the internalization of both proteins, consistent with its function as a negative regulator of Rab5 and endocytosis. Strikingly, RN-tre does not block EGF-induced internalization of a Grb2 mutant deficient in RN-tre binding. These results 1) suggest that the ability of RN-tre to inhibit internalization of the EGFR requires Grb2-mediated binding to the receptor and 2) identify Grb2 as a critical regulator of Rab5 and EGFR endocytosis. epidermal growth factor receptor wild type guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase C-terminal SH3 domain N-terminal SH3 domain The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase that controls cellular proliferation and differentiation (1Yarden Y.

Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). The EGFR is activated by a family of related ligands that includes EGF and transforming growth factor α. Binding of ligand induces receptor autophosphorylation, creating docking sites for the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules, such as Grb2, Shc, Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ (3van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, Grb2 has been extensively characterized for its role in proliferative signaling. Grb2 serves to recruit SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for p21 ras , to the plasma membrane (4Buday L. Downward J.

This leads to GTP-loading of p21 ras , followed by activation of the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase cascade, which is essential for proliferation (8Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Binding of EGF to the EGFR initiates not only mitogenic signals, but also triggers receptor endocytosis (2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). After internalization and delivery to endosomes, receptors are ultimately targeted for degradation to the lysosome, a process referred to as receptor down-regulation (9Sorkin A. Waters C.M.

In its active, GTP-bound form, it recruits cytosolic factors such as EEA1 and Rabaptin-5 to promote endosome docking and fusion (23Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M.

However, recycling of Rab5 to the GDP-bound state is essential for normal trafficking, as expression of GTPase-deficient Rab5 leads to the formation of giant early endosomes (21Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of Rab5 GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) must be coordinated for the maintenance of proper trafficking. RN-tre was recently shown to function as a GAP for Rab5 (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Originally identified as a binding partner for the EGFR substrate Eps8 (26Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar), RN-tre contains a Rab family GAP homology domain (alternatively referred to as a TrH domain) at its N terminus, and an extended proline-rich C terminus (26Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Seki N. Nagase T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2563-2571PubMed Google Scholar). A C-terminally truncated RN-tre mutant was found to be modestly transforming, causing anchorage-independent growth at a low frequency and increasing sensitivity to the proliferative effects of EGF (26Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of RN-tre in HeLa cells inhibits endocytosis of both the EGF and transferrin receptors, consistent with a requirement for Rab5 activation during receptor endocytosis (13Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). One issue that is not completely understood is how RN-tre is regulated. The Eps8 protein is required for RN-tre to be able to inhibit internalization of the EGF but not transferrin receptor, presumably by mediating interaction of RN-tre with the EGFR (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, recent studies analyzing EGFR complexes at the cell surface versusinternalized compartments indicate that regulation of RN-tre may be more complex. This study failed to detect association of Eps8 with the EGFR at the cell surface (28Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Instead, binding of Eps8 was observed only after receptor internalization. This result raised the possibility that other proteins might contribute to recruitment of RN-tre to activated receptors at the plasma membrane, perhaps functioning earlier than Eps8 in the endocytic process to regulate Rab5. Because RN-tre has an extensive proline-rich C terminus, we hypothesized that other SH3 domain-containing proteins might function as adaptors to recruit RN-tre to the EGFR. In the current study, we identify Grb2 as an in vivo binding partner for RN-tre. RN-tre is recruited to the activated EGFR by Grb2, and inhibits internalization of the receptor complex. Interestingly, RN-tre did not inhibit endocytosis of a Grb2 mutant that fails to bind RN-tre, suggesting that inhibition of receptor internalization specifically requires interaction with Grb2. These results identify a novel role for Grb2 in regulating Rab5 and specifying the trafficking fate of activated growth factor receptor complexes. COS cells, HeLa cells, and fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Eps8-expressing and null fibroblasts have been described previously and were generously provided by Drs. Pier Paolo Di Fiore and Letizia Lanzetti (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). COS cells and fibroblasts were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and HeLa cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche), according to manufacturer's instructions. Human wild-type and SH3 point mutants of Grb2 in pEBB were generously provided by Dr. Bruce J. Mayer. The Grb2 inserts were excised fron pEBB using BamHI and NotI, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pEBG to generate GST fusions. The cDNA encoding RN-tre in pEGFP-C1 was provided by Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The entire open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into a modified version of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal HA-tag; further details are available on request. RN-tre (466) was generated by digesting with PvuII, which removes from amino acid 467 to the C terminus of RN-tre; for RN-tre (720), encoding the N-terminal 720 amino acids, a STOP codon was introduced at amino acid 721. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. In the RN-tre(PXXGS) mutant, also provided by Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore, amino acids 728 and 729 are mutated to glycine and serine, respectively (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S.

[35S]methionine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. In vitro-translated products were diluted in GPLB Buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and pulled down using various GST-fusion proteins (10 μg) bound to glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After a 2-h incubation with constant mixing at 4 °C, pull-down reactions were washed five times in GPLB. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm the amounts of GST fusion protein, incubated in 1 m salicylic acid (pH 6.0), and visualized by autoradiography. GST fusion proteins encoding Grb2, Nck, p85, p85(SH3), and Src(SH3) were purified from Escherichia coli as previously described. Purified GST fusions of the isolated N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (sc-4034AC and sc-4036AC, respectively). COS cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE for 4–5 h and were then allowed to recover overnight. Cells were either harvested the following day or starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h as indicated. For examining co-precipitation of HA-RN-tre with GST-tagged Grb2 alleles or the EGFR, cells were lysed in Buffer X (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice and pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was then precipitated using glutathione Sepharose beads or anti-HA antibody as indicated and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. Beads were washed three times in Buffer Y (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors), then twice in Buffer Z (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors). Samples were eluted by boiling for 5 min in Sample Buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 7.5% glycerol, bromphenol blue). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL). For examining association of endogenous Grb2 and RN-tre, HeLa cells were lysed in Buffer X. Equal aliquots of lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz, sc-8034), anti-RN-tre (generously provided by Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore) (26Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar), or nonspecific mouse IgG. After incubation for 4 h, immunoprecipitates were washed three times in Buffer Y and three times in Buffer Z. Samples were immunoblotted with anti-RN-tre antibody. HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips at 1.7–2.0 × 105 per 35 mm dish. The following day, cells were transfected using Fugene 6. Cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium the next day for 24 h, and stimulated where indicated with EGF (Invitrogen) at 100 ng/ml for 10–15 min. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and probed with the indicated antibodies for 1–2 h. Secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chain) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were mounted with SloFade (Molecular Probes) and viewed on a Zeiss confocal microscope with LSM510 software using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm (for fluorescein isothiocyanate) or 546 nm (for Cy3). For immunofluorescence, anti-HA antibodies from Roche (Clone 12CA5) or Santa Cruz (sc-805) were utilized. Anti-GST antibody was affinity purified from rabbits immunized with bacterially expressed GST. Anti-SOS antibody (sc-259) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. Anti-EGFR antibody for immunofluorescence was from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (05–104).; anti-EGFR antibody for immunoblotting was from NeoMarkers (MS-400). The C-terminal 376 amino acids of RN-tre contains multiple potential SH3-binding sites. To test whether SH3-domain containing proteins other than Eps8 might bind to RN-tre, SH3 domains from a variety of signaling molecules were expressed as GST fusions and purified from E. coli. The recombinant proteins were incubated with in vitro-translated RN-tre, and the bound RN-tre was detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, RN-tre associated strongly with Grb2; ∼40–60% of the input RNtre was co-precipitated with Grb2. Binding was also observed with the Nck adaptor protein, although at much lower levels than Grb2. Only residual binding was observed for the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the isolated SH3 domains of p85 or c-Src. The C terminus of RN-tre is proline-rich, with 50 of the C-terminal 376 amino acids encoding proline. To delineate the region of RN-tre that mediates interaction with Grb2, two C-terminal deletion constructs were generated, RN-tre (466) and RN-tre (720). RN-tre (466), encoding the N-terminal 466 amino acids, was previously shown to be weakly transforming (26Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar). RN-tre (720), encoding the N-terminal 720 amino acids, removes the C-terminal 108 amino acids containing 15 proline residues. As shown in Fig. 1 B, progressive truncation of the C terminus led to a corresponding decrease in Grb2 binding. Nevertheless, RN-tre (466) still retained some ability to associate with Grb2. These results indicate that interaction with Grb2 is mediated not by a single proline-rich motif within RN-tre, but that multiple contacts are formed between the two proteins. Grb2 consists of two SH3 domains separated by an SH2 domain. To determine which of these domains mediates interaction with RN-tre, we tested GST fusions of the isolated SH3 domains for binding to in vitro-translated RN-tre. The C-terminal SH3 domain (SH3-C) bound to RN-tre more strongly than the N-terminal SH3 domain (SH3-N) (Fig. 2 A). However, both constructs bound significantly less RN-tre than full-length Grb2, suggesting that optimal binding requires both SH3 domains of Grb2. To confirm this, cDNAs encoding RN-tre and Grb2 mutants were expressed in COS cells. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RN-tre was co-transfected with GST-tagged wild type (WT) Grb2 or with full-length Grb2 mutants bearing point mutations in the SH3 domains, which abolish binding to proline-rich ligands (30Gupta R.W. Mayer B.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 155-165Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Grb2 proteins were purified using glutathione Sepharose beads, and associated RN-tre was detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2 B, RN-tre co-precipitated specifically with WT Grb2 but not with GST. Interestingly, RN-tre failed to co-precipitate with Grb2 if either the N-terminal, C-terminal, or both SH3 domains were mutated (mutants SH3-N−, SH3-C−, and SH3-N−C−, respectively). As a control, the predicted binding properties of these mutants were confirmed by examining their association with SOS, which has been shown to bind Grb2 predominantly through its N-terminal SH3 domain (31Raabe T. Olivier J.P. Dickson B. Liu X. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, SH3-C− bound to SOS as efficiently as WT Grb2. In contrast, both SH3-N− and SH3-−C− failed to bind SOS. These results indicate that association of RN-tre with Grb2 requires both SH3 domains of Grb2. We next examined whether endogenous RN-tre and Grb2 are associated. Extracts prepared from HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibody or isotype-matched non-immune control. As shown in Fig. 3 A, RN-tre specifically co-precipitated with Grb2, confirming that these proteins are associated in vivo in the absence of overexpression. Most SH3 domain/proline-rich peptide interactions are constitutive, occurring in a mitogen-independent manner. For example, Grb2 and SOS associate in quiescent cells, and binding is not further enhanced by mitogen (7Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). However, ligand-dependent SH3 domain interactions have also been described. For example, Grb2 association with dynamin is stimulated by EGF (32Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To characterize the association between RN-tre and Grb2, COS cells were co-transfected with RN-tre and Grb2. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF for various times. Grb2 was precipitated and the associated RN-tre was monitored by immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 3 B, RN-tre was present in anti-Grb2 precipitates in serum-starved cells, and no increase was observed upon EGF stimulation. Anti-phosphotyrosine blots confirmed appropriate stimulation of cells (data not shown). Conversely, Grb2 was constitutively present in RN-tre immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). This interaction was specific, because Nck, which bound weakly to RN-trein vitro (Fig. 1), failed to associate with RN-tre in vivo (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, Grb2 and RN-tre associate specifically in a ligand-independent manner in vivo. Because Grb2 binds to the EGFR in response to ligand, we examined whether this leads to co-recruitment of RN-tre. COS cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-RN-tre and the EGFR, either in the absence or presence of Grb2. After serum starvation, cells were stimulated with EGF for 10 min. RN-tre was immunoprecipitated, and the associated EGFR was detected by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. When co-transfected with control vector, no co-immunoprecipitation of RN-tre and the EGFR was observed, regardless of the presence of EGF (Fig. 4). However, co-expression of Grb2 dramatically induced co-precipitation of the two proteins in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Grb2 was also co-precipitated with RN-tre in a ligand-independent manner, as shown in Fig. 3. Grb2-mediated recruitment of RN-tre to the EGFR was specific, as co-expression with Nck had no effect (Fig. 4). Together, these results indicate that Grb2 can mediate recruitment of RN-tre to the EGFR in response to ligand. We next examined the subcellular localization of Grb2 and the EGFR after EGF addition. Because several different anti-Grb2 antibodies yielded poor staining of endogenous Grb2, GST-tagged Grb2 was transfected into HeLa cells, and its localization was compared with that of the endogenous EGFR by confocal microscopy. In serum-starved cells, the EGFR exhibited diffuse, uniform staining on the cell surface (Fig. 5 A), as previously described (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G.

However, after addition of EGF for 10 min, the receptor was internalized into endosomes, which appeared as discrete punctate structures (Fig. 5 B), as previously reported (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V.

Similarly, Grb2 diffusely stained the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand (Fig. 5 A), but became internalized into endosomes that co-localized with the EGFR upon addition of EGF (Fig. 5 B), as shown previously (33Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 34Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr.

These results confirm that Grb2 is recruited to and internalized with the EGFR. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of RN-tre blocks internalization of the EGFR because of its ability to serve as a GAP for Rab5 (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because RN-tre is recruited to the EGFR via Grb2 (Fig. 4), it is expected that RN-tre might also block internalization of Grb2. To test this, RN-tre and Grb2 were co-transfected into HeLa cells, and their localization was examined by confocal microscopy. As previously reported, RN-tre effectively inhibited internalization of the EGFR (Fig. 6 A). RN-tre also abrogated the internalization of WT Grb2 (Fig. 6 B). However, internalization of the Grb2 mutant SH3-C−, which fails to bind RN-tre, was not inhibited (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that Grb2-mediated recruitment of RN-tre to the EGFR prevents internalization of the receptor/Grb2 complex. Furthermore, inhibition of internalization requires direct interaction between Grb2 and RN-tre. Because Eps8 has previously been shown to bind RN-tre, we wished to determine whether it mediates interaction between Grb2 and RN-tre or whether the latter two proteins bind directly. To distinguish between these possibilities, we utilized a double point mutant of RN-tre, denoted PXXGS, which fails to bind Eps8 (14Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 29Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, A andB, PXXGS bound as well as WT RN-tre to Grb2 bothin vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that Grb2 associates with RN-tre independently of Eps8. We further wished to examine whether the ability of RN-tre to inhibit internalization of Grb2-associated EGFR was also independent of Eps8. First, we confirmed that like WT RN-tre, PXXGS was recruited to the EGFR by Grb2 (Fig. 7 C). Co-expression of PXXGS effectively inhibited EGF-induced internalization of Grb2 in HeLa cells (Fig. 8). Furthermore, both WT and PXXGS RN-tre inhibited EGF-induced internalization of Grb2 in Eps8-null fibroblasts (Fig. 9). Together, these data conclusively demonstrate that the effect of RN-tre on trafficking of Grb2-associated receptors does not involve Eps8 as an intermediate.Figure 9RN-tre inhibits Grb2 internalization in Eps8-deficient fibroblasts. Eps8-expressing (A andB) or Eps8-null (C) fibroblasts were co-transfected with Grb2 and either RN-tre WT (top panels) or PXXGS (bottom panels). A"

Although many Conus peptides that interact with voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+channels have been characterized, relatively few have been identified that interact with K+ channels. We describe a novelConus peptide that interacts with the ShakerK+ channel, κM-conotoxin RIIIK from Conus radiatus. The peptide was chemically synthesized. Although κM-conotoxin RIIIK is structurally similar to the μ-conotoxins that are sodium channel blockers, it does not affect any of the sodium channels tested, but blocks Shaker K+ channels. Studies using Shaker K+ channel mutants with single residue substitutions reveal that the peptide interacts with the pore region of the channel. Introduction of a negative charge at residue 427 (K427D) greatly increases the affinity of the toxin, whereas the substitutions at two other residues, Phe425 and Thr449, drastically reduced toxin affinity. Based on the Shaker results, a teleost homolog of theShaker K+ channel, TSha1 was identified as a κM-conotoxin RIIIK target.

A different stream of research focuses on a few model systems intensively to uncover basic mechanistic insights. For both of these contrasting facets of ion channel research, the small peptides made by predatory cone snails (conotoxins) (1Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 2Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have considerable potential. Thus, the ω-conotoxins, one family of conotoxins, have become standard reagents for discriminating among Ca2+ channel subtypes (3Olivera B.M. Miljanich G. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and characterizing the functional role of each subtype. The μ-conotoxins that block voltage-gated channels are used as probes for the outer vestibule of the channel pore. The subject of this report is a novel conotoxin that has promising properties to be an important reagent for structure/function studies of the ShakerK+ channel, arguably the most intensively studied of all voltage-gated ion channels. However, the characterization of the peptide also defines a new family of conotoxins, the κM family, that should provide a set of new ligands specific for different K+channel isoforms. The first Conus peptide shown to target a voltage-gated ion channel was μ-conotoxin GIIIA, which was discovered and characterized two decades ago (4Spence I. Gillessen D. Gregson R.P. Quinn R.J. Life Sci. 1977; 21: 1759-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Stone B.L. Gray W.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 756-767Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Sato S. Nakamura H.

Experientia (Basal). 1983; 39: 590-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of all μ-conotoxins is the arrangement of disulfide cross-links in the primary sequence, the μ-conotoxin pattern can be recognized by the following pattern of Cys residues: -CC—C—C—CC–, now defined as a class III (or M-1) conotoxin scaffold (9Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 2002; 33: 25-42Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After the discovery of the μ-conotoxins, other groups of Conus peptides with three disulfide bonds (the ω-conotoxins, δ-conotoxins, μO-conotoxins, and the spasmodic peptides) were characterized, but these had a different arrangement of Cys residues. Only one other family of conopeptides with a class III disulfide framework has been characterized, the ψ-conotoxins (10Shon K. Grilley M. Jacobsen R. Cartier G.E. Hopkins C. Gray W.R. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Rivier J. Torres J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9581-9587Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The latter are noncompetitive antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In this report, a peptide from Conus radiatus venom ducts that has the same class III scaffold as the μ- and the ψ-conotoxins is characterized. Despite its structural affinities, the C. radiatus peptide proved to have an entirely different pharmacological specificity: it affects the ShakerK+ channel and is therefore the defining member of a new family of Conus peptides, the κM-conotoxins. We also identify a putative K+ channel target in teleost fish, the presumed prey of C. radiatus. The results demonstrate that the class III framework first elucidated in the μ-conotoxins has also been exploited by the cone snails in the course of their evolution to target a diversity of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels. The peptides were synthesized on Rink amide resin using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarboxyl) chemistry and standard side chain protection except for the cysteine residues. For all the peptides, the cysteine side chains were trityl protected. Peptides were removed from the resin as described previously (11Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M.

Preparative purification of the linear peptides was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with either a 5–55 or 10–50% gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile (buffer B60). The standard one-step oxidation protocol (13Shon K. Olivera B.M. Watkins M. Jacobsen R.B. Gray W.R. Floresca C.Z. Cruz L.J. Hillyard D.R. Bring A. Terlau H. Yoshikami D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to fold the peptides. Fully oxidized peptides were purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography using either a 5–55 or 10–50% gradient of B60. The Xenopusexpression system was used for investigating the potential effects of κM-conotoxin RIIIK on voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were prepared as described previously (14Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Stühmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Frogs were anesthetized with 0.2% Tricaine1 in ice water for surgery. Following cRNA injection, the oocytes were incubated 1–5 days to allow expression of the protein. Prior to the electrophysiological measurements, the vitelline membranes of the oocytes were removed mechanically with fine forceps. cRNAs encoding various cloned Na+ and K+ channels to be tested were prepared by standard techniques. Whole cell currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage-clamp control using a Turbo-Tec amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). The intracellular electrodes were filled with 2 m KCl and had a resistance between 0.6 and 1 megaohm. Current records were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (K+ channels) or 3 kHz (Na+ channels) (−3dB) and sampled at 4 or 10 kHz, respectively. Leak and capacitive currents were corrected online by using a P/n method. The bath solution was normal frog Ringer's containing (in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 (NaOH). Lyophilized κM-conotoxin RIIIK was dissolved in normal frog Ringer's, diluted to the final concentration, and added to the bath chamber. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (19–22 °C). The IC50 values for the block of Shakerwild-type and the Shaker K427D channels were calculated from the peak currents at a test potential of 0 mV according to IC50 = fc/(1-fc) × [Tx], where fc is the fractional current and [Tx] is the toxin concentration. For the binding of κ-conotoxin PVIIA to Shaker channels, it was shown that this is an approximation to obtain the affinity of the toxin to the closed state of the channel (see below). Data are given as mean ± S.D. The kinetic parameters of the state-dependent block for the different channels investigated were obtained as described in Ref. 16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. From the ratio of the currents under control and toxin conditions a single exponential relaxation of the block is observed (see Fig. 5) that can be interpreted by a simple bimolecular reaction scheme, {U}⇄koffkm*[T]{B}SCHEME 1 where {U} represents the toxin-free channels and {B} the channels bound to a toxin molecule. From the experimental parameters τ and U it is possible to evaluateK O, k offO,k onO according to the following inverse relationships:K(O)=[T]∗U(O)1−U(O);koff(O)=U(O)τ(O);kon(O)=1−U(O)[T]∗τ(O) Closed Channel Binding—The parameters of toxin binding to the closed state were obtained by performing a similar analysis for the currents obtained from double pulse protocols (16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding κM-RIIIK were determined from a directionally cloned cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from C. radiatusvenom as described previously (17Colledge C.J. Hunsperger J.P. Imperial J.S. Hillyard D.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 51: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Total DNA from the library was isolated by standard methods (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,Third Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), and the DNA using the polymerase chain reaction in an Air Thermo-Cycler (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT); the reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 ng of total DNA, 0.5 μm oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved nucleotide sequences at the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the μ-conotoxin gene, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (25 °C), 2 mm MgCl2, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, and 0.5 units ofTaq polymerase. PCR was carried out in capillary tubes with the thermocycler set at a denaturation temperature of 94 °C for 0 s, annealing at 54 °C for 0 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 15 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced using standards methods. The predicted toxin sequences were compared with other known members of this family. The peptide encoded by one of the cDNAs, which was subsequently designated κM-RIIIK, was synthesized and characterized using electrophysiological assays (see section above). The wild-type, Δ6-46, and substitution mutant clones of the Shaker K+ channel were a generous gift of Dr. Martin Stocker. A cDNA clone from a C. radiatus venom duct library was sequenced and the predicted mature peptide sequence deduced from rules now standard for conopeptide precursors. The predicted sequence, one including the expected post-translational processing of the original ribosomally translated polypeptide, is shown in TableI. Because in all known μ-conotoxins and ψ-conotoxins (the groups with amino acid sequences most related to that of the mature κM peptide), proline residues are always found to be hydroxylated, the peptide is inferred to have a hydroxyproline residue at all loci encoded by a proline codon. The sequence N-terminal to the mature toxin contains a canonical dibasic signal for proteolytic cleavage (underlined in Table I), whereas the C-terminal amino acid sequence predicted by the clone would be expected to be post-translationally processed to an amidated C-terminal threonine residue.Table INucleic acid sequence of cDNA clone and predicted processing of peptide—GAAAAGAGACTACCATCGTGTTGCTCCCTTAACTTGCGGCTTTGC— E K R L P S C C S L N L R L CCCAGTACCAGCATGCAAACGTAACCCTTGTTGCACAGGATAA— P V P A C K R N P C C T G *——EKRLPSCCSLNLRLCPVPACKRNPCCTG(C terminus of precursor) LOSCCSLNLRLCOVOACKRNOCCT-NH21-aThe O represents 4-trans-hydroxyproline.(Predicted mature peptide)1-a The O represents 4-trans-hydroxyproline. Open table in a new tab The predicted mature peptide that was chemically synthesized is shown in the bottom of Table I. Procedures used in the chemical synthesis and folding of the peptide are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The peptide elicited obvious symptomatology upon injection into mice both intracerbrovascular and intrathecal. When 4 nmol of the synthetic peptide were injected by the intracerbrovascular route, seizures were observed. However, when the peptide was injected intraperitoneal into mice, there were no visible effects. Electrophysiological experiments using amphibian nerve-muscle preparations were similarly unaffected by 10 μm of the peptide. Because the peptide has a Class III framework similar to the μ-conotoxins (which are sodium channel ligands), the effects of the synthetic κM peptide on three cloned Na+ channel subtypes (i.e. Nav1.2 (rat brain type II), Nav1.4 (rat skeletal muscle), and Nav1.5 (mouse cardiac channel) subtypes) expressed in Xenopus oocyte were examined (see “Experimental Procedures”). At a concentration of 2 or 10 μm, the peptide did not show any detectable effect on the currents produced by these cloned sodium channel subtypes. This is shown in Fig. 1 for Nav1.4, which is a high affinity target of μ-conotoxins GIIIA and PIIIA. The peptide has been tested on nine different cloned potassium channels. No activity (with 10 μm peptide) was detected on Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv2.1, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, herg, and r-eag K+ channel clones expressed in oocytes. However, when the peptide was tested on the Shaker K+ channel, an inhibition of channel conductance was observed as shown in Fig. 2. The inhibition is readily reversible as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 A. The IC50 for the Shaker channel obtained from measuring the peak currents is 1.21 ± 0.25 μm(n = 5 dose-response experiments, see Fig. 2 B). The Hill coefficient is ∼1, suggesting that binding of a single toxin molecule is sufficient to inhibit theShaker channel. The interaction of C. radiatuspeptide with a number of mutants of the Shaker potassium channel were assessed. Many ligands that decrease the conductance of the Shaker K+ channel bind to the outer vestibule of the Shaker channel. Among the key amino acids in this general region found to affect the affinity of otherShaker K+ channel ligands are Phe425, Lys427, and Thr449. We therefore determined whether single amino acid substitutions at these loci might affect the affinity of the C. radiatus peptide for the Shaker channel. The results for three different amino acid substitutions (F425G, K427D, and T449Y) are shown in Fig. 3. The different substitutions show strikingly different effects; two of the mutant channels, F425G and T449Y (the latter affects the tetraethyl ammonium sensitivity of the Shaker channel), were found to be much more resistant to the C. radiatus peptide. In contrast, the K427D mutant exhibited about a 10-fold greater affinity for the toxin (IC50 = 109 ± 61 nm, n = 5) than was observed for the wild-type Shaker channel. A smaller increase is observed when Lys427 is substituted with a neutral amino acid leading to an IC50 of 180 ± 27 nm(n = 3) for the K427N substitution. The results in Fig. 3 reveal that substitution of any of the three residues, believed to be near the extracellular opening of the channel pore, significantly affects toxin affinity. Thus, the three AAs appear to be significant determinants for the peptide to bind to the ShakerK+ channel, with either increases or decreases in affinity observed. The data are consistent with the C. radiatus peptide blocking the conductance of the Shaker K+channel by interactions with the outer vestibule region. Presumably, toxin binding would block Shaker channel conductance by impeding transit of K+ through the extracellular opening of the pore. Because C. radiatus is believed to be a fish-hunting cone snail, the results above suggest that the presumptive physiologically relevant molecular target is a voltage-gated K+ channel in fish. We tested one teleost K+ channel available as a cDNA clone, the Sha1 channel from trout (20Nguyen T.-D. Rabe H. Terlau H. Jeserich G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 175-183Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We chose the Sha1 channel because the results withShaker showed that the K427D Shaker mutant has a higher affinity than wild-type, and in the trout sequence, the homologous position to Lys427 in Shaker has a Glu residue (see Table II).Table IIComparison of Shaker and TSha1 K + channel sequencesShown is the TSha1 amino acid sequence in the P-loop region between S5 and S6 (Nguyen et al., (20Nguyen T.-D.

Open table in a new tab Shown is the TSha1 amino acid sequence in the P-loop region between S5 and S6 (Nguyen et al., (20Nguyen T.-D. Rabe H. Terlau H. Jeserich G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 175-183Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) aligned with the correspondingShaker sequence. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The Sha1 channel, which is a noninactivating voltage-gated K+ channel, is more potently inhibited by the C. radiatus peptide than is theShaker channel. At a concentration of 1 μmκM-conotoxin RIIIK the evoked currents are almost completely inhibited. The inhibition is reversible, as well as voltage-dependent. The effects of the toxin as a function of test potential are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. These results directly establish that the toxin is able to block the conductance of a vertebrate voltage-gated K+ channel. We evaluated whether the affinity of the peptide changed as a function of the state of the Shaker channel. The open channel properties were investigated by relaxation of partial block during step depolarizations. For this work, Δ6-46 channels ofShaker lacking the N-type inactivation were used: this made it easier to evaluate unblocking of open channels. A sample of results obtained are shown in Fig. 5; the unblock follows an exponential time course and is voltage-dependent. Similar results were obtained forShaker–Δ6-46 K427D and the TSha1 (Fig. 5). Double-pulse protocols were used to characterize the reequilibration of closed channel binding (see Terlau et al., Ref. 16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The data derived from the two types of experiments were used to calculate kinetic parameters (K on, K off, and IC50) for both the open and the closed states of theShaker–Δ6-46 channel, Shaker–Δ6-46 K427D, and the TSha1 from trout (see Table III). The calculations demonstrate that binding of this toxin to openversus closed channels is very different, i.e.that the toxin interactions with the Shaker channel are state-dependent.Table IIISummary of KD, kon, and koff valuesOpen stateClosed statek (O) (0 mV)k on(O)k off(O)nK (C)k on(C)k off(C)nnmμm −1 s −1s −1nmμm −1 s −1s −1Shaker-Δ6–463330 ± 196030 ± 790 ± 3031260 ± 3604.0 ± 0.76.0 ± 3.04Shaker-Δ6–46K427D392 ± 19457 ± 2619 ± 2.53146 ± 5416.7 ± 8.62.2 ± 0.96Tsha165 ± 3188 ± 255.2 ± 1.8418 ± 1216.9 ± 6.90.25 ± 0.043Data are given as mean ± S.D.; n = number of independent experiments.

Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Data are given as mean ± S.D.; n = number of independent experiments. K D, k on, and k off values for the binding of κM-conotoxin RIIIK to the open and closed state of the different channels are calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Ref. 16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For all three channel types the affinity of the toxin for the open state measured at 0 mV is about three to four times lower compared with the closed state. The results show that the affinity of κM-conotoxin RIIIK to Tsha1 from trout is about 20 nm for the closed and 60 nm for the open state measured at 0 mV. This demonstrates that Tsha1 is a high affinity target for this peptide. The other data are in accordance with the results obtained withShaker wild type and K427D channels (with inactivation; Figs. 2 and 3) demonstrating that for fast inactivating channels the calculation of the IC50 from the peak currents is an approximation for the affinity to the closed state of those channels (see Terlau et al., Ref. 16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Table III shows that the major reason for the lower affinities of the κM-peptide to the open state of the channels is an increase in k off(O) but also thek on(O) is affected. The comparison of the kinetic parameters of the binding for the three different channel reveals that the k off(O) for open channel binding for Tsha1 is about 20 times smaller than in theShaker--Δ6-46 channel. In contrast, thek on(O) in Tsha1 is only three times higher than in the Shaker--Δ6-46 channel. The binding kinetics of κM-RIIIK to the closed state of the three channel types investigated is slower than the binding to the open state. The data shown in Table III indicate that the negatively charged residues in Shaker–Δ6-46 K427D and the TSha1 channel strongly affect k on(C), which is almost identical in these two channels, but about four times higher than in the Shaker–Δ6-46 channel. In contrast, thek off(C) differs by a factor of three between Shaker–Δ6-46 and Shaker–Δ6-46 K427D channels, but by a factor of 10 between the Shaker–Δ6-46 K427D channel and Tsha1. This indicates that a negatively charged amino acid at residue 427 is a key determinant for rapid association, whereask off(C) is primarily influenced by other residues. The peptide characterized above, although structurally related to the μ-conotoxins that block voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance, clearly inhibits the Shaker K+channel. We designate this peptide as κM-conotoxin RIIIK, the first member of a new family of conotoxins targeted to K+channels. The characterization of κM-RIIIK is noteworthy in several respects. First, the discovery that κM-RIIIK targets the Shakerpotassium channel provides a new scaffold for a Shakerchannel ligand, the smallest disulfide cross-linked framework so far characterized for any polypeptide antagonist of K+channels. Because this is the most intensively studied voltage-gated ion channel both from a molecular and functional perspective, the availability of a novel framework in a small polypeptide ligand provides a new platform for examining the topology of this and related channels. We have also established that the interaction of κM-conotoxin RIIIK with the Shaker channel is state-dependent. Thus, the peptide is a potentially useful probe for conformational changes that occur in the transition of a voltage-gated ion channel from a closed to an open state. It was unexpected that a scaffold well known for sodium channel-targeted ligands would also be used by a Conusspecies to target potassium channels. In retrospect, because these ion channels belong to the same superfamily, the observation can be rationalized ex post-facto. As will be detailed elsewhere, the μ-conotoxins and κM-conotoxin RIIIK belong to the same gene superfamily of conopeptides. The sequences of two μ-conotoxins and a ψ-conotoxin are compared with the κM-conotoxin in Table IV. The κM-conotoxin is distinctive in having a longer first loop, between the second and third cysteine residues. Structure/function studies on the μ-conotoxins have established that the arginine residue indicated by the arrow (Arg13 in μ-conotoxin GIIIA) is a critical residue for blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, because the charged guanidino group of the arginine residue is believed to functionally block the pore. In contrast, both the ψ-conotoxins and κM-conotoxin RIIIK lack this critical arginine residue. These differential biochemical characteristics provide a guide in the search for, and identification of, additional members of the κM-conotoxin family. Considerable work has been done on μ-conotoxin/sodium channel interactions. Whether the orientation of κM-conotoxin within the potassium channel is analogous to the orientation of μ-conotoxins in the outer vestibule region of sodium channels remains to be determined.Table IVComparison of κM-conotoxin RIIIK to other M-superfamily Peptides and κ-PVIIAO = 4-trans-hydroxyproline; Z = pyroglutamate, # denotes an amidated C-terminal amino acid. The arrow indicates the Arg residue known to be critical for μ-conotoxin function, which is absent in κM-RIIIK. Note that the κM-, μ-, and ψ-conotoxins all have the same pattern of Cys residues, whereas κ-PVIIA, the only other peptide that also blocks K+ channels, has an entirely different arrangement of Cys.

Note that the κM-, μ-, and ψ-conotoxins all have the same pattern of Cys residues, whereas κ-PVIIA, the only other peptide that also blocks K+ channels, has an entirely different arrangement of Cys. κM-Conotoxin RIIIK is not the only conopeptide known to inhibit theShaker K+ channel by binding to the outer vestibule. This was first demonstrated for κ-conotoxin PVIIA fromConus purpurascens (21Terlau H. Shon K. Grilley M. Stocker M. Stühmer W. Olivera B.M.

Although both C. radiatus (the source of κM-RIIIK) and C. purpurascensare probably fish-hunting, they are not closely related species as judged by available molecular phylogeny data for the genusConus (24Espiritu D.J.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13201-13208Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the different groups of Conus species use a different spectrum of conotoxin families as major ligands in their venoms. The results presented here establish that two different species of cone snails have evolved structurally and genetically unrelated peptides, both of which block the Shaker K+ channel. The two peptides have entirely different structural scaffolds; κM-RIIIK is most closely related to the μ-conotoxins, whereas κ-PVIIA has the greatest structural similarity to the ω-conotoxins, which target voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Even more conopeptides have been found that target the Shaker K+channel, 2J. Imperial, H. Terlau, and B. Olivera, unpublished data. and which are genetically and structurally unrelated to either PVIIA or κM-RIIIK. Thus, screening a broad range of Conus venoms makes it possible to identify a structurally diverse set of ligands that target a given ion channel subtype. The effect of Shaker K+ channel amino acid substitutions on the interaction with κM-conotoxin RIIIK has provided insight into the physiologically relevant channel target of the peptide. The discovery that the K427D Shaker mutant had a higher affinity for the toxin suggested that the physiological target of this peptide might have a negatively charged residue at the homologous locus. Because C. radiatus is believed to be a piscivorous Conus species, we examined the sequences of recently cloned teleost channels (20Nguyen T.-D. Rabe H. Terlau H. Jeserich G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 175-183Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) related to the Shakerpotassium channel. Because the Sha1 channel from trout had a negative residue at this position, we tested the peptide on the trout channel expressed in oocytes. The trout Sha1 channel was potently inhibited by κM-conotoxin RIIIK with an IC50 of 20 nm for the closed state. Thus, this teleost voltage-gated K+channel subtype is a better target for κM-conotoxin RIIIK thanShaker, exhibiting an almost 50-fold higher affinity. Although little is known about the true teleost prey of Conus radiatus, we postulate that the actual high affinity target of κM-conotoxin RIIIK is a voltage-gated K+ channel related to the trout Sha1 channel. However, the full spectrum of K+channels in teleost fish has not yet been elucidated. Previously, it has been suggested that positively charged toxins have an accelerated dissociation from open channels because of the voltage-dependent occupancy of a site at the outer end of the conducting pore by a K+ ion (16Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The site has been postulated to also be occupied by external cations in closed channels, thereby antagonizing the association rate. Our results with theC. radiatus peptide, which is positively charged, are generally consistent with this model and suggest that electrostatic interactions between the peptide and K+ ions in the pore are a major factor in state-dependent binding. Finally, we speculate on the endogenous biological role of κM-conotoxin RIIIK. One potential function for K+channel-targeted Conus peptides was previously proposed: that they serve as components of the “lightning-strike cabal” of toxins that cause excitotoxic shock, a physiological strategy to instantaneously immobilize prey (2Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Terlau H. Shon K. Grilley M. Stocker M. Stühmer W. Olivera B.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that κM-conotoxin RIIIK targets a K+ channel subtype in peripheral axons similar to the trout Sha1 channel, and in combination with other excitatory peptides (such as the δ-conotoxins that inhibit Na channel inactivation), causes a massive depolarization of peripheral axons near the venom injection site. This elicits trains of action potentials propagated bidirectionally, in effect, the action potentials directed centrally allow the toxins to functionally bridge the blood-brain barrier; the end point is equivalent to a tonic/clonic seizure, resulting in a very rapid tetanic paralysis of the fish prey.

Phenylalkylamines such as NPS R-568 are allosteric modulators (calcimimetics) that activate CaR by increasing the apparent affinity of the receptor for calcium. We determined, by fluorescence imaging with fura-2, whether the calcimimetic NPS R-568 could activate Ca2+ioscillations in HEK-293 cells expressing human CaR. NPS R-568 was more potent than Ca2+e at eliciting Ca2+i oscillations, particularly at low [Ca2+]e (as low as 0.1 mm). The oscillation frequencies elicited by NPS R-568 varied over a 2-fold range from peak to peak intervals of 60–70 to 30–45 s, depending upon the concentrations of both Ca2+e and NPS R-568. Finally, NPS R-568 induced sustained (>15 min after drug removal) Ca2+i oscillations, suggesting slow release of the drug from its binding site. We exploited the potency of NPS R-568 for eliciting Ca2+i oscillations for structural studies. Truncation of the CaR carboxyl terminus from 1077 to 886 amino acids had no effect on the ability of Ca2+ or NPS R-568 to induce Ca2+i oscillations, but further truncation (to 868 amino acids) eliminated both highly cooperative Ca2+-dependent activation and regular Ca2+i oscillations. Alanine scanning within the amino acid sequence from Arg873 to His879 reveals a linkage between the cooperativity for Ca2+-dependent activation and establishment and maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. The amino acid residues critical to both functions of CaR may contribute to interactions with either G proteins or between CaR monomers within the functional dimer.

A key regulator of parathyroid cell function is extracellular calcium, acting through the extracellular calcium sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium sensing receptor; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+; [Ca2+]e, extracellular Ca2+; PTH, parathyroid hormone1The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium sensing receptor; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+; [Ca2+]e, extracellular Ca2+; PTH, parathyroid hormone (1Brown E.M.

CaR belongs to family C of the G protein-coupled receptors; all members of the family have agonist binding sites in a large extracellular domain. Activation of CaR results in an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) via phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O.

Recently, we have shown that modest increases (0.5 to 1 mm increments) in extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e), induce sustained (30 to 40 min) low frequency oscillations of [Ca2+]i in HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing CaR. CaR-mediated intracellular Ca2+oscillations are crucially dependent on intracellular calcium stores (5Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parathyroid cells, CaR regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and gene expression as well as parathyroid cell proliferation (6Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bovine and human parathyroid cells have been shown to respond to small increases in extracellular calcium with oscillations of [Ca2+]i (7Miki H. Maercklein P.B. Fitzpatrick L.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Ridefelt P. Bjorklund E. Akerstrom G. Olsson M.J. Rastad J. Gylfe E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PTH secretion was significantly lower for cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+oscillations, indicating that the oscillations may be part of the signal associated with inhibition of PTH secretion (7Miki H. Maercklein P.B. Fitzpatrick L.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whether PTH gene expression and other cellular responses such as proliferation are also influenced by oscillations of [Ca2+]i remain open questions, but recent studies in several cell types suggest that intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are potent and highly specific regulators of gene expression (9Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 10Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y.

Calcium and other polycations bind to the agonist site of CaR, and are termed type I calcimimetics (12Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Family C G protein-coupled receptors are also able to bind allosteric modulators (both stimulatory and inhibitory) at sites distinct from the agonist binding site. In the presence of [Ca2+]e, CaR can be activated by small organic compounds, such as the phenylalkylamines NPS R-467 and NPS R-568, as well as by amino acids (12Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 13Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J.

These compounds are allosteric activators or type II calcimimetics, capable of activating CaR only in the presence of Ca2+.

Increases in extracellular Ca2+ activate CaR and contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of CaR-activated oscillatory Ca2+ influx pathways. It is difficult, therefore, to dissect the relative contributions of Ca2+ to the two coincident processes. In this study, we characterized the single cell responses to NPS R-568 under a range of physiological conditions and compared these responses to those elicited by extracellular Ca2+ alone. NPS R-568 was more potent than extracellular Ca2+ at inducing CaR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. NPS R-568-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations varied with the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, although oscillations were regular and sustained even at very low extracellular Ca2+ (0.1 mm). Furthermore, NPS R-568 produced a broader range of intracellular Ca2+ oscillation frequencies than variations in extracellular Ca2+ alone, increasing the range of potential contribution(s) to signaling and/or regulation of gene expression. Because NPS R-568 was found to be more potent at inducing intracellular Ca2+ oscillations than changes in extracellular Ca2+ alone, it was used to identify the critical determinants for CaR-mediated induction of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus as well as point mutations of CaR were examined. Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were regular and sustained for truncations that exhibited cooperativity with respect to activation by extracellular Ca2+ (CaRΔ886-EGFP), but were minimal for truncations that did not exhibit cooperativity (CaRΔ868-EGFP). The region between residues 868 and 886 is involved in G protein coupling (17Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and point mutations made within the unique sequence …873RCSTAAH … suggest that loss of cooperativity is linked to a severe diminution in the ability of either Ca2+ or NPS R-568 to elicit intracellular Ca2+oscillations. The mammalian expression vector containing human CaR cDNA (pCDNA3.1-CaR) was kindly provided by Dr. Klaus Seuwen (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). pEGFP was purchased from Clontech, Inc. CaR-EGFP fusion proteins (human CaR-EGFP, truncations CaRΔ886-EGFP, and CaRΔ868-EGFP) were as previously described (17Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Point mutations were produced in the CaR-EGFP background by PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing (31Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) stably transfected with human CaR (HEK-293/CaR cells) or CaRΔ868-EGFP (HEK-293/CaRΔ868-EGFP) (5Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in collagen-coated flasks in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transient transfections, 1 μg of each CaR construct, 2 μl of Novafector (Venn Nova LLC, Pompano, FL), and 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were added to HEK-293 cells, and supplemented with medium as previously described (17Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out 64–72 h after transfection. Single cell fluorescence measurements of [Ca2+]i were made as previously described (5Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions containing NPS R-568 or thapsigargin were prepared from stock solutions in Me2SO, and added to the extracellular solutions immediately prior to the experiment. NPS R-568 was synthesized as described by Nemeth et al. (12Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). All other drugs were obtained from Sigma. Me2SO controls, tested under identical experimental conditions, had no effect on the parameters measured. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). Fifteen to 20 cells were analyzed during each experiment; experiments were repeated in at least two independent transfections or cell passages (for stably transfected cells). Transient transfections of wild type CaR-EGFP were used as a control for studies of the responses of transiently expressed truncated or mutated CaRs; all other studies were performed in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with full-length human CaR. Selected regions of cells were excited at 340/380 nm and emitted light collected at 510 nm at intervals of 10 s using an imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) based on the MetaFluor software package. Background images were obtained at the beginning of each experiment from an area devoid of cells. Calibration of [Ca2+]i was done with a series of buffered calcium standards (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) assuming aK d of 145 nm (determined in vitro at 22 °C, Ref. 37Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR2002: 775Google Scholar). Average [Ca2+]i in a given condition was calculated as the average of at least 10 consecutive time points for each cell analyzed. A cell was characterized as exhibiting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations if three or more consecutive peaks could be clearly differentiated, and the amplitude of the peaks was ≥20 nm[Ca2+]i. Data were fitted to the Hill equation by least squares minimization using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (NFIT, Island Products, Galveston, TX). All statistical analyses were done with SPSS 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and SigmaPlot 2000 for Windows version 6.0 (SPSS Inc.). The majority of the data did not meet the criteria for parametric tests (i.e. normal distribution), therefore nonparametric tests were used (Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon tests, Spearman rank correlation). To compare the fractions of cells having intracellular Ca2+ oscillations under distinct conditions, Chi-square tests were applied (or Fisher's exact tests for group frequencies of less than 5 cells). A p value <0.05 was considered significant. To investigate whether NPS R-568 altered intracellular Ca2+ oscillations induced by small increments of [Ca2+]e, HEK-293/CaR cells were loaded with fura-2-AM in 2 mm [Ca2+]e for 30 min. Experiments were begun at 0.5 mm[Ca2+]e, and small incremental changes of [Ca2+]e were applied in the absence (Fig.1 A) or presence (Fig.1 B) of 1 μm NPS R-568. In both the absence and presence of NPS R-568, small increments in [Ca2+]e induced oscillations of intracellular Ca2+, although the threshold level of [Ca2+]e was altered by NPS R-568. No intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were observed in 1 mm Ca2+e under control conditions, but oscillations were evident even at 0.5 mmCa2+e in the presence of 1 μm NPS R-568. To permit quantitative comparisons, the recruitment of cells having intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (% oscillating cells) was determined at various [Ca2+]e under control conditions (zero NPS R-568) and at 1 or 10 μm NPS R-568 (Fig. 1 C). Maximal recruitment of cells to the Ca2+i oscillating state under control conditions was seen at 3 mm Ca2+e, whereas in the presence of 1 μm NPS R-568, maximal recruitment occurred at 1 mm Ca2+e. 10 μm NPS R-568 caused a further left shift in the [Ca2+]edependence for induction of intracellular Ca2+oscillations, with maximal recruitment at 0.5 mmCa2+e and 40% of cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations even at 0.1 mmCa2+e (the lowest [Ca2+]etested). Whereas the concentration range for Ca2+e-elicited intracellular Ca2+oscillations is narrow (0.1–5 mm, depending upon the absence/presence of NPS R-568), application of NPS R-568 (1 or 10 μm) over a broader range of extracellular [Ca2+] resulted in a left-shifted dose response for Ca2+e, without a change in the maximal response, as has been described by others (12Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Addition of NPS R-568 decreased the EC50 for calcium from 3.64 to 1.69 mm (1 μm NPS R-568) and 0.65 mm (10 μm NPS R-568), respectively (Fig. 1 D). To examine the effects of NPS R-568 in more detail, experiments were performed at constant [Ca2+]e. HEK-293/CaR cells were loaded with fura-2-AM in either 1 or 3 mmCa2+e, and then exposed to various concentrations of NPS R-568 (0.01–10 μm). At the end of each experiment, cells were exposed to 20 mmCa2+e to maximally activate CaR. Representative experiments at 10 μm NPS R-568 are illustrated at 1 and 3 mm Ca2+e (Fig.2, A and B, respectively). In 1 mm Ca2+e, NPS R-568 generated intracellular Ca2+ oscillations; the percentage of oscillating cells increased in a dose-dependent manner over the range from 0.1 to 10 μm NPS R-568 (p < 0.005, Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained in 3 mm Ca2+e for submaximal (0.01–1 μm) concentrations of NPS R-568 (p = 0.05). In 3 mmCa2+e, the highest concentration of NPS R-568 tested (10 μm) significantly reduced the number of oscillating cells (90.1% at 1 μm versus65.0% at 10 μm, p < 0.001, Fig.2 C). The threshold for induction of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations by NPS R-568 in HEK-293/CaR cells varied with [Ca2+]e, being significantly left-shifted at 3 versus 1 mm Ca2+e; a 2 mm change in extracellular Ca2+ caused a 10-fold shift in the affinity of CaR for NPS R-568. The oscillation frequencies of cells exposed to varying NPS R-568 concentrations were analyzed, and plotted as peak-to-peak intervals (Fig. 2 D). At 1 mm Ca2+e, peak-to-peak intervals were significantly shorter at 10 μm NPS R-568 (42.2 ± 14.2 s) when compared with submaximal concentrations (which were not significantly different): 1 μm (65.7 ± 16.8 s) (p < 0.001) or 0.1 μm (69.1 ± 26.1 s) (p < 0.005). At 3 mmCa2+e, there was a significant dose-dependent decrease in peak-to-peak intervals over the entire range of NPS R-568 concentrations tested, from 65.6 ± 33.8 (0.1 μm) to 29.7 ± 6.8 s (10 μm) (p < 0.001). At concentrations of NPS R-568 above 0.1 μm, the peak-to-peak intervals induced by NPS R-568 were dependent on [Ca2+]e, with shorter peak-to-peak intervals at higher [Ca2+]e (Fig. 2 D). Examination of Fig. 2, A and B, suggests the possibility that [Ca2+]e may influence the duration of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations induced by exposure to NPS R-568 ([Ca2+]i oscillations halted after 650 s in 3 mm Ca2+e, but continued for >900 s in 1 mmCa2+e). To test this possibility systematically, cells were exposed to 10 μm NPS R-568 for 12 min, and the number of cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations after 1 and 10 min of drug exposure were determined. At 1 mm Ca2+e, the number of cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations declined by 30.9% after 10 min exposure to NPS R-568 compared with an 84.2% decline at 3 mm Ca2+e(p < 0.001). Thus, both [Ca2+]eand [NPS R-568] crucially influence the induction and the persistence of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in HEK-293/CaR cells. Prolonged exposure to NPS R-568 results in a cessation of oscillations, which is dependent upon [Ca2+]e (Fig. 2, A andB). CaR-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are obligatorily linked to the content and integrity of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (5Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of NPS R-568-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores were therefore determined. After loading HEK-293/CaR cells with fura-2-AM for 30 min at 1 or 3 mm Ca2+e, respectively, the experiments were begun in the same [Ca2+]e, followed by addition of 1 μm NPS R-568 for periods of ∼10–15 min. After a brief exposure to nominally 0 mmCa2+e, 1 μm thapsigargin was applied, and the complete time course of the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ transient was monitored (Fig.3, A and B). In control experiments, HEK-293/CaR cells were exposed to 1 or 3 mm Ca2+ solutions for 12–15 min before switching to 0 mm Ca2+e and thapsigargin (data not shown). As characterized in Fig. 2 D, the oscillation frequencies of the cells were significantly different depending on whether NPS R-568 was added in the presence of 1 or 3 mm Ca2+e. At 1 mmCa2+e, the cells had peak-to-peak intervals of 64.1 ± 19.7 s, whereas at 3 mmCa2+e, they were significantly shorter, 38.2 ± 11.6 s (p < 0.001). When [Ca2+]e was reduced to 0 mm shortly before applying thapsigargin, Ca2+i dropped significantly for experiments at 3 mm[Ca2+]e (p < 0.001), but not when [Ca2+]e was reduced from 1 to 0 mm (p = 0.7). A similar tendency was observed for control experiments without addition of NPS R-568 (3 to 0 mm, p = 0.06). The content of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores was estimated as the area under the averaged thapsigargin-elicited Ca2+ transients for experiments such as those illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B. When HEK-293/CaR cells were treated with 1 μm NPS R-568, the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores were significantly less at 3 mmCa2+e than at 1 mmCa2+e (p < 0.05, see Fig.3 C). Control experiments in the absence of NPS R-568 indicated a similar trend, i.e. decreased content of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores at 3 mmCa2+e (p = 0.09). However, there was no statistically significant difference in thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores in the absence/presence of NPS R-568 at either 1 or 3 mm Ca2+e. The joint effects of NPS R-568 plus 3 mm Ca2+e yield higher frequency Ca2+ oscillations and a significant decrease in thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. This may, in part, account for the more rapid time-dependent decline in the number of cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations after prolonged exposure to NPS R-568. HEK-293/CaR cells (loaded with fura-2AM at 1 mm Ca2+e) exhibited intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in a significantly higher percentage of cells when initially exposed to NPS R-568 than an initial increment of Ca2+e (p < 0.001, Fig. 4, A andB). Likewise, when two different agonists (Ca2+ or NPS R-568) were applied sequentially to HEK-293/CaR cells, the percentages of cells with intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in response to an increment of Ca2+e were significantly higher when cells had first been exposed to NPS R-568 (NPS R-568 then Ca2+, 70%versus Ca2+ then NPS R-568, 5%,p < 0.001). Under all experimental conditions, the percentages of cells exhibiting intracellular Ca2+oscillations were higher in response to NPS R-568 than Ca2+e (Fig. 4 C). In control experiments, cells were loaded with Fura-2AM in 1 mmCa2+e, and an increment in [Ca2+]e or exposure to NPS R-568 was repeated twice; no potentiation was observed in either case (Fig.4 C). The results of experiments such as that illustrated in Fig.4 B point to a “sensitizing” effect of NPS R-568, which may be because of persistent binding of the drug to CaR, even after removal from the extracellular solution and/or to the presence of a reservoir of the hydrophobic drug within the membranes. Indeed, intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were observed for more than 10 min after removal of NPS R-568 from the extracellular solution (Fig.4, D and E), whereas the effects of elevated [Ca2+]e on intracellular Ca2+oscillations were rapidly reversible, with oscillations ceasing within 1 to 2 min after reduction in [Ca2+]e (data not shown, but see Ref. 5Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4, D and E, illustrates representative experiments in which cells were exposed to 0.1 or 1 μmNPS R-568, respectively. The averaged delay from NPS R-568 application to onset of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations was dependent upon [NPS R-568]: 307 ± 46 s at 0.1 μm (5 experiments; 31 cells) and 220 ± 56 s at 1 μm(5 experiments; 74 cells). Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were sustained for prolonged periods after removal of NPS R-568 from the extracellular solution; persistence was both time- and [NPS R-568]-dependent (Fig. 4 F). For both concentrations of NPS R-568 tested, a significant percentage of cells exhibited intracellular Ca2+ oscillations for up to 15 min after removal of the drug from the bath. There was no significant reduction in numbers of oscillating cells for 5 min following removal of 1 μm NPS R-568, whereas removal of 0.1 μm NPS R-568 resulted in a biphasic decline, beginning immediately following drug removal (Fig. 4 F). To determine which domain(s) of CaR contribute to establishment and/or maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, the responses of CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations were investigated. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-tagged CaR truncated at the carboxyl terminus at residues 886 or 868 (CaRΔ886-EGFP, CaRΔ868-EGFP). The dose-response relationship obtained for Ca2+-dependent activation of CaRΔ886-EGFP was not significantly different from that obtained for full-length CaR-EGFP (Fig.5 A), and cells transiently transfected with CaRΔ886-EGFP exhibited intracellular Ca2+ oscillations when exposed to increasing [Ca2+]e or NPS R-568 (Fig. 5 B). However, similar experiments performed with the truncation CaRΔ868-EGFP exhibited a right-shifted dose-response relationship with respect to activation by Ca2+e and a diminution of cooperativity, in both transiently and stably transfected cells (Fig. 5 A), as we have previously shown (17Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increments of [Ca2+]e or addition of high concentrations of NPS R-568 did not generate regular intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in cells expressing CaRΔ868-EGFP (Fig.5 C), although some cells exhibited irregular fluctuations in intracellular Ca2+ in response to both [Ca2+]e increments and NPS R-568 (Fig.5 D). Both CaRΔ868 (coexpressed with soluble EGFP) and CaRΔ868-EGFP have previously been shown to exhibit comparable responses to [Ca2+]e (17Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); therefore, it can be assumed that the failure to induce regular intracellular Ca2+ oscillations with increments of [Ca2+]e or NPS R-568 is a result of the loss of critical residues between amino acids 868 and 886 of human CaR. The amino acid residues between 868 and 886 of the CaR carboxyl terminus are critical to both the cooperativity of CaR-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+and, as illustrated in Fig. 5, for induction of sustained intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. This stretch of amino acids is unique to CaR, and has been subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis by several groups (32Ray K. Fan G.-F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Bourguignon L. Shoback D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), but spectral analysis of Tom40 purified directly from mitochondria revealed less β-sheet and more α-helix than predicted (22Ahting U. Thieffry M. Engelhardt H. Hegerl R. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The integration and assembly of Tom40 itself into the mitochondrial outer membrane requires the TOM complex and is only accomplished efficiently if the protein exists in a partially folded state (29Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Assembly of Tom40 into the TOM complex is thought to occur via translocation intermediates (29Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct.

In the first step of translocation, the Tom40 precursor binds at the outer surface of the TOM complex as a monomer. This monomer is imported through the outer membrane and assembled on the intermembrane space side of the membrane into an intermediate of 250 kDa that also contains pre-existing molecules of Tom40 and Tom5. There are two views for the mechanism by which Tom40 integrates into the outer membrane. In one model, integration occurs when the precursor that is associated with other components in the 250-kDa intermediate progresses to a 100-kDa intermediate that most likely contains Tom40 as a dimer of the newly imported subunit and a pre-existing molecule. This intermediate undergoes further assembly and becomes associated with other Tom proteins to give the fully assembled TOM complex (30Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In a second model, Tom40 was thought to insert into the membrane directly from the 250-kDa form into the 400-kDa fully assembled complex (29Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A conserved set of amino acid residues near the N terminus of Tom40 is required for assembly and stability of Tom40 within the TOM complex, but is not involved in targeting of newly synthesized Tom40 to mitochondria (32Rapaport D. Taylor R. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To date, there has been only one report of cells lacking Tom40.S. cerevisiae cells depleted of the protein (then named Isp42p) were shown to accumulate mitochondrial precursors in the cytosol and ascospores lacking a functional copy of the gene were inviable (16Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To examine and more fully characterize the effects of Tom40 depletion in another organism, we have generated a null allele of the gene in N. crassa that is maintained in a sheltered heterokaryon. We have also further investigated the assembly pathway of Tom40 into the TOM complex. Growth and handling ofN. crassa strains was carried out as described previously (28Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Strains used in this study are listed below in Table I. Race tubes were constructed as described previously (33White B.

RIP results in the generation of GC to AT transitions in both copies of the duplication (34Selker E.U. Ann. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Because Tom40 was predicted to be an essential protein in N. crassa, the procedure of sheltered RIP was used to mutate the tom40 gene. Sheltered RIP insures that nuclei containing non-functioning alleles are present in a heterokaryon that also contains nuclei with a wild type copy of the gene. The rationale and strains utilized for sheltered RIP are described in detail elsewhere (35Metzenberg R.L. Grotelueschen J.S. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1992; 39: 37-49Google Scholar, 36Harkness T.A.A. Metzenberg R.L. Schneider H. Lill R. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, molecular restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping studies (37Metzenberg R. Stevens J. Selker E. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Neurospora Newsl. 1984; 31: 35-39Google Scholar, 38Metzenberg R. Stevens J. Selker E. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using atom40-containing cosmid as a probe revealed that thetom40 gene was located on linkage group V of N. crassa. To create a duplication of tom40, spheroplasts of the HostV strain for sheltered RIP were transformed with a plasmid (pRIP-4) carrying hygromycin resistance (39Staben C. Jensen B. Singer M. Pollock J. Schechtman M. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1989; 36: 79-81Google Scholar) and 1.8 kb of PCR-generated tom40 genomic sequence. Transformants were selected on hygromycin, and strains containing duplications were identified by Southern analysis. One strain, 40Dupl, was crossed to the MateV strain. Any ascospores from this cross that were capable of growth on minimal medium were determined to be heterokaryons. One nucleus of the heterokaryon was wild type with respect to Tom40 function, whereas the other could contain either RIPed or wild type tom40 alleles. The desired heterokaryotic strain is shown in Fig. 1. Several ascospore isolates from the sheltered RIP cross were screened for the predicted characteristics oftom40 RIP -sheltered heterokaryons. When heterokaryons with the genotype shown in Fig. 1 were grown in media containing lysine, leucine, and cycloheximide (concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 μg/ml) the RIPed nucleus was forced to predominate the heterokaryon to provide resistance to the antibiotic. As a result, the growth rate was severely reduced, because Tom40 could not be supplied by the nucleus providing cycloheximide resistance. One strain (RIP40het), which grew slowly under these conditions, was analyzed further. Southern analysis (not shown) indicated that, in addition to the gene at the endogenous tom40 locus, the ectopically integrated RIP substrate was also present in the strain. Using specific primers, both RIPed versions of the gene were amplified by PCR. The gene at the endogenous locus was cloned and sequenced entirely. A total of 92 RIP mutations, including a RIP generated stop codon at residue 35, were identified. About 270 base pairs of the ectopictom40 sequence were determined directly from specific PCR products, and 9 RIP mutations were observed, including one that created a stop codon at residue 30. For both RIPed alleles, the stop codons occurred prior to the first predicted membrane-spanning domain (26Court D.A. Lill R. Neupert W. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73: S193-S197Crossref Google Scholar, 27Mannella C.A. Neuwald A.F. Lawrence C.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the protein, and we consider these to be effectively null alleles. We have briefly described the use of this strain for developing mutants expressing exclusively variants of Tom40 in a previous report (32Rapaport D. Taylor R. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DNA was transformed intoN. crassa using spheroplasts as described previously (40Schweizer M. Case M.E.

Biol. 1985; 5: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or by electroporation of conidia using modifications of a previously described technique (42Margolin B.S. Freitag M. Selker E.U. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1997; 44: 34-36Google Scholar, 43Margolin B.S. Freitag M. Selker E.U. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 2000; 47: 112Google Scholar). For electroporation, conidia (1 week old) were harvested, washed three times with 1 msorbitol, and resuspended in 1 m sorbitol at a concentration of 2 to 2.5 × 109 conidia/ml. Linearized plasmid DNA (5 μg in a final volume of 5 μl) was mixed with 40 μl of conidia, placed in a pre-chilled electroporation cuvette, and incubated for 5 min on ice. A Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used with settings of 2.1 kV, 475 Ω, 25 microfarads. Immediately after the pulse (time constant, 11–12 ms), 1 ml of ice-cold 1 m sorbitol was added and the conidia were allowed to recover for 1 h at 30 °C. Aliquots (10–100 μl) of the mixture were added to top agar containing appropriate antibiotics for selection of transformants, and the mixture was poured onto plates containing the same medium. The method for development of strains expressing only mutant versions of Tom40 was described previously (32Rapaport D. Taylor R. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutant alleles oftom40 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA derived from a Bluescript plasmid derivative containing a genomic version of N. crassa tom40 and a bleomycin resistance gene (44Austin B. Hall R.M. Tyler B.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Plasmids confirmed to carry the desired mutations were transformed into thetom40 RIP -sheltered heterokaryon (RIP40het). Plasmids used to develop strains expressing altered Tom40s in this study contained deletions in the region between residues 50 and 60 of theN. crassa Tom40 protein. Plasmids pRD, pRDTLL, and p297 lack the residues, RD, RDTLL, or all of residues 51–60, respectively. Another plasmid, p16.6, encoded a Tom40 variant where residues KLG at position 321–323 were changed to alanine residues. Transformants were selected on media containing cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), lysine, and leucine (to select for transformants of the nucleus carrying thetom40 RIP alleles), as well as bleomycin (1.5 μg/ml) and caffeine (0.5 mg/ml, to enhance the action of bleomycin), purified through one round of single-colony isolation on the same selective medium and tested for nutritional requirements. Plasmids giving rise to homokaryons requiring lysine and leucine contain mutant alleles capable of restoring Tom40 function to a level sufficient for viability. The presence of mutant alleles in the transformants was confirmed by sequencing tom40-specific PCR products generated from genomic DNA. Atom40 cDNA was cloned into plasmid pGEM7Zf(+). Mutant alleles were created by site-directed mutagenesis and used for in vitro transcription and translation to produce mutant Tom40 precursor proteins for import into isolated mitochondria. For in vitro import studies, the isolation of mitochondria (45Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), import of Tom40 precursors (32Rapaport D. Taylor R. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and import of other mitochondrial precursor proteins (46Harkness T.A.A. Nargang F.E. Van der Klei I. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were as described. Import was analyzed by SDS-PAGE or blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE) and gels were viewed by autoradiography. For some experiments, carbonate extraction was performed to determine if imported precursor proteins were inserted into membranes. Mitochondria were suspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) for 30 min at 0 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min at 2 °C, and the pellets were processed for BNGE. Mitochondria (50–100 μg) were solubilized in 50 μl of buffer containing detergent (either 1% digitonin or 1% dodecyl maltoside in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 0.1 mm EDTA; 50 mm NaCl; 1% glycerol; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After gentle mixing at 4 °C for 15 min and a clarifying spin (30 min, 14,000 ×g), 5 μl of sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 100 mm Bis-Tris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) was added, and the mixture was analyzed on a 6–13% gradient blue native gel (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 48Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). One milliliter of cell suspension from liquid cultures was fixed in 1.5% KMnO4 for 30 min at room temperature followed by several washes with distilled water. The sample was then suspended in 0.05 m sodium cacodylate buffer containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 15% sucrose. The cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation at room temperature in a clinical centrifuge and were resuspended in the same buffer. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were post-fixed in 1% (w/v) OsO4 and 1.5% (w/v) K2Cr2O7 for 90 min on ice. Samples were then post-stained in 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate overnight at room temperature. The steps of dehydration, embedding, and sectioning were performed by the Microscopy Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta. Sections were examined in a transmission electron microscope. The standard techniques of agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern and Northern blotting of agarose gels, preparation of radioactive probes, transformation of Escherichia coli, isolation of bacterial plasmid DNA, and the PCR using a mixture of Taq and Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) to minimize replication errors, were all performed as described (49Ausubel R.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). The following procedures were employed using the supplier's recommendations or previously described procedures: isolation of total RNA with the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA), separation of mitochondrial proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar), Western blotting (51Good A.G.

In this study we evaluated the expression of betaglycan during the C2C12 skeletal muscle differentiation. Betaglycan expression, as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene promoter was cloned, and its sequence showed putative binding sites for SP1, Smad3, Smad4, muscle regulatory factor elements such as MyoD and MEF2, and retinoic acid receptor. Transcriptional activity of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in differentiating C2C12 cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin, stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-β. On the other hand, basic fibroblast growth factor, BMP-2, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect. In myotubes, up-regulated betaglycan was also detectable by TGF-β affinity labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The latter indicated that betaglycan was localized both on the cell surface and in the ECM. Forced expression of betaglycan in C2C12 myoblasts increases their responsiveness to TGF-β2, suggesting that it performs a TGF-β presentation function in this cell lineage. These results indicate that betaglycan expression is up-regulated during myogenesis and that MyoD and RA modulate its expression by a mechanism that is independent of myogenin.

During development these cells are maintained in a proliferative and undifferentiated state until appropriate signals cause them to undergo conversion into multinucleated myotubes. A network of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs),1 some of which have been identified and characterized, governs this process. When myogenesis begins, myogenic regulatory genes encoding factors of the MyoD family are activated (myogenin, MRF4, and MRF5). These factors bind to specific DNA consensus sites called E boxes, which function as transcriptional enhancers of muscle differentiation genes (for review see Ref. 1Ji C. Chen Y. McCarthy T.L.

Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of these master regulatory genes are regulated by polypeptide growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) (3Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

The onset and progression of the differentiation process are controlled by a complex set of interactions between myoblasts and their environment. The presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for normal myogenesis (8Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 9Fuentealba L. Carey D.J.

It has been demonstrated that the activities of FGF-2, HGF, and TGF-β can be regulated by binding to proteoglycans (2Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y.

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in particular, have been suggested to play a role in modulating the activities of heparin-binding growth factors (7Bernfield, M., Hinkes, M.

They modulate terminal myogenesis probably by acting as low affinity receptors for some growth factors such as FGF-2 (5Larrain J. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1983; 209: 317-324Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have shown that constitutive expression of syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan whose expression is down-regulated during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation, inhibits the differentiation of myoblasts in culture (5Larrain J.

In contrast, abolishment of the expression of syndecan-3, another heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by myoblasts, results in acceleration of skeletal muscle differentiation by a mechanism being dependent on FGF-2 (9Fuentealba L.

Cell interaction with TGF-β is mediated by a complex group of proteins that includes the type I and II TGF-β receptors, which have signal transducing activity, and the membrane-bound proteoglycan betaglycan (16Cheifetz S.

Betaglycan, a heparan/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan also known as type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII), is present on the cell surface of several cell types (19Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J.

DeFalcis D. Noda M. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5927-5930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although betaglycan is not directly involved in the intracellular TGF-β signaling, it controls its access to the TβRII receptor, thereby modulating its actions (6Esparza-Lopez J. Montiel J.L.

In this study we show that expression of betaglycan is up-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation of C2C12myoblasts, increasing its levels on the cell surface of the myotubes and in the ECM. Our data also indicate that the proximal region of the betaglycan gene promoter controls this process in a manner that is dependent of MyoD expression. Although it is not clear at this moment what is the function of betaglycan during the skeletal muscle differentiation process, the fact that its ectopic forced expression in myoblasts enhances their responsiveness to TGF-β2 suggests a potential regulatory role. The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (23Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) was grown and induced to differentiate as described (15Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 days after plating (80% confluence), the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum to trigger myoblast differentiation. Two days later 0.1 mmcytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium. Thereafter the incubation medium was changed daily. Rat1 and L6E9 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% or 20% fetal bovine serum, respectively, as described (19Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures at the indicated times using Trizol (Invitrogen). The RNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membranes, hybridized with probes for mouse betaglycan (24Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Esparza-Lopez J. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Mendoza V. Lopez-Casillas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. The DNA vectors and hosts employed were generous gifts of Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University Oncology Center), and the method employed has been described by He et al. (25He T.-C. Zhou S., Da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3264) Google Scholar). Briefly, to generate the appropriate transfer vector, a DNA fragment containing the 186 upstream bp of the 5′-untranslated region, the complete open reading frame, and the first 513 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of the wild type rat betaglycan cDNA (19Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was subcloned at the NotI-HindIII sites of pAdenoTrack. The created transfer vector was recombined with pAdenoEasy-1, and the recombinant adenoviral genome was transfected in 293 cells to recover the recombinant viral particle (Adv-BG). Enrichment and purification of an Adv-BG viral stock was carried out according to standard methods. A bacterial artificial chromosome mouse genomic library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was screened with the 190 nucleotides (bases 15–205) at the 5′ end of the reported mouse betaglycan cDNA (24Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Esparza-Lopez J. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Mendoza V. Lopez-Casillas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and eight positive clones were analyzed by restriction mapping. A 6.5-kilobase pairHindIII fragment that hybridized to bases 88–105 of the cDNA was recovered from bacterial artificial chromosome clone B70. A smaller HindIII-BamHI fragment containing the 2542 bp located at the 5′ end was further isolated and fully sequenced at Instituto de Fisiologia Celular Molecular Biology Core Facility (deposited in the GenBankTM with accession numberAF537325). For the construction of betaglycan reporter plasmid, pBG-Lux, the 2307-bp HindIII-NotI Klenow-filled-in fragment was subcloned in the SmaI of pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), and the proper orientation was verified by sequencing (see Fig. 2 for more details). The pMyo-Luc reporter construction was reported previously (14Riquelme C. Larraı́n J. Schönherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); pRLSV40 was fromPromega; and pEMSV, pEMSV-MyoD, and pEMSV-myogenin were gifts from Dr. Stephen F. Konieczny (Purdue University). The cells were plated at a density of 8,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates for 48 h and transfected for 5 h using with 4 μg of pBG-Lux or 4 μg of pMyoLuc and 0.01 μg of pRLSV40 in each well mixed in Opti-MEM I with 4 μl of PLUS reagent and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Promega). Following transfection, fetal bovine serum and chicken embryo extract were added to restore their complete growth medium concentrations, and the cells were cultured for a further 14 h. The cells were then trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates in normal growth medium. Under these conditions, FGF-2 (3 ng/ml) (Invitrogen), BMP-2 (1 nm) (generous gift from Genetic Institute, Cambridge, MA), HGF (3 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), TGF-β (1 ng/ml) (R & D Systems), and RA (1 μm) (Sigma) were added at the indicated concentrations. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for dual luciferase activity (Promega). All of the transfections were performed at least three times. For immunoblot analysis aliquots were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis in 4–12% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), probed with a rabbit antiserum raised against rat betaglycan ectodomain (1:2000) (22Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-myogenin (1:500), or rabbit anti-MyoD (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For betaglycan core protein analysis, the samples were previously treated with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) (9Fuentealba L. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37876-37884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,26Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larrain J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β was radiolabeled with 125I using the chloramine T, and affinity labeling and immunoprecipitations were done as described before (22Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Cells to be analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy were grown on glass coverslips, as described previously (27Larrain J. Alvarez J. Hassell J.R. Brandan E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For cell surface staining the live unfixed cells were incubated in the first antibody solution 1:200 anti-betaglycan, 1:1000 anti-perlecan (27Larrain J. Alvarez J. Hassell J.R. Brandan E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h on ice. After removal of this solution, the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated with 1:100 monoclonal anti-myosin antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). The bound antibodies were detected by incubating the cells with 1:100 affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and 1:100 TRITC anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), respectively. After rinsing, the slides were viewed with a Nikon upright microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Creatine kinase activity was determined as previously described (9Fuentealba L. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37876-37884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA (28Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4555) Google Scholar) and protein (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) were determined in aliquots of cell extracts as described. To evaluate the expression of betaglycan during myoblast differentiation, the levels of its mRNA were determined in total RNA isolated from myoblasts and myotubes induced to differentiate for 2, 4, and 6 days. As shown in Fig. 1 A, betaglycan mRNA was detected after 2 days of induced differentiation with an increase by day 4 and small decrease by day 6. At the same time, the level of cellular betaglycan during skeletal muscle differentiation was determined by Western blot analysis of detergent extracts treated previously with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC, a procedure that reveals the total content of betaglycan as its core protein. Fig. 1 B shows that cells allowed to differentiate for 4 days increased betaglycan expression significantly compared with the amount synthesized by myoblasts. Betaglycan has the ability to bind the three isoforms of TGF-β through its core protein. To evaluate this property of the betaglycan induced during muscle differentiation, affinity labeling experiments using 125I-labeled TGF-β2 were performed. Fig. 1 C shows that the up-regulated betaglycan, displaying its characteristic pattern of migration in this kind of experiments, bound TGF-β2 and that this binding increased during differentiation when the total extracts were analyzed. The specificity of this result was confirmed when immunoprecipitates from the total cell extract were analyzed using a specific anti-betaglycan antibody (Fig. 1 D). Fig. 1 E shows the densitometric analysis for the quantitative analyses of the data. As a test of concomitant differentiation, the level of creatine kinase activity, a specific skeletal muscle marker, was evaluated (Fig. 1 F). Together, these results demonstrate that the synthesis of betaglycan increased during skeletal muscle differentiation. To characterize the mechanism underlying the control of up-regulation of betaglycan mRNA, the murine betaglycan gene promoter was cloned. For that purpose, a bacterial artificial chromosome library was screened with the most 5′ end sequences of the murine betaglycan cDNA, and theHindIII-BamHI 2542-nucleotide-long fragment (Fig. 2 A) containing the most upstream cDNA region was isolated and sequenced (Fig. 2 B). This genomic DNA fragment had 86% sequence identity with the corresponding region of its rat ortholog (1Ji C. Chen Y. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30487-30494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, it contained a stretch of 127 nucleotides (2265–2391) that corresponded to bases 20–141 of the published murine betaglycan cDNA and that was followed by a GT, presumably the splicing donor site of the first intron. Other relevant functional cis-regulatory elements, SP1 and GC boxes, including the putative BMP-2-responsive element, that have been experimentally determined in the rat gene by the Centrella and co-workers (1Ji C. Chen Y. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30487-30494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were also conserved in the mouse promoter. These similarities strongly suggest that the cloned sequences contain the promoter and first exon of the mouse betaglycan gene. Importantly, the mouse sequences contained several MRFs binding sites: two MyoD- and five MEF2-binding sites, elements that have been shown to be essential for skeletal muscle differentiation (30Olson E.N. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, they also showed the presence of one RA receptor and four Smad4- and one Smad3-binding elements, factors that mediate responses to RA and TGF-β, regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation. To determine whether or not the isolatedHindIII-BamHI 2542-bp fragment had promoter activity, it was used to construct a luciferase reporter plasmid, which was transiently transfected in cell lines capable of expressing the endogenous betaglycan. Fig. 2 C shows that, as compared with the empty vector, the cloned HindIII-NotI fragment drove the expression of luciferase in Rat1 fibroblasts. Importantly, transfected L6E9 rat myoblasts, which do not express betaglycan (22Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), failed to express the reporter gene. Together, these findings confirmed that the cloned region contains the bona fide mouse betaglycan gene promoter. To characterize the mechanisms controlling the up-regulation of betaglycan during the myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected using the betaglycan reporter vector and induced to differentiate for 6 days. As expected from the results described above, Fig. 3 shows that the activity of the pBG-Lux increased 8.4-fold during skeletal muscle differentiation. In parallel, as a control of the differentiation process, the increase in expression of myogenin (40-fold) evaluated with pMyo-Luc reporter is shown. As indicated before, betaglycan promoter contain several DNA-binding sites for MyoD and MEF2 proteins. Upon induction of muscle differentiation, these proteins bind to the regulatory regions and activate the transcription of skeletal muscle genes, such as creatine kinase. Thus, we asked whether or not by forcing the expression of myogenin or MyoD in myoblasts the transcriptional activity of the betaglycan reporter could be enhanced. For that purpose, myoblasts cells were transiently co-transfected with an expression vector containing the full-length myogenin cDNA (pEMSV-Myog) or with an expression vector containing the full-length MyoD cDNA (pEMSV-MyoD), together with pBG-Lux and pRLSV40. The transfected cells were maintained under proliferating conditions, and dual luciferase activity was measured after 24 h. Fig. 4 (open bars) shows that MyoD overexpression produced an important increase of the betaglycan reporter activity. However, no effect on the betaglycan promoter activity was observed by myogenin overexpression. The same results were observed when the cells were triggered to differentiate for 24 h (Fig. 4, dark bars). The inset of Fig. 4 shows the protein levels of MyoD or myogenin in the corresponding transfected cells, evaluated by Western blot analyses, and is compared with the induction of those MRFs in myoblasts induced to differentiate. The levels of expression of MyoD or myogenin in the transfected cells were comparable with or even higher than the levels observed during normal differentiation. These results demonstrate that betaglycan expression is under the control of MyoD but not of myogenin activity. The promoter sequence for betaglycan contains putative binding sites for Smads, the major transcriptional mediators of the TGF-β responses, as well as for RA receptor. Because the induction of myoblast differentiation is modulated by removal of diverse growth factors (26Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larrain J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar) or by the addition of RA to the medium (11Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18418-18424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we decided to evaluate their role on the activity of betaglycan promoter. For that purpose, myoblasts were transiently transfected with pBG-Lux and cultured in the presence and absence of defined growth factors FGF-2, BMP-2, HGF, and TGF-β and growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum). Fig. 5 shows that treatment of the cells for 24 h with FGF-2, BMP-2, or HGF did not modify luciferase activity compared with growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum), whereas treatment with any of the three TGF-β mammalian isoforms resulted in a 50% inhibition. These results suggest that growth factors like FGF-2, BMP-2, and HGF are not necessary to maintain the expression of betaglycan, whereas TGF-β is inhibitory. On the other hand, RA, a vitamin A metabolite that plays a major role in skeletal muscle development (31Mocchetti I. Wrathall J.R. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 853-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and differentiation, strongly stimulated the transcriptional activity of pBG-Lux (Fig. 5). This stimulation is observed under growth or differentiation conditions (data not shown), indicating that RA, an inducer of skeletal muscle differentiation, stimulates the expression of betaglycan. Since the recent paper by Eickelberg et al. (32Eickelberg O. Centrella M. Reiss M. Kashgarian M. Wells R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reporting that depending on the type and quantity of the glycosaminoglycan attached to betaglycan, it may prevent the access of TGF-β to the signaling receptors, thereby acting as an inhibitor of the factor, the membrane-bound form of this co-receptor can not be assumed to be an enhancer of TGF-β. Therefore, to determine whether or not betaglycan in the C2C12 myoblasts was a TGF-β enhancer or inhibitor, we analyzed its effect on a prototypical TGF-β assay. For this purpose we forced the expression of betaglycan in C2C12 myoblasts using the adenoviral vector Adv-BG, which drives the expression of the wild type receptor. Cells infected with Adv-BG and a control empty vector were then transiently transfected with p3TP-lux, a well known and widely used TGF-β responsive luciferase reporter (33Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Mendoza-Hernandez G. Lopez-Casillas F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After another 24 h of incubation in growth medium, TGF-β2 was added to the cells at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 6. The luciferase activity of these cells indicated that both the magnitude and the sensitivity of the response greatly increased in the Adv-BG infected cells as compared with the control infected cells. Importantly, the presence of betaglycan in the Adv-BG-infected cells was verified by Western blot (Fig. 6 B). These results clearly show that betaglycan forced expression in the C2C12 cells enhances TGF-β function at least in nondifferentiated myoblasts. To further evaluate the expres"

The main effector of the RAS is the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the successive enzymatic cleavage of the hepatic glycoprotein angiotensinogen (AGT) by kidney-derived renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a metalloprotease located at the surface of endothelial cells (1Rubanyi G.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S1-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although Ang II acts through two receptors, type I and type II (AT1 and AT2, respectively), all of the known cardiovascular effects of Ang II are mediated by the AT1 receptor. In addition to this circulating RAS, the mRNA and protein for all of the RAS components have been identified in different tissues as brain, heart, adrenal gland, reproductive organs, and kidney (reviewed in Ref. 2Bader M. Peters J. Baltatu O. Muller D.N. Luft F.C. Ganten D. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 76-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that tissue RAS (tRAS) might mediate cardiovascular and other functions within tissue sites. Inactivation of the RAS during development either by pharmacological inhibition or gene ablation also causes severe anomalies in the neonatal kidney, leading to hydronephrosis and impaired urine concentration (3Kihara M.

Kimura K. Sugaya T. Yoneda H. Shirato I. Murakami K. Sakai T. Virchows Arch. 1998; 433: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because only limited tissues, including the brain, adrenal gland, and testis, express both the AT1 receptor isoforms in mice, it is possible that the effects of the RAS on renal development are mediated through one of these non-renal tissues.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) prevents kidney abnormalities seen in AGT−/− mice, whereas targeted restoration of AGT only in the kidney of these animals does not prevent the renal anomalies (8Ding Y. Stec D.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have used a novel transgenic strategy to directly address the ability of brain Ang II to correct the renal anomalies in AGT−/− mice and have compared these results to those obtained when Ang II is specifically restored in the circulation of these mice. The expression vector used for releasing Ang II is shown in Fig. 1, and the details of its construction have been described previously (23Methot D. van Kats J.P. Lochard N. Tremblay F. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. Am. J. Hypertens. 2001; 14: 38S-43SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the signal peptide of human prorenin was linked to a fragment of the heavy chain constant region of IgG2b mouse immunoglobulin lacking the BIP binding, hinge, and intermolecular disulfide bridge regions. This domain is followed by a portion of the human prorenin prosegment, which includes a consensus cleavage site (RVRTKR) for furin, a ubiquitous protease, immediately linked to the human Ang II peptide sequence. This fusion protein coding sequence was placed downstream of a 2.2-kb fragment of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (hGFAP), which targets expression to astrocytes of transgenic mice (24Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C., Su, Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transgene was excised from the plasmid vector and co-injected with a tyrosinase gene for pigmentation marking in the pronucleus of fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice as previously described (25Methot D. Reudelhuber T.L. Silversides D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resulting transgenic founder lines were called GFAP-AngII. Generation and characterization of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of frog skin Ang II (fsAng II 2C) has been described previously (26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Knockout mice for angiotensinogen (AGT−/−, a gift from Drs. Kim and Smithies, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) were crossed from the original C57BL/6 strain onto the FVB/N background for 10 generations to generate AGT−/−(FVB) mice. GFAP-Ang II or fsAngII 2C transgenic mice were crossed into the AGT−/−(FVB) background. All mice were used at 12–16 weeks of age unless otherwise specified. The animal protection committee of the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal approved all animal protocols. Total RNA from brain or other tissues was prepared by the guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (25Methot D. Reudelhuber T.L. Silversides D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (27Methot D. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Labeled RNA probes corresponding to the transgene or to histone H4 (an internal control for RNA loading) were synthesized in presence of the [α-32P]CTP (AmershamBiosciences). Total RNA (10 μg) from tissue samples was hybridized with a mixture of the labeled probes (6 × 103counts·min−1 ml−1). The distribution of transgene expression in brain was assessed byin situ hybridization as described previously (28Marcinkiewicz M. Nagao T. Day R. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Avoli M. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by decapitation and brains were removed and quickly embedded in OCT and frozen in isopentane at −30 °C. Serial frozen sections (10-μm thick) were cut by cryostat at −20 °C and thaw-mounted on Superfross slides (Fisher). Tissue sections were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline and followed by a 10-min wash in a buffer containing 0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.1 m acetic acid glacial, and 0.02 m acetic anhydride. Ribonucleotide probes corresponding to the transgene were synthesized by in vitro transcription in the presence of [35S]UTP and [35S]-CTP. The labeled probes (8 × 107counts·min−1 ml−1) were hybridized overnight at 55 °C. Non-hybridized probes were digested by incubation in RNase A solution (200 μg/ml of RNase A in 1 × SSC), and the slides were extensively washed and dipped in photographic emulsion (Kodak NTB-2). Slides were exposed for 6 days and developed in Kodak D19 solution. The levels of Ang II in brain, tissues, and plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (29Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II in tissue or plasma was obtained by acid/alcohol extraction (80% ethanol, 0.1 m HCl) and purified on Sep-Pak hydrophobic C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA). The peptides were eluted with ethanol, and lyophilized peptides were quantified by RIA using a polyclonal rabbit antibody, which has 100% cross-reactivity with Ang II (angiotensin 1–8), Ang III (angiotensin 2–8), and Ang IV (angiotensin 3–8) but no reactivity with Ang I (angiotensin 1–10) (29Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the form of angiotensin peptides released by the fusion protein in brain, whole brain acid/alcohol extracts from three mice were pooled and fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC and elution fractions were lyophilized and subjected to RIA using an antibody specific for Ang II and its metabolites (26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,29Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma renin activity was determined as described previously (26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood (5 drops) was obtained by orbital puncture of mice under light ether anesthesia in cold tubes containing 25 μl of 0.5m EDTA (pH 8.0). Blood was immediately centrifuged, and the plasma was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until the assay was performed. Plasma renin activity was determined by an Ang I generation assay in presence of excess angiotensinogen substrate from sheep (26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The resulting Ang I was measured by RIA using antibody specific for Ang I. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography (BP-200 system, Visitech Systems, Apex, NC). Mice were trained for 7 days and BP was recorded for an additional 3 days. After the initial 10 days of BP recording, some mice were treated with an ACE inhibitor (Captopril, Sigma) at 100 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection in 0.9% NaCl or an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist (Candesartan, a gift from Astra-Zeneca) 15 mg/kg/day by gavage for a further 5 or 3 days while measuring BP during the treatment. For determination of water intake and urine output, animals were placed in metabolic cages with free access to water and food. After a 24-h adaptation period, water intake and urine output volume were measured for three consecutive days. Urine and plasma osmolality were determined by the freezing-point depression method (μOsmette, Precision Systems). Water bottles were removed for 24 h, and urine volume and osmolality were again measured to evaluate the capacity of the mice to concentrate urine when faced with dehydration. Animals were killed by CO2inhalation, and the kidneys were fixed in Bouin's fixative and embedded in paraffin. Serial cuts (5 μm) were prepared and stained with either Sirius Red or hematoxylin/eosin for morphological analysis by standard techniques. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post test or unpaired ttest was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). A fusion protein capable of releasing Ang II into the secretory pathway of expressing cells was placed under the control of the human GFAP promoter (Fig. 1) to drive over-production of Ang II specifically in the brain of transgenic mice. Six founder lines were obtained, and the tissue distribution of transgene expression in the brain was determined by RNase protection and in situhybridization. Three lines (GFAP58.8, GFAP58.5, and GFAP58.2) were found to express the transgene (Fig. 2 A) at different levels in brain. Line GFAP58.8 (which had the highest expression level in the brain and was used for most of the experiments in this study) was found to express the transgene exclusively in the brain (Fig. 2 B) and in situ hybridization demonstrated that this expression was evenly distributed throughout the entire brain (Fig. 2 C). Notably, expression of the fusion protein had no effect on the pattern of expression of the endogenous GFAP gene (data not shown). Angiotensin peptides were extracted from various tissues and plasma from line GFAP58.8 by acid/ethanol extraction and quantitated by radioimmunoassay. The results show that brain Ang II was increased by 3–7-fold in the transgene-expressing lines as compared with non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 3 A), and Ang II production in the brain of each line was roughly proportional to the level of transgene expression (Fig. 2 A). Measurement of the levels of Ang II in various tissues of line GFAP58.8 confirmed that Ang II production was only increased in the brain of this line as we could not detect any increase of Ang II content in non-brain tissues tested (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, we were also unable to detect any increase in circulating Ang II in the plasma of GFAP-Ang II mice as compared with control littermates, suggesting that the Ang II being produced in the brain of the transgenic animals is not spilling over into their circulation (Fig. 3 C). To confirm this finding, we measured plasma renin activity, a sensitive indicator of circulating Ang II levels, because renin secretion from the kidney is potently suppressed by increases in circulating Ang II. Notably, GFAP58.8 mice actually show a slight increase in plasma renin activity (GFAP58.8, 1721 ± 404; non-transgenic 1193, ± 185 ng Ang I/ml/h; p < 0.05), supporting the conclusion that these animals do not liberate brain-derived Ang II into the circulation. Because the brain is rich in aminopeptidases that can break down Ang II to less active metabolites (30Reaux A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. David C. Zini S. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13415-13420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we investigated the form of Ang II contained in the brain of line GFAP58.8 by RIA-coupled HPLC of whole brain acid/alcohol extracts. The results clearly demonstrate that the majority of the peptide extracted from the brain of GFAP58.8 mice migrates as bona fide Ang II (Fig. 4).Figure 4Characterization of angiotensin peptides present in brain of GFAP-Ang II mice. Tic marksindicate the migration of angiotensin peptide standards for Ang II (angiotensin 1–8), Ang III (angiotensin 2–8), and Ang IV (angiotensin 3–8). Peptides extracted from the brains of three transgenic (closed circles) or three control (open diamonds) mice were separated by HPLC, and fractions were subjected to RIA with an antibody specific for Ang II and its metabolites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the effect of increases in brain Ang II on cardiovascular functions, systolic BP was measured by the non-invasive tail-cuff method (32Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We found that the BP was significantly increased in the transgenic mice (GFAP58.8, 150 ± 12; control, 123 ± 6 mmHg; p < 0.001). Despite the differences observed in the levels of Ang II in brain of the three transgenic lines we characterized, there was no significant difference in the degree of hypertension seen in mice from these lines (data not shown). Treatment of line GFAP58.8 mice with a specific angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist (Candesartan) at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day by gavage normalized BP after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 5), confirming that the hypertension seen in these mice was due to the action of Ang II on the AT1 receptor. In contrast, treatment of these mice with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 4 days did not reduce the BP of transgenic mice to a greater extent than seen in non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 5). This dose of Captopril was effective, however, in correcting RAS-dependent hypertension in mice, which over-express human renin in the liver under the control of transthyretin promoter (TTRhRen-A3 before treatment 169 ± 10 and after treatment 112 ± 9; p < 0.001 (29Prescott G. Silversides D.W. Chiu S.M. Reudelhuber T.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). These results clearly demonstrate that the hypertension seen in line GFAP58.8 is due to the direct action of Ang II on the AT1 receptor and not due to activation of the endogenous mouse RAS, which would have responded to Captopril treatment. Inactivation of the AGT gene in C57BL/6 mice leads to multiple renal defects including hydronephrosis, hypertrophy of renal arteries, increased thirst, and an inability to concentrate urine when faced with dehydration and results in a high mortality rate by weaning (6Piper J.M. Ray W.A. Rosa F.W. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 80: 429-432PubMed Google Scholar, 7Niimura F. Labosky P.A. Kakuchi J. Okubo S. Yoshida H. Oikawa T. Ichiki T. Naftilan A.J. Fogo A. Inagami T. J. Clin.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test for the effect of complementation of Ang II on these phenotypes, we first bred the AGT−/− mice onto the FVB/N background (hereafter referred to as AGT−/−(FVB)). After 10 generations, AGT−/−(FVB) mice had all of the expected phenotypes but did not exhibit any increased mortality at weaning (data not shown). These mice were bred to GFAP58.8 transgenic mice or to transgenic mice over-expressing frog skin Ang II in the heart (line 2C; Ref. 26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 2C line has an approximate 1,000-fold increase in cardiac Ang II and spills this peptide into the circulation as evidenced by a suppression of plasma renin content (line 2C; Ref. 26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Blood pressure in line 2C mice is not increased at 5 weeks, but is slightly elevated by 10–12 weeks as compared with non-transgenic littermates (26van Kats J.P. Methot D. Paradis P. Silversides D.W. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44012-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The GFAP58.8 and line 2C transgenic mice were bred into the AGT−/−(FVB) background, and the resulting mice were characterized. Selective restoration of Ang II either in brain or in plasma normalizes BP of the AGT−/−(FVB) mice (*AGT−/−(FVB) 106 ± 7; GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) 110 ± 9; 2C/AGT−/−(FVB) 112 ± 12 and control 120 ± 5 mmHg; *, p < 0.01 versus control). The kidneys of AGT−/−(FVB) mice present hydronephrosis, increased perivascular, glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, medullary cysts, and hypertrophy of interlobular arteries (Fig. 6, C and D). All (22/22) kidneys examined from GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) mice were free of hydronephrosis (Fig. 6 E), whereas the vast majority (8/10) of kidneys from 2C/ AGT−/−(FVB) were hydronephrosis-free (Fig. 6 G). Interestingly, some glomerular atrophy and hypertrophy of interlobular arteries persists despite restoration of Ang II in brain or the circulation of AGT−/− animals (Fig. 6, F and H). Small cysts were also present in the renal cortex of animals restoring Ang II only in the circulation of the AGT-deficient animals (Fig. 6 H). To test for the effect of brain or circulatory Ang II on kidney function in AGT−/−(FVB) mice, animals were placed individually in metabolic cages with free access to water and food, and urine output and water consumption were measured. As expected, AGT−/−(FVB) mice show an increased water intake and urine output (Fig. 7,A and B), but both were significantly attenuated in GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) and 2C/AGT−/−(FVB) mice. Urine osmolality of AGT−/−(FVB) and GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) was significant lower than that of control mice (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, 2C/AGT−/−(FVB) mice correct this decrease in urine osmolality (Fig. 7 C), consistent with the known importance of circulating Ang II for kidney function (8Ding Y. Stec D.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As previously reported, AGT−/− mice are unable to concentrate urine when deprived of water (Fig. 7 C). After a 24-h period of water deprivation, GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) mice show the same capacity as control mice to concentrate urine (an approximate 2-fold increase) even though the starting osmolality is lower than that of control mice (Fig. 7 C). The 2C/ AGT−/−(FVB) as well AGT−/−(FVB) cannot concentrate their urine after being water-deprived as compared with control littermates (Fig. 7 C). These results demonstrate that brain Ang II plays an important role in regulating fluid balance in conditions of dehydration. We have used a novel technique to generate transgenic mice with a chronic over-production of Ang II peptide in the brain. This locally produced Ang II does not spill over into the circulation as evidenced by an absence of transgene mRNA or Ang II peptide increases in the non-brain tissues tested, a lack of detectable increases in circulating Ang II, and a lack of suppression of circulating renin, a very sensitive indicator of circulating Ang II. Our results demonstrate that restoration of brain Ang II in mice deficient for an endogenous renin-angiotensin system prevents the hydronephrosis seen in the non-complemented AGT−/− mice and restores their ability to concentrate urine when challenged by dehydration. In contrast, although restoration of circulating Ang II in the AGT−/−mice also corrects hydronephrosis, it is unable to correct their ability to concentrate urine when challenged with dehydration, suggesting differences in the site of action of Ang II in these two models. Although both complementation strategies partially corrected the increased drinking and urine output seen in AGT−/−mice, neither improved the observed hypertrophy of the interlobular renal arteries. Taken together, these results suggest that the panoply of renal phenotypes described in RAS-deficient mice may be due to the action of Ang II on multiple target tissues. Newborn mice deficient for a RAS have histologically normal kidneys at birth and develop frank hydronephrosis in the first 3–5 weeks of life (8Ding Y. Stec D.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Matsusaka T. Miyazaki Y. Ichikawa I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a period when the newborn kidney must adapt to a much higher flux in fluid than it was exposed to in utero. Although both transgenic models reduce drinking behavior and urine output in the AGT−/−background, these values do not return to levels seen in control mice, and it seems unlikely that this partial reduction in urine flux could account for the complete disappearance of the hydronephrosis. Taniguchiet al. (33Matsusaka T. Miyazaki Y. Ichikawa I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have suggested that the hydronephrosis seen in RAS-deficient C57bl/6 mouse pups is due to an incomplete development of a smooth muscle layer around the upper ureter, which results in a loss of ureteral peristalsis and hydronephrosis due to reflux pressure. Surprisingly, in the FVB background we see no deficiency in the formation of the smooth muscle cell layer around the upper ureter of the AGT−/− animals (data not shown) even though all of these animals develop hydronephrosis, raising the possibility that the hydronephrosis is not directly linked to this developmental phenomenon. Correction of hydronephrosis in RAS-deficient mice has also been reported by other groups who have targeted components of the RAS to different tissues. Double transgenic mice expressing both human renin and angiotensinogen in numerous tissues correct all of the renal abnormalities seen in AGT−/−mice (22Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similar results were reported with expression of AGT in AGT−/− mice using the metallothionein promoter that results in expression in multiple tissues including brain, kidney, and liver (21Ishida J. Sugiyama F. Tanimoto K. Taniguchi K. Syouji M. Takimoto E. Horiguchi H. Murakami K. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Somewhat more surprisingly, rescue of the hydronephrosis in AGT−/− mice has been reported with complementation of angiotensinogen expression selectively in adipocytes (20Massiera F. Bloch-Faure M. Ceiler D. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Gasc J.M. Quignard-Boulange A. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Seydoux J. Meneton P. Teboul M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2727-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Notably all of these approaches would result in a partial or complete restoration of circulating Ang II. One possible explanation for the ability of both brain and circulating Ang II to correct hydronephrosis might be their parallel effects on blood pressure, which might counter reflux pressure in the ureter by increasing the filtration pressure in the kidney. Indeed, whereas AGT−/− mice are mildly hypotensive, GFAP-Ang II/AGT−/−(FVB) and 2C/AGT−/−(FVB) mice had a normal BP. However, Kessleret al. (34Kessler S.P. Gomos J.B. Scheidemantel T.S. Rowe T.M. Smith H.L. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4271-4276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) recently reported that replacement of a soluble form of ACE in ACE−/− knockout mice resulted in the rescue of kidney anomalies even though these mice remain hypotensive (34Kessler S.P. Gomos J.B. Scheidemantel T.S. Rowe T.M. Smith H.L. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4271-4276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), making blood pressure an unlikely reason for the correction of hydronephrosis. Another possible explanation for the ability of circulating Ang II to correct renal defects in AGT−/− mice would be its uptake by the kidney itself. Even though the kidney can indeed take up Ang II from the circulation via the AT1 receptor (35Zou L.X. Imig J.D. Hymel A. Navar L.G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1998; 11: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), restoration of Ang II production only in the kidney is not sufficient to rescue anomalies in kidneys of AGT−/− mice (8Ding Y. Stec D.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of Ang II on hydronephrosis is mediated by a non-renal tissue. Alternatively, Ang II produced in the circulation might act on the brain to influence the development of hydronephrosis, which would explain why both of our transgenic mouse models correct this phenotype. Although the blood-brain barrier is impermeable to peptides such as angiotensin, the circumventricular organs, such as subfornical organ (SFO), paraventricular nuclei, and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), allow peptides and hormones to leave the brain without disrupting blood-brain barrier and permit substances in plasma that do not normally cross this barrier to trigger changes in brain function (reviewed in Ref. 36Ganong W.F. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These organs are rich in AT1 receptors (37Phillips M.I. Sumners C. Regul. Pept. 1998; 78: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and injection of 125I-Ang II into the circulation results in Ang II binding in SFO, OVLT, median eminence, and area postrema (38Volicer L. Loew C.G. Neuropharmacology. 1971; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Johnson A.K. Schwob J.E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1975; 3: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40van Houten M. Schiffrin E.L. Mann J.F. Posner B.I. Boucher R. Brain Res. 1980; 186: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) to affect both blood pressure and drinking behavior. These findings raise the possibility that both brain and circulating Ang II act at the same sites in the brain to influence either post-natal renal development or function in newborn mice. Although the actual mechanisms need further investigation, both central and circulating Ang II can influence renal sympathetic nerve activity, which in turn could have a direct effect on kidney function by stimulating the peristalsis of the ureter and in this way prevent the urinary reflux (41DiBona G.F. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Interestingly we found that the high rate of neonatal mortality that has been associated with renin-angiotensin system deficiency depends on genetic background use. By using AGT−/−(FVB) it seems that the kidney anomalies seen in mice with RAS disruption are an adaptation problem instead of a developmental problem, because obvious renal defects are not seen until 4 to 5 weeks of age. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that chronic elevations of Ang II specifically restricted to the brain can prevent the hydronephrosis and urine concentration deficit seen in RAS-deficient mice. These findings may have important implications for understanding the fetotoxic effects of RAS inhibitors seen in humans (4Barr M., Jr. Cohen M.M., Jr. Teratology. 1991; 44: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Shotan A.

The mechanism of the alkaline phosphatase reaction involves the attack of a serine alkoxide on the phosphorus of the substrate to transiently form a covalent enzyme-phosphate complex followed by the hydrolysis of the serine phosphate (1Trentham D.R. Gutfreund H. Biochem. J. 1968; 106: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the phosphate can be transferred to a phosphate acceptor such as Tris or ethanolamine. Under alkaline conditions, the slow step in the mechanism is the release of inorganic phosphate from the noncovalent enzyme-phosphate complex. Details of the enzymatic mechanism and the involvement of metal ions in catalysis have been determined largely through studies utilizing theEscherichia coli enzyme. As a result of these investigations, the specific roles of many active site residues have been elucidated (2Chaidaroglou A. Brezinski D.J. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R.

Open table in a new tab A few of the alkaline phosphatases from organisms listed in Table Ihave been analyzed as to their metal requirements for catalysis. With the exception of the Mg2+ requirement of the enzyme from TAB5 (10Rina M. Pozidis C. Mavromatis K. Tzanodaskalaki M. Kokkinidis M. Bouriotis V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), these characterized enzymes require Co2+, not Zn2+, for activity (11Wojciechowski C., L. Cardia J., P. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Hulett M.F. Kim E.E. Bookstein C. Kapp N.V. Edwards C.W. Wyckoff H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1077-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the Co2+-requiring enzymes, Thermotoga maritima alkaline phosphatase and the Bacillus subtilis phoAIII and phoAIV gene products have His and Trp atE. coli positions 153 and 328, respectively. These data taken together suggest that the presence of a Trp at E. colialkaline phosphatase position 328 either alone or in combination with a His at position 153 is required for the enzyme to utilize Co2+ for catalysis. To test this proposal, we have constructed the mutations D153H and K328W individually and in combination in the Zn2+-requiring E. coli enzyme to determine whether the alterations result in an enzyme that can utilize Co2+ for phosphate ester hydrolysis.DISCUSSIONA comparison of several alkaline phosphatase amino acid sequences reveals a trend linking the nature of certain active site residues and the metal required for catalysis (Table I). In the E. colienzyme, residues 153 and 328 are Asp and Lys, respectively. This enzyme requires two Zn2+ and one Mg2+ ion/active site for activity (Fig. 1) (16Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Removing these metals and replacing them with either Co2+ alone or Co2+ in combination with Mg2+ results in greatly diminished activity. Alternatively, enzymes with a His and a Trp at E. colipositions 153 and 328, respectively, have higher activity with Co2+, as compared with Zn2+ (11Wojciechowski C., L. Cardia J., P. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Hulett M.F. Kim E.E. Bookstein C. Kapp N.V. Edwards C.W. Wyckoff H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1077-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the T. maritima enzyme, which contains the His, Trp combination, has been reported to be most active in the presence of Co2+ or of Co2+ and Mg2+ combinations and is even inhibited by high concentrations of Zn2+ (11Wojciechowski C., L. Cardia J., P. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The roles of the Asp-153 and Lys-328 residues in wild-type and mutant versions of E. coli alkaline phosphatase have been elucidated through kinetic and crystallographic studies. Asp-153 binds the Mg2+ through two water molecules and forms a salt-bridge to Lys-328 in the wild-type E. coli enzyme (8Murphy J.E., Xu X. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21479-21500Google Scholar,16Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Lys-328 binds the phosphate through a water molecule (9Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Through these interactions, Asp-153 and Lys-328 participate in the charge and structure of the active site (Fig. 1).Zinc and cobalt share some similar properties but exhibit differences that might allow enzymes to discriminate between the two. Cobalt is slightly smaller than zinc, having an ionic radius of 1.25 Å as compared with a zinc ionic radius of 1.38 Å. There is also a slight difference in pK a values; cobalt has a pK a of 9.6 as opposed to a zinc pK a of 9.0 (17Wulfsberg G. Principles of Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry. Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, Belmont, CA1987: 25Google Scholar). Although both metals can adopt either a tetrahedral or octahedral configuration, zinc more readily adopts a tetrahedral configuration, and cobalt more readily adopts an octahedral configuration (18Simpson R.T. Vallee B.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 166: 670-695Crossref Google Scholar).CatalysisThe wild-type enzyme only shows significant activity with Zn2+, with the combination of Zn2+ and Mg2+ yielding the highest activity. Incubating the apo-enzyme with Co2+ alone or Co2+ in combination with Mg2+ yields an enzyme with at best 10% of the activity seen in the Zn2+,Mg2+ wild-type enzyme. The D153H enzyme has optimal activity with the same metals as the wild-type enzyme but requires more Mg2+ for maximal activity, as was shown in previous studies (5Janeway C.M., Xu, X. Murphy J.E. Chaidaroglou A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Even though this indirect ligand to the Mg site has been altered, the D153H enzyme still remains a Zn2+,Mg2+-requiring enzyme. The single change from an Asp to a His at position 153 alone does not allow the E. coli enzyme to utilize Co2+.The K328W enzyme, unlike the wild-type and the D153H enzymes, can catalyze the dephosphorylation of PNPP with either Co2+ or Zn2+. However, the reaction is not as efficient with Co2+ as with Zn2+, and theK m is greatly increased for the Co2+-K328W enzyme. The poor K m value might be due to a loss of interactions with the substrate or with the Asp-153. In previous crystallographic studies on the K328H enzyme, interactions between the phosphate and the residue at position 328 were compromised (9Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Also, the change from a positive Lys to a hydrophobic Trp is drastic and must change the electrostatics and perhaps the geometry of the active site.The D153H/K328W enzyme shows equal activity with Zn2+ and Co2+ under many of the conditions tested. However, under optimal conditions, the D153H/K328W enzyme is a better catalyst with Co2+ than with Zn2+. Like the K328W enzyme, theK m value is very poor. For the reasons listed above, interactions with the phosphate could be compromised by the changes.Metal BindingThe interaction of the apo-wild-type enzyme with Zn2+ shows at least two, possibly three, classes of Zn2+ binding sites with different affinities (Fig. 2). When Zn2+ binds to the apo-wild-type enzyme, all of the interactions are exothermic in nature, suggesting highly favorable bond formations, with little reorganization at the active site (19Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M.-C. Makarov A. Briand C. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When this enzyme is titrated with Co2+, there is some endothermic character to the metal-protein interactions at the mid-point in the titration. Also, the wild-type enzyme has a much lower affinity for Co2+. These results indicate that Co2+ is a poor ligand for the wild-type enzyme and that the Co2+ binding occurs in a different manner than Zn2+ binding.Initially, Zn2+ binds exothermically to high affinity sites on the apo-K328W enzyme, indicating a process both entropically and enthalpically driven. At the weaker binding site, the binding changes to mostly endothermic, showing that the later binding process is driven mainly entropically (Fig. 3) (20Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The entropic contribution to metal binding could be due to the loss of water from the Zn2+coordination sphere or, more likely, the release of structured water molecules from surrounding polar or nonpolar residues because of a rearrangement (21Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19573-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The binding of Co2+ to the high affinity sites on the apo-K328W enzyme is exothermic, whereas the binding of Co2+ to the low affinity sites is a mixture of exothermic with a rapid relaxation rate, followed by endothermic with a much slower relaxation rate (Fig. 3). The more pronounced endothermic character suggests that a reorganization of the binding site may be necessary to bind Co2+ to the apo-K328W enzyme and may explain the lower affinity of the apo-K328W enzyme for Co2+as compared with the affinity of the apo-wild-type enzyme for Co2+. However, a rearrangement could result in an active site conformation better able to utilize Co2+ for catalysis.The apo-D153H/K328W enzyme initially binds Zn2+exothermically; then in the mid-range of the titration, metal binding has a large endothermic contribution (Fig. 4). Again, the large endothermic part could represent a change in Zn2+ solvation or an active site reorganization upon binding. In this case, the endothermic character is much more pronounced, indicating that a large change is necessary to accommodate Zn2+ at the active site. When the apo-D153H/K328W enzyme is titrated with Co2+, there is very little endothermic character to the binding of the metal ion. Even though the binding constants are poor for the Co2+-D153H/K328W enzyme, the geometry of the active site may be more suitable for Co2+.ConclusionsThese data indicate that very small differences in the active site of E. coli alkaline phosphatase are necessary for the enzyme to utilize Co2+for catalysis instead of Zn2+. Although theK m values for the K328W and D153H/K328W enzymes are greatly increased, the k cat values indicate that catalysis does occur in these enzymes to a much greater extent than in the wild-type enzyme. Isothermal titration data also suggest that in the D153H/K328W enzyme there is much less rearrangement when Co2+ binds to the enzyme, as is the case for Zn2+ binding the wild-type enzyme. For Co2+ to be most effective in the E. coli alkaline phosphatase active site, both His and Trp must be in positions 153 and 328, respectively. To better understand the structural basis of the isothermal titration calorimetry data, crystallographic studies are in progress to determine the alteration of the metal sites upon Co2+ or Zn2+ binding to the D153H/K328W enzyme.

Lys-328 binds the phosphate through a water molecule (9Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Through these interactions, Asp-153 and Lys-328 participate in the charge and structure of the active site (Fig. 1).Zinc and cobalt share some similar properties but exhibit differences that might allow enzymes to discriminate between the two. Cobalt is slightly smaller than zinc, having an ionic radius of 1.25 Å as compared with a zinc ionic radius of 1.38 Å. There is also a slight difference in pK a values; cobalt has a pK a of 9.6 as opposed to a zinc pK a of 9.0 (17Wulfsberg G. Principles of Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry. Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, Belmont, CA1987: 25Google Scholar). Although both metals can adopt either a tetrahedral or octahedral configuration, zinc more readily adopts a tetrahedral configuration, and cobalt more readily adopts an octahedral configuration (18Simpson R.T. Vallee B.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 166: 670-695Crossref Google Scholar).CatalysisThe wild-type enzyme only shows significant activity with Zn2+, with the combination of Zn2+ and Mg2+ yielding the highest activity. Incubating the apo-enzyme with Co2+ alone or Co2+ in combination with Mg2+ yields an enzyme with at best 10% of the activity seen in the Zn2+,Mg2+ wild-type enzyme. The D153H enzyme has optimal activity with the same metals as the wild-type enzyme but requires more Mg2+ for maximal activity, as was shown in previous studies (5Janeway C.M., Xu, X. Murphy J.E. Chaidaroglou A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Even though this indirect ligand to the Mg site has been altered, the D153H enzyme still remains a Zn2+,Mg2+-requiring enzyme. The single change from an Asp to a His at position 153 alone does not allow the E. coli enzyme to utilize Co2+.The K328W enzyme, unlike the wild-type and the D153H enzymes, can catalyze the dephosphorylation of PNPP with either Co2+ or Zn2+. However, the reaction is not as efficient with Co2+ as with Zn2+, and theK m is greatly increased for the Co2+-K328W enzyme. The poor K m value might be due to a loss of interactions with the substrate or with the Asp-153. In previous crystallographic studies on the K328H enzyme, interactions between the phosphate and the residue at position 328 were compromised (9Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Also, the change from a positive Lys to a hydrophobic Trp is drastic and must change the electrostatics and perhaps the geometry of the active site.The D153H/K328W enzyme shows equal activity with Zn2+ and Co2+ under many of the conditions tested. However, under optimal conditions, the D153H/K328W enzyme is a better catalyst with Co2+ than with Zn2+. Like the K328W enzyme, theK m value is very poor. For the reasons listed above, interactions with the phosphate could be compromised by the changes.Metal BindingThe interaction of the apo-wild-type enzyme with Zn2+ shows at least two, possibly three, classes of Zn2+ binding sites with different affinities (Fig. 2). When Zn2+ binds to the apo-wild-type enzyme, all of the interactions are exothermic in nature, suggesting highly favorable bond formations, with little reorganization at the active site (19Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M.-C. Makarov A. Briand C. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When this enzyme is titrated with Co2+, there is some endothermic character to the metal-protein interactions at the mid-point in the titration. Also, the wild-type enzyme has a much lower affinity for Co2+. These results indicate that Co2+ is a poor ligand for the wild-type enzyme and that the Co2+ binding occurs in a different manner than Zn2+"

To understand the mechanism by which p105 binds and inhibits NF-κB, we have used both p105 and its C-terminal inhibitory segment known as IκBγ for our study. We show here that one IκBγ molecule binds to NF-κB dimers wherein at least one NF-κB subunit is p50. We suggest that the obligatory p50 subunit in IκBγ·NF-κB complexes is equivalent to the N-terminal p50 segment in all p105·NF-κB complexes. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the obligatory p50 subunit is masked by IκBγ, whereas the NLS of the nonobligatory NF-κB subunit is exposed. Thus, the global binding mode of all IκB·NF-κB complexes seems to be similar where one obligatory (or specific) NF-κB subunit makes intimate contact with IκB and the nonobligatory (or nonspecific) subunit is bound primarily through its ability to dimerize. In the case of IκBα and IκBβ, the specific NF-κB subunit in the complex is p65. In contrast to IκBα·NF-κB complexes, where the exposed NLS of the nonspecific subunit imports the complex to the nucleus, p105·NF-κB and IκBγ·NF-κB complexes are cytoplasmic. We show that the death domain of p105 (also of IκBγ) is essential for the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-κB by p105 and IκBγ. However, the death domain does not mask the exposed NLS of the complex. We also demonstrate that the death domain alone is not sufficient for cytoplasmic retention and instead functions only in conjunction with other parts in the three-dimensional scaffold formed by the association of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and NF-κB dimer. We speculate that additional cytoplasmic protein(s) may sequester the entire p105·NF-κB complex by binding through the death domain and other segments, including the exposed NLS. p105, also known as NF-κB1, is an atypical IκB molecule with a multi-domain organization distinct from other prototypical IκBs, like IκBα and IκBβ.

In response to a variety of extracellular signals, the IκB molecule is phosphorylated by IκB kinases, which leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB by the proteosome machinery within the cell (22Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar). It has long been thought that all IκB proteins inhibit NF-κBs by masking the nuclear localization signal (NLS)1 of NF-κB and thereby sequestering them in the cytoplasm (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have indicated that the IκB proteins differ with regard to their regulation of NF-κB subcellular localization. The IκBα·NF-κB complex exhibits dynamic shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (23Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tam W.F.

However, despite its transient presence in the nucleus, NF-κB remains bound to IκBα, and this prevents DNA binding and activation of transcription. IκBβ, on the other hand, sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm of resting cells (26Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Ghosh S. Karin M.

It has been suggested that other ancillary proteins may be required for this function. 2S. Malek, Y. Chen, and G. Ghosh, unpublished observation.2S. Malek, Y. Chen, and G. Ghosh, unpublished observation. p105 and p100 are the precursors of NF-κB subunits p50 and p52, respectively, which are located in their N termini. Both p105 and p100 have similar structural organizations (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The central portion of these molecules has a glycine-rich region that has been shown to play a critical role in processing of the precursor (29Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C termini resemble other IκB molecules that possess ankyrin repeats (AR) (14Bours V. Burd P.R. Brown K. Villalobos J. Park S. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Mercurio F. Didonato J. Rosette C. Karin M. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These two proteins also contain a death domain immediately C-terminal to the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD). The IκB kinase phosphorylation sites are located further downstream within a region called the destruction box (see Fig. 1). A separate gene also encodes the C-terminal part of p105. This gene product, known as IκBγ, has been shown to exist only in certain cell types, like mouse pre-B cells (12Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Kakizuka A. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In resting cells, p105 is partially processed, generating p50. The exact mechanism of this limited processing event is not known, although co-translational processing events have been proposed (32Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 33Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unprocessed p105 functions as an inhibitor molecule and nonspecifically inhibits almost all NF-κB subunits, including p50 (34Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 35Naumann M. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C.

An earlier study has shown that p105 retains itself, as well as other NF-κB molecules, in the cytoplasm (37Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Muller J.M Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition is, however, still unclear. The p105 molecule, like the classical IκB inhibitors, can also undergo complete degradation in response to signals and the sequential action of IκB kinases, ubiquitin ligases, and the 26 S proteasome (38Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F.

Both the death domain and the destruction box have been shown to be important for IκB kinase phosphorylation (41Cohen S. Orian A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26769-26776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Beinke S. Belich M.P. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24162-24168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to p105, the mechanism of p100 processing is very different. In resting cells, most of p100 remains unprocessed, and in response to appropriate signals all of it gets processed into p52 (43Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In this study, we address the functional properties of p105 by asking the following questions. How does p105 regulate subcellular distribution of NF-κB subunits? How does p105 nonspecifically inhibit other NF-κB proteins? What is the relationship between p105·NF-κB and IκBγ·NF-κB complexes? We find that although IκBγ resembles other IκBs in exhibiting a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding to NF-κB dimers, it has a unique specificity for NF-κB dimers that contain at least one p50 subunit. This obligatory p50 subunit in IκBγ·NF-κB complexes is structurally equivalent to the N-terminal p50 segment of p105 in p105·NF-κB complexes. Interestingly, although IκBγ fails to mask one NF-κB NLS, it still retains NF-κB in the cytoplasm. We observe that the death domain of p105 is necessary but not sufficient for this cytosolic retention. We suggest that p105 and IκBγ inhibitors may require an as yet unknown cellular factor(s) to sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm. The cloning, expression, and purification of the NF-κB subunits has been described previously (45Chen F. Kempiak S. Huang D. Phelps C. Ghosh G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 46Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated glutathione S-transferase-IκBγ were made by cloning into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 and purified by glutathione-agarose column chromatography following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins and protein complexes were diluted in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The reactions were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 1 h. Native gel loading dye (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was then added to each sample. 10% native polyacrylamide gels were prepared with 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The samples were loaded on the gel and run in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer for 2 h at a constant current (3 mA). The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. Fluorescence polarization competition assays were done as described previously (47Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, varying concentrations of IκBγ were mixed with constant amounts of p50 homodimer pre-equilibrated with fluorescein-labeled DNA. The competition assay binding curves were analyzed for IC50 values, defined as the concentration of IκBγ at 0.5 fractional occupancy. cDNAs encoding full-length p50 and full-length/truncated p105 were cloned into a pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) containing either an N-terminal FLAG (p50 constructs) or an N-terminal HA (p105·IκBγ constructs) tag. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics and transfected with plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Protein expression was checked by Western blot. HeLa cells were grown on 8-well chamber slides (Lab Tek). The cells were transfected with a total of 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 1 min and blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescent detection was done by incubating the cells with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (against HA), M2 (against FLAG), and H-286 (against p65) in PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and incubated with fluoresceinated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed three times with buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and the slide was mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For immunoprecipitation from whole cell lysates, HeLa cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation was carried out by the protein A pull-down method. Briefly, 0.1–0.5 mg equivalent of protein from transfected cell extract was diluted with 300 μl of lysis buffer. The appropriate antibodies were added to the extract and incubated overnight with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) at 4 °C. The beads were pulled down by brief centrifugation and washed three times with the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then eluted from the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer devoid of β-mercaptoethanol by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The bound proteins were then identified by Western blot.In vitro immunoprecipitation was carried out with a similar protocol using purified E. coli proteins in place of whole cell extract. Unprocessed p105 functions as an inhibitor of NF-κB, although its mode of inhibition appears to be quite different from the prototypical IκB proteins such as IκBα and IκBβ. As opposed to IκBα and IκBβ that bind through p65, p105 inhibits all NF-κB members nonspecifically. To understand the biochemical basis of NF-κB inhibition by p105, we wanted to first test how the p105 C terminus (IκBγ) binds to NF-κB dimers. We have characterized the interactions between IκBγ and various NF-κB dimers by protein-protein gel shift assays under native conditions. To simplify the assay we generated a truncated IκBγ containing only the ARD fused to a poly-His peptide. This construct will be referred to as ARD-IκBγΔC. We observe that ARD-IκBγΔC binds strongly to the p50·p50 homodimer and p50·p65 heterodimer but only weakly to the p65·p65 and c-Rel·c-Rel homodimer (Fig. 2 A). Although no stable complexes are formed between IκBγ and p65·p65 or c-Rel·c-Rel homodimers, we do not observe free IκBγ in these lanes. It is likely that these complexes are weaker and smear during electrophoresis. Based on these results we suggest that complexes between IκBγ and non-p50 containing NF-κB dimers are highly unstable. The fact that p105 binds to all NF-κB proteins and IκBγ binds only to p50 dimers (any NF-κB dimer that contains at least one p50 subunit) suggests that the required p50 subunit in IκBγ·NF-κB complexes is likely the N-terminal p50 segment of p105 in p105·NF-κB complexes. Thus, the p105·p50 (or p105·p65) complex can be considered to be structurally equivalent to the IκBγ·p50·p50 (or IκBγ·p50·p65) complex (Fig. 2 B). The binding data presented above suggest that IκBγ prefers p50 containing NF-κB dimers. However, these experiments do not reveal whether one or two molecules of IκBγ bind to one molecule of NF-κB dimer. This is important considering that Bcl-3, which contains seven AR like IκΒγ, has been proposed to bind to p50·p50 and p52·p52 homodimers in a 2:1 molar ratio (48Michel F. Soler-Lopez M. Petosa C. Cramer P. Siebenlist U. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6180-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33132-33139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To elucidate IκBγ·NF-κB binding stoichiometry, we have used two different IκBγ constructs, one is the full-length IκBγ expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (FL-IκBγ), and the other is the previously described ARD-IκBγΔC. As seen in Fig. 2 C (lanes 4 and 5), both of these proteins bind p50·p50 homodimer efficiently, and the resulting complex migrates to different positions in the native gel. In a reaction mixture containing both IκBγs and the p50 homodimer, binding of two molecules of IκBγ to the homodimer would result in a distinct, additional complex composed of these IκBγ molecules of different lengths and p50. However, when equivalent amounts of FL-IκBγ, ARD-IκBγΔC, and p50·p50 homodimer were mixed, only two distinct complexes, one corresponding to the FL-IκBγ·p50·p50 complex and the other to the ARD-IκBγΔC·p50·p50 complex, were seen (Fig. 2 C,lane 6). Thus, we can conclude that one molecule of IκBγ binds to one p50·p50 homodimer. The presence of one free NLS is a prime reason for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the IκBα·NF-κB complex. To elucidate the status of the NF-κB NLS(s) in its complex with IκBγ, p50·p50 homodimers of different lengths, both with and without the NLSs, were prepared, and their binding to ARD-IκBγΔC was tested using native gel shift assays. Fig. 3 A shows that all three of the p50·p50 dimers were capable of binding to ARD-IκBγΔC, although the dimer with both NLSs deleted (p50–350(−NLS)) seems to bind IκBγ relatively weakly (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–7). This suggests that IκBγ may not use the NLS sequence for p50 binding, or at least this region does not seem to contribute significantly. Similar binding patterns were also observed with FL-IκBγ (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to further confirm the presence of at least one free NLS in the IκBγ·NF-κB complex. If the p65 NLS in the IκBγ·p50·p65 complex were free, then anti-p65 NLS antibody would interact with the p65 NLS. Here, the p50·p65 heterodimer was used because of the availability of the p65 NLS-specific monoclonal antibody. Free NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer and the IκBγ·p50·p65 heterodimer complex were incubated with p65 NLS antibody. It was seen that the antibody was able to pull down NF-κB in both the free and IκBγ complexed form (Fig. 3 B, top panel). This demonstrates that the p65 NLS in the p50·p65 heterodimer is not protected by IκBγ. As a parallel control, the IκBα·p50·p65 complex was also tested. The p65 NLS antibody was unable to pull down NF-κB in the IκBα·p50·p65 complex (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel). This corroborates with earlier results that have shown that the p65 NLS is masked in the IκBα·p50·p65 complex (26Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Ghosh S. Karin M.

Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus, these experiments show that at least one NF-κB NLS remains unmasked in the IκBγ·NF-κB complex. The above observation that at least one NF-κB NLS is free in the IκBγ·NF-κB complex suggests that these complexes should localize to the nucleus. The subcellular distribution of the complex was tested by simultaneously transfecting HeLa cells with IκBγ, p50, and p65. Immunostaining shows that free p50 and p65, which are most likely to be present as a heterodimer, are nuclear (Fig. 4 A, left panel), but co-expression of IκBγ leads to cytoplasmic retention (Fig. 4 A, right panel). Thus, although the IκBγ·p50·p65 has at least one NLS free, the complex does not localize to the nucleus. The subcellular distribution of p105 and IκBγ complexes with p50 was also tested. Immunofluorescence studies show both these complexes to be cytoplasmic (Fig. 4 B). Free p50, as expected, is localized in the nucleus (data not shown). To further test the ability of these complexes to be retained in the cytoplasm, a mutant p50 with an additional NLS (p50-NLS) was made. Cells co-transfected with p50-NLS and p105 or IκBγ reveal that the complexes are retained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C, left panels). To test whether the p105·p50-NLS complex shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, HeLa cells were treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), and the subsequent changes in localization were monitored. LMB treatment does not appear to alter the localization of the p105·p50-NLS or the IκBγ·p50-NLS complexes (Fig. 4 C, right panels), implying that these complexes do not shuttle. This result is in contrast to that observed for IκBα·NF-κB complexes where addition of the inhibitor confines both proteins within the nucleus (26Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the p105·NF-κB complexes seem to be similar to the IκBβ·NF-κB complexes, which are primarily cytoplasmic. Free p50-NLS, as expected, is localized within the nucleus (data not shown). To assess the possible role of the death domain and the C-terminal tail containing the destruction box in the cytoplasmic retention of NF-κBs, deletion mutants of both p105 and IκBγ were constructed. HeLa cells were co-transfected with p50 and various truncated forms of p105 or IκBγ. Subcellular localization of these complexes was monitored by immunofluorescence. As mentioned in the previous results section, the p105·p50 complex is cytoplasmic (Fig. 5 A,left panel). Removal of the last ∼100 residues, which includes the destruction box, p105ΔDB, did not alter the localization of the complex (Fig. 5 A, right panel). However, deletion of the C-terminal 171 residues (encompassing the death domain), p105ΔC, localizes the complex exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). These results suggest that the death domain of p105·IκBγ plays a role in the retention of NF-κB complexes within the cytoplasm. p50 is again retained in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with a truncated p105, p105ΔN (Fig. 1), where the N-terminal, DNA-binding immunoglobulin domain (residues 1–244) is deleted (Fig. 5 B,left panel). However, when both the N- and C-terminal domains (p105ΔNΔC) are deleted, these proteins localize to the nucleus (Fig. 5 B, right panel). Similar results were obtained with various deletion mutants of IκBγ. Co-expression of full-length IκBγ and p50 lead to cytoplasmic retention of the complex (Fig. 5 C, left panel). Deletion of the C terminus, IκBγΔC, leads to nuclear localization of both proteins (Fig. 5 C, right panel). Also, a shorter construct of IκBγ co"

MutT is a nucleoside triphosphatase that hydrolyzes all canonical nucleoside triphosphates with a preference for deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) and its oxidized form 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGTP). Inactivation of themutT gene increases the occurence of A:T → C:G transversion mutations in the E. coli genome due to the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP paired with adenine during DNA replication (3Sakumi K.

It has been proposed that Nudix hydrolases may be divided into subfamilies based on their major substrates: dinucleoside polyphosphates, ADP-ribose, NADH, nucleotide sugars, or ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (4Dunn C.A.

As all these substrates are either potentially toxic, cell signaling molecules, or metabolic intermediates whose concentrations require modulation during the cell cycle, it has been postulated that the role of Nudix hydrolases is to sanitize or regulate the accumulation of these metabolites (4Dunn C.A.

In this work, we report the cloning and characterization of AtNUDT1, the first characterized member of the Nudix family fromA. thaliana. Seeds of A. thaliana ecotype Columbia were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Columbus, OH. Oligonucleotide primers used in polymerase chain reaction were provided by the DNA Sequencing and Oligonucleotide Synthesis Service from the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Science. Enhanced reverse transcriptase-PCR kit, biochemicals, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma, and E. coli inorganic pyrophosphatase was obtained from Merck. pGEM-T Easy vector system I was supplied byPromega, and E. coli expression vector pQE31 and QIA-express kit type IV were purchased from Qiagen. Enzymes used in standard cloning procedures were obtained from Fermentas. Plants were grown in a greenhouse (standard conditions), and total RNA was isolated from 14-day-old seedlings using Tri Reagent from the Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, according to the procedure suggested by the supplier. The cDNA corresponding to the gene, assigned in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base as F14K14.13 from A. thaliana, coding 147 amino acids, was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the total RNA isolated from 14-day-old seedlings, using forward d(GGTACCGTCGACAGGAGAAGCGATA) and reversed d(CTGCAGTTAGTCTCCACCACCATGAGT) primers. The synthesized primers provided KpnI and PstI restriction sites at the start and at the end of the amplified AtNUDT1 cDNA, respectively. After amplification, the DNA was gel-purified and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector. The resulting pGEMAtNUDT1 construct was digested with KpnI and PstI, gel-purified, and inserted between the KpnI and PstI sites of the pQE31 vector. The resulting plasmid, pQE31AtNUDT1 (with the His-tag fusion upstream of the coding sequence), was used to transform E. coli M15 cells carrying the pREP4 repressor plasmid. The expression and purification of AtNUDT1 was performed according to the Qiagen procedure. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicilin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. After overnight growth at 37 °C, 2. 5 ml of the culture was transferred to 50 ml of LB medium (with antibiotics) and grown to an A 600 of 0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm and the cells were incubated for another 3 h, harvested, washed with an isotonic saline buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The cells were subsequently lysed by five consecutive freeze/thaw cycles with freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature, cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate (1 ml) was mixed with 0. 25 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, with gentle shaking. The lysate-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was loaded onto a column and washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer, then the protein was eluted four times with 0.5 ml of elution buffer. All the buffers were prepared according to the Qiagen handbook. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing pure protein were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a Microcon membrane YM-10 (Millipore). The amount of protein was estimated by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of substrates was assayed colorimetrically. 50 μl of the standard reaction mixture contained: 50 mm Tris, pH 7. 0, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm substrate, 1–2 units of alkaline phosphatase or inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0. 2–2 milliunits of AtNUDT1 protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 20 mm EDTA. The resulting inorganic ortophosphate was determined using the method of Ames and Dubin (41Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Bhatnagar et al. (13Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

Plasmids pQE31 and pQE31AtNUDT1 were transformed into E. coli mutT strain EC5976 (pro, thi Δ (lac, ara) F' lacZ101, pro) mutT, and tested for complementation of an E. coli mutT mutator phenotype using protocols described elsewhere (42Miller J.H. Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-200Google Scholar). Fast performance liquid chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 column. The proteins were eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. 200-μl fractions were collected, and their enzymatic activities were measured as described above. Prior to ESI-MS analysis, a purified protein sample was loaded onto a Vydac C18 HPLC column and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient to remove excess salt. Samples were then injected directly into a Q-Tof1 spectrometer (Micromass) at 4 μl/min using a Hamilton syringe pump. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was used as an internal mass standard. Positive ion spectra were obtained for the eluted protein, and the MaxEnt 1 program (Micromass) was used to deconvolute the spectra. To confirm the identity of the protein, the AtNUDT1 protein band was excised from a polyacrylamide gel, reduced, alkylated, digested overnight with trypsin, and tandem mass spectrometry of the tryptic digest was performed using the Q-Tof1 mass spectrometer (Micromass) combined with a nano-HPLC system (LC Packings). The MaxEnt3 program (Micromass) was used to identify the obtained peptide sequences that were then compared with the amino acid sequences predicted for the His-tagged AtNUDT1 protein. The enzymatic reaction products were analyzed using negative ion spectra. Calf intestine phosphatase was omitted for these analyses. The standards were dissolved in NH4OH/water/acetonitrile (20:40:40) to 1 mm concentration and immediately injected into the spectrometer. The enzyme reaction mixtures (2 μl) were diluted 100 times in NH4OH/water/acetonitrile (20:40:40) and used for injection. Masses were determined as for M-H ions. A search for the Arabidopsis homologue of the mutT gene in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base revealed eight open reading frames with the Nudix (MutT) domain. For further analysis, the F14K14.3 gene from chromosome 1 was selected. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length DNA, including one intron, for the F14K14.13 gene comprises 518 base pairs. It contains an open reading frame of 444 nucleotides coding for a 147-amino acid protein (Fig. 1) with a predicted molecular mass of 16,356.61 Da and pI 5.12 (43Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Link A.J. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocols. Humana Press, NJ1998: 531-553Google Scholar). A cDNA clone of the F14K14.13 gene (designated AtNUDT1) was obtained from A. thaliana total RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described under “Methods.” The hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein, AtNUDT1, was expressed in the E. coli M15 cells and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2). The approximate molecular mass on the SDS-PAGE was 19 kDa. Mass spectrometry was used as a more accurate method to determine the molecular mass of the recombinant protein. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to measure the precise mass of the purified hexahistidine-tagged AtNUDT1 protein. The obtained mass spectrum revealed microheterogeneity within the sample. The main peak of molecular mass 18,517.00 ± 1.8 Da was different from the calculated mass (18,502.9 Da). Two other low intensity components of 18,532.59 Da and 18,552.69 Da were also observed. To address this discrepancy, tandem mass spectrometry analysis for a tryptic digest of the AtNUDT1 protein was performed. The MS sequencing experiment confirmed the identity of the hexahistidine-tagged AtNUDT1 with 65% sequence coverage. The only modification in the observed tryptic peptides was methionine oxidation (Fig. 3). Thus, the +15 and +30 Da mass differences most probably result from the presence of one or two oxidized methionines of the five methionines present in the recombinant protein. This oxidation might be due to sample preparation for ESI-MS. The first attempt to characterize AtNUDT1 was to check whether this protein displayed MutT activity. Complementation of the E. coli mutT mutator phenotype was tested using an E. coli mutT strain devoid of its own 8-oxo-dGTPase activity and expressing the AtNUDT1 gene cloned into the pQE31 plasmid. The pQE31 vector with no insert was used as a control. Since the A. thaliana AtNUDT1 protein did not decrease the rate of the spontaneous mutations caused by the accumulation of 8-oxo-dGTP in the nucleotide pool, it was concluded that the AtNUDT1 was not functionally related to the MutT enzyme. Therefore, the purified protein was used for further characterization of specific substrates found for other Nudix hydrolases. A variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives were used as potential substrates (TableI). At the optimal pH of 7.0 and in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+, AtNUDT1 favored NADH while less efficiently hydrolyzing Ap4A. The rate of hydrolysis decreased 20-fold when NADH was substituted by NAD+. No significant activity was observed for Ap3A and ADP-ribose as substrates. No activity was observed for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (data not shown), which was consistent with the inability to complement the E. coli mutT mutation by AtNUDT1.Table ISubstrate specificity of At NUDT1SubstrateRelative activity%NADH100Ap4A24Ap3A11NAD+5ADP-ribose4All substrates were at a concentration of 2 mm and were assayed as described under “Methods.” A unit of enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min under optimal conditions. Open table in a new tab All substrates were at a concentration of 2 mm and were assayed as described under “Methods.” A unit of enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min under optimal conditions. The reaction products of NADH hydrolysis were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The reaction products contain two new molecules with molecular mass corresponding to NMNH (335.150 Da) and AMP (346.139 Da), indicating that AtNUDT1 acts as a NADH pyrophosphatase. AtNUDT1 has an optimal activity with NADH as a substrate, at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 5 mmMn2+. When the Mn2+ ions were substituted by the same concentration of Mg2+, an 85% decrease was observed in the catalytic activity. The kinetic parameters for the most and least favored substrates are presented in TableII. Although the K mfor NADH was nearly the same as for NAD+ (0. 36 and 0. 48 mm, respectively), the V max values differed considerably (12.7 units/mg and 0.62 units/mg, respectively).Table IIKinetic parameters for AtNUDT1SubstrateK mV maxK catK cat/K mmmunits/mgs −1s −1 m −1NADH0.36 ± 0.0512.7 ± 0.53.921.0 × 104NAD+0.48 ± 0.060.62 ± 0.060.190.4 × 103Substrates at a concentration from 0.1 to 3 mm were used for colorimetric measurements.

The K cat was calculated from theV max assuming one active site per monomer. A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min. FPLC analysis of AtNUDT1 protein was performed to investigate the structure of this enzyme. The active protein was found at around 36 kDa, suggesting that AtNUDT1 might form a dimer under native conditions (Fig. 5). In this report, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of AtNUDT1 protein, the first characterized member of Nudix hydrolases from A. thaliana, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of NADH to NMNH and AMP. The biological role of NADH pyrophosphatases is unclear; however, it has been postulated (26Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that NADH pyrophosphatase are involved in the regulation of the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, an important factor in maintaining a balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways in the cell. Jacobson and Kaplan (44Jacobson B.K. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 427-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the addition of a partially purified pigeon liver NADH pyrophosphatase to the assay increased the rate of ethanol oxidation catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase. The authors (44Jacobson B.K. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 427-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the NADH pyrophosphatase might play an intracellular regulatory role by changing the equilibrium of a particular metabolic pathway under specific conditions. Moreover, NADH pyrophosphatase is the only known source of NMNH in the cell. Thus, it may have a specialized physiological function, although the role of NMNH in the cell remains to be discovered. NADH pyrophosphatases were described for E. coli (26Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar),Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans (27Xu W.L. Dunn Ch. A. Bessman M.J. Biochem.

Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Twenty-five putative members of the NADH pyrophosphatase subfamily of Nudix hydrolases have been detected by a BLAST search in a variety of species, including Homo sapiens. They are characterized by the presence of an array of eight conserved amino acids (SQPWPFP) around 12 amino acids downstream of the Nudix box (27Xu W.L. Dunn Ch. A. Bessman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the analysis of amino acid sequences revealed that none of the eight members of the Nudix family from A. thaliana possesses the SQPWPFP consensus (Fig. 6). In this regard, the AtNUDT1 described here as a NADH pyrophosphatase resembles an open reading frame 186 hydrolase from E. coli, which has a substantial activity for NADH but also does not have the eight-amino acid consensus that predicts such an activity (7O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of NADH pyrophosphatase from A. thaliana resembles those described for enzymes from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and C. elegans (TableIII). The striking aspect of the specificity of these enzymes is the marked preference for NADH over NAD+. Similarly, the AtNUDT1 hydrolase favors NADH as a substrate with a 20-fold difference in the rate of hydrolysis of NADH over NAD+, with a V max similar to that of the S. cerevisiae protein and K msimilar to the value described for the E. coli hydrolase. The A. thaliana AtNUDT1 hydrolase differs from the enzyme purified from another plant, L. esculentum. The latter has a lower rate (1.5-fold) of NADH over NAD+ hydrolysis, a broader substrate specificity, a distinctly alkaline pH, and is monomeric. It is possible that the lentil hydrolase belongs to the Nudix family; however, the protein sequence is not yet known.Table IIIComparison of the catalytic properties of NADH pyrophosphatasesE. coliS. cerevisiae3-aFrom Frick and Bessman (26) and Xu et al.

The important common feature of NADH pyrophosphatases from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, andA. thaliana is the formation of homodimers. The other Nudix subfamily known to be dimeric is a family of the ADP-ribose pyrophposphatases. Recently, the crystal structure of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from E. coli was described (24Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a symmetric homodimer, requiring dimerization through domain swapping for substrate recognition and catalytic activity. It has been suggested that the Nudix motif is the binding and catalytic site for hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bonds, but the specificity for individual substrates lies outside this region. The segregation of the catalytic activity and substrate specificity provided the basis for the versatility of the Nudix hydrolases. The properties of the AtNUDT1 enzyme resemble those of the NADH hydrolases from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, andC. elegans; therefore, we propose the name NADH pyrophosphatase for the AtNUDT1 protein. The results presented extend the growing knowledge about the family of the Nudix hydrolases. Currently, we are investigating two other members of the Nudix family from A. thaliana.

In cultured myotubes, agrin stimulates the rapid phosphorylation of MuSK, leading to MuSK activation and tyrosine phosphorylation and clustering of acetylcholine receptors. Agrin, however, fails to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK that is force-expressed in myoblasts and fibroblasts, indicating that myotubes contain an additional activity that is required for agrin to stimulate MuSK. Certain glycosyltransferases are expressed selectively at synaptic sites in skeletal muscle, raising the possibility that carbohydrate modifications of MuSK, catalyzed by glycosyltransferases expressed selectively in myotubes, may be essential for agrin to bind and activate MuSK. We identifed two N-linked glycosylation sites in MuSK, and we expressed MuSK mutants lacking one or bothN-linked sites into MuSK mutant myotubes to determine whether N-linked carbohydrate modifications of MuSK have a role in MuSK activation. We found that N-linked glycosylation restrains ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and downstream signaling but is not necessary for agrin to stimulate MuSK.

Agrin, a heparansulfate proteoglycan that is synthesized by motor neurons and stably deposited into the synaptic basal lamina, plays a crucial role in the formation of neuromuscular synapses (3McMahan U.J.

Importantly, muscle-derived proteins, including acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), which are concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane of muscle in wild-type mice, are instead expressed uniformly in muscle of MuSK mutant mice (11DeChiara T.M.

Taken together with experiments showing that agrin can stimulate multiple aspects of postsynaptic differentiation in cultured myotubes (12Wallace B.G. J.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), these results indicate that agrin stimulation of MuSK leads to clustering of critical muscle-derived proteins, including AChRs, at synaptic sites (1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 4Wallace B.G.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which agrin activates MuSK, however, are poorly understood (1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 6Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Agrin stimulates the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK in myotubes, consistent with the idea that MuSK is a receptor, or a component of a receptor complex for agrin. Nonetheless, MuSK, forced-expressed in fibroblasts or myoblasts, is not phosphorylated by agrin (9Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K.

These results, together with a failure to detect binding between recombinant agrin and recombinant MuSK in vitro, indicate that additional components, which are expressed in myotubes and not in myoblasts or fibroblasts, are essential for agrin to activate MuSK (9Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The additional myotube-specific component(s) are not known but could include: 1) a membrane protein that binds agrin and acts as a bona fide agrin receptor; 2) a co-ligand that acts with agrin to bind and activate MuSK; or 3) post-translational modifications of MuSK that allow agrin to bind directly to MuSK (14Burden S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter possibility, certain glycosyltransferases are expressed selectively at synaptic sites in skeletal muscle (15Scott L.J. Balsamo J. Sanes J.R. Lilien J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 346-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the concentration of certain carbohydrate epitopes, attached to proteins, at neuromuscular synapses (17Scott L.J. Bacou F. Sanes J.R. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 932-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the sites of carbohydrate modification on MuSK and whether carbohydrate modification might be essential for agrin to activate MuSK. We identifed twoN-linked carbohydrate attachment sites on MuSK and found that these N-linked sites are dispensable for agrin to activate MuSK. Carbohydrate addition, however, restrains ligand-independent MuSK activity, because mutation of bothN-linked sites increases the level of agrin-independent MuSK phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in AChR tyrosine phosphorylation and clustering. The generation of MuSK mutant muscle cell lines has been described previously (18Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MuSKmutant myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract, 20 units/ml recombinant mouse interferon-γ (Invitrogen), and gentamycin at 33 °C and induced to differentiate as myotubes by growing the cells at 39 °C in medium lacking chick embryo extract and interferon-γ (18Herbst R.

Recombinant retrovirus was produced by transfecting Bosc 23 cells with the pBabe/puro plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant MuSK, as described previously (18Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Myoblasts, at ∼50% confluency, were infected with retrovirus and selected subsequently in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Myotubes were stimulated with 100 nm recombinant agrin (R&D Systems) or treated with 0.1 units/ml NA for 16 h. AChRs were labeled by staining with Texas Red-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) for one h. Myotubes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min, washed, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and viewed at 630× with a Zeiss Axioskop. The number of AChR clusters was determined, and the number of AChR clusters per field was calculated. Myotubes were serum-starved for several hours before stimulation with agrin (30 min) or NA (2 h). Myotubes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation, and antibodies to MuSK, together with Protein A-agarose, or biotin-coupled α-bungarotoxin and streptavidin-agarose were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and washed four times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation, MuSK expression, and AChR β-subunit expression were detected by probing Western blots with monoclonal antibody 4G10, polyclonal antibodies to MuSK (20Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6467-6473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal antibody to the AChR β-subunit (mAb124, gift of J. Lindstrom, University of Pennsylvania), respectively. Antibody binding was visualized with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and x-ray films were scanned with a densitometer (BioRad). MuSK was immunoprecipitated from Torpedo californica electric organ (Winckler Enterprises, San Pedro, CA), as described previously (19Watty A. Neubauer G. Dreger M. Zimmer M. Wilm M. Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4585-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MuSK was immunoprecipitated from myotubes as described above. Two units of N-glycosidase F (in 20–30 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) were added to the washed protein A-agarose beads; after 24 h at 37 °C, an additional two units of N-glycosidase F were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 24 h. Immunoprecipitated MuSK was digested with NA (50 milliunits in 50 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 4.5) for 48 h at 37 °C. MuSK was immunoprecipitated fromTorpedo electric organ with antibodies to MuSK, and the single immunoprecipitate, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, was divided and fractionated in different lanes of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% polyacrylamide). Individual lanes from a Western blot were probed with DIG-labeled lectins, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biosciences), and the bound DIG-lectin was visualized with HRP-coupled antibodies to DIG (Roche Molecular Biosciences) and ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ImmunoprecipitatedTorpedo MuSK was treated with NA or N-glycosidase F, and the digested immunoprecipitates were divided and fractionated in different lanes of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel; Western blots were probed either with DIG-labeled lectins or antibodies to MuSK. In a first step to determine whether MuSK is glycosylated, we isolated membranes fromTorpedo electric organ, a rich source of synaptic proteins, including MuSK. MuSK was immunoprecipitated from nonionic detergent lysates, and proteins in the immunoprecipitate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were probed with DIG-labeled lectins and HRP-coupled antibodies to DIG (Fig. 1 A). This analysis reveals that Maackia amurensis agglutinin, a lectin that recognizes terminal sialic acid attached to galactose in an α2→3 linkage (22Wang W.C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), a lectin that recognizes terminal galactose attached to GlcNac in a β1→4 linkage (23Crowley J.F. Goldstein I.J. Arnarp J. Lonngren J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), bind to MuSK (Fig. 1 A). Other lectins, such as Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), which recognizes high-mannose structures inN-linked glycans, peanut agglutinin (PNA), which recognizes the core disaccharide in O-glycans after removal of terminal sugar residues, Sambucuc nigraagglutinin (SNA), which recognizes terminal sialic acid attached to galactose in an α2→6 linkage and VVA, which binds terminal GalNac, do not bind to MuSK (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). These results demonstrate that MuSK bears carbohydrate structures that are complex but not of the high-mannose type. The specificity of MAA binding was further demonstrated by treating immunoprecipitated MuSK with NA, a glycosidase that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with NA abolishes MAA binding to MuSK, while leaving DSA binding unimpaired (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, NA treatment does not expose binding sites for GNA, PNA, SNA, or VVA (data not shown). Because PNA recognizes the core of O-linked carbohydrate structures after removal of terminal sugar residues, the lack of PNA binding in NA-digested MuSK does not support the presence of O-linked carbohydrates in MuSK. We next sought to determine whether the carbohydrates recognized by MAA and DSA are linked to asparagine (N-linked) or to serine/threonine (O-linked) residues. To distinguish between these possibilities, we treated immunoprecipitated MuSK withN-glycosidase F, which removes the entire carbohydrate structure from N-linked sites and converts the asparagine into an aspartate residue (Fig. 1 C).N-Glycosidase F treatment results both in a shift in the molecular weight of MuSK, revealed by probing Western blots with antibodies to MuSK (Fig. 1 C), and in a loss of MAA and DSA binding, demonstrating that the recognized carbohydrates are linked to MuSK via asparagine residues (Fig. 1 C). We next sought to determine whether the same carbohydrate structures are present on mammalian MuSK. The substantially lower abundance of MuSK in skeletal muscle, compared with that in Torpedo electric organ, made it difficult to analyze the carbohydrates attached to mammalian MuSK by probing Western blots with lectins. Therefore, we determined whether digestion of MuSK with N-glycosidase F or NA caused a shift in molecular weight, as observed in MuSK isolated from Torpedo electric organ. We immunoprecipitated MuSK from C2 myotubes, digested MuSK withN-glycosidase F or NA and probed Western blots with antibodies to MuSK (Fig. 1 D). Incubation withN-glycosidase F or NA caused a shift in the molecular weight of mammalian MuSK, similar to that observed with TorpedoMuSK, indicating that carbohydrate structures had been removed (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, these results demonstrate that mammalian MuSK bears N-linked carbohydrate, including sialic acid, and imply that glycosylation of mouse MuSK is not fundamentally different from glycosylation of Torpedo MuSK. Two consensusN-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-X-(Ser/Thr); (X = any amino acid, except Pro), are conserved in the extracellular domain of MuSK from fish, avian, amphibian, and mammals (Asn-222 and Asn-338 in rat MuSK) (7Jennings C.G.

Asn-222 is located between the second and third Ig-like domains, and Asn-338 is within the C6 box, located between the third and fourth Ig-like domains (Fig. 2 A). A third consensusN-linked glycosylation site is present in avian, amphibian, and rat MuSK (Asn-459 in rat MuSK) but absent in fish and human MuSK; in rat MuSK, Asn-459 is located within an insert, produced by alternative splicing, between the fourth Ig-like domain and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 2 A). We mutated the three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites in rat MuSK, either individually or in combination, and stably expressed the MuSK mutants in MuSK-deficient muscle cells (18Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated MuSK from the muscle cell lines and probed Western blots of the immunoprecipitate with antibodies to MuSK (Fig. 2 B). A MuSK double mutant (N222Q/N338Q), lacking the two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites, migrates more rapidly than wild-type MuSK in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that one or both of the two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-222 and Asn-338, are glycosylated in vivo. We were unable to distinguish between these two possibilities or to determine whether Asn-459 is a carbohydrate attachment site, because the three single mutants (N222Q, N338Q, or N459Q) lacking only one of the three consensus glycosylation sites, migrate similar to wild-type MuSK in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Moreover, a MuSK triple mutant (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q), lacking all three consensus sites, migrates similar to the MuSK double mutant (N222Q/N338Q) in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). We next sought to determine whether Asn-222, Asn-338, and Asn-459 are required for agrin to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation. We treated muscle cell lines, stably expressing wild-type or mutant MuSK, with agrin for 30 min, immunoprecipitated MuSK and probed Western blots with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. Following agrin stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type MuSK increases more than 10-fold (Fig. 3, A and B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the MuSK double mutant (N222Q/N338Q) or the MuSK triple mutant (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) is similarly stimulated by agrin (Fig. 3, A and B and data not shown). In the absence of agrin stimulation, however, tyrosine phosphorylation of the double and triple mutants is elevated (2- to 3-fold) relative to wild-type MuSK (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that N-linked carbohydrate addition is not essential for agrin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK but that glycosylation restrains MuSK activation, possibly by limiting ligand-independent dimerization. Agrin activation of MuSK leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR β- and δ-subunits (13Wallace B.G., Qu, Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 26Mittaud P. Marangi P.A. Erb-Vogtli S. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR are poorly understood and could, in principle, require glycosylation of MuSK. We treated myotubes expressing wild-type or mutant forms of MuSK with agrin for 30 min, isolated AChRs with α-bungarotoxin, and probed Western blots with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. We found that the AChR β-subunit is tyrosine-phosphorylated similarly in agrin-treated myotubes expressing either wild-type, double mutant (N222Q/N338Q), or triple mutant (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) MuSK (Fig. 3, C andD and data not shown). Therefore, N-linked glycosylation of MuSK is not essential for agrin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of AChRs. The extracellular domain of MuSK is thought to have an important role in the clustering of synaptic proteins, including AChRs (27Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether N-linked glycosylation of MuSK is required for agrin to stimulate clustering of AChRs. We treated myotubes expressing wild-type or mutant forms of MuSK with agrin, and we determined the number of AChR clusters that formed 8–16 h later. We found that the number of AChR clusters is similar in agrin-treated myotubes expressing either wild-type, double mutant (N222Q/N338Q), or triple mutant (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) MuSK (Fig. 4). Thus, N-linked glycosylation of MuSK is not required for agrin to stimulate AChR clustering. We next asked whether the increase in agrin-independent MuSK phosphorylation, found in myotubes expressing the double (N222Q/N338Q) or triple (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) MuSK mutant (Fig. 3, A andB) leads to an increase in the level of AChR tyrosine phosphorylation and clustering. The basal level of AChR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D) and clustering (Fig. 4) is indeed elevated in myotubes expressing MuSK N222Q/N338Q or MuSK N222Q/N338Q/N459Q. These data support the idea thatN-linked carbohydrate structures bearing terminal sialic acid minimize spontaneous MuSK activation and signal transduction. Because mutation of single asparagine residues in MuSK fails to increase MuSK phosphorylation (data not shown) and downstream signaling (Fig. 4), these data support the idea that both Asn-222 and Asn-338 function as N-linked carbohydrate-attachment sites but that glycosylation of either site is sufficient to restrain adventitious MuSK activation. Previous studies have shown that NA treatment of wild-type myotubes increases the level of MuSK and AChR tyrosine phosphorylation and AChR clustering, indicating that removal of sialic acid residues from MuSK or from other proteins expressed in skeletal muscle increases tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and MuSK signaling (28Martin P.T. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 743-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 21: 436-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Grow W.A. Gordon H. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 299: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we compared the level of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, AChR tyrosine phosphorylation, and clustering in 1) NA-treated myotubes expressing wild-type MuSK; 2) myotubes expressing glycosylation-deficient MuSK mutants; and 3) NA-treated myotubes expressing glycosylation-deficient MuSK mutants. We found that MuSK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, Aand B) and MuSK-dependent signaling, assessed by AChR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D) and AChR clustering (Fig. 4), were similarly elevated in untreated myotubes expressing the MuSK mutants (MuSK N222Q/N338Q and MuSK N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) and in NA-treated myotubes expressing wild-type MuSK. Moreover, NA treatment of myotubes expressing the MuSK double (N222Q/N338Q) or triple (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) mutant failed to further increase the level of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, AChR tyrosine phosphorylation, or AChR clustering (Figs. 3 and 4). These results indicate that NA increases tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and MuSK-dependent signaling by removing sialic acid from from Asn-222 and Asn-338 in MuSK rather than by removing sialic acid from other muscle proteins. MuSK has three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites, and two of these sites are conserved in MuSK from all classes. Mutation of the two conserved glycosylation sites leads to an increase in MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, AChR tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. Because mutation of either site alone does not increase MuSK activation and signaling, our data are consistent with the idea that glycosylation at either site is sufficient to minimize adventitious MuSK activation. Although these data are compatible with the possibility that both sites serve as glycosylation attachment sites, it is also possible that one of the two N-linked sites serves as the primary glycosylation site, but that an alternative, second site can be used if the primary site is not available. This latter idea is consistent with experiments showing that the double, but not the single MuSK mutants migrate more rapidly than wild-type MuSK in SDS-PAGE. Because the double (N222Q/N338Q) and triple (N222Q/N338Q/N459Q) MuSK mutants migrate similarly in SDS-PAGE and induce similar numbers of AChR clusters, and because the Asn-459 glycosylation site is not conserved in human and Torpedo, our data favor the idea that Asn-459 does not function as aN-linked glycosylation site. The lectins tested in our experiments fail to bind to MuSK afterN-linked carbohydrates were removed byN-glycosidase F, indicating that the recognized carbohydrates are not O-linked to MuSK. Nonetheless, it is possible that other carbohydrate structures, which are not recognized by these lectins, are attached to MuSK through O-linked sites. Thus, although our experiments do not demonstrate the presence of O-linked glycans on MuSK, we cannot rule out this possibility. Attachment of carbohydrates to the consensus N-linked sites in MuSK is not required for agrin to activate MuSK and to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and clustering of AChRs. These data are inconsistent with the idea that cell-type differences in MuSK glycosylation account for the inability of agrin to activate MuSK in fibroblasts and myoblasts. The increase in MuSK activation and signaling found in myotubes expressing glycosylation-deficient MuSK mutants is comparable with the level of MuSK activation and signaling found in NA-treated myotubes expressing wild-type MuSK. Moreover, NA is ineffective in further increasing MuSK signaling in myotubes expressing glycosylation-deficient MuSK mutants. These results indicate that NA increases MuSK signaling in wild-type myotubes by removing sialic acid from MuSK. Our experiments, however, do not exclude the possibility that NA also acts on other proteins that exert an inhibitory effect on MuSK. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation often causes defects in the trafficking of RTKs, including kinase insert receptor/flk-1, flt-1, and the insulin receptor (32Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Collier E. Carpentier J.L. Beitz L. Carol H. Taylor S.I. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), resulting in a failure of these RTKs to accumulate at the cell surface. MuSK glycosylation mutants, however, are expressed at the cell surface, because mutants lacking individual or multiple N-linked glycosylation sites are tyrosine-phosphorylated by agrin stimulation. Moreover, in the absence of agrin, expression of double or triple mutants leads to an increase in AChR clustering at the cell surface. Thus,N-linked glycosylation of MuSK is neither required to stably express MuSK at the cell surface nor to activate MuSK by agrin. It remains possible, however, that MuSK glycosylation mutants are transported to the cell surface less efficiently than wild-type MuSK or that these mutants are less stable at the cell surface. The suppression of ligand-independent activation by N-linked glycosylation is a feature that MuSK shares with other RTKs.N-Glycosylation of TrkA (34Watson F.L. Porcionatto M.A. Bhattacharyya A. Stiles C.D. Segal R.A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), insulin receptor (35Elleman T.C. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. McKern N.M. Cosgrove L. Hewish D.R. Jachno K.M. Bentley J.D. Sankovich S.E. Ward C.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor receptor (36Tsuda T. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21988-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suppresses ligand-independent activation of these RTKs. In TrkA, even partial deglycosylation is sufficient to cause ligand-independent TrkA phosphorylation, resulting in the recruitment of Shc and phospholipase C-γ (34Watson F.L. Porcionatto M.A. Bhattacharyya A. Stiles C.D. Segal R.A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation, however, is not necessarily linked to inhibtion of RTKs, because N-linked glycosylation can induce conformational changes that lead to ligand-independent RTK dimerization and activation (37Fernandes H. Cohen S. Bishayee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5375-5383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which N-linked glycosylation restrains tyrosine kinase activity are poorly understood, glycosylation may minimize spontaneous dimerization simply by steric hindrance or by electrostatic repulsion and thereby inhibit trans-phosphorylation (38Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In COS cells, however, the low level of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation is not further increased by NA treatment (39Borges L.S. Ferns M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus,N-glycosylation may not inhibit MuSK activation by a simple steric or electrostatic mechanism. In the epidermal growth factor receptor (40Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), attached carbohydrate interacts with glycosphingolipids, and the epidermal growth factor receptor-ganglioside complex minimizes spontaneous epidermal growth factor receptor dimerization. By analogy, carbohydrate attached to MuSK may interact with glycolipids or with other glycoproteins either in the plasma membrane or in the extracellular matrix, and such interactions may minimize spontaneous MuSK dimerization. Because these interactions may be cell type-specific, it is possible that such interactions mediate inhibition of MuSK in muscle cells but not in COS cells. In this regard, other groups have suggested that NA and α-galactosidase induce AChR clusters by unmasking subterminal Galβ-1→3-GalNac and Galβ-1→4-GalNac (CT carbohydrate) in proteins within the extracellular matrix. Consistent with this idea, CT carbohydrate is concentrated at neuromuscular synapses, and addition of either disaccharide to cultured muscle cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and clustering of AChRs (41Parkhomovskiy N. Kammesheidt A. Martin P.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 380-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Martin P.T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 1R-7RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, agrin can stimulate MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation in non-muscle cells if these cells also express the CT carbohydrate, implicating the CT carbohydrate as a potential co-factor in agrin-induced MuSK activation, similar to that for heparin in fibroblast growth factor-induced fibroblast growth factor receptor activation (43Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results favor a model in which the interaction between the N-linked carbohydrates on MuSK and other carbohydrates, possibly the Galβ-1→3-GalNac and Galβ-1→4-GalNac structures of the CT carbohydrate, regulate activation of MuSK. Such an interaction could mediate MuSK inhibition, partially relieved by removal of either the CT carbohydrate or MuSK glycosylation and fully relieved by agrin-binding, resulting in maximal MuSK activation.

A veritable plethora of these compounds exhibit structural modifications such as N-methylated peptide bonds. The natural cyclosporins are products of cyclosporin synthetase (CySyn),1 a very complex high molecular mass (1.7-MDa) single polypeptide chain nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (1Lawen A.

The nonribosomal biosynthetic assembly of cyclosporins proceeds via a protein template-driven mechanism (12Dittmann J. Wenger R.M. Kleinkauf H. Lawen A. J. Biol.

CySyn catalyzes a total of 40 reactions in the synthesis of the cycloundecapeptide product (1Lawen A. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11355-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lawen A. Prog. Med. Chem. 1996; 33: 53-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,12Dittmann J. Wenger R.M. Kleinkauf H. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CySyn is composed of 11 conserved modules, which are each arranged into functional domains that catalyze the activation, modification, and polymerization of the constituent amino acids of the peptide product (15Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6163-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Stachelhaus T. Schneider A.

Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The order of these semiautonomous modules is co-linear with the sequence of the peptide product (14Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 561-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The fundamental module unit consists of catalytic domains responsible for substrate amino acid activation (A-domain), thiolation (T-domain, synonymous with peptidyl carrier protein), and condensation (C-domain) (19Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Together, these domains form the functional NRPS repeating unit, which represents the minimal domain set necessary for peptide elongation. Often these modules carry an additional modification domain of ∼430 amino acids between the A- and T-domains. Functional and sequence analyses have indicated that this region represents an N-methyltransferase (N-MTase) function in CySyn (1Lawen A. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11355-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dittmann J. Wenger R.M. Kleinkauf H. Lawen A. J. Biol.

In the process of nonribosomal peptide assembly, activation of the substrate amino acid occurs at the A-domain through the generation of a transient aminoacyl adenylate that is in turn covalently attached via a thioester linkage to the thiol of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl prosthetic cofactor of the T-domain in the respective module (18Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Stachelhaus T. Hüser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The peptide is elongated in a linear NH2- to COOH-terminal direction with successive rounds of trans-thiolations andtrans-peptidations between each activated amino acid facilitated by the interplay of 4′-phosphopantetheinyl internal carriers. This sequence of events is repeated in a stepwise fashion until the consummation of peptide assembly. In the case of cyclosporin synthesis, release of the full-length peptide ensues via cyclization. Prokaryotic NRPSs usually employ a thioesterase domain (TE-domain) situated at the extreme COOH terminus of the last module (24Trauger J.W. Kohli R.M. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Walsh C.T. Nature. 2000; 407: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25de Ferra F. Rodriguez F. Tortora O. Tosi C. Grandi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25304-25309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas most fungal NRPSs, such as CySyn, utilize a unique COOH-terminal C-domain for cyclization and release of the mature peptide (26Keating T.A. Ehmann D.E. Kohli R.M. Marshall C.G. Trauger J.W. Walsh C.T. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CySyn contains four basic C-A-T modules (modules 1, 6, 9, and 11); the other seven modules (modules 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10) display the additional N-MTase domain insert between the A- and T-domains (Fig. 1) (18Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Whereas analysis of the mechanism of action of the domains forming the catalytic triad has progressed well during recent years, characterization of the modification domains, and especially the N-MTase domain, is still in its infancy. Methyltransferases (MTases) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from the ubiquitous cofactorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or carbon atoms of a range of small molecules and macromolecular species (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). These enzymes can be divided into families according to four major substrate classes, protein, RNA, DNA, and small molecule (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). The N-MTase domains of NRPS catalyze the bimolecular transfer of the S-methyl group of AdoMet to the α-nitrogen of the thioesterified amino acid, releasingS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine as a reaction product (Fig. 1) (1Lawen A. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11355-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dittmann J. Wenger R.M. Kleinkauf H. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, theseN-MTase domains can be assigned as small molecule MTases. Most AdoMet-dependent MTases have a bilobial structure and are organized into an AdoMet binding domain, which provides cofactor binding contacts and catalytic residues, and a second domain mainly responsible for conferring substrate specificity (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the poor overall sequence identity across AdoMet-dependent MTases and varied substrate specificity, these enzymes display a structurally conserved cofactor-binding domain termed the “AdoMet-binding fold” (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar, 28Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, a structural conservation of the mode of cofactor binding is observed across most structurally defined members of this superfamily; this has led to the delineation of a set of consensus AdoMet binding interactions (28Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In most AdoMet-dependent MTases, the AdoMet binding region is constructed from a set of noncontiguous sequence elements. The low overall level of sequence identity across MTases has complicated the assignment of specific motifs to AdoMet binding. Kagan and Clarke (30Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) defined a set of three conserved sequence motifs, which are apparent in most non-nucleic acid MTases (Fig. 2). Subsequently, a structure-guided sequence alignment of several structurally characterized AdoMet-dependent MTases revealed, motifs I and II participate directly in cofactor binding, whereas motif III serves a structural role, forming the core of β-strand 5 of the AdoMet-binding fold (Fig. 2) (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). More importantly, this comparison indicated that the key residues governing the interactions with the cofactor molecule are localized within four motifs, I–IV (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper, we shall adopt the AdoMet binding motif nomenclature as defined by Faunam et al. (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar). In most MTases, these motifs occur in the same linear order and are separated by similar intervals in the polypeptide (27Faunam E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar, 30Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made toward the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of various protein and DNA methyltransferases, the assignment of unambiguous, specific amino acid sequence motifs to AdoMet binding and catalysis of N-methylation have not been established for NRPS. We have previously demonstrated that [methyl-14C]AdoMet can be utilized to directly photolabel the N-MTase domains of CySyn in a highly specific manner. 2Velkov, T., and Lawen, A. (2003)Photochem. Photobiol., in press.2Velkov, T., and Lawen, A. (2003)Photochem. Photobiol., in press. In this study, stochiometric photoaffinity labeling demonstrated that CySyn is photolabeled with AdoMet in a molar ratio of ∼7:1 (AdoMet/CySyn), which is in good agreement with the seven N-MTase domains identified in the CySyn cDNA sequence. The specificity of photolabeling was demonstrated by competitive displacement by unlabeled AdoMet and its congeners S-adenosyl-l-ethionine,S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and sinefungin. Photolabeling was only tenable with native CySyn and was not detected with denatured enzyme or with proteins, which do not bind AdoMet. The photolabeling of the AdoMet binding sites displayed homotropic negative cooperativity, characterized by a curvilinear Scatchard plot with upward concavity. Here we have employed a combination of classical photoaffinity labeling and peptide mapping techniques to define the specific amino acid sequences involved in the cofactor interaction. We also present a three-dimensional homology model of the cofactor binding interaction with the N-MTase domains of CySyn. The proposed bimolecular interaction model provides a satisfactory structure-function rationale for the photoaffinity labeling data and conforms agreeably to homologous cofactor interactions defined from structurally characterized AdoMet-dependent MTases. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a structure-related characterization of the N-MTase domains of a NRPS. Due to the high degree of sequence identity conserved across NRPS, the information garnered from this study can be generalized to all NRPS family members expressing an N-MTase function. S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine ([methyl-14C]AdoMet; 58 mCi/mmol) andS-adenosyl-l-[carboxyl-14C]methionine ([carboxyl-14C]AdoMet; 60 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bmt and cyclosporin A were donated by Dr. R. Traber (Novartis Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). All other chemicals used were from Sigma or Merck and of the highest purity commercially available. Flat bottom microtiter plates were purchased from NUNC (Roskilide, Denmark). Tolypocladium inflatum Syn.Beauveria nivea, strain 7939/45 was donated by Dr. M. Dreyfuss (Novartis) and cultured as previously described (32Lawen A. Traber R. Geyl D. Zocher R. Kleinkauf H. J. Antibiot. 1989; 42: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CySyn was purified to near homogeneity as described earlier (1Lawen A. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11355-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications to the protocol. 25 g of lyophilized mycelium was ground to a fine powder and extracted with 500 ml of buffer A (200 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 150 ml of 2 m KCl; 40 ml of 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7, 10 mm dithioerythritol, 40% (w/v) glycerol) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C. Nuclear material was precipitated from the supernatant with 0.3% polyethyleneimine and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The protein precipitated between 30 and 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 was collected by centrifugation and resolubilized in buffer B (100 ml of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 40 ml 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 4 mm dithioerythritol). The protein suspension was resolved by gel filtration on Fractogel EMD BioSEC, pore size 0.2–0.4 mm (Merck). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated. Aliquots (1 ml) of the concentrate were loaded onto a 50–25% (w/v) stabilized glycerol gradient in buffer C (0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mmdithioerythritol). The samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation, first for 6 h at 10,000 rpm and subsequently for an additional 48 h at 22,000 rpm. Active fractions are pooled and once again subjected to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, yielding fractions of CySyn of electrophoretic purity (Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining). Two-dimensional high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) of peptide digests was performed according to Pataki (33Pataki G. Chromatogr. Rev. 1967; 9: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For developing the chromatograms, butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) (solvent A) was used in the first dimension, and phenol/water (75:25) (solvent B) was used in the second dimension (33Pataki G. Chromatogr. Rev. 1967; 9: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Amino acid standards were detected with ninhydrin reagent (0.3% in acetone); for development, the chromatogram was sprayed and heated at 60 °C for 20 min. The radiolabeled material was visualized by autoradiography, and the developed film was in turn superimposed onto the ninhydrin-stained HPTLC sheet to allow for correlation with the position of amino acid standards. Where specified, material was scraped from the plates and analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESIMS). Samples of CySyn preparations were incubated together with 0.25 μCi of [14C]AdoMet in a 96-well microtiter plate precooled on ice and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h prior to photoirradiation. Photolabeling was induced by irradiation of the reaction mixture at 4 °C for 15 min with short wave ultraviolet (254 nm). For large scale preparative photolabeling, 2-mg samples of CySyn were photolabeled with [14C]AdoMet. The photolabeled protein was first partially digested by incubation with sequencing grade modified trypsin or chymotrypsin (Sigma) at a protease/substrate ratio of 1:125 (w/w) at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog no. P2714) and an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The resultant fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and photolabeled fragments were visualized by phosphorimaging. The apparent molecular masses of the photolabeled fragments were determined by comparison with the mobility of molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). Prominent photolabeled bands generated from the partial tryptic and chymotryptic digests of ∼56 and ∼60 kDa, respectively, were excised from dried gels using the phosphor image as a template. They were rehydrated with 300 μl of elution buffer (0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS) and finely crushed. The labeled protein was passively eluted from the macerated gel pieces into 5 ml of elution buffer for 3 days with agitation. The eluent was separated from the gel by centrifugation to prevent the protein from reentering the gel. The elution was repeated three times to maximize the recovery of protein from the gel. The eluents were filtered with a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Pall Gelman Sciences, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) and combined, and the protein was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone at −20 °C overnight to concentrate and remove excess SDS. The protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in digestion buffer (0.1m NH4HCO3, 2 m urea, pH 8.0). To ensure complete reaction, the radiolabeled protein fragment was reduced by incubation with 45 mm dithiothreitol at 55 °C for 30 min, the mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The mixture was then incubated for 30 min in the dark to alkylate the cysteinyl thiol groups. The protein fragment was then exhaustively digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin 1:25 (w/w) for 2 days at 37 °C. After 4 and 20 h of incubation, the initial amount of protease was added again to the reaction. Preparative purification of the photolabeled tryptic peptides was achieved by several successive reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) runs. The digested sample was dried, resuspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a Zorbax 300-Å C18 column (3.5 μm; 4.6 mm × 250 mm; Agilent Technologies, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent C) and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent D). The peptides were eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 80% solvent D in 80 min at a constant flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 214 nm, fractions were collected, and aliquots of each fraction were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactive peak fractions were dried and reconstituted in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and rechromatographed. The purified radioactive peptide fractions from successive runs were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Purified [14C]AdoMet-modified peptides were also digested with pronase in 100 mm triethanolammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, for 12 h at 37 °C. The mixture was then boiled, eluted through a Sephadex G-25 M column, and concentrated. The concentrate was redissolved and digested for another 12 h at 25 °C with carboxypeptidase Y (400 μg/ml) in 100 mmtriethanolammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The digestion mixture was then boiled, eluted through a Sephadex G-25 M column, and concentrated. The concentrate was subjected to another round of proteolysis with proteinase K in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 12 h at 37 °C. The digest was eluted through a Sephadex G-25 M column, dried and redissolved in 60 μl of water, and resolved by HPTLC. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed on a ProciseTM (Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) protein sequencer. Sequencing was performed at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility. The dissolved peptide sample was applied onto a precycled Biobrene-treated trifluoroacetic acid glass fiber disk (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to cycles of Edman degradation following a modified pulse-liquid protocol. Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative mass values were derived from a correlation of chromatographic peak heights of the PTH-derivatives released with each cycle with a standard 10-pmol mixture of the 20 proteogenic amino acids (Applied Biosystems). The theoretical initial yield and repetitive yield were calculated from linear least squares analysis of the semilogarithmic plot of the quantity (pmol) of PTH-derivative released with each cycleversus the cycle number. The low yielding residues Ser, Thr, and Trp were omitted from the analysis. An aliquot of the PTH-derivatives released from each cycle was counted for 14C radioactivity; the remainder of the material was injected into the on-line HPLC PTH-derivative analysis system for identification. Mass values of purified photolabeled proteolytic peptides and modified amino acids were determined on a Micromass (Manchester, UK) Platform II liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system. Protein was determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (prepared from fraction V, globulin-free; Sigma). The sequence alignment of the seven N-methyltransferase domains of CySyn was performed using ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of CySyn (accession number Z28383) was retrieved from the EMBL nucleotide/protein sequence data base. A structural model of the AdoMet binding site of the N-MTase domain of module 8 (N-MET M8) of CySyn was constructed using the experimental structure of catechol-O-methyltransferase (RCSB Protein Data Bank www.rcsb.org/pdb; PDB ID-1VID) as the modeling template. The model was constructed using the Swiss-Model and Deep-Viewer environment (36Peitsch M.C. Wells T.N.C. Stampf D.R. Sussman J.L. Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1972238298,"Antithrombin (AT) is a major plasma protease inhibitor with three intramolecular disulfide bonds, and its deficiency is associated with increased venous thrombosis. Recently, we found a novel missense mutation named ATMorioka (C95R), which causes the loss of one of the three disulfide bonds. In this study, we prepared Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing wild type or mutant AT and examined the intracellular fate of the ATs. In pulse-chase experiments, newly synthesized wild type AT was secreted into the medium with a half-life of ∼1.5 h. In contrast, most of the mutant type AT was not secreted during the chase period of 9 h and, surprisingly, was not degraded in the cells. The kinetics of the secretion suggests that the mutant was secreted about 50 times more slowly into the medium. Most of the mutant AT in the cells had high mannose type oligosaccharides, suggesting that it was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, half of the mutant AT existed in a dimeric form with an intermolecular disulfide bond. On immunoelectron microscopy, the mutant AT was found to have accumulated in variously sized structures surrounded by a single membrane in the cytoplasm. Immunogold particles exhibiting calnexin immunoreactivity were detected on the membranes. Ribosomes were attached to some of the small structures that had accumulated the mutant AT. Further, we prepared Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing another mutant AT in which two cysteine residues at 21 and 95, responsible for disulfide bond formation, were substituted for arginines. In pulse-chase experiments, the mutant AT (C21C,C95R) was secreted faster than that of ATMorioka (C95R) into the medium. These results suggest that AT Morioka remained for a long time in ER without being degraded and accumulated in newly formed membrane structures derived from the ER. The dimerization of AT Morioka (C95R) through Cys-21 seems to be critical for its intracellular accumulation. Antithrombin (AT) is a major plasma protease inhibitor with three intramolecular disulfide bonds, and its deficiency is associated with increased venous thrombosis. Recently, we found a novel missense mutation named ATMorioka (C95R), which causes the loss of one of the three disulfide bonds. In this study, we prepared Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing wild type or mutant AT and examined the intracellular fate of the ATs. In pulse-chase experiments, newly synthesized wild type AT was secreted into the medium with a half-life of ∼1.5 h. In contrast, most of the mutant type AT was not secreted during the chase period of 9 h and, surprisingly, was not degraded in the cells. The kinetics of the secretion suggests that the mutant was secreted about 50 times more slowly into the medium. Most of the mutant AT in the cells had high mannose type oligosaccharides, suggesting that it was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, half of the mutant AT existed in a dimeric form with an intermolecular disulfide bond. On immunoelectron microscopy, the mutant AT was found to have accumulated in variously sized structures surrounded by a single membrane in the cytoplasm. Immunogold particles exhibiting calnexin immunoreactivity were detected on the membranes. Ribosomes were attached to some of the small structures that had accumulated the mutant AT.

It is synthesized by hepatocytes as a 464-amino acid propeptide from which the N-terminal 32 amino acids constituting the signal peptide are cleaved to give the mature protein of 432 residues. AT contains four potential glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 96, 135, 155, and 192 and three intramolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 8–128, 21–95, and 247–430 (3Sun X.J.

Type I deficiency, which is found only in heterozygous patients, is characterized by a reduction in immunological and functional AT levels to ∼50% of normal. In contrast, type II deficiency is characterized by the presence of a dysfunctional protein in the plasma of affected individuals, and this AT may be present in either normal or reduced amounts. In the case of type I deficiency, intracellular degradation of mutant ATs is thought to be the reason for the deficiency of plasma AT (11Lane D.A. Olds R.J. Conard J. Boisclair M. Bock S.C. Hultin M.

The major site for quality control within the secretory pathway is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the ER, newly synthesized secretory polypeptides are associated with resident chaperone proteins until they are fully folded and covalently modified with oligosaccharides and assembled into appropriate oligomers, at which point they are packed into ER-to-Golgi complex transport vesicles (13Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 14Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Most proteins that fail to retain the correct conformation in the ER are degraded. In many cases, the ER-associated degradation is carried out by cytoplasmic proteasomes (15Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 16Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

On the other hand, misfolded proteins with hydrophobic structures form aggresomes (18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J.

However, the intracellular fate is not well characterized in the case of misfolded proteins, which escape degradation in the ER. Recently, we found a novel missense mutation, which we named ATMorioka (20Ozawa T. Takikawa Y. Niiya K. Fujiwara T. Suzuki K. Sato S. Sakuragawa N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 77: 403Google Scholar). A single base mutation leads to the replacement of cysteine (Cys; TGT) 95 with arginine (Arg; CGT). To examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of AT deficiency, we transfected CHO cells with the cDNA of AT Morioka and compared its intracellular fate to that of wild type AT. We found that the mutant AT is not transported to the Golgi apparatus and accumulates without degradation in novel structures surrounded by a single membrane derived from the ER. PRO-MIXTM:l[35S]-in vitro cell labeling mix (70% l-[35S]methionine and 30%l-[35S]cysteine, >37 TBq/mmol), concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose, and ECL+Plus, a Western blotting detection system, were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit anti-human AT, sheep anti-human AT, and rabbit anti-rat GRP78 (Bip) were obtained from Gelco Diagnostics, Inc. (Shreveport, LA), Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., (Victoria, Canada), and Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO), respectively. Rabbit anti-canine calnexin, rabbit anti-human calreticulin, mouse anti-rat protein disulfide isomerase, rabbit anti-mouse ERp72, rabbit anti-human Erp57, and rat anti-chicken GRP94 were from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). Protein A- and Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B, brefeldin A (BFA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and human AT were from Sigma. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., LTD (Tokyo, Japan). Antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The plasmid pBluescript KS(-)/AT in which the human cDNA sequence encoding AT was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript was described in Ref. 21Oguma Y. Sakuragawa N Hiraga K. Thromb. Res. 1992; 65: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar. From this cDNA, the full-length AT was excised withBamHI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at the corresponding sites, to obtain pcDNA3.1(+)/AT. A mutant version of AT containing the mutation C(TGT)95R(CGT) (the underlined letters indicate the single base mutation leading to an amino acid replacement of cysteine to arginine) was constructed with a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA 3.1(+)/AT as a template and designated pcDNA3.1(+)/AT(C95R). Two oligonucleotides (the substitution site is underlined), 5′-TATGACCAAGCTGGGTGCCCGTAATGACACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCATTACGGGCACCCAGCTTGGTCATA-3′, were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Another mutant version of AT containing Cys(TGC)21Arg(CGC) and Cys(TGT)95Arg(CGT) was also constructed using pcDNA 3.1(+)/AT(C95R) as a template and designated pcDNA3.1(+)/AT(C21R,C95R). Two oligonucleotides, 5′-CCCATGAATCCCATGCGCATTTACCGCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCGGTAAATGCG CATGGGATTCATGGG-3′, were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The mutation in the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids were stably transfected into CHO cells. CHO cells were cultured with Ham's F-12 medium (100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin) and transfected with 5.0 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/AT, which had been mixed with Trans FastTM (Promega). The procedure was essentially the same as described in Ref. 22Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Surviving isolated colonies were removed by the cylinder technique and subjected to analysis for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation of AT. The same procedure was carried out to obtain cells overexpressing the mutant ATs. CHO cells were plated at a concentration of 2 × 105 in 6-well plates and cultured at 37 °C for 18 h with Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% (v/v) feral calf serum. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were incubated with methionine-free medium at 37 °C for 1 h, pulsed for 1 h with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine and cysteine, and followed for various periods with Ham's F-12 medium containing 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine (0–9 h). After each observation period, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were harvested in 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. To avoid proteolytic breakdown, antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A (each at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml) were added. In the case of the pulse-chase study with BFA, the cells were preincubated with methionine-free medium containing 1 μg/ml BFA for 1 h, and the pulse-chase experiments were carried out as described above in the presence of 1 μg/ml BFA (23Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11880-11884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For long-term chase experiments, CHO cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 104 in 6-cm2 dishes and cultured at 37 °C for 18 h. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were labeled with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine and cysteine as described above and followed for various periods with Ham's F-12 containing 10% (v/v) serum (0–72 h). [35S]AT in medium and cell fractions was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human AT antibody as described previously (24Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with 10 mmdithiothreitol or non-reducing conditions without dithiothreitol. When the molecular size of AT was compared under reducing or non-reducing SDS-PAGE, cells were washed with PBS and then treated with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide/PBS for 10 min at 4 °C to block free sulfhydryl groups in the proteins. The gels were dried, and the band of AT was quantified with a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). CHO cells were labeled for 3 h with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine and cysteine, and the cells were lysed with Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 17.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate) (25Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H., P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors described above were added to avoid proteolysis. The cellular lysates were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with an excess amount of the appropriate antibodies for 2 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 40 min. The beads were washed three times with Triton buffer and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA. The beads were heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were diluted with 10-fold 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and the usual protease inhibitors, and a second immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (24Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 3 h with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine and cysteine and followed for 3 h. The [35S]AT in the cell and medium fractions was immunoprecipitated with the anti-AT antibody, and the immune complexes adsorbed on protein A-Sepharose were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.2% SDS, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was diluted with 5 volumes of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing Endo H (0.1 milliunits/ml) and incubated for 16–18 h at 37 °C (26Urade R. Kusunose M. Moriyama T. Higasa T. Kito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 3 h with 925 kBq of [35S]methionine and cysteine and followed for 3 h. [35S]-Labeled cell lysates were diluted in binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml of antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). α-Methyl-d-mannose was added to the samples, and the final concentration was adjusted to 0, 20, or 200 mm. Then, ConA-Sepharose was added, and the samples were rotated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were then spun for 10 min by microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human AT antibodies as described above (24Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, the binding of purified human AT to ConA-Sepharose was examined under the same conditions, and the AT remaining in the supernatant fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting. CHO cells were washed twice with PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide and incubated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 30 min with some modification of the method by Johnston et al.(18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 15 min and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions. For transmission electron microscopy, CHO cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate hydrochloride, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were then detached from culture dishes with 20% ethanol and were enclosed in low melting temperature agarose. Cell pellets were postfixed for 1 h with 2% reduced osmium, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Epon (27Yokota S. Kamijo K. Oda T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thin sections were mounted on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All thin sections were examined with a Hitachi H600 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 75 kV. For immunoelectron microscopy, CHO cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the cells were dehydrated with graded dimetylformamide at −20 °C and embedded in LR White. Polymerization of the resin was performed under UV light at −20 °C for 24 h. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife equipped with Ultracut R microtome (Reichert, Germany). AT was visualized with a combination of rabbit anti-human AT antibody and a 10-nm protein A-gold probe (22Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For double immunostaining, AT was visualized with a combination of sheep anti-AT antibody and 8-nm gold coupled to donkey anti-sheep IgG applied to one side of the thin sections, and calnexin was detected by rabbit anti-calnexin antibody and 15-nm gold coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG applied to the other side of the same sections. Lactate dehydrogenase was assayed using a lactate dehydrogenase-UV test kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Immunoblotting was done by the method of Small et al. (28Small G.M. Imanaka T Lazarow P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using ECL+Plus, a Western blotting detection system. The expression plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/AT and pcDNA3.1(+)/AT(C95R) were transfected into CHO cells, and stable transformants were selected based on Geneticin resistance. The clones were first examined for the expression of wild and mutant ATs by immunofluorescence microscopy. Several cell lines transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)/AT and pCDNA3.1(+)/AT(C95R) showed a punctuated staining pattern, but control cells and cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) did not exhibit any immunofluorescence (data not shown). The cells expressing wild and mutant ATs were then labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine overnight, and the medium and cell fraction were immunoprecipitated with anti-human AT antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, a band of 52 kDa corresponding to premature AT was detected in the cell fraction and a band of 58 kDa corresponding to mature AT was detected in the medium of the cells expressing wild type AT. In contrast, mutant AT with a molecular mass of 52 kDa was only detected in the cell fraction, and neither the 52- nor the 58-kDa bands were detected in the medium. These results suggest that newly synthesized wild type AT was processed in CHO cells and secreted into the medium, but the mutant type AT was not. For subsequent experiments, we chose #23 (w-AT) and #13 (AT/C95R) cells, because these cells synthesized relatively large amounts of the wild type and mutant ATs compared with the other cell lines. To examine the intracellular fate of the wild type and mutant ATs, #23 (w-AT) and #13 (AT/C95R) cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and cysteine, and the radioactivity was followed for up to 3 h in #23 (w-AT) and up to 9 h in #13 (AT/C95R) cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, after the labeling of the #23 (w-AT) cells, the 35S-mature wild type AT was detected in the medium and increased up to 3 h. The amount of35S-premature AT detected in the cell fraction decreased during chase periods of 1 to 3 h. This secretion pattern suggests that newly synthesized wild type AT was folded properly with oligosaccharides and secreted into the medium in the CHO cells expressing wild type AT. On the other hand, mutant AT was not secreted into the medium in the period up to 3 h, and only a very small amount of AT of mature size was secreted into the medium in the chase period of 9 h (Fig. 2 B). The amount of35S-premature AT detected in the cells was almost constant over a chase period of up to 9 h. Quantification of the radioactivity was carried out with a BAS 2000 imaging analyzer as shown in Fig. 2 C. The newly synthesized wild type AT was secreted into the medium with a half-life of ∼1.5 h, whereas mutant AT was secreted only very slowly and was retained in the cells rather than undergoing rapid degradation. To analyze the intracellular fate of mutant AT in detail, #13 (AT/C95R) cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 3 h, and the radioactivity was followed for up to 72 h. For this experiment, 5 × 104 cells were seeded on 6-cm2 dishes in consideration of cell growth during the chase period. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a small amount of35S-mature AT was detected in the medium after a chase period of 9 h, and the amount increased up to 72 h. In addition, 35S-premature AT was also detected in the medium after a chase period of 48 h and increased up to 72 h. After a chase period of 72 h, ∼30 and ∼20% of the newly synthesized AT had been secreted into the medium as mature and premature forms, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Most intracellular AT existed in a premature form, and the amount decreased with a half-life of 75 h (Fig. 3 C). However, the total AT radioactivity remained virtually constant throughout the chase period. These results suggest that the secretion of mutant AT is ∼50 times slower, and as a result, the mutant AT accumulates in the cells as mostly the premature form. It is possible that 35S-premature AT in the medium is released from cells damaged during the longer chase periods. To exclude this possibility, lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in the medium and cell fractions under the same pulse-chase conditions. As shown in Table I, lactate dehydrogenase activity increased linearly in each cell fraction during cell growth. In contrast, lactate dehydrogenase activity was not detected in the medium after any chase periods in #13 (AT/C95R), #23 (w-AT), or control cells, suggesting that in fact the cells had not been damaged during the long chase experiments.Table ILactate dehydrogenase activity in the cells and the medium fraction in long chase experimentsCells, mUMedium, mU244872244872hhCont591172484.000#23 (w-AT)45982203.000#13 (AT/C95R)45952105.000Control (Cont), #23 (w-AT), and #13 (AT/C95R) cells (5 × 104) were seeded on 6-cm2 dishes and cultured under the same conditions as in the pulse-chase experiments. After 24, 48, and 72 h of culture, the cell and medium fractions were separated by centrifugation. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in both fractions, as a marker enzyme of cytosol and measure of cell damage. Activity in the medium was calculated by subtracting the activity in the cell-free culture medium at each time point. Open table in a new tab Control (Cont), #23 (w-AT), and #13 (AT/C95R) cells (5 × 104) were seeded on 6-cm2 dishes and cultured under the same conditions as in the pulse-chase experiments. After 24, 48, and 72 h of culture, the cell and medium fractions were separated by centrifugation. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in both fractions, as a marker enzyme of cytosol and measure of cell damage. Activity in the medium was calculated by subtracting the activity in the cell-free culture medium at each time point. As a control experiment, #23 (w-AT) cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 3 h, and the radioactivity was followed for up to 72 h. Most of the35S-mature AT was secreted in the medium by 9 h, and the amount of [35S]AT in the medium was constant (Fig. 3,A and C). The finding that the molecular mass of the mutant AT in the cells was ∼5 kDa smaller than that of wild type AT secreted in the medium suggested that the mutant was not transported into the Golgi apparatus and did not bear complex oligosaccharide. To test this hypothesis, #13 (AT/C95R) and #23 (w-AT) cell cultures were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine. The cell fraction prepared from #13 (AT/C95R) cells and the medium fraction prepared from #23 (w-AT) cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-AT antibody and the resulting immunocomplexes treated with Endo H. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the size of mutant AT (C95R) was reduced by Endo H treatment. Under these conditions, the size of the wild type AT secreted in the medium was not diminished. As a control, the size of purified human plasma AT under these conditions was also not diminished. Next, we examined the binding of wild type and mutant ATs to ConA-Sepharose. Human AT contains four complex oligosaccharides with two branched chains in one molecule (29Mizuochi T. Fujii J. Kurachi K. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem.

It is known that this type of oligosaccharide with a free hydroxy residue in the C-2 position of the two mannoses is bound to ConA-Sepharose and released by 10–20 mm α-methyl-d-mannose and that high mannose type oligosaccharides are released by more than 100 mm α-methyl-d-mannose (30Krusius T. Finne J. Rauvala H. FEBS Lett. 1976; 71: 117-122Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using this selectivity of ConA-Sepharose to the complex or high mannose oligosaccharides, the binding of wild type and mutant ATs to the resin was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the mutant AT (C95R) bound to ConA-Sepharose was released by 200 mm but not 20 mm α-methyl-d-mannose. In comparison, wild type and purified human AT bound to the resin were released by as low as 20 mm α-methyl-d-mannose. These results suggest that mutant AT (C95R) bears the high mannose type oligosaccharides. Next, we examined the inhibitory effect of BFA on the processing of oligosaccharide chains of AT in #13 (AT/C95R) and #23 (w-AT) cells. BFA is well known to block transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus by inhibiting the exchange of GDP to GTP on ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (31Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A.

These two alternate states are stabilized by a series of interdomain and intersubunit interactions. The salt link between Lys-143 of the regulatory chain and Asp-236 of the catalytic chain is only observed in the T state. When Asp-236 is replaced by alanine the resulting enzyme exhibits full activity, enhanced affinity for aspartate, no cooperativity, and no heterotropic interactions. These characteristics are consistent with an enzyme locked in the functional R state. Using small angle x-ray scattering, the structural consequences of the D236A mutant were characterized. The unliganded D236A holoenzyme appears to be in a new structural state that is neither T, R, nor a mixture of T and R states. The structure of the native D236A holoenzyme is similar to that previously reported for another mutant holoenzyme (E239Q) that also lacks intersubunit interactions. A hybrid version of aspartate transcarbamoylase in which one catalytic subunit was wild-type and the other had the D236A mutation was also investigated. The hybrid holoenzyme, with three of the six possible interactions involving Asp-236, exhibited homotropic cooperativity, and heterotropic interactions consistent with an enzyme with both T and R functional states. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis of the unligated hybrid indicated that the enzyme was in a new structural state more similar to the T than to the R state of the wild-type enzyme. These data suggest that three of the six intersubunit interactions involving D236A are sufficient to stabilize a T-like state of the enzyme and allow for an allosteric transition.

The low affinity, low activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the T state and the high affinity, high activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the R state. The conversion from the T to the R state occurs upon aspartate binding to the enzyme in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. Structurally, the enzyme elongates by at least 11 Å along the 3-fold axis, the upper catalytic trimer rotates 10° relative to the lower trimer, and the regulatory dimers rotate 15° around the 2-fold axes (9Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. Cho Y. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to these quaternary changes, several tertiary changes also occur during the T to R state transition. In particular, the 80s and 240s loops reorient. The distinct interchain contacts of side chains of the 240s loop in the T and R states have been identified as being the major contributors to the stabilization of the T and R states (11Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The manifestation of homotropic cooperativity in aspartate transcarbamoylase results from the substrate-induced transition from the T state to the R state. These two alternate structural and functional states are stabilized by a series of interdomain and intersubunit interactions. For example, the two domains of the catalytic chain are stabilized in their domain-closed R conformation by stabilizing interactions between Glu-50 of the carbamoyl phosphate domain to Arg-167 and Arg-229 of the aspartate domain (Fig.1). These interdomain bridging interactions are critical for the formation and stabilization of the R state of the enzyme (11Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interactions between catalytic chains in different catalytic subunits play an important role in T state stabilization. When the links between Glu-239c1 2c or r appended to a residue number specifies the catalytic or regulatory chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase. A number following the C or R, e.g. c1, r4, refers to a particular polypeptide chain in aspartate transcarbamoylase.2c or r appended to a residue number specifies the catalytic or regulatory chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase. A number following the C or R, e.g. c1, r4, refers to a particular polypeptide chain in aspartate transcarbamoylase. and both Lys-164c4 and Tyr-165c4 are disrupted, the T state of the enzyme is no longer stable, resulting in the formation of a stable intermediate structural state (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Links between the catalytic and regulatory subunits are also important for T state structural stabilization (Fig. 1). For example, breaking of the link between Lys-143r1 and Asp-236c4 results in an enzyme with full activity, enhanced affinity for aspartate, no cooperativity, no activation by ATP, and minimal inhibition by CTP (13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,14Eisenstein E. Markby D.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These functional characteristics are consistent with an enzyme locked in the functional R state. Here we characterize structurally the D236A holoenzyme and characterize both functionally and structurally a hybrid version of aspartate transcarbamoylase that has only three of the six possible intersubunit interactions between Lys-143r and Asp-236c, to more fully understand the functional role of the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase.DISCUSSIONA comparison of the x-ray structures of the T and R states of aspartate transcarbamoylase reveal a series of interdomain and intersubunit interactions that appear to stabilize these two alternate functional and structural states of the enzyme (9Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. Cho Y. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Site-specific mutagenesis has been used extensively to investigate the functional importance of many of the interdomain and intersubunit interactions observed in the T and R state x-ray structures (1Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R.

Two sets of interactions have been found to be important for the stabilization of the T state of the enzyme. The best characterized is the interaction between Glu-239c1 with both Lys-164c4 and Tyr-165c4 (11Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When Glu-239c is replaced by Gln, the resulting enzyme exhibits full activity, no cooperativity, enhanced affinity for substrates, no activation by ATP, and no inhibition by CTP (11Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based upon functional studies, the native E239Q holoenzyme is functionally locked in the R state. Structural studies using SAXS have also been used to characterize the native E239Q holoenzyme (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, the native E239Q holoenzyme is in a new structural state inconsistent with either the T or R structures of the wild-type enzyme (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The position of the SAXS pattern for the E239Q holoenzyme suggests that the loss of the intersubunit interactions destabilizes the T state and the unligated enzyme exists in a new structural state between the T and R states of the wild-type enzyme. Because the intersubunit interactions involving E239Q only exist in the T state of the enzyme, this suggests that the structural intermediate observed in the x-ray scattering of the E239Q holoenzyme may be a structural intermediate in the T to R transition of the wild-type enzyme. This notion is supported by the fact that PALA is able to convert the unligated structure of the E239A holoenzyme into a structure that is virtually identical to that observed with the PALA-ligated wild-type enzyme (12Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).A study utilizing a series of hybrid holoenzymes, in which one to five of the catalytic chains had the E239Q mutation, revealed that three of the six intersubunit interactions are sufficient to stabilize the enzyme in the T state, thereby allowing the retention of homotropic cooperativity and heterotropic activation and inhibition (16Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Sakash J. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28701-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Another intersubunit interaction that stabilizes the T functional state of aspartate transcarbamoylase is between Asp-236c1 and Lys-143r4. The replacement of Asp-236 by alanine results in a mutant holoenzyme (D236A) that had remarkably similar properties to the E239Q holoenzyme, full activity, no cooperativity, enhanced affinity for substrates, no activation by ATP, and little inhibition by CTP (13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To more fully establish the importance of the intersubunit interactions between Asp-236c1 and Lys-143r4 for the function of aspartate transcarbamoylase and to compare the loss of this catalytic-regulatory intersubunit interaction to the catalytic-catalytic intersubunit interaction involving Glu-239, we report here the characterization of a hybrid enzyme that has only three of the six possible catalytic-regulatory intersubunit interactions involving Asp-236. In addition, the structural consequences of the replacement of Asp-236 by alanine were also investigated in both the native D236A holoenzyme and the hybrid by small-angle x-ray scattering.To isolate the hybrid holoenzyme in which one catalytic subunit had the D236A mutation and the other had the wild-type amino acid, Asp, at position 236, a modified version of the wild-type catalytic chain with six additional Asp residues appended to the C-terminal was used. We have previously shown that a holoenzyme consisting of two of these modified wild-type catalytic subunits (AT-C) and wild-type regulatory subunits, (AT-C)2R3, exhibited kinetic and structural characteristics identical to that of the corresponding wild-type holoenzyme lacking the Asp tail (16Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the additional negative charge on the AT-C catalytic subunits is sufficient to resolve by chromatography the three holoenzyme species produced by reconstitution of AT-C and D236A-C catalytic subunits with wild-type regulatory subunits (R) (see Fig. 2).Comparison of the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme with the wild-type and native D236A holoenzymes revealed that the hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity to both species. Although the [Asp]0.5 is diminished for the hybrid compared with the native D236A holoenzyme, the [Asp]0.5 of the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme is still about 3-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme exhibits slight aspartate cooperativity, however, the low [Asp]0.5 of the hybrid holoenzyme makes the accurate kinetic determination of residual cooperativity difficult. Therefore, the slight cooperativity observed for the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid indicates that three of the six Asp-236c/Lys-143r interactions are sufficient for stabilization of the T state of the enzyme. The lower [Asp]0.5 of the hybrid and native D236A enzymes is most likely because of a slight alteration in the position of the critical 240s loop in the R state.As opposed to the (D236A-C)2R3 holoenzyme, the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme was activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP, although the extent of the activation and inhibition were reduced compared with the wild-type holoenzyme. The activation by ATP and the inhibition by CTP of the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme indicates that three of the six Asp-236c to Lys-143r interactions are sufficient to restore heterotropic interactions and the ability of the hybrid holoenzyme to undergo a T to R transition.To obtain direct structural data on the conformation of the native D236A holoenzyme and the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were performed. As a control, the SAXS curves were also recorded for the wild-type holoenzyme. The native D236A holoenzyme without ligands exhibits a scattering pattern that is different from the T and R patterns of the wild-type enzyme (see Fig. 5). The SAXS pattern of the native D236A holoenzyme without ligands suggests that this enzyme is in a new structural state, as no combination of the wild-type T and R state patterns fit the native D236A holoenzyme scattering pattern, within error. When PALA is added to the native D236A holoenzyme, the SAXS pattern changes and is very similar to that of the PALA-ligated wild-type enzyme suggesting that the R state structures of the two enzymes are very similar.The SAXS pattern for the unligated (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid is different from either the unligated wild-type or the native D236A holoenzyme. However, the SAXS pattern of the hybrid is much more similar to the unligated wild-type than the native D236A holoenzyme, providing additional support for the hypothesis that three of the six Asp-236c/Lys-143r interactions provide significant T state stabilization to the enzyme. Addition of PALA to the (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid gives a SAXS pattern very similar to the PALA-ligated wild-type pattern, suggesting that the R states of these enzymes are virtually identical.We have previously investigated another set of intersubunit interactions between Glu-239c1 and both Lys-164c4 and Tyr-165c4. The native D236A and E239Q holoenzymes as well as the hybrid holoenzymes, containing one wild-type and one mutant catalytic subunit, have remarkably similar properties. For the unligated native E239Q holoenzyme, the SAXS pattern is very similar to that of the unligated native D236A holoenzyme reported here. Furthermore, the kinetic characterization and the SAXS pattern of the (E239Q-C)(AT-C)R3 and (D236A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzyme are quite similar. In both cases the hybrid has restored cooperativity and heterotropic interactions, and the SAXS patterns of the hybrids are very T-like. Both sets of data suggest that three of the six intersubunit interactions add significant stabilization to the T state of the enzyme.The saturation of only a small number of active sites by substrates (or substrate analogs) to aspartate transcarbamoylase is sufficient to induce the allosteric transition (37Macol C.P. Tsuruta H. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding of aspartate to enzymes previously saturated with carbamoyl phosphate induces the critical closure of the domains of the catalytic chains (38Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Science. 1988; 241: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, as we have previously proposed this domain closure in one catalytic chain cannot occur without some change in the quaternary structure of the enzyme because of steric interference of this domain closure (39Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the elongation of the enzyme is a necessary part of the allosteric transition of aspartate transcarbamoylase. The elongation of the molecule requires the breaking of the T state intersubunit interactions involving both Asp-236 and Glu-239. When the side chain of either of these residues is replaced by noncharged substitutes, the net results are the inability of the enzyme to exist in the T state and the formation of a new structural state that is neither T nor R. Because the interactions involving both Glu-239 and Asp-236 are lost during the wild-type T to R transition, it is reasonable to speculate that the structures of the unligated D236A and E239Q holoenzymes are intermediates in the pathway of the wild-type T to R transition. The fact that the E239Q holoenzyme can be shifted to the R state with only the addition of carbamoyl phosphate suggests that the final conformational changes necessary to create the R state may be partially coupled to the major quaternary conformational change. Additional SAXS experiments are currently underway to better establish the nature of the allosteric transition for both the wild-type and mutant versions of aspartate transcarbamoylase. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC2.1.3.2) catalyzes the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate and l-aspartate to form N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate (2Gerhart J.C.

The enzyme shows homotropic cooperativity for the substrate l-aspartate and is heterotropically regulated by ATP, CTP (2Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol.

Two functionally and structurally different states of aspartate transcarbamoylase have been characterized. The low affinity, low activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the T state and the high affinity, high activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the R state. The conversion from the T to the R state occurs upon aspartate binding to the enzyme in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. Structurally, the enzyme elongates by at least 11 Å along the 3-fold axis, the upper catalytic trimer rotates 10° relative to the lower trimer, and the regulatory dimers rotate 15° around the 2-fold axes (9Ke H.-M.

In contrast to recent results obtained with the thermophilic F1 (Groth, G., Hisabori, T., Lill, H., and Bald, D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 20117–20119), substitution of a critical serine in the β-subunit (βSer59), which is supposed to provide an important intermolecular hydrogen bond in the binding site, was not sufficient on its own for conferring tentoxin sensitivity to theE. coli F1 complex. Superimposition of the chloroplast F1-tentoxin inhibitor complex on a homology model of the E. coli F1 complex provided detailed information on the critical residues in the α-subunit of the binding cleft and allowed us to model the binding site according to the steric requirements of the inhibitor. Substitution of the highly conserved residue αLeu64 seems to be most important for allowing access of the inhibitor to the binding site. Combining this substitution with either additional replacements in the α-subunit (Q49A, L95A, E96Q, I273M) or the replacement of Ser59 in the β-subunit enhanced the sensitivity to the inhibitor and resulted in a complete inhibition of the E. coli F1-ATPase by the plant-specific inhibitor tentoxin.

In these plants the phytotoxin binds specifically to the F1 complex of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1),1 causing the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis (2Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F.

High affinity binding (10−8m) of a single tentoxin molecule seems sufficient for the inhibition, whereas low affinity binding (10−5m) of a second and third molecule results in a reactivation of the enzyme (5Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Letters. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure and location of the inhibitory tentoxin binding site was determined by x-ray analysis of crystals containing the spinach chloroplast α3β3γε-core complexed with tentoxin (7Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The inhibitor binds to a cleft localized at the αβ-interface of the F1 complex. Hydrogen bonding provided by residue Asp83 in the catalytic β-subunit seems exceptionally crucial for the binding of the inhibitor. Most of the binding site, however, is located on the non-catalytic α-subunit, which forms important hydrophobic contacts with the inhibitor.The importance of βAsp83 for tentoxin binding and sensitivity was already suggested in mutagenesis studies (8Tucker W.C., Du, Z.

Substitution by glutamate, alanine, or leucine caused tentoxin resistance, whereas substitution of glutamate by aspartate in the tentoxin resistant F1-ATPase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii resulted in a sensitive F1 complex (8Tucker W.C., Du, Z.

Surprisingly, bacterial F1-ATPases from Escherichia coli and Bacillus PS3 are resistant to tentoxin even though they contain aspartate in the corresponding position of their β-subunit. Thus, additional structural elements in the F1complex must be required for tentoxin binding and sensitivity. The crystal structure of the CF1-tentoxin inhibitor complex (7Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) shed more light on these additional critical residues and identified important hydrophobic contacts between residuesl-Leu2 and MePhe3 in the tentoxin molecule and Ile63, Leu65, Val75, Tyr237, Leu238, and Met274 in the α-subunit. Moreover, this structure supports the critical role of Ala96 for tentoxin binding, which was already suggested on the basis of a structural alignment of MF1, TF1, and CF1 (10Groth G. Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Substitution of alanine by larger side chains like methionine (TF1), valine (MF1), or leucine (EF1), which are found in resistant species, will certainly result in steric conflicts withl-Leu2 in the tentoxin molecule and will, in turn, avoid the binding of the inhibitor to the F1complex.To identify the minimal structural requirement for tentoxin binding in the α- and β-subunit, we have substituted several critical residues in the E. coli F1F0-ATP synthase, which, despite containing the essential aspartate in a position equivalent to Asp83 in CF1, is resistant against tentoxin (11Chen Z. Spies A. Hein R. Zhou X. Thomas B.C. Richter M.L. Gegenheimer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17124-17132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The failure of βAsp61 in EF1 to bind tentoxin might be related to βSer59. As already reported for the thermophilic F1 complex, an intramolecular hydrogen bond formed between the β-aspartate and the hydroxyl side chain of the adjacent serine residue might impair the critical interaction of the aspartate carboxyl and the amide hydrogens of l-Leu2 and Gly4 in the peptide backbone of the inhibitor (12Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hence, we have substituted residues 58–60 in the β-subunit of the E. coli F1 complex according to the native residues found in CF1. Moreover, residues Gln49, Leu64, Leu95, Glu96, and Ile273 in the α-subunit were exchanged for those found in the tentoxin-sensitive CF1 complex or for residues having smaller side chain volumes. Here we report the results of these substitutions on the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and ATP-dependent proton translocation by tentoxin and demonstrate that, by subtle changes in the α-subunit, the E. coli ATP synthase can be turned into a tentoxin-sensitive enzyme.
