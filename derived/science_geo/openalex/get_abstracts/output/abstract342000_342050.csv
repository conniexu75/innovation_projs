https://openalex.org/W2166722801,"The commonly observed high diversity of trees in tropical rain forests and corals on tropical reefs is a nonequilibrium state which, if not disturbed further, will progress toward a low-diversity equilibrium community. This may not happen if gradual changes in climate favor different species. If equilibrium is reached, a lesser degree of diversity may be sustained by niche diversification or by a compensatory mortality that favors inferior competitors. However, tropical forests and reefs are subject to severe disturbances often enough that equilibrium may never be attained."
https://openalex.org/W1971134888,"I have proposed that droplet chondrules were formed by jetting during collision of meteoritic particles with diameters ranging in order of magnitude from 0.5 mm to 20 cm. This conclusion, based on a dynamic model for the collision process, supports the hypotheses of Wasson (2) (based on geochemical considerations) and Whipple (35) and Cameron (36) (based on dynamic model considerations) that chondrules were formed from objects less than 1 m in radius. In this model, the formation of chondrules is viewed as a textural, but not substantial chemical, change in the material of the early solar system. Droplets of melt produced by jetting are mixtures of material derived from two parent grains. Jets are probably not appreciably fractionated (except in volatile elements) either in the short duration of the shock events (several microseconds) or in subsequent cooling. This model for the formation of droplet chondrules implies that they were formed at a time in the history of the solar system when particle sizes were small. The most likely time for this condition is early in the process of accretion of nebular dust to planetary matter. Since velocities less than approximately 1.5 km/sec are required for the agglomeration and accretion of particles (37), the relatively higher velocities indicated for droplet chondrule-forming collisions indicate an early high-velocity destructive epoch amidst the general trend toward accretion of material."

Local competition for mates seemed to be absent, and the population investment ratio was not significantly different from 1:1. Workers are not more closely related to the brood they tend than they would be to their own offspring. The 3/4 relationship between sisters in haplodiploid species cannot account for the maintenance of eusociality in this case."

https://openalex.org/W2037664263,"Both P(n), and S(n), phases recorded at distances greater than 3000 kilometers in the western Pacific have substantial amounts of energy at high frequencies, in sorne instances as high as 12 hertz for P(n) and 15 hertz for S(n), A comparison of P(n) and S(n) spectra reveals generally higher energy levels and higher proportions of high-frequency to low-frequency energy for S(n) than for P(n). Estimates of the effective quality factor, Q, indicate that the efficiency of S(n) propagation may be two or three times that of P(n). First arrivals of Pn and Sn have apparent velocities in agreement with values for the uppermost mantle, whereas maximum-energy arrivals have apparent velocities in agreement with values for the lower crust."
https://openalex.org/W2076546594,"Peer ratings of the quality of doctoral program faculties were obtained in a 1975 national survey of chemistry, history, and psychology programs. The ratings were then compared to those obtained 6 and 11 years earlier by the American Council on Education. In general, the rankings obtained from the ratings proved to be highly stable over the 11-year period, particularly in chemistry and history."
https://openalex.org/W2035360834,"The special properties of synchrotron light are leading to a rapid increase in its utilization for both research and technology. At wavelength in the ultraviolet region of the broad spectrum in these beams a number of atomic, molecular, and solid-state spectroscopies are being pursued; soft x-rays are being used for spectroscopy, lithography, microscopy, and topography; at still shorter wavelengths, advantage is taken of scattering properties to probe the structure of matter. Characteristics of synchrotron radiation and of the sources which produce it are described, and some typical investigations and applications are presented to suggest the versatility of these sources."
