https://openalex.org/W2161184021,"The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via ""SNP chip"" microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2046895286,"Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BEC) constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which forms a dynamic interface between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS). This highly specialized interface restricts paracellular diffusion of fluids and solutes including chemicals, toxins and drugs from entering the brain. In this study we compared the transcriptome profiles of the human immortalized brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and human primary BEC. We identified transcriptional differences in immune response genes which are directly related to the immortalization procedure of the hCMEC/D3 cells. Interestingly, astrocytic co-culturing reduced cell adhesion and migration molecules in both BECs, which possibly could be related to regulation of immune surveillance of the CNS controlled by astrocytic cells within the neurovascular unit. By matching the transcriptome data from these two cell lines with published transcriptional data from freshly isolated mouse BECs, we discovered striking differences that could explain some of the limitations of using cultured BECs to study BBB properties. Key protein classes such as tight junction proteins, transporters and cell surface receptors show differing expression profiles. For example, the claudin-5, occludin and JAM2 expression is dramatically reduced in the two human BEC lines, which likely explains their low transcellular electric resistance and paracellular leakiness. In addition, the human BEC lines express low levels of unique brain endothelial transporters such as Glut1 and Pgp. Cell surface receptors such as LRP1, RAGE and the insulin receptor that are involved in receptor-mediated transport are also expressed at very low levels. Taken together, these data illustrate that BECs lose their unique protein expression pattern outside of their native environment and display a more generic endothelial cell phenotype. A collection of key genes that seems to be highly regulated by the local surroundings of BEC within the neurovascular unit are presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089881597,"The biofertilization of crops with plant-growth-promoting microorganisms is currently considered as a healthy alternative to chemical fertilization. However, only microorganisms safe for humans can be used as biofertilizers, particularly in vegetables that are raw consumed, in order to avoid sanitary problems derived from the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the final products. In the present work we showed that Rhizobium strains colonize the roots of tomato and pepper plants promoting their growth in different production stages increasing yield and quality of seedlings and fruits. Our results confirmed those obtained in cereals and alimentary oil producing plants extending the number of non-legumes susceptible to be biofertilized with rhizobia to those whose fruits are raw consumed. This is a relevant conclusion since safety of rhizobia for human health has been demonstrated after several decades of legume inoculation ensuring that they are optimal bacteria for biofertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2130663624,"Huanglongbing (HLB) or ""citrus greening"" is the most destructive citrus disease worldwide. In this work, we studied host responses of citrus to infection with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas) using next-generation sequencing technologies. A deep mRNA profile was obtained from peel of healthy and HLB-affected fruit. It was followed by pathway and protein-protein network analysis and quantitative real time PCR analysis of highly regulated genes. We identified differentially regulated pathways and constructed networks that provide a deep insight into the metabolism of affected fruit. Data mining revealed that HLB enhanced transcription of genes involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis and in ATP synthesis. Activation of protein degradation and misfolding processes were observed at the transcriptomic level. Transcripts for heat shock proteins were down-regulated at all disease stages, resulting in further protein misfolding. HLB strongly affected pathways involved in source-sink communication, including sucrose and starch metabolism and hormone synthesis and signaling. Transcription of several genes involved in the synthesis and signal transduction of cytokinins and gibberellins was repressed while that of genes involved in ethylene pathways was induced. CaLas infection triggered a response via both the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways and increased the transcript abundance of several members of the WRKY family of transcription factors. Findings focused on the fruit provide valuable insight to understanding the mechanisms of the HLB-induced fruit disorder and eventually developing methods based on small molecule applications to mitigate its devastating effects on fruit production."
https://openalex.org/W2138661165,"Whether a healthy lifestyle may be associated with longer telomere length is largely unknown.To examine healthy lifestyle practices, which are primary prevention measures against major age-related chronic diseases, in relation to leukocyte telomere length.Cross-sectional analysis in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS).The population consisted of 5,862 women who participated in multiple prospective case-control studies within the NHS cohort. Z scores of leukocyte telomere length were derived within each case-control study. Based on prior work, we defined low-risk or healthy categories for five major modifiable factors assessed in 1988 or 1990: non-current smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight (body mass index in 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), engaging in regular moderate or vigorous physical activities (≥150 minutes/week), drinking alcohol in moderation (1 drink/week to <2 drinks/day), and eating a healthy diet (Alternate Healthy Eating Index score in top 50%). We calculated difference (%) of the z scores contrasting low-risk groups with reference groups to evaluate the association of interest.Although none of the individual low-risk factors was significantly associated with larger leukocyte telomere length z scores, we observed a significant, positive relationship between the number of low-risk factors and the z scores. In comparison with women who had zero low-risk factors (1.9% of the total population) and were, therefore, considered the least healthy group, the leukocyte telomere length z scores were 16.4%, 22.1%, 28.7%, 22.6%, and 31.2% (P for trend = 0.015) higher for women who had 1 to 5 low-risk factors, respectively.Adherence to a healthy lifestyle, defined by major modifiable risk factors, was associated with longer telomere length in leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2050866090,"Fibroblast growth factors 19 (FGF19) and 21 (FGF21) have emerged as key regulators of energy metabolism. Several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism of FGF19 and FGF21 action, however, the data presented has often been inconsistent and at times contradictory. Here in a single study we compare the mechanisms mediating FGF19/FGF21 actions, and how similarities/differences in actions at the cellular level between these two factors translate to common/divergent physiological outputs. Firstly, we show that in cell culture FGF19/FGF21 are very similar, however, key differences are still observed differentiating the two. In vitro we found that both FGF's activate FGFRs in the context of βKlotho (KLB) expression. Furthermore, both factors alter ERK phosphorylation and glucose uptake with comparable potency. Combination treatment of cells with both factors did not have additive effects and treatment with a competitive inhibitor, the FGF21 delta N17 mutant, also blocked FGF19's effects, suggestive of a shared receptor activation mechanism. The key differences between FGF21/FGF19 were noted at the receptor interaction level, specifically the unique ability of FGF19 to bind/signal directly via FGFR4. To determine if differential effects on energy homeostasis and hepatic mitogenicity exist we treated DIO and ob/ob mice with FGF19/FGF21. We find comparable efficacy of the two proteins to correct body weight and serum glucose in both DIO and ob/ob mice. Nevertheless, FGF21 and FGF19 had distinctly different effects on proliferation in the liver. Interestingly, in vivo blockade of FGF21 signaling in mice using ΔN17 caused profound changes in glycemia indicative of the critical role KLB and FGF21 play in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Overall, our data demonstrate that while subtle differences exist in vitro the metabolic effects in vivo of FGF19/FGF21 are indistinguishable, supporting a shared mechanism of action for these two hormones in the regulation of energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W2166637116,"The analysis of collections of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional fermented plant foods in tropical countries may enable the detection of LAB with interesting properties. Binding capacity is often the main criterion used to investigate the probiotic characteristics of bacteria. In this study, we focused on a collection of 163 Lactobacillaceace comprising 156 bacteria isolated from traditional amylaceous fermented foods and seven strains taken from a collection and used as controls. The collection had a series of analyses to assess binding potential for the selection of new probiotic candidates. The presence/absence of 14 genes involved in binding to the gastrointestinal tract was assessed. This enabled the detection of all the housekeeping genes (ef-Tu, eno, gap, groEl and srtA) in the entire collection, of some of the other genes (apf, cnb, fpbA, mapA, mub) in 86% to 100% of LAB, and of the other genes (cbsA, gtf, msa, slpA) in 0% to 8% of LAB. Most of the bacteria isolated from traditional fermented foods exhibited a genetic profile favorable for their binding to the gastrointestinal tract. We selected 30 strains with different genetic profiles to test their binding ability to non-mucus (HT29) and mucus secreting (HT29-MTX) cell lines as well as their ability to degrade mucus. Assays on both lines revealed high variability in binding properties among the LAB, depending on the cell model used. Finally, we investigated if their binding ability was linked to tighter cross-talk between bacteria and eukaryotic cells by measuring the expression of bacterial genes and of the eukaryotic MUC2 gene. Results showed that wild LAB from tropical amylaceous fermented food had a much higher binding capacity than the two LAB currently known to be probiotics. However their adhesion was not linked to any particular genetic equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2056190621,"Similar to other highly successful invasive bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus recruits the complement regulatory protein factor H (fH) to its surface to inhibit the alternative pathway of complement. Here, we report the identification of the surface-associated protein SdrE as a fH-binding protein using purified fH overlay of S. aureus fractionated cell wall proteins and fH cross-linking to S. aureus followed by mass spectrometry. Studies using recombinant SdrE revealed that rSdrE bound significant fH whether from serum or as a purified form, in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, rSdrE-bound fH exhibited cofactor functionality for factor I (fI)-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b which correlated positively with increasing amounts of fH. Expression of SdrE on the surface of the surrogate bacterium Lactococcus lactis enhanced recruitment of fH which resulted in increased iC3b generation. Moreover, surface expression of SdrE led to a reduction in C3-fragment deposition, less C5a generation, and reduced killing by polymorphonuclear cells. Thus, we report the first identification of a S. aureus protein associated with the staphylococcal surface that binds factor H as an immune evasion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2081153887,"Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer. Recently, phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumor cells were identified. Among them, ABCB5-expressing cells were proposed to display an enhanced tumorigenicity with stem cell-like properties. In addition, ABCB5+ cells are thought to participate to chemoresistance through a potential efflux function of ABCB5. Nevertheless, the fate of these cells upon drugs that are used in melanoma chemotherapy remains to be clarified. Here we explored the effect of anti-melanoma treatments on the ABCB5-expressing cells. Using a melanoma xenograft model (WM266-4), we observed in vivo that ABCB5-expressing cells are enriched after a temozolomide treatment that induces a significant tumor regression. These results were further confirmed in a preliminary study conducted on clinical samples from patients that received dacarbazine. In vitro, we showed that ABCB5-expressing cells selectively survive when exposed to dacarbazine, the reference treatment of metastatic melanoma, but also to vemurafenib, a new inhibitor of the mutated kinase V600E BRAF and other various chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results show that anti-melanoma chemotherapy might participate to the chemoresistance acquisition by selecting tumor cell subpopulations expressing ABCB5. This is of particular importance in understanding the relapses observed after anti-melanoma treatments and reinforces the interest of ABCB5 and ABCB5-expressing cells as potential therapeutic targets in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1985295342,"Cardiac Na(+) channels encoded by the SCN5A gene are essential for initiating heart beats and maintaining a regular heart rhythm. Mutations in these channels have recently been associated with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).We investigated a young male patient with a mixed phenotype composed of documented conduction disorder, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia associated with DCM. Further family screening revealed DCM in the patient's mother and sister and in three of the mother's sisters. Because of the complex clinical phenotypes, we screened SCN5A and identified a novel mutation, R219H, which is located on a highly conserved region on the fourth helix of the voltage sensor domain of Na(v)1.5. Three family members with DCM carried the R219H mutation.The wild-type (WT) and mutant Na(+) channels were expressed in a heterologous expression system, and intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using a pH-sensitive electrode. The biophysical characterization of the mutant channel revealed an unexpected selective proton leak with no effect on its biophysical properties. The H(+) leak through the mutated Na(v)1.5 channel was not related to the Na(+) permeation pathway but occurred through an alternative pore, most probably a proton wire on the voltage sensor domain.We propose that acidification of cardiac myocytes and/or downstream events may cause the DCM phenotype and other electrical problems in affected family members. The identification of this clinically significant H(+) leak may lead to the development of more targeted treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2076953184,"Cleft Lip and Palate Transmembrane Protein 1-Like (CLPTM1L), resides in a region of chromosome 5 for which copy number gain has been found to be the most frequent genetic event in the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This locus has been found by multiple genome wide association studies to be associated with lung cancer in both smokers and non-smokers. CLPTM1L has been identified as an overexpressed protein in human ovarian tumor cell lines that are resistant to cisplatin, which is the only insight thus far into the function of CLPTM1L. Here we find CLPTM1L expression to be increased in lung adenocarcinomas compared to matched normal lung tissues and in lung tumor cell lines by mechanisms not exclusive to copy number gain. Upon loss of CLPTM1L accumulation in lung tumor cells, cisplatin and camptothecin induced apoptosis were increased in direct proportion to the level of CLPTM1L knockdown. Bcl-xL accumulation was significantly decreased upon loss of CLPTM1L. Expression of exogenous Bcl-xL abolished sensitization to apoptotic killing with CLPTM1L knockdown. These results demonstrate that CLPTM1L, an overexpressed protein in lung tumor cells, protects from genotoxic stress induced apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-xL. Thus, this study implicates anti-apoptotic CLPTM1L function as a potential mechanism of susceptibility to lung tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2111601211,"Tinnitus, a phantom auditory sensation, is associated with hearing loss in most cases, but it is unclear if hearing loss causes tinnitus. Phantom auditory sensations can be induced in normal hearing listeners when they experience severe auditory deprivation such as confinement in an anechoic chamber, which can be regarded as somewhat analogous to a profound bilateral hearing loss. As this condition is relatively uncommon among tinnitus patients, induction of phantom sounds by a lesser degree of auditory deprivation could advance our understanding of the mechanisms of tinnitus. In this study, we therefore investigated the reporting of phantom sounds after continuous use of an earplug. 18 healthy volunteers with normal hearing wore a silicone earplug continuously in one ear for 7 days. The attenuation provided by the earplugs simulated a mild high-frequency hearing loss, mean attenuation increased from <10 dB at 0.25 kHz to >30 dB at 3 and 4 kHz. 14 out of 18 participants reported phantom sounds during earplug use. 11 participants presented with stable phantom sounds on day 7 and underwent tinnitus spectrum characterization with the earplug still in place. The spectra showed that the phantom sounds were perceived predominantly as high-pitched, corresponding to the frequency range most affected by the earplug. In all cases, the auditory phantom disappeared when the earplug was removed, indicating a causal relation between auditory deprivation and phantom sounds. This relation matches the predictions of our computational model of tinnitus development, which proposes a possible mechanism by which a stabilization of neuronal activity through homeostatic plasticity in the central auditory system could lead to the development of a neuronal correlate of tinnitus when auditory nerve activity is reduced due to the earplug."
https://openalex.org/W1979777047,"With the wide use of double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) for the analysis of gene function in plants, a high-throughput system for making hairpin RNA (hpRNA) constructs is in great demand. Here, we describe a novel restriction-ligation approach that provides a simple but efficient construction of intron-containing hpRNA (ihpRNA) vectors. The system takes advantage of the type IIs restriction enzyme BsaI and our new plant RNAi vector pRNAi-GG based on the Golden Gate (GG) cloning. This method requires only a single PCR product of the gene of interest flanked with BsaI recognition sequence, which can then be cloned into pRNAi-GG at both sense and antisense orientations simultaneously to form ihpRNA construct. The process, completed in one tube with one restriction-ligation step, produced a recombinant ihpRNA with high efficiency and zero background. We demonstrate the utility of the ihpRNA constructs generated with pRNAi-GG vector for the effective silencing of various individual endogenous and exogenous marker genes as well as two genes simultaneously. This method provides a novel and high-throughput platform for large-scale analysis of plant functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2127326873,"Background The complement system is one of the important contributing factors in the development of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). C5a and the neutrophil C5a receptor play a central role in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-mediated neutrophil recruitment and activation. The current study further investigated the signaling pathways of C5a-mediated priming of human neutrophils for ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Methodology/Principal Findings The effects of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) inhibitor (SB202190), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (PD98059), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (6o) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) were tested on respiratory burst and degranulation of C5a-primed neutrophils activated with ANCA, as well as on C5a-induced increase in expression of membrane-bound PR3 (mPR3) on neutrophils. For C5a-primed neutrophils for MPO-ANCA-induced respiratory burst, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value was 254.8±67.1, which decreased to 203.6±60.3, 204.4±36.7, 202.4±49.9 and 188±47.9 upon pre-incubation with SB202190, PD98059, LY294002 and the mixture of above-mentioned three inhibitors (compared with that without inhibitors, P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.05), respectively. For PR3-ANCA-positive IgG, the MFI value increased in C5a-primed neutrophils, which decreased upon pre-incubation with above-mentioned inhibitors. The lactoferrin concentration increased in C5a-primed neutrophils induced by MPO or PR3-ANCA-positive IgG supernatant and decreased upon pre-incubation with above-mentioned three inhibitors. mPR3 expression increased from 923.3±182.4 in untreated cells to 1278.3±299.3 after C5a treatment and decreased to 1069.9±188.9, 1100±238.2, 1092.3±231.8 and 1053.9±200.3 by SB202190, PD98059, LY294002 and the mixture of above-mentioned three inhibitors (compared with that without inhibitors, P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.01), respectively. Conclusions/Significance Activation of p38MAPK, ERK and PI3K are important steps in the translocation of ANCA antigens and C5a-induced activation of neutrophils by ANCA."
https://openalex.org/W2022162074,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are required for proper folding of many proteins. The low capacity for PTMs hinders the production of heterologous proteins in the widely used prokaryotic systems of protein synthesis. Until now, a systematic and comprehensive study concerning the specific effects of individual PTMs on heterologous protein synthesis has not been presented. To address this issue, we expressed 1488 human proteins and their domains in a bacterial cell-free system, and we examined the correlation of the expression yields with the presence of multiple PTM sites bioinformatically predicted in these proteins. This approach revealed a number of previously unknown statistically significant correlations. Prediction of some PTMs, such as myristoylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, and disulfide bond formation, was found to significantly worsen protein amenability to soluble expression. The presence of other PTMs, such as aspartyl hydroxylation, C-terminal amidation, and Tyr sulfation, did not correlate with the yield of heterologous protein expression. Surprisingly, the predicted presence of several PTMs, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and prenylation, was associated with the increased production of properly folded soluble proteins. The plausible rationales for the existence of the observed correlations are presented. Our findings suggest that identification of potential PTMs in polypeptide sequences can be of practical use for predicting expression success and optimizing heterologous protein synthesis. In sum, this study provides the most compelling evidence so far for the role of multiple PTMs in the stability and solubility of heterologously expressed recombinant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2167057608,"The RNA-binding protein, trans-active response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), is normally found in the nucleus, but in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontal temporal dementia, and some cases of Alzheimer disease it is cleaved and mislocalized to the cytosol, leading to accumulation. The mechanisms contributing to this are largely unknown. Here, we show that part of the normal clearance cascade for TDP-43 involves the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex. An Hsp90 inhibitor that disrupts the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex reduced TDP-43 levels to a greater extent than a standard Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor. When Cdc37 was depleted, TDP-43 underwent proteolytic clearance that was dependent on nuclear retrotranslocation and autophagic uptake. Accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau prevented the clearance of cleaved TDP-43, but not its production. This caused cleaved TDP-43 to accumulate, a feature observed in the brain of persons with Alzheimer disease. Clearance of cleaved TDP-43 was also prevented by knockdown of the autophagic inducer beclin1. Thus, in cells where TDP-43 clearance is normally needed, a system that employs manipulation of the Hsp90 complex and autophagy exists. But when tau accumulation is occurring, cleaved TDP-43 can no longer be cleared, perhaps explaining the emergence of these co-pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1978957441,"This study elucidates exposure-response relationships between performance of repetitive tasks, grip strength declines, and fibrogenic-related protein changes in muscles, and their link to inflammation. Specifically, we examined forearm flexor digitorum muscles for changes in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; a matrix protein associated with fibrosis), collagen type I (Col1; a matrix component), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1; an upstream modulator of CTGF and collagen), in rats performing one of two repetitive tasks, with or without anti-inflammatory drugs.To examine the roles of force versus repetition, rats performed either a high repetition negligible force food retrieval task (HRNF), or a high repetition high force handle-pulling task (HRHF), for up to 9 weeks, with results compared to trained only (TR-NF or TR-HF) and normal control rats. Grip strength declined with both tasks, with the greatest declines in 9-week HRHF rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of HRNF muscles showed increased expression of Col1 in weeks 3-9, and CTGF in weeks 6 and 9. Immunohistochemistry confirmed PCR results, and also showed greater increases of CTGF and collagen matrix in 9-week HRHF rats than 9-week HRNF rats. ELISA, and immunohistochemistry revealed greater increases of TGFB1 in TR-HF and 6-week HRHF, compared to 6-week HRNF rats. To examine the role of inflammation, results from 6-week HRHF rats were compared to rats receiving ibuprofen or anti-TNF-α treatment in HRHF weeks 4-6. Both treatments attenuated HRHF-induced increases in CTGF and fibrosis by 6 weeks of task performance. Ibuprofen attenuated TGFB1 increases and grip strength declines, matching our prior results with anti-TNFα.Performance of highly repetitive tasks was associated with force-dependent declines in grip strength and increased fibrogenic-related proteins in flexor digitorum muscles. These changes were attenuated, at least short-term, by anti-inflammatory treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2011059614,"Background There has been very little prospective research on rape perpetration among men. This paper describes the incidence and risk factors for new rape and attempted rape events among young South African men in an HIV prevention trial. Methods We followed 1,147 men aged 15–26 years who enrolled into a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the HIV prevention behavioural intervention Stepping Stones. Incidence rate ratios for factors associated with incident rape were derived from Poisson models. Results The young men reported 217 incident rapes (completed or attempted) of a girl or woman over 1,914 person years of follow up, yielding a rape incidence of 11.2 per 100 person years. Overall 24.9% of men had previously raped at baseline, and 18.9% did so during the follow up. Among the latter, 61.3% raped for the first time, and 38.7% re-offended. Multivariable Poisson modelling showed a higher incidence of rape perpetration among men who had ever used drugs (IRR 1.86 95%CI 1.39, 2.49), had eight or more lifetime partners (IRR 1.48 95% CI 1.09, 2.01), had been physically violent toward a female partner (IRR 1.50 95%CI 1.11, 2.03) and had disclosed rape perpetration at baseline (IRR 1.45 95%CI 1.07, 1.97). A lower incidence was found among those with greater resistance to peer pressure (IRR 0.85 95%CI 0.74, 0.97). Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of male gender socialisation and addressing delinquent youth sub-cultures in rape prevention. Prevention requires change in hegemonic masculinity, with its emphasis on gender hierarchy, exaggerated performance of heterosexuality and control of women. Interventions are needed to address male socialisation with delinquent peers, by reducing exposure to childhood trauma and strengthening opportunities for gainful employment (in work or recreation)."
https://openalex.org/W2032602034,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism in carcinogenesis. To determine the mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of EMT, it is crucial to develop new biomarkers and therapeutic targets towards cancers. In this study, when TGFβ1 and TNFα were used to induce EMT in human lung carcinoma A549 cells, we found an increase in an epithelial cell tight junction marker, Claudin 1. We further identified that it was the TNFα and not the TGFβ1 that induced the fibroblast-like morphology changes. TNFα also caused the increase in Claudin-1 gene expression and protein levels in Triton X-100 soluble cytoplasm fraction. Down-regulation of Claudin-1, using small interfering RNA (siRNA), inhibited 75% of TNFα-induced gene expression changes. Claudin-1 siRNA effectively blocked TNFα-induced molecular functional networks related to inflammation and cell movement. Claudin-1 siRNA was able to significantly reduce TNF-enhanced cell migration and fibroblast-like morphology. Furthermore, over expression of Claudin 1 with a Claudin 1-pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector enhanced cell migration. In conclusion, these observations indicate that Claudin 1 acts as a critical signal mediator in TNFα-induced gene expression and cell migration in human lung cancer cells. Further analyses of these cellular processes may be helpful in developing novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2073205471,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. NEC is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response to bacterial flora leading to bowel necrosis. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediates inflammation through TLR4 activation and is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of NEC. However, LPS also induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which promotes intestinal barrier restitution through stimulation of intestinal cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation prevents experimental NEC and may play a critical role in LPS-stimulated COX-2 production. We hypothesized that EGFR is required for LPS induction of COX-2 expression. Our data show that inhibiting EGFR kinase activity blocks LPS-induced COX-2 expression in small intestinal epithelial cells. LPS induction of COX-2 requires Src-family kinase signaling while LPS transactivation of EGFR requires matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors block LPS stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK, suggesting an important role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in EGFR-mediated COX-2 expression. LPS stimulates proliferation of IEC-6 cells, but this stimulation is inhibited with either the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478, or the selective COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib. Taken together, these data show that EGFR plays an important role in LPS-induction of COX-2 expression in enterocytes, which may be one mechanism for EGF in inhibition of NEC."
https://openalex.org/W2025620259,"Background Given the relative abundance and toxic potential of acrolein in inhaled cigarette smoke, it is surprising how little is known about the pulmonary and systemic effects of acrolein. Here we test the hypothesis whether systemic administration of acrolein could cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and lung cell apoptosis, leading to the enlargement of the alveolar air spaces in rats. Methods Acute and chronic effects of intraperitoneally administered acrolein were tested. Mean alveolar airspace area was measured by using light microscopy and imaging system software. TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for active caspase 3 and Western blot analysis for active caspase 3, and caspase 12 were performed to detect apoptosis. The ER-stress related gene expression in the lungs was determined by Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Acrolein-protein adducts in the lung tissue were detected by IHC. Results Acute administration of acrolein caused a significant elevation of activated caspase 3, upregulation of VEGF expression and induced ER stress proteins in the lung tissue. The chronic administration of acrolein in rats led to emphysematous lung tissue remodeling. TUNEL staining and IHC for cleaved caspase 3 showed a large number of apoptotic septal cells in the acrolein-treated rat lungs. Chronic acrolein administration cause the endoplasmic reticulum stress response manifested by significant upregulation of ATF4, CHOP and GADd34 expression. In smokers with COPD there was a considerable accumulation of acrolein-protein adducts in the inflammatory, airway and vascular cells. Conclusions Systemic administration of acrolein causes endoplasmic reticulum stress response, lung cell apoptosis, and chronic administration leads to the enlargement of the alveolar air spaces and emphysema in rats.

Patients and Methods We analyzed characteristics of 238 patients with mCRC referred to the phase 1 trials unit at MD Anderson Cancer Center. KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF status were tested using PCR-based DNA sequencing. Results Fifty-one percent of patients harbored KRAS mutations; 15% had PIK3CA mutations. In the multivariate regression model for clinical characteristics KRAS mutations were associated with an increased incidence of lung and bone metastases and decreased incidence of adrenal metastases; PIK3CA mutations were marginally correlated with mucinous tumors (p = 0.05). In the univariate analysis, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations were strongly associated. Advanced Duke's stage (p<0.0001) and KRAS mutations (p = 0.01) were the only significant independent predictors of poor survival (Cox proportional hazards model). Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a trend toward shorter progression-free survival when treated with anti-EGFR therapies (p = 0.07). Eighteen of 78 assessable patients (23%) treated with PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis inhibitors achieved stable disease [SD] ≥6 months or complete response/partial response (CR/PR), only one of whom were in the subgroup (N = 15) with PIK3CA mutations, perhaps because 10 of these 15 patients (67%) had coexisting KRAS mutations. No SD ≥6 months/CR/PR was observed in the 10 patients treated with mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway targeting drugs. Conclusions KRAS and PIK3CA mutations frequently coexist in patients with colorectal cancer, and are associated with clinical characteristics and outcome. Overcoming resistance may require targeting both pathways."

Global systems have been established to monitor the evolution and impact of influenza viruses, yet regional analysis of surveillance findings has been limited. This study describes epidemiological and virological characteristics of influenza during 2006-2010 in the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region.Influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza virus data were obtained from the 14 countries with National Influenza Centres. Data were obtained directly from countries and from FluNet, the web-based tool of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. National influenza surveillance and participation in the global system increased over the five years. Peaks in ILI reporting appeared to be coincident with the proportion of influenza positive specimens. Temporal patterns of ILI activity and the proportion of influenza positive specimens were clearly observed in temperate countries: Mongolia, Japan and the Republic of Korea in the northern hemisphere, and Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia (France) in the southern hemisphere. Two annual peaks in activity were observed in China from 2006 through the first quarter of 2009. A temporal pattern was less evident in tropical countries, where influenza activity was observed year-round. Influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of viruses reported between 2006 and 2009, but an equal proportion of influenza A and influenza B viruses was detected in 2010.Despite differences in surveillance methods and intensity, commonalities in ILI and influenza virus circulation patterns were identified. Patterns suggest that influenza circulation may be dependent on a multitude of factors including seasonality and population movement. Dominant strains in Southeast Asian countries were later detected in other countries. Thus, timely reporting and regional sharing of information about influenza may serve as an early warning, and may assist countries to anticipate the potential severity and burden associated with incoming strains."
https://openalex.org/W1995455180,"The Senepol cattle breed (SEN) was created in the early XX(th) century from a presumed cross between a European (EUT) breed (Red Poll) and a West African taurine (AFT) breed (N'Dama). Well adapted to tropical conditions, it is also believed trypanotolerant according to its putative AFT ancestry. However, such origins needed to be verified to define relevant husbandry practices and the genetic background underlying such adaptation needed to be characterized.We genotyped 153 SEN individuals on 47,365 SNPs and combined the resulting data with those available on 18 other populations representative of EUT, AFT and Zebu (ZEB) cattle. We found on average 89% EUT, 10.4% ZEB and 0.6% AFT ancestries in the SEN genome. We further looked for footprints of recent selection using standard tests based on the extent of haplotype homozygosity. We underlined i) three footprints on chromosome (BTA) 01, two of which are within or close to the polled locus underlying the absence of horns and ii) one footprint on BTA20 within the slick hair coat locus, involved in thermotolerance. Annotation of these regions allowed us to propose three candidate genes to explain the observed signals (TIAM1, GRIK1 and RAI14).Our results do not support the accepted concept about the AFT origin of SEN breed. Initial AFT ancestry (if any) might have been counter-selected in early generations due to breeding objectives oriented in particular toward meat production and hornless phenotype. Therefore, SEN animals are likely susceptible to African trypanosomes which questions the importation of SEN within the West African tsetse belt, as promoted by some breeding societies. Besides, our results revealed that SEN breed is predominantly a EUT breed well adapted to tropical conditions and confirmed the importance in thermotolerance of the slick locus."
https://openalex.org/W2063859820,"Anecdotal evidence suggested that some outbreaks of aggression and violence may be related to a fear of being laughed at and ridiculed. The present study examined the potential association of the fear of other persons' laughter (gelotophobia) with emotion-related deficits predisposing for aggression, anger and aggression proneness, and its overlaps with relevant mental disorders.Gelotophobic individuals were compared to a non-phobic control group with respect to emotion regulation skills and strategies, alexithymia, anger proneness, and aggressive behavior. Social phobia was diagnosed using the Structural Clinical Interview (SCID-I) for DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition). Additionally, the SCID-II modules for Cluster A Personality Disorders, which includes schizoid, paranoid, and schizotypal personality disorder were administered to all participants. The findings show that gelotophobia is associated with deficits in the typical handling of an individual's own affective states, greater anger proneness and more aggressive behavior according to self-report as compared to non-phobic individuals. 80% of the subjects in the gelotophobia group had an additional diagnosis of social phobia and/or Cluster A personality disorder. The additional diagnoses did not predict additional variance of anger or aggressive behavior as compared to gelotophobia alone.Features related to aggression and violence that are inherent in mental disorders such as social phobia and Cluster A personality disorders may be particularly evident in the symptom of fear of other persons' laughter."

In this study, a concept EdK was introduced. A test procedure of using the ISO 14852 method and detecting the evolved carbon dioxide as an analytical parameter was developed, and the calculated EdK was used as an indicator for the ultimate biodegradability of materials. Starch and polyethylene used as reference materials were defined as the EdK values of 100 and 0, respectively. Natural soil samples were inoculated into bioreactors, followed by determining the rates of biodegradation of the reference materials and 15 commercial BDPs over a 2-week test period. Finally, a formula was deduced to calculate the value of EdK for each material. The EdK values of the tested materials have a positive correlation to their biodegradation rates in the simulated soil environment, and they indicated the relative biodegradation rate of each material among all the tested materials. Therefore, the EdK was shown to be a reliable indicator for quantitatively evaluating the potential biodegradability of BDPs in the natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2087099306,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is a spirochetal pathogen with limited metabolic capabilities that survives under highly disparate host-specific conditions. However, the borrelial genome encodes several proteins of the mevalonate pathway (MP) that utilizes acetyl-CoA as a substrate leading to intermediate metabolites critical for biogenesis of peptidoglycan and post-translational modifications of proteins. In this study, we analyzed the MP and contributions of acetate in modulation of adaptive responses in B. burgdorferi. Reverse-transcription PCR revealed that components of the MP are transcribed as individual open reading frames. Immunoblot analysis using monospecific sera confirmed synthesis of members of the MP in B. burgdorferi. The rate-limiting step of the MP is mediated by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) via conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Recombinant borrelial HMGR exhibited a Km value of 132 µM with a Vmax of 1.94 µmol NADPH oxidized minute−1 (mg protein)−1 and was inhibited by statins. Total protein lysates from two different infectious, clonal isolates of B. burgdorferi grown under conditions that mimicked fed-ticks (pH 6.8/37°C) exhibited increased levels of HMGR while other members of the MP were elevated under unfed-tick (pH 7.6/23°C) conditions. Increased extra-cellular acetate gave rise to elevated levels of MP proteins along with RpoS, CsrABb and their respective regulons responsible for mediating vertebrate host-specific adaptation. Both lactone and acid forms of two different statins inhibited growth of B. burgdorferi strain B31, while overexpression of HMGR was able to partially overcome that inhibition. In summary, these studies on MP and contributions of acetate to host-specific adaptation have helped identify potential metabolic targets that can be manipulated to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease."
https://openalex.org/W2096229762,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is among the accessory V. cholerae virulence factors that may contribute to disease pathogenesis in humans. VCC, encoded by hlyA gene, belongs to the most common class of bacterial toxins, known as pore-forming toxins (PFTs). V. cholerae infects and kills Caenorhabditis elegans via cholerae toxin independent manner. VCC is required for the lethality, growth retardation and intestinal cell vacuolation during the infection. However, little is known about the host gene expression responses against VCC. To address this question we performed a microarray study in C. elegans exposed to V. cholerae strains with intact and deleted hlyA genes.Many of the VCC regulated genes identified, including C-type lectins, Prion-like (glutamine [Q]/asparagine [N]-rich)-domain containing genes, genes regulated by insulin/IGF-1-mediated signaling (IIS) pathway, were previously reported as mediators of innate immune response against other bacteria in C. elegans. Protective function of the subset of the genes up-regulated by VCC was confirmed using RNAi. By means of a machine learning algorithm called FastMEDUSA, we identified several putative VCC induced immune regulatory transcriptional factors and transcription factor binding motifs. Our results suggest that VCC is a major virulence factor, which induces a wide variety of immune response- related genes during V. cholerae infection in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1983110710,"Background In April 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a list of “priority medicines” for maternal and child health based on 1) the global burden of disease and 2) evidence of efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of these priority medicines on national essential medicines lists. Methods and Findings All essential medicines lists published since 1999 were selected from the WHO website collection. The most-up-to date list for each country was then selected, resulting in 89 unique country lists. Each list was evaluated for inclusion of medicines (chemical entity, concentration, and dosage form) on the Priority Medicines List. There was global variation in the listing of the Priority Medicines. The most frequently listed medicine was paracetamol, on 94% (84/89) of lists. Sodium chloride, gentamicin and oral rehydration solution were on 93% (83/89) of lists. The least frequently listed medicine was the children's antimalarial rectal artesunate, on 8% of lists (7/89); artesunate injection was on 16% (14/89) of lists. Pediatric artemisinin combination therapy, as dispersible tablets or flexible oral solid dosage form, appeared on 36% (32/89) of lists. Procaine benzylpenicillin, for treatment of pediatric pneumonia and neonatal sepsis, was on 50% (45/89) of the lists. Zinc, for treatment of diarrhoea in children, was included on only 15% (13/89) of lists. For prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in women, oxytocin was more prevalent on the lists than misoprostol; they were included on 55 (62%) and 31 (35%) of lists, respectively. Cefixime, for treatment of uncomplicated anogenital gonococcal infection in woman was on 26% (23/89) of lists. Magnesium sulfate injection for treatment of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was on 50% (45/89) of the lists. Conclusions The findings suggest that countries need to urgently amend their lists to provide all priority medicines as part of the efforts to improve maternal and child health."
https://openalex.org/W2131437189,"Background Abnormal expression of the liver peptide hormone hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, contributes to the pathogenesis of anemia in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since little is known about the mechanisms that control hepcidin expression during states of intestinal inflammation, we sought to shed light on this issue using mouse models. Methodology/Principal Findings Hepcidin expression was evaluated in two types of intestinal inflammation caused by innate immune activation—dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in wild-type mice and the spontaneous colitis occurring in T-bet/Rag2-deficient (TRUC) mice. The role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α was investigated by in vivo neutralization, and by treatment of a hepatocyte cell line, as well as mice, with the recombinant cytokine. Expression and activation of Smad1, a positive regulator of hepcidin transcription, were assessed during colitis and following administration or neutralization of TNFα. Hepcidin expression progressively decreased with time during DSS colitis, correlating with changes in systemic iron distribution. TNFα inhibited hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes and non-colitic mice, while TNFα neutralization during DSS colitis increased it. Similar results were obtained in TRUC mice. These effects involved a TNFα-dependent decrease in Smad1 protein but not mRNA. Conclusions/Significance TNFα inhibits hepcidin expression in two distinct types of innate colitis, with down-regulation of Smad1 protein playing an important role in this process. This inhibitory effect of TNFα may be superseded by other factors in the context of T cell-mediated colitis given that in the latter form of intestinal inflammation hepcidin is usually up-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1981559856,"Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are known to harbour intracellular bacteria from several phylogenetic groups that can develop both mutualistic and pathogenic relationships to the host. This is of particular importance for public health as tick derived bacteria can potentially be transmitted to mammals, including humans, where e.g. Rickettsia or Coxiella act as severe pathogens. Exact molecular taxonomic identification of tick associated prokaryotes is a necessary prerequisite of the investigation of their relationship to both the tick and possible vertebrate hosts. Previously, an intracellular bacterium had been isolated from a monosexual, parthenogenetically reproducing laboratory colony of females of the hard tick, Ixodes woodi Bishopp, and had preliminarily been characterized as a ""Rickettsiella-related bacterium"". In the present molecular taxonomic study that is based on phylogenetic reconstruction from both 16 S ribosomal RNA and protein-encoding marker sequences complemented with likelihood-based significance testing, the bacterium from I. woodi has been identified as a strain of the taxonomic species Rickettsiella grylli. It is the first time that a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach based on a four genes comprising MLST scheme has been implemented in order to classify a Rickettsiella-like bacterium to this species. The study demonstrated that MLST holds potential for a better resolution of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Rickettsiella, but requires sequence determination from further Rickettsiella-like bacteria in order to complete the current still fragmentary picture of Rickettsiella systematics."

The centromere sites, composed of multiple repeat elements, are specifically recognized in a cooperative manner by CBPs. The CBPs show little to no sequence homology, and hence, bacterial plasmid partition (par) systems can be categorized based on NTPase type. In this way, the par systems, which are encoded on a cassette on the respective plasmid, have been delineated into three main types: I, II, and III (3.Schumacher M.A. Structural biology of plasmid partition: uncovering the molecular mechanisms of DNA segregation.Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Type I systems are the most abundant and contain NTPase proteins that harbor deviant Walker A-type ATPase folds, whereas type II systems utilize actin-like NTPases, and type III systems use tubulin-like NTPases (6.Anand S.P.

Type I par systems can be further subdivided into types Ia and Ib based on size and limited sequence homologies of the Par proteins.

Type II and III systems are currently the best understood partition systems from a molecular standpoint. Studies have shown that type II CBPs have ribbon-helix-helix DNA-binding motifs and bind their centromere repeats to form a higher order partition complex superstructure (10.Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C.

The superstructure is of the correct dimension to engulf each end of the dynamically unstable actin-like type II ParM NTPase filament, which forms in the presence of NTP. The stabilized capped filament grows by the addition of ParM molecules, allowing the attached plasmids to be “pushed” to opposite cell poles (12.Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H.

P1 ParA structures show that the N-terminal 100-residue region, which is not present in type Ib NTPases, forms a long helix (α1), followed by a winged helix-turn-helix motif. Unexpectedly, α1 functions in dimerization, and the structures and biochemical data indicate that P1 ParA is dimeric, even in its apo state. The P1 ParA dimer is flexible, and the data suggest that the role of ADP and ATP binding is to lock in specific dimeric states that presumably stabilize a conformation active for transcriptional regulation and partition, respectively (18.Dunham T.D.

The structure of δ was determined only in the presence of ATP. This structure reveals a dimer; however, biochemical data indicate that the apoprotein may also be dimeric. Hence, how ATP binding mediates partition by type Ib NTPases is currently unclear. Data indicate that both P1 ParA and δ form polymers in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism involved in NTP-dependent polymerization by any type I NTPases and the role(s) it plays in type I partition are not well understood. Arguably the best studied type Ib partition system is that harbored on the multidrug resistance plasmid TP228, which was originally identified in Salmonella newport (20.Hayes F. The partition system of the multidrug resistance plasmid TP228 includes a novel protein that epitomizes an evolutionarily distinct subgroup of the ParA superfamily.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The TP228 plasmid confers resistance to a range of antibiotics, including kanamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, as well as mercuric ions (21.Jones C.S.

This segregation stability was shown to require a type Ib partition system encoding two proteins, the 22-kDa ParF protein and the 8.6-kDa ParG protein (20.Hayes F.

Subsequently, it was demonstrated that ParG functions as the CBP that binds cooperatively to the parH centromere site to form a partition complex, which recruits ParF (23.Wu M. Zampini M. Bussiek M. Hoischen C. Diekmann S. Hayes F. Segrosome assembly at the pliable parH centromere.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 5082-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24.Zampini M. Derome A. Bailey S.E. Barillà D. Hayes F. Recruitment of the ParG segregation protein to different affinity DNA sites.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3832-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). ParG plays a second critical role in partition by stimulating the ATPase activity of ParF. This function is imparted by the flexible N-terminal tail of ParG (25.Barillà D. Carmelo E. Hayes F. The tail of the ParG DNA segregation protein remodels ParF polymers and enhances ATP hydrolysis via an arginine finger-like motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the role that ATP hydrolysis plays in type I partition is unclear, it has been demonstrated that the adenine nucleotide-bound state of ParF determines its function. Specifically, ATP binding stimulates ParF polymer formation, which is critical for DNA segregation, whereas ADP inhibits polymer formation and partition. Thus, the combined data indicate that an adenine nucleotide-mediated polymerization/depolymerization cycle drives TP228 partition by ParF. To understand the structural basis for this process, we performed structural, biochemical, and cellular studies on the ParF protein. TP228 ParF protein was expressed and purified as described previously (15.Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F. Bacterial DNA segregation dynamics mediated by the polymerizing protein ParF.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, for purification of each ParF protein (wild-type and mutants), cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Proteins were purified in one step using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Because of the low solubility of ParF, it was concentrated immediately after purification and exchanged into a buffer (using a Centricon concentrator) consisting of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The protein was concentrated to between 10 and 15 mg/ml for crystallization. To reach these concentrations, small volumes were concentrated each time. ADP or AMPPCP was added at a 1:1 stoichiometry per ParF subunit for crystallization. ParF-ADP crystal form 1 was obtained using 30% PEG 4000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0). These crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, with a = 39.5, b = 78.3, and c = 68.5 Å and β = 93°. ParF-ADP crystal form 2 was grown using 25% PEG 6000 and 0.1 m NaCl. These crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, with a = 54.7, b = 80.2, and c = 67.0 Å and β = 112.6°. ParF-AMPPCP crystal form 1 was obtained using 1 m NaCl and 10% PEG 6000. These crystals are orthorhombic, space group C2221, with a = 86.9, b = 121.6, and c = 87.4 Å. ParF-AMPPCP crystal form 2 was grown using 15% PEG 3000 and 0.1 m NaCl. These crystals are tetragonal, space group I422, with a = b = 87.6 and c = 150.0 Å. X-ray intensity data for all crystal forms were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 and processed with MOSFLM (see Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for ParF-ADP and ParF-AMPPCP complexesComplexParF-ADPParF-ADPParF-AMPPCPParF-AMPPCPData collection Space groupP21P21I422C2221 Cell constantsa = 39.5, b = 78.3, c = 68.5 Å β = 93.0a = 54.7, b = 80.2, c = 67.0 Å β = 112.6a = b = 87.6, c = 150.0 Åa = 86.9, b = 121.6, c = 87.4 Å Molecules in ASUaASU, asymmetric unit; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.2212 Resolution (Å)78.3-1.8080.1-2.4575.6-2.9943.2-2.90 Overall Rsym (%)bRsym = ΣΣ|Ihkl − Ihkl(j)|/ΣIhkl, where Ihkl(j) is the observed intensity and Ihkl is the final average value of intensity.5.6 (39.6)cValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.7.9 (36.6)6.9 (43.8)11.9 (44.2) Overall I/σ(I)13.0 (2.8)8.8 (2.2)17.2 (2.4)6.1 (1.8) No. total reflections82,03240,82562,43979,603 No. unique reflections34,50820,740676311,316Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)78.3-1.8080.1-2.4575.6-2.9943.2-2.90 Rwork/Rfree (%)dRwork = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo| and Rfree = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo|, where all reflections belong to a test set of 5% randomly selected data.19.9/24.320.2/24.027.8/29.623.5/26.2 r.m.s.d.

Extensive rebuilding and refinement were carried out to obtain the final model composed of residues 1–206 of both subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, 239 solvent molecules, two magnesium ions, and two ADP molecules. The structure has a final Rwork/Rfree of 19.9/24.3% to 1.80 Å resolution. One subunit of ParF-ADP crystal form 1 (minus the solvent molecules and ADP) was used to solve ParF-ADP crystal form 2 using MolRep. The model was refined to a final Rwork/Rfree of 20.2/24.0% to 2.45 Å resolution and contains residues 1–206 of both subunits, two magnesium ions, 220 water molecules, and two ADP molecules. ParF-AMPPCP crystal form 1 was solved by molecular replacement with MolRep using the high resolution ParF-ADP structure in which the ADP molecule, magnesium ions, and waters were removed as a search model (26.Brünger A.T.

Improved methods for building protein models in electron density maps and the location of errors in these models.Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). The structure was refined to a final Rwork/Rfree of 23.5/26.2% to 2.90 Å resolution and contains residues 1–139 and 144–206 of both subunits of the dimer, two magnesium ions, and two AMPPCP molecules. ParF-AMPPCP crystal form 2 was solved by molecular replacement using one subunit from the ParF-AMPPCP crystal form 1 structure. The structure was refined to a final Rwork/Rfree of 27.8/29.6% to 2.9 Å resolution and contains residues 1–139 and 144–206, one magnesium ion, and one AMPPCP molecule. Relevant data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. Wild-type and mutant ParF protein polymerization was measured by DLS in a Malvern Zetasizer Nano system (helium-neon laser, 633 nm). Proteins were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected and used for experiments. A 47-μl aliquot of protein (2.16 μm in 30 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) was added to a 50-ml quartz cuvette and incubated at 30 °C in the Zetasizer chamber. ATP (500 μm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) were then added to a final volume of 50 μl. Values obtained every 20 s were plotted. The intensity or count rate measures the amount of scattered light expressed as photons detected per s. The intensity is proportional to the size and concentration of the scattering particles. Wild-type or mutant ParF proteins (6–8 μm) in 30 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol were incubated in the absence or presence of nucleotides (2 mm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were collected for gel analysis, 10 μl were kept for Bradford quantitation, and the remaining supernatant was carefully aspirated. The pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of water. Protein levels in the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The ATP-binding activity of wild-type and mutant ParF proteins was assessed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements with the fluorescent ATP analog MANT-ATP using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer. The assay was performed in buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.8 mm MgCl2. The excitation wavelength (λex) was 356 nm, and the emission wavelength (λem) was 442 nm. The MANT-ATP concentration was kept constant (1 μm), and the protein concentration was increased from 0.25 to 7 μm. Ten measurements were taken for each point in the curve, and the average value was plotted against the concentration of the proteins. Thin layer chromatography ATPase assays were performed as described previously (15.Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F. Bacterial DNA segregation dynamics mediated by the polymerizing protein ParF.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Partition assays were performed as described (20.Hayes F. The partition system of the multidrug resistance plasmid TP228 includes a novel protein that epitomizes an evolutionarily distinct subgroup of the ParA superfamily.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFH450 was used as the empty vector, and pFH547 was the construct containing the wild-type parFG cassette. To understand the molecular basis for adenine nucleotide-mediated switching of ParF, we determined the structures of ParF in complex with ADP and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPCP (26.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L.

Improved methods for building protein models in electron density maps and the location of errors in these models.Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). Two different crystal forms of ParF-ADP were obtained, and the structures were solved to 1.80 and 2.45 Å resolution, resulting in Rwork/Rfree values of 19.9/24.3% and 20.2/24.0%, respectively. Both ParF-ADP crystal forms contain two ParF-ADP complexes in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Two different crystal forms of the ParF-AMPPCP complex were also obtained. The ParF-AMPPCP structures were solved to 2.90 and 2.99 Å resolution. The final Rwork/Rfree values of the structures were 23.5/26.2% and 27.8/29.6%, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). Crystal form 1 contains two ParF-AMPPCP subunits in the asymmetric unit, whereas crystal form 2 possesses one complex in the asymmetric unit. The ParF structure is composed of a single domain with a central seven-stranded twisted β-sheet surrounded on each side by four α-helices with the following topology: β1 (residues 1–8)-α1 (residues 14–29)-β2 (residues 32–39)-α2 (residues 43–49)-β3 (residues 55–60)-α3 (residues 64–73)-β4 (residues 77–85)-α4 (residues 89–98)-β5 (residues 99–106)-α5 (residues 111–123)-β6 (residues 131–139)-α6 (residues 145–157)-β7 (residues 159–163)-α7 (residues 171–178)-310 (residues 182–184)-α8 (residues 189–205) (Fig. 1A). Database searches showed that the ParF structure displays the strongest similarity to the E. coli MinD and Thermus thermophilus Soj structures (28.Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Löwe J.

The ParF structure can be maximally superimposed onto the T. thermophilus Soj structure (Protein Data Bank code 1WCV) with a root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å and onto the E. coli MinD structure with a root mean square deviation of 2.1 Å (code 3R9I) (Fig. 1B). The functionally related plasmid partition proteins δ and P1 ParA superimpose with root mean square deviations of 2.5 and 2.6 Å, respectively (18.Dunham T.D. Xu W. Funnell B.E.

These findings are consistent with previous predictions suggesting that ParF and its immediate relatives form a discrete subgroup of the ParA superfamily, which is evolutionarily more closely related to MinD than to P1 ParA (20.Hayes F.

ParF is a member of the subgroup of Walker A superfamily-containing proteins that harbor a “deviant” Walker box motif, GKGGHGK(S/T) (32.Lutkenhaus J. Sundaramoorthy M.

The Walker A superfamily is functionally diverse, with members performing roles including DNA segregation, electron transport, and regulation of cell division. Structures of Walker proteins have shown that the Walker A motif is located at the N terminus of an α-helix and is involved in interactions with the phosphate groups of ATP (32.Lutkenhaus J.

A family of ATPases involved in active partitioning of diverse bacterial plasmids.Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The deviant Walker A motif is distinguished from the standard Walker A box by the presence of the second lysine near the N-terminal end of the motif, which is also involved in ATP binding. The ParF deviant Walker A motif consists of residues 9–16 (PKGGSGKT). Also present in Walker box proteins is a motif called the Walker B box. The residues in this sequence are less conserved than the Walker A motif. Indeed, there is considerable variability in the sequence of the Walker B motif, and its only conserved feature is the presence of a negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu), followed by several hydrophobic or aromatic residues. The Walker B motif functions in magnesium binding and catalysis and is located on a strand near the Walker A motif. In ParF, the Walker B motif is composed of residues 73–83 (Fig. 2A). Two different crystal forms of the ParF-ADP complex were obtained. No significant ParF o"

To identify novel CRC loci, we conducted a genome-wide linkage scan in 356 white families with no evidence of defective MMR (i.e., no loss of tumor expression of MMR proteins, no microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors, or no evidence of linkage to MMR genes). Families were ascertained via the Colon Cancer Family Registry multi-site NCI-supported consortium (Colon CFR), the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Memorial University of Newfoundland. A total of 1,612 individuals (average 5.0 per family including 2.2 affected) were genotyped using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism linkage arrays; parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis used MERLIN in a priori-defined family groups. Five lod scores greater than 3.0 were observed assuming heterogeneity. The greatest were among families with mean age of diagnosis less than 50 years at 4q21.1 (dominant HLOD = 4.51, α = 0.84, 145.40 cM, rs10518142) and among all families at 12q24.32 (dominant HLOD = 3.60, α = 0.48, 285.15 cM, rs952093). Among families with four or more affected individuals and among clinic-based families, a common peak was observed at 15q22.31 (101.40 cM, rs1477798; dominant HLOD = 3.07, α = 0.29; dominant HLOD = 3.03, α = 0.32, respectively). Analysis of families with only two affected individuals yielded a peak at 8q13.2 (recessive HLOD = 3.02, α = 0.51, 132.52 cM, rs1319036). These previously unreported linkage peaks demonstrate the continued utility of family-based data in complex traits and suggest that new CRC risk alleles remain to be elucidated."

The catalytic F1 subunit complex α3β3 and FO components subunits (a, c, e, f, g, and A6L (or ATP8)) are connected by a central stalk (including F1 subunits γ, δ, and ϵ) and a peripheral stalk (including OSCP, subunit b, subunit d, and F6) (5.Rees D.M.

This view is supported by the relatively high abundance of the separate components, which would not normally be expected for assembly intermediates (12.Klodmann J. Senkler M. Rode C. Braun H.P.

Tzagoloff A. Identification of two nuclear genes (ATP11, ATP12) required for assembly of the yeast F1-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The amount of F1 subunits released from human cultured cells mitochondria by osmotic shock has been used as a marker of ATP synthase disassembly status (17.Cortés-Hernández P. Vázquez-Memije M.E.

Chem. 2007; 282: 1051-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of intact F1FO ATP synthase in BN gels from plants has been reported to be sensitive to salt concentration during dodecylmaltoside-assisted membrane solubilization, and buffer changes were found to partially stabilize the dodecylmaltoside-assisted solubilization of intact plant F1FO ATP synthase (8.Jänsch L.

Many proteomic reports in plants, however, have noted the differential sensitivity of plant F1 subunits to a range of biological stress treatments. This suggests the F1 subcomplex may need an in vivo pathway for repair or replacement distinct from what is required for the FO subcomplex. Stress treatments including H2O2, paraquat, chilling and drought have been found to enhance the abundance of plant mitochondrial F1 subunit breakdown products (24.Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. The impact of oxidative stress on Arabidopsis mitochondria.Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 25.Taylor N.L. Heazlewood J.L. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Differential impact of environmental stresses on the pea mitochondrial proteome.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1122-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Coordination of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes expression of F1FO ATP synthase during sugar stress has also been postulated to occur at the level of protein complex assembly of F1. Sugar starvation caused the limited supply of nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory enzyme complexes including the β subunit of F1FO ATP synthase, which then required the degradation of accumulated mitochondrial-encoded subunits such as the F1 α subunit to build stoichiometric ATP synthase complexes (26.Giegé P. Sweetlove L.J. Cognat V. Leaver C.J. Coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial genome expression during mitochondrial biogenesis in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1497-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Degradation of specific subunits or subcomplexes and/or modular assembly of ATP synthase might thus be a way for plants to adapt to differential damage of subunits in changing environments and altered demands during plant development. However, the biological implications of significant amounts of free F1 in vivo in plants would be significant. In principle, F1 not governed by membrane potential could enhance ATP hydrolysis creating a futile cycle inside mitochondria and lowering the efficiency of ATP synthesis under such circumstances. To determine if apparently free F1 arose from breakage of F1FO in vitro or was a separate subcomplex in vivo required the isolation of complexes and subcomplexes to determine their relative rates of assembly. The typical method to investigate complex assembly had been by a radio-labeled pulse-chase strategy which can monitor different subunits chased into protein complexes in organello or in vivo (6.Kane P.M.

However, this approach only studies a tiny proportion of the newly synthesized complex in cells or isolated mitochondria. Recent research in yeast using these approaches has shown the assembly of F1FO ATP synthase involves two separate but coordinately regulated pathways that converge at the final stage (28.Rak M. Tzagoloff A. F1-dependent translation of mitochondrially encoded Atp6p and Atp8p subunits of yeast ATP synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Modular assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At least three modules: F1, the c subunit ring and the subunit a/A6L/stator sub-complex are thought to be assembly intermediates (29.Rak M. Gokova S. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Free F1 has also been shown to play an activation role in Atp6 and Atp8 translation (29.Rak M. Gokova S. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and increased degradation of the a subunit has been discovered in HeLa cells lacking F1 (30.Rak M. McStay G.P. Fujikawa M. Yoshida M. Manfredi G. Tzagoloff A.

However, the significance of the earlier evidence of appreciable amounts of apparently free F1 in mammal and plant mitochondrial extracts has not been incorporated into this model based on radio-labeled pulse-chase experiments. Here we have used a strategy to look at the progressive incorporation rate of a stable isotope (15N) into Arabidopsis mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix proteins to understand the assembly model of F1FO ATP synthase in vivo and the nature of the significant amount of apparently free F1 in plant mitochondria. Arabidopsis cell suspension was cultured in growth medium (1×Murashige and Skoog medium without vitamins, 3% sucrose [w/v], 0.5 mg/liter naphthalene acetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, pH 5.8) at 22 °C under continuous light conditions and a light intensity of 90 μmol m−2 s−1 with orbital shaking at 120 rpm. Cultures were maintained in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks by the inoculation of 20–25 ml of 7-day-old cells into 100 ml of new medium. The same growth medium without nitrogen (no ammonium nitrate or potassium nitrate) was used to wash the 7-day-old cell culture three times before transfer to 15N growth medium. Ammonium-15N nitrate-15N (1.69 g/liter) and potassium nitrate-15N (1.92 g/liter) (98% 15N, Sigma) were added to growth medium without nitrogen to form the 15N growth medium. 15N-labeled cells were collected onto filter paper at 96, 120, and 168 h using vacuum filtration. Fresh cells (20–25 g) from each time point and replicate were dispersed in digestion solution (0.4% [w/v] Onozuka cellulase RS, 0.05% [w/v] Kyowa pectolyase Y-23, 0.4 m mannitol, MES 0.7 g/liter, pH 5.7) with gentle shaking in the dark for 3 h at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, the supernatant decanted and the resuspended protoplast pellet dispersed in digestion solution, without enzymes, by swirling and repeating the centrifugation. Washed protoplasts were then resuspended in extraction buffer (0.4 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 3 mm EDTA and 0.1% [w/v] BSA, pH 7.5) and homogenized 5–9 times in a Dounce 0.12 mm homogenizer. Extraction buffer containing broken protoplasts was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min and the supernatant recovered for centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The organelle pellet was resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of mannitol wash buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES and 0.1% [w/v] BSA pH 7.5) using a paint brush, and then pipetted onto two 35 ml Percoll step gradients (40, 25, and 18% [w/v] Percoll in mannitol wash buffer). The gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min with slow braking. Mitochondria, which form a yellow-brown band at the 40 and 25% interface, were collected and diluted in sucrose wash buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES, pH 7.5). Diluted mitochondria were centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 15 min with slow braking. The pellet was collected and diluted again in sucrose wash buffer. Preparation of mitochondria from 20-day-old shoots of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis seedlings was performed according to (31.Lee C.P. Eubel H. O'Toole N. Millar A.H. Heterogeneity of the mitochondrial proteome for photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic Arabidopsis metabolism.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1297-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were quantified with the Bradford assay and were used for in vitro imports or BN gels, or made into aliquots corresponding to 1 mg of mitochondrial protein and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Mitochondria equivalent to 3 mg of protein were freshly prepared from 120 h 15N labeled cell cultures and were subjected to a series of treatments. Mitochondria equivalent to 1 mg of the protein were directly solubilized without freezing and separated by BN-PAGE. Mitochondria equivalent to another 1 mg of protein were frozen and thawed three times, half were further treated by incubating at 50 °C for 15 min before samples were washed, solubilized, and separated by BN-PAGE. The relative abundance of F1 and FO subcomplexes in Coomassie-stained gel images was quantified by Image J. Mitochondria corresponding to 3 mg of protein isolated from 120 h 15N labeled cells were used for fractionation of membrane and soluble proteomes. Mitochondria were vortexed at 4 °C for 5 min, with 30 s intervals between every 30 s of vortexing. Two equal aliquots were prepared, one was treated with 150 mm potassium acetate and further vortexed for 5 min while the other aliquot was not treated. These corresponded to salt-treated and untreated samples. Sucrose wash buffer was added to both aliquots to fill the centrifuge tubes, samples were vortexed, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Supernatant proteins were concentrated using a 3 kDa cut-off filter (Ultracel, Amicon). Membrane and soluble fractions from salt-treated and untreated samples were then solubilized and separated by BN-PAGE. Mitochondrial aliquots were washed with 2 ml of sucrose wash buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES, pH 7.5) and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of digitonin solubilization buffer (30 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10% [v/v] glycerol, digitonin 50 mg/ml). Samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min after incubation for 20 min on ice to remove insoluble material, and were subsequently supplemented with 5 μl of a Coomassie Blue solution (5% [w/v] Coomassie G250 from Serva in 750 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid). Coomassie Blue-treated protein samples were directly loaded onto BN gels. Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously (11.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Blue native electrophoresis for isolation of membrane-protein complexes in enzymatically active form.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). Gradient gels (4.5–16% [w/v] polyacrylamide) were used for the first BN dimension as described previously (22.Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. New insights into the respiratory chain of plant mitochondria. Supercomplexes and a unique composition of complex II.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A second dimension Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel consisting of a 4% stacking gel and a 12% separation gel was used for separation of polypeptides. Electrophoresis parameters and Coomassie staining were carried out as described previously (22.Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. New insights into the respiratory chain of plant mitochondria.

Fractions of membrane and soluble proteomes from 0.5–1 mg of mitochondrial protein isolated from cell culture and from plant shoots were separated by BN-PAGE. In-gel ATP hydrolysis activity assays were performed according to Ref. 16.Wittig I. Karas M. Schägger H.

Mass spectrometric analyses and determination of the amounts of natural abundance (NA) and 15N-labeled peptides (H) were conducted as previously described (32.Li, L., Nelson, C. J., Solheim, C., Whelan, J., Millar, A. H. (2012) Determining degradation and synthesis rates of Arabidopsis proteins using the kinetics of progressive 15N labeling of 2D gel-separated protein spots. Mol. Cell Proteomics, doi: M111.010025Google Scholar). This allowed the amount of the unlabeled (NA) peptides as a fraction of the total amount of labeled and unlabeled peptides combined (NA+H) to be calculated. This ratio (NA/(NA+H)) was used as a proxy for protein turnover rate. Peptides were analyzed with an UltraFlex III MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). In-gel digested peptides were reconstituted in 5 μl of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). A total of 2 μl of each sample was then spotted onto a MTP 384 MALDI target plate and mixed with 2 μl of a matrix solution (90% [v/v] ACN, 10% [v/v] of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution, supplemented with 0.01% [v/v] TFA). Dried spots were overlaid with 10 μl of cold washing buffer (10 mm NH4H2PO4, 0.1% [v/v] TFA) and allowed to stand for 10 s before removal by pipette. Spots were analyzed at 50–85% laser intensity with up to 1200 shots for MS analysis per spot. Ions between 700 and 4000 m/z were selected for MS/MS experiments using 3% additional laser power. Masses corresponding to trypsin autolysis were excluded from analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Biotools (Bruker Daltonics) and an in-house Arabidopsis database comprising ATH1.pep (release 9) from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and the Arabidopsis mitochondrial and plastid protein sets (33621 sequences; 13487170 residues), using the Mascot search engine version 2.3 and utilizing error tolerances of ±1.2 Da for MS and ±0.6 Da for MS/MS; “Max Missed Cleavages” set to 1; variable modifications of oxidation (Met) and carbamidomethyl (Cys). Only protein matches with ion scores greater than 40 were used for analysis (p < 0.05). For all spots, the 0 and 24 h time points were used for both MS and MS/MS analyses for protein IDs whereas only the MS data were analyzed for 96, 120, and 168 h. Search results were exported to CSV format for each spot. To calculate heavy label incorporation and the relative abundance of NA and H peptide populations to yield NA/(NA+H), MALDI-TOF/TOF MS data were exported to mzXML files (CompassXport 3.0 (Bruker)), and were subsequently converted to text files using the ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework 6.21. Text files were then parsed using a script written in Mathematica 7.0 (Wolfram Research) for further analysis. Isotopic envelopes were fitted using a two population model consisting of NA and H fractions with the open source program Isodist as previously described (33.Sperling E. Bunner A.E. Sykes M.T.

We have now investigated the involvement of 14-3-3σ in the termination of NF-κB signal in mammary cells and its putative role in cancer relapse and metastasis. Our results show that 14-3-3σ regulates nuclear export of p65-NF-κB following chronic TNFα stimulation. Restoration of 14-3-3σ in breast cancer cells reduces migration capacity and metastatic abilities in vivo. By microarray analysis, we have identified a genetic signature that responds to TNFα in a 14-3-3σ-dependent manner and significantly associates with different breast and other types of cancer. By interrogating public databases, we have found that over-expression of this signature correlates with poor relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. Finally, screening of 96 human breast tumors showed that NF-κB activation strictly correlates with the absence of 14-3-3σ and it is significantly associated with worse prognosis in the multivariate analysis. Our findings identify a genetic signature that is important for breast cancer prognosis and for future personalized treatments based on NF-κB targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2057445890,"The Werner protein (WRNp), a member of the RecQ helicase family, is strongly associated with the nucleolus, as is nucleolin (NCL), an important nucleolar constituent protein. Both WRNp and NCL respond to the effects of DNA damaging agents. Therefore, we have investigated if these nuclear proteins interact and if this interaction has a possible functional significance in DNA damage repair.Here we report that WRNp interacts with the RNA-binding protein, NCL, based on immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescent co-localization in live and fixed cells, and direct binding of purified WRNp to nucleolin. We also map the binding region to the C-terminal domains of both proteins. Furthermore, treatment of U2OS cells with 15 µM of the Topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, causes the dissociation of the nucleolin-Werner complex in the nucleolus, followed by partial re-association in the nucleoplasm. Other DNA damaging agents, such as hydroxyurea, Mitomycin C, and aphidicolin do not have these effects. Nucleolin or its C-terminal fragment affected the helicase, but not the exonuclease activity of WRNp, by inhibiting WRN unwinding of G4 tetraplex DNA structures, as seen in activity assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).These data suggest that nucleolin may regulate G4 DNA unwinding by WRNp, possibly in response to certain DNA damaging agents. We postulate that the NCL-WRNp complex may contain an inactive form of WRNp, which is released from the nucleolus upon DNA damage. Then, when required, WRNp is released from inhibition and can participate in the DNA repair processes."
https://openalex.org/W2149744808,"Information exchange (or signaling) between plants following herbivore damage has recently been shown to affect plant responses to herbivory in relatively simple natural systems. In a large, manipulative field study using three annual plant species (Achyrachaena mollis, Lupinus nanus, and Sinapis arvensis), we tested whether experimental damage to a neighboring conspecific affected a plant's lifetime fitness and interactions with herbivores. By manipulating relatedness between plants, we assessed whether genetic relatedness of neighboring individuals influenced the outcome of having a damaged neighbor. Additionally, in laboratory feeding assays, we assessed whether damage to a neighboring plant specifically affected palatability to a generalist herbivore and, for S. arvensis, a specialist herbivore. Our study suggested a high level of contingency in the outcomes of plant signaling. For example, in the field, damaging a neighbor resulted in greater herbivory to A. mollis, but only when the damaged neighbor was a close relative. Similarly, in laboratory trials, the palatability of S. arvensis to a generalist herbivore increased after the plant was exposed to a damaged neighbor, while palatability to a specialist herbivore decreased. Across all species, damage to a neighbor resulted in decreased lifetime fitness, but only if neighbors were closely related. These results suggest that the outcomes of plant signaling within multi-species neighborhoods may be far more context-specific than has been previously shown. In particular, our study shows that herbivore interactions and signaling between plants are contingent on the genetic relationship between neighboring plants. Many factors affect the outcomes of plant signaling, and studies that clarify these factors will be necessary in order to assess the role of plant information exchange about herbivory in natural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2075006727,"Background Most HIV-seropositive subjects in western countries receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although many aspects of their health have been studied, little is known about their vestibular and balance function. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalences of vestibular and balance impairments among HIV-seropositive and comparable seronegative men and women and to determine if those groups differed. Methods Standard screening tests of vestibular and balance function, including head thrusts, Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, and Romberg balance tests on compliant foam were performed during semiannual study visits of participants who were enrolled in the Baltimore and Washington, D. C. sites of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Results No significant differences by HIV status were found on most tests, but HIV-seropositive subjects who were using HAART had a lower frequency of abnormal Dix-Hallpike nystagmus than HIV-seronegative subjects. A significant number of nonclassical Dix-Hallpike responses were found. Age was associated with Romberg scores on foam with eyes closed. Sex was not associated with any of the test scores. Conclusion These findings suggest that HAART-treated HIV infection has no harmful association with vestibular function in community-dwelling, ambulatory men and women. The association with age was expected, but the lack of association with sex was unexpected. The presence of nonclassical Dix-Hallpike responses might be consistent with central nervous system lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2167438382,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, affects 1.4 million persons in the United States alone. KLF5, a Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family member, is expressed within the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and has been implicated in rapid cell proliferation, migration, and remodeling in a number of tissues. Given these functions, we hypothesized that constitutive Klf5 expression would protect against the development of colitis in vivo. To examine the role of KLF5 in vivo, we used the Villin promoter to target Klf5 to the entire horizontal axis of the small intestine and colon. Villin-Klf5 transgenic mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios and appeared grossly normal to at least 1 year of age. Surprisingly, there were no significant changes in cell proliferation or in the differentiation of any of the intestinal lineages within the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of Villin-Klf5 mice, compared to littermate controls. However, when Villin-Klf5 mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis, they developed less colonic injury and significantly reduced disease activity scores than littermate controls. The mechanism for this decreased injury may come via JAK-STAT signaling, the activation of which was increased in colonic mucosa of DSS treated Villin-Klf5 mice compared to controls. Thus, KLF5 and its downstream mediators may provide therapeutic targets and disease markers for IBD or other diseases characterized by injury and disruption of intestinal epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2010448494,"In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using in situ Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to monitor counter-diffusion crystallization experiments in capillaries. Firstly, we have validated the quality of the DLS signal in thin capillaries, which is comparable to that obtained in standard quartz cuvettes. Then, we have carried out DLS measurements of a counter-diffusion crystallization experiment of glucose isomerase in capillaries of different diameters (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mm) in order to follow the temporal evolution of protein supersaturation. Finally, we have compared DLS data with optical recordings of the progression of the crystallization front and with a simulation model of counter-diffusion in 1D."
https://openalex.org/W2032535801,"The vast majority of animals mate more or less promiscuously. A few mammals, including humans, utilize more restrained mating strategies that entail a longer term affiliation with a single mating partner. Such pair bonding mating strategies have been resistant to genetic analysis because of a lack of suitable model organisms. Prairie voles are small mouse-like rodents that form enduring pair bonds in the wild as well as in the laboratory, and consequently they have been used widely to study social bonding behavior. The lack of targeted genetic approaches in this species however has restricted the study of the molecular and neural circuit basis of pair bonds. As a first step in rendering the prairie vole amenable to reverse genetics, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) lines from prairie vole fibroblasts using retroviral transduction of reprogramming factors. These IPSC lines display the cellular and molecular hallmarks of IPSC cells from other organisms, including mice and humans. Moreover, the prairie vole IPSC lines have pluripotent differentiation potential since they can give rise to all three germ layers in tissue culture and in vivo. These IPSC lines can now be used to develop conditions that facilitate homologous recombination and eventually the generation of prairie voles bearing targeted genetic modifications to study the molecular and neural basis of pair bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W2055300911,"Background Multiple sources of influenza surveillance data are becoming more available; however integration of these data streams for situational awareness of influenza activity is less explored. Methods and Results We applied multivariate time-series methods to sentinel outpatient and school absenteeism surveillance data in Hong Kong during 2004–2009. School absenteeism data and outpatient surveillance data experienced interruptions due to school holidays and changes in public health guidelines during the pandemic, including school closures and the establishment of special designated flu clinics, which in turn provided ‘drop-in’ fever counts surveillance data. A multivariate dynamic linear model was used to monitor influenza activity throughout epidemics based on all available data. The inferred level followed influenza activity closely at different times, while the inferred trend was less competent with low influenza activity. Correlations between inferred level and trend from the multivariate model and reference influenza activity, measured by the product of weekly laboratory influenza detection rates and weekly general practitioner influenza-like illness consultation rates, were calculated and compared with those from univariate models. Over the whole study period, there was a significantly higher correlation (ρ = 0.82, p≤0.02) for the inferred trend based on the multivariate model compared to other univariate models, while the inferred trend from the multivariate model performed as well as the best univariate model in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic period. The inferred trend and level from the multivariate model was able to match, if not outperform, the best univariate model albeit with missing data plus drop-in and drop-out of different surveillance data streams. An overall influenza index combining level and trend was constructed to demonstrate another potential use of the method. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the potential use of multiple streams of influenza surveillance data to promote situational awareness about the level and trend of seasonal and pandemic influenza activity."
https://openalex.org/W2040587319,"In state-dependency, information retrieval is most efficient when the animal is in the same state as it was during the information acquisition. State-dependency has been implicated in a variety of learning and memory processes, but its mechanisms remain to be resolved. Here, mice deficient in AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits were first conditioned to morphine (10 or 20 mg/kg s.c. during eight sessions over four days) using an unbiased procedure, followed by testing for conditioned place preference at morphine states that were the same as or different from the one the mice were conditioned to. In GluA1 wildtype littermate mice the same-state morphine dose produced the greatest expression of place preference, while in the knockout mice no place preference was then detected. Both wildtype and knockout mice expressed moderate morphine-induced place preference when not at the morphine state (saline treatment at the test); in this case, place preference was weaker than that in the same-state test in wildtype mice. No correlation between place preference scores and locomotor activity during testing was found. Additionally, as compared to the controls, the knockout mice showed unchanged sensitization to morphine, morphine drug discrimination and brain regional μ-opioid receptor signal transduction at the G-protein level. However, the knockout mice failed to show increased AMPA/NMDA receptor current ratios in the ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons of midbrain slices after a single injection of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c., sliced prepared 24 h afterwards), in contrast to the wildtype mice. The results indicate impaired drug-induced state-dependency in GluA1 knockout mice, correlating with impaired opioid-induced glutamate receptor neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1998839744,"Human nitrilase-like protein 2 (hNit2) is a putative tumor suppressor, recently identified as ω-amidase. hNit2/ω-amidase plays a crucial metabolic role by catalyzing the hydrolysis of α-ketoglutaramate (the α-keto analog of glutamine) and α-ketosuccinamate (the α-keto analog of asparagine), yielding α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Transamination between glutamine and α-keto-γ-methiolbutyrate closes the methionine salvage pathway. Thus, hNit2/ω-amidase links sulfur metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To elucidate the catalytic specificity of hNit2/ω-amidase, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the wild type enzyme and its mutants to investigate enzyme-substrate interactions. Binding free energies were computed to characterize factors contributing to the substrate specificity. The predictions resulting from these computations were verified by kinetic analyses and mutational studies. The activity of hNit2/ω-amidase was determined with α-ketoglutaramate and succinamate as substrates. We constructed three catalytic triad mutants (E43A, K112A, and C153A) and a mutant with a loop 116-128 deletion to validate the role of key residues and the 116-128 loop region in substrate binding and turnover. The molecular dynamics simulations successfully verified the experimental trends in the binding specificity of hNit2/ω-amidase toward various substrates. Our findings have revealed novel structural insights into the binding of substrates to hNit2/ω-amidase. A catalytic triad and the loop residues 116-128 of hNit2 play an essential role in supporting the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex, resulting in the generation of the catalytic products. These observations are predicted to be of benefit in the design of new inhibitors or activators for research involving cancer and hyperammonemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2132540237,"Fluid licking in mice is a rhythmic behavior that is controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) located in a complex of brainstem nuclei. C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) strains differ significantly in water-restricted licking, with a highly heritable difference in rates (h(2)≥0.62) and a corresponding 20% difference in interlick interval (mean ± SEM = 116.3±1 vs 95.4±1.1 ms). We systematically quantified motor output in these strains, their F(1) hybrids, and a set of 64 BXD progeny strains. The mean primary interlick interval (MPI) varied continuously among progeny strains. We detected a significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for a CPG controlling lick rate on Chr 1 (Lick1), and a suggestive locus on Chr 10 (Lick10). Linkage was verified by testing of B6.D2-1D congenic stock in which a segment of Chr 1 of the D2 strain was introgressed onto the B6 parent. The Lick1 interval on distal Chr 1 contains several strong candidate genes. One of these is a sodium/potassium pump subunit (Atp1a2) with widespread expression in astrocytes, as well as in a restricted population of neurons. Both this subunit and the entire Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase molecule have been implicated in rhythmogenesis for respiration and locomotion. Sequence variants in or near Apt1a2 strongly modulate expression of the cognate mRNA in multiple brain regions. This gene region has recently been sequenced exhaustively and we have cataloged over 300 non-coding and synonymous mutations segregating among BXD strains, one or more of which is likely to contribute to differences in central pattern generator tempo."
https://openalex.org/W2143631731,"Reduced renal function is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, and persistently elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is frequently observed in patients with end-stage renal disease. In the general population the relationship between renal function and cTnT levels may not be clear because of the low sensitivity of the assay. In this study, we investigated the level of cTnT using a highly sensitive assay (hs-cTnT) and evaluated the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with detectable hs-cTnT levels in a community-based population.The serum hs-cTnT levels were measured in 1365 community dwelling population aged ≥45 years in Beijing, China. eGFR was determined by the Chinese modifying modification of diet in renal disease (C-MDRD) equation.With the highly sensitive assay, cTnT levels were detectable (≥3pg/mL) in 744 subjects (54.5%). The result showed that eGFR was associated with Log hs-cTnT (r = -0.14, P<0.001). After adjustment for the high predicted Framingham Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk (10-year risk >20%) and other prognostic indicators, moderate to severe reduced eGFR was independently associated with detectable hs-cTnT, whereas normal to mildly reduced eGFR was not independently associated with detectable hs-cTnT. In addition, after adjustment for other risk factors, the high predicted Framingham CHD risk was associated with detectable hs-cTnT in the subjects with different quartile levels of eGFR.The levels of hs-cTnT are detectable in a community-based Chinese population and low eGFR is associated with detectable hs-cTnT. Moreover, eGFR and high predicted Framingham CHD risk are associated with detectable hs-cTnT in subjects with moderate-to-severe reduced renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1980718296,"Yellow anacondas (Eunectes notaeus) are large, semiaquatic boid snakes found in wetland systems in South America. These snakes are commercially harvested under a sustainable management plan in Argentina, so information regarding population structuring can be helpful for determination of management units. We evaluated genetic structure and migration using partial sequences from the mitochondrial control region and mitochondrial genes cyt-b and ND4 for 183 samples collected within northern Argentina. A group of landscape features and environmental variables including several treatments of temperature and precipitation were explored as potential drivers of observed genetic patterns. We found significant population structure between most putative population comparisons and bidirectional but asymmetric migration in several cases. The configuration of rivers and wetlands was found to be significantly associated with yellow anaconda population structure (IBD), and important for gene flow, although genetic distances were not significantly correlated with the environmental variables used here. More in-depth analyses of environmental data may be needed to fully understand the importance of environmental conditions on population structure and migration. These analyses indicate that our putative populations are demographically distinct and should be treated as such in Argentina's management plan for the harvesting of yellow anacondas."
https://openalex.org/W2009250432,"Visual scene recognition is a dynamic process through which incoming sensory information is iteratively compared with predictions regarding the most likely identity of the input stimulus. In this study, we used a novel progressive unfolding task to characterize the accumulation of perceptual evidence prior to scene recognition, and its potential modulation by the emotional valence of these scenes. Our results show that emotional (pleasant and unpleasant) scenes led to slower accumulation of evidence compared to neutral scenes. In addition, when controlling for the potential contribution of non-emotional factors (i.e., familiarity and complexity of the pictures), our results confirm a reliable shift in the accumulation of evidence for pleasant relative to neutral and unpleasant scenes, suggesting a valence-specific effect. These findings indicate that proactive iterations between sensory processing and top-down predictions during scene recognition are reliably influenced by the rapidly extracted (positive) emotional valence of the visual stimuli. We interpret these findings in accordance with the notion of a genuine positivity offset during emotional scene recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1996395378,"Glutamate neurotransmission and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are central to photic signaling to the master circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). NMDARs also play important roles in brain development including visual input circuits. The functional NMDAR is comprised of multiple subunits, but each requiring the NR1 subunit for normal activity. The NR1 can be alternatively spliced to produce isoforms that confer different functional properties on the NMDAR. The SCN undergoes extensive developmental changes during postnatal life, including synaptogenesis and acquisition of photic signaling. These changes are especially important in the highly photoperiodic Siberian hamster, in which development of sensitivity to photic cues within the SCN could impact early physiological programming. In this study we examined the expression of NR1 isoforms in the hamster at different developmental ages. Gene expression in the forebrain was quantified by in situ hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific to alternatively spliced regions of the NR1 heteronuclear mRNA, including examination of anterior hypothalamus, piriform cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. Gene expression analysis within the SCN revealed the absence of the N1 cassette, the presence of the C2 cassette alone and the combined absence of C1 and C2 cassettes, indicating that the dominant splice variants are NR1-2a and NR1-4a. Whilst we observe changes at different developmental ages in levels of NR1 isoform probe hybridization in various forebrain structures, we find no significant changes within the SCN. This suggests that a switch in NR1 isoform does not underlie or is not produced by developmental changes within the hamster SCN. Consistency of the NR1 isoforms would ensure that the response of the SCN cells to photic signals remains stable throughout life, an important aspect of the function of the SCN as a responder to environmental changes in quality/quantity of light over the circadian day and annual cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2084761608,"In an attempt to optimize a high yield, high efficiency artificial photosynthetic protein we have discovered unique energy and spatial architecture limits which apply to all light-activated photosynthetic systems. We have generated an analytical solution for the time behavior of the core three cofactor charge separation element in photosynthesis, the photosynthetic cofactor triad, and explored the functional consequences of its makeup including its architecture, the reduction potentials of its components, and the absorption energy of the light absorbing primary-donor cofactor. Our primary findings are two: First, that a high efficiency, high yield triad will have an absorption frequency more than twice the reorganization energy of the first electron transfer, and second, that the relative distance of the acceptor and the donor from the primary-donor plays an important role in determining the yields, with the highest efficiency, highest yield architecture having the light absorbing cofactor closest to the acceptor. Surprisingly, despite the increased complexity found in natural solar energy conversion proteins, we find that the construction of this central triad in natural systems matches these predictions. Our analysis thus not only suggests explanations for some aspects of the makeup of natural photosynthetic systems, it also provides specific design criteria necessary to create high efficiency, high yield artificial protein-based triads."
