https://openalex.org/W2104195325,"Comparison of experimental data with analyses of oceanic sulfate indicates that oceanic sulfate is not in oxygen isotope equilibrium with ocean water. Preliminary experiments suggest that the turnover of sulfate in the sulfur cycle is too rapid to allow equilibrium to be established. If this is so, the sulfur cycle must exert a significant influence on the oxygen balance of the oceanatmosphere system."

https://openalex.org/W2088896348,"This discussion may have given the feeling that the present composition of ocean water does not result just from blind chance. The composition may in the main be given by well-defined equilibria, and the deviations from equilibrium may be explainable by welldefined processes. However, much remains to be discovered by laboratory work and studies of the natural systems. For any discussion of equilibria between sediments and sea water to become really fruitful and decisive, one must achieve a much better separation of the various sediment phases than has been obtained hitherto. Equilibrium data for various silicate systems are highly desirable. Studies of various elements indicate that there are serious gaps in our knowledge of soluble species and of equilibrium constants for known species; equilibrium measurements in the ionic medium, sea water, are scarce and not too reliable. Obviously, better understanding of the system ocean plus air plus sediments and of its history will require close cooperation between geologists, biologists, and chemists of various specialties."
https://openalex.org/W2039684307,"With glass capillary pressure vessels it has been possible to study the effect of pressure on the temperature of maximum density (TMD) and on the ""sharpness"" of the density maximum in liquid H(2)O and D(2)O in the important but little-studied supercooled regime. A pressure of 1200 bars produces a 33 degrees C depression of the TMD in these liquids and a considerable reduction in sharpness. Comparison with the rather flat density maximum for liquid SiO(2) supports the notion that the presence or absence of density anomalies in ""tetrahèdral"" liquids depends on the average bridge-bond angle, which is evidently unusually large in water at normal pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2050526475,"The aboveground activity of the spring herb, Erythronium americanum, is restricted to the period between snowmelt and forest canopy development. Its phenology and production capacity closely adapt the species to this temporal niche in northern deciduous forests. While E. americanum has a minor effect on energy flow, it may reduce losses of potassium and nitrogen from the ecosystem during the period of maximum removal by incorporating these elements in accumulating biomass. Later, during the summer, these nutrients are made available when the above-ground, nonperennating tissues decay."
https://openalex.org/W2029766722,Movements of spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) in formation reduce drag during locomotion; such movement is of particular significance during mass migration. Queues (single-file lines) of spiny lobsters sustain less drag per individual than do individual lobsters moving at the same speed. It is proposed that queuing behavior conserves energy and is a consequence of the evolutionary role of migration in this particular species.
https://openalex.org/W2030294210,"The predicted flux on the earth of solar neutrinos has eluded detection, confounding current ideas of solar energy production by nuclear fusion. The dominant low-energy component of that flux can be detected by mass-spectrometric assay of the induced tiny concentration of 1.6 × 107 year lead-205 in old thallium minerals. Comments are solicited from those in all relevant disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W1999659619,Analyses of beryllium-10 activity in two sections of a manganese nodule indicate an accumulation rate that compares well with such rates measured by other methods on different nodules. The observed specific activity of beryllium-10 in the nodule is in accord with the calculations based on the production of beryllium-10 by cosmic rays in the atmosphere and with the geochnemistry of beryllium in the ocean.
https://openalex.org/W1996281932,"Uptake of vegetative cells of Azotobacter vinelandii into protoplasts of the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizopogon sp. can be induced by treatment with polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 6000). An L-form of the bacteria has been selected for within the differentiated fungal mycelium which is capable of acetylene reduction and nitrogen fixation, as confirmed by nitrogen-15 assays; this allows the fungus to grow on media lacking any combined nitrogen. The fungus grows and reduces acetylene on concentrations of antibiotics that prevent the growth and activity of free-living Azotobacter. Electron microscopy has revealed modified mitochondrial forms or included bacterial L-forms surrounded by an extra fungal membrane within the hyphae of the modified strains. Poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, a storage product of Azotobacter cysts, has also been identified in the hyphae. This would appear to be the first report of the transgenosis for acetylene reduction activity and nitrogen fixation into a eukaryote cell."
https://openalex.org/W2016824116,A new radar image of Venus covering the latitude range 46 degrees to 75 degrees and the approximate longitude range 290 degrees to 10 degrees is shown. The resolution is approximately 20 kilometers.
https://openalex.org/W2006127615,The surface tension-temperature relationship for water is smooth and linear when account is taken of the expansion of the surface with temperature. This plot permits the calculation of thermodynamic properties for 1 square centimeter of surface. Molar surface quantities are derived by assuming a hexagonal water surface structure.
https://openalex.org/W2056761236,"The activity of 26Al in a North Pacific core was found to be 0.081 ± 0.046 disintegration per minute per kilogram of dry sediment, which corresponds to a 26Al/10Be ratio of 0.018 ± 0.011 (or 0.019 ± 0.012 when this ratio is corrected for decay). This ratio is in good agreement with that measured in Greenland ice, 0.017 ± 0.008. These ratios are also in agreement with the calculated values for the production of these isotopes by cosmic rays in the atmosphere: 0.013 ± 0.006. The contribution of cosmic dust bearing 26Al seems small in comparison with the production of this nuclide in the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2010399192,"The Farmington chondrite contains two small xenoliths of granular cristobalite, each surrounded by a thin reaction rim of diopsidic clinopyroxene. Similarities between the blackened structure and drusy cavities, characteristic of this meteorite, and those of an experimentally heat-treated chondrite suggest that Farmington was reheated rather than shocked, but neither the exact stage in the history of this stone at which reaction rims developed around the xenoliths nor the source of the calcium necessary to form rim diopside have been established with certainty."

The discovery of flagellar porelike structures and probable trichocyst pores in the Upper Cretaceous genus Dinogymnium suggests that motile stage tests are also preserved as acid-resistant, organic-walled microfossils."

https://openalex.org/W2057138710,"The efflux time, T, of gas from soap bubbles of radius, R, through their blow tube of length, 1, and radius, p, is given by the equation see pdf for equation where eta is the viscosity of the gas and omicron the surface tension of the bubble solution, all in centimeter-gram-second units. Similar relations between time and diameter were established for the flow from one bubble to another or from one bubble within another. The same relations hold for the flow of liquid spheres, suspended in another liquid of equal density, following Plateau's classic method. They have been extended to the flow of spheres to cylinders and catenoids of rotation. In all these cases the driving force is the surface or interfacial tension, creating an excess pressure as defined by Laplace's equation."
