https://openalex.org/W4207077800,"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, novel and traditional vaccine strategies have been deployed globally. We investigated whether antibodies stimulated by mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2), including third-dose boosting, differ from those generated by infection or adenoviral (ChAdOx1-S and Gam-COVID-Vac) or inactivated viral (BBIBP-CorV) vaccines. We analyzed human lymph nodes after infection or mRNA vaccination for correlates of serological differences. Antibody breadth against viral variants is lower after infection compared with all vaccines evaluated but improves over several months. Viral variant infection elicits variant-specific antibodies, but prior mRNA vaccination imprints serological responses toward Wuhan-Hu-1 rather than variant antigens. In contrast to disrupted germinal centers (GCs) in lymph nodes during infection, mRNA vaccination stimulates robust GCs containing vaccine mRNA and spike antigen up to 8 weeks postvaccination in some cases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity, breadth, and maturation are affected by imprinting from exposure history and distinct histological and antigenic contexts in infection compared with vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4211205596,"Rapid neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation is crucial for innate immune responses. Here, we reveal that the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR35 is upregulated in activated neutrophils, and it promotes their migration. GPR35-deficient neutrophils are less recruited from blood vessels into inflamed tissue, and the mice are less efficient in clearing peritoneal bacteria. Using a bioassay, we find that serum and activated platelet supernatant stimulate GPR35, and we identify the platelet-derived serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) as a GPR35 ligand. GPR35 function in neutrophil recruitment is strongly dependent on platelets, with the receptor promoting transmigration across platelet-coated endothelium. Mast cells also attract GPR35+ cells via 5-HIAA. Mice deficient in 5-HIAA show a loss of GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissue. These findings identify 5-HIAA as a GPR35 ligand and neutrophil chemoattractant and establish a role for platelet- and mast cell-produced 5-HIAA in cell recruitment to the sites of inflammation and bacterial clearance."
https://openalex.org/W4211179425,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is broadly accepted that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its spike protein to recognize the extracellular domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter cells for viral infection. However, other mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry may occur. We show quantitatively that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also binds to the extracellular domain of broadly expressed integrin α5β1 with an affinity comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2. More importantly, we provide direct evidence that such binding promotes the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 into non-ACE2 cells in a manner critically dependent upon the activation of the integrin. Our data demonstrate an alternative pathway for the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that upon initial ACE2-mediated invasion of the virus in the respiratory system, which is known to trigger an immune response and secretion of cytokines to activate integrin, the integrin-mediated cell invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the respiratory system and other organs becomes effective, thereby promoting further infection and progression of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4211144006,"Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands influence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the physical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W4210996190,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential step to drive the metastatic cascade to lymph nodes (LNs) in cervical cancer cells. However, few of them metastasize successfully partially due to increased susceptibility to immunosurveillance conferred by EMT. The precise mechanisms of cancer cells orchestrate EMT and immune evasion remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified a lncRNA termed lymph node metastasis associated suppressor (LNMAS), which was downregulated in LN-positive cervical cancer patients and correlated with LN metastasis and prognosis. Functionally, LNMAS suppressed cervical cancer cells metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LNMAS exerts its metastasis suppressive activity by competitively interacting with HMGB1 and abrogating the chromatin accessibility of TWIST1 and STC1, inhibiting TWIST1-mediated partial EMT and STC1-dependent immune escape from macrophage phagocytosis. We further demonstrated that the CpG sites in the promoter region of LNMAS was hypermethylated and contributed to the downregulation of LNMAS. Taken together, our results reveal the essential role of LNMAS in the LN metastasis of cervical cancer and provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of LNMAS in EMT and immune evasion."

https://openalex.org/W4213040807,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are isolated from adipose tissue (AD-MSCs), umbilical cord (UC-MSCs), or bone marrow, have therapeutic potential including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. It was recently reported that MSCs are also effective as a therapeutic treatment for neuropathic pain, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be resolved. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of human AD- and UC-MSCs on neuropathic pain and its mechanisms using rat models of partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL). AD- or UC-MSCs were intravenously administered 4 days after PSNL. Antinociceptive effects were then evaluated using the von Frey and weight-bearing tests. We found that, 3-9 days after the administration of AD- or UC-MSCs to PSNL-exposed rats, both the mechanical threshold and differences in weight-bearing of the right and left hind paws were significantly improved. To reveal the potential underlying antinociceptive mechanisms of MSCs, the levels of activation transcription factor 3- and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive cells were measured by immunohistochemical analysis. AD- and UC-MSCs significantly decreased the levels of these proteins that were induced by PSNL in the dorsal root ganglia. Additionally, UC-MSC significantly improved the PSNL-induced decrease in the myelin basic protein level in the sciatic nerve, indicating that UC-MSC reversed demyelination of the sciatic nerve produced by PSNL. These data suggest that AD- and UC-MSCs may help in the recovery of neuropathic pain via the different regulation; AD-MSCs exhibited their effects via suppressed neuronal damage and anti-inflammatory actions, while UC-MSCs exhibited their effects via suppressed neuronal damage, anti-inflammatory actions and remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W4213309241,"Osteosarcoma, which is the most common malignant pediatric bone cancer, remains dependent on an imprecise systemic treatment largely unchanged in 30 years. In this study, we correlated histopathology with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), used the correlation to extract MRI-specific features representative of tumor necrosis, and subsequently developed a novel classification model for predicting tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma using multi-modal MRI. The model could ultimately serve as a testable biomarker for a high-risk malignancy without successful precision treatments.Patients with newly diagnosed high-grade appendicular osteosarcoma were enrolled in a single-center observational study, wherein patients underwent pre-surgical evaluation using both conventional MRI (post-contrast T1-weighted with fat saturation, pre-contrast T1-weighted, and short inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR)) and advanced MRI (diffusion weighted (DW) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)). A classification model was established based on a direct correlation between histopathology and MRI, which was achieved through histologic-MR image co-registration and subsequent extraction of MR image features for identifying histologic tumor necrosis. By operating on the MR image features, tumor necrosis was estimated from different combinations of MR images using a multi-feature fuzzy clustering technique together with a weighted majority ruling. Tumor necrosis calculated from MR images, for either an MRI plane of interest or whole tumor volume, was compared to pathologist-estimated necrosis and necrosis quantified from digitized histologic section images using a previously described deep learning classification method.15 patients were enrolled, of whom two withdrew, one became ineligible, and two were subjected to inadequate pre-surgical imaging. MRI sequences of n = 10 patients were subsequently used for classification model development. Different MR image features, depending on the modality of MRI, were shown to be significant in distinguishing necrosis from viable tumor. The scales at which MR image features optimally signified tumor necrosis were different as well depending on the MR image type. Conventional MRI was shown capable of differentiating necrosis from viable tumor with an accuracy averaging above 90%. Conventional MRI was equally effective as DWI in distinguishing necrotic from viable tumor regions. The accuracy of tumor necrosis prediction by conventional MRI improved to above 95% when DCE-MRI was added into consideration. Volume-based tumor necrosis estimations tended to be lower than those evaluated on an MRI plane of interest.The study has shown a proof-of-principle model for interpreting chemotherapeutic response using multi-modal MRI for patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. The model will continue to be evaluated as MR image features indicative of tumor response are now computable for the disease prior to surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4210828124,"Despite extensive basic and clinical research on immune checkpoint regulatory pathways, little is known about the effects of the ionic tumor microenvironment on immune checkpoint expression and function. Here we describe a mechanistic link between Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) inhibition and activity of the immune checkpoint protein indoleamine-pyrrole 2′,3′-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). We found that IDO1 was necessary and sufficient for production of kynurenine, a downstream tryptophan metabolite, in cancer cells. We developed a spectrophotometric assay to screen a library of 31 model ion transport-targeting compounds for potential effects on IDO1 function in A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This revealed that the cardiac glycosides ouabain and digoxin inhibited kynurenine production at concentrations that did not affect cell survival. NKA inhibition by ouabain and digoxin resulted in increased intracellular Na+ levels and downregulation of IDO1 mRNA and protein levels, which was consistent with the reduction in kynurenine levels. Knockdown of ATP1A1, the ɑ1 subunit of the NKA and target of cardiac glycosides, increased Na+ levels to a lesser extent than cardiac glycoside treatment and did not affect IDO1 expression. However, ATP1A1 knockdown significantly enhanced the effect of cardiac glycosides on IDO1 expression and kynurenine production. Mechanistically, we show that cardiac glycoside treatment resulted in curtailing the length of phosphorylation-mediated stabilization of STAT1, a transcriptional regulator of IDO1 expression, an effect enhanced by ATP1A1 knockdown. Our findings reveal cross talk between ionic modulation via cardiac glycosides and immune checkpoint protein expression in cancer cells with broad mechanistic and clinical implications.

Understanding and treating cancer are a fundamental struggle of modern medicine. Breast cancer alone is responsible for 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women in the United States over the last year, with more than 240,000 new cases registered only in 2019 (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 7-34Google Scholar). A key feature of highly metastatic breast tumors is represented by ionic imbalances characterized primarily by elevated intracellular Na+ and a slightly depolarized cell membrane (2Nagy I.Z.

The tumor microenvironment is generally immunosuppressive to prevent an attack by the host immune system. One way immunosuppression is achieved is through immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1 and IDO1 (20Havel J.J. Chowell D. Chan T.A.

PD-1 and its ligands in tolerance and immunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 677-704Google Scholar). IDO1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism, mediating its conversion to N-formyl-kynurenine, which is then converted to downstream kynurenine metabolites. IDO1 metabolism depletes the tumor microenvironment of tryptophan, leading to T cell starvation and impaired activation (22Blair A.B. Kleponis J. Thomas D.L. Muth S.T. Murphy A.G. Kim V. Zheng L.

Effects of the ionic tumor microenvironment on cancer immunity are less understood. The ionic content of tumors can itself act as an immune inhibitor by regulating T cell activation and stemness (16Eil R. Vodnala S.K. Clever D. Klebanoff C.A. Sukumar M. Pan J.H. Palmer D.C. Gros A.

Our understanding of how ionic transport affects tumor immune escape remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated how pharmacological modulation of multiple ionic transport pathways affects immune gene expression of cancer cells in vitro. We curated a library of 31 model ionic transport modulating compounds and assessed their activity in screens using lung and breast cancer cell lines. We selected levels of secreted kynurenine as our readout as this is directly connected with activity of IDO1, which, in addition to being an immune checkpoint protein, is also a surrogate marker of tumor cell immune activation. We found that in breast and lung cancer cell lines, cardiac glycosides decrease IDO1 expression by suppressing STAT1 activation. To assess effects of changing the ionic environment on activity of immune checkpoint protein IDO1, we designed a screen of ion transport modulating small molecules based on colorimetric detection of kynurenines, downstream tryptophan metabolites (30Takikawa O. Kuroiwa T. Yamazaki F. Kido R. Mechanism of interferon-gamma action. Characterization of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in cultured human cells induced by interferon-gamma and evaluation of the enzyme-mediated tryptophan degradation in its anticellular activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2041-2048Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). TNF/IFN-ɣ has been used to stimulate kynurenine production in human cell lines (30Takikawa O. Kuroiwa T. Yamazaki F. Kido R. Mechanism of interferon-gamma action. Characterization of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in cultured human cells induced by interferon-gamma and evaluation of the enzyme-mediated tryptophan degradation in its anticellular activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2041-2048Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with ion channel targeting small molecules for 24 h, then stimulated with TNF/IFN-ɣ for 24 h to induce IDO1 expression and kynurenine production. After drug pretreatment and cytokine stimulation, kynurenine production was measured using the colorimetric kynurenine assay (Fig. 1, A and B). We tested a library of 31 ion channel targeting compounds for their effect on kynurenine production by TNF/IFN-ɣ stimulated human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and lung cancer A549 cells (Table S1). An initial screen of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased kynurenine (mean ± SD) upon treatment with 50 μM ouabain: 3.8 ± 1.3 μM, n = 3, versus 1% DMSO control: 27.5 ± 4.1 μM, n = 6 (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA Tukey’s post-hoc) (Fig. 1C). An initial screen of A549 cells resulted in decreased kynurenine upon treatment with 50 μM ouabain: 1.5 ± 1.6 μM (conservatively, < 3.1 μM), n = 3, versus 1% DMSO control: 15.0 ± 2.9 μM, n = 6 (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA Tukey’s post-hoc) (Fig. 1D). Other hits were the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors diclofenac and celecoxib, which have been reported to reduce IDO1 expression (33Lee S.Y. Choi H.K. Lee K.J. Jung J.Y. Hur G.Y. Jung K.H. Kim J.H. Shin C. Shim J.J. In K.H. Kang K.H. Yoo S.H. The immune tolerance of cancer is mediated by Ido that is inhibited by COX-2 inhibitors through regulatory T cells.J.

Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor enhances the efficacy of a breast cancer vaccine: Role of Ido.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2391-2402Google Scholar). Next, we validated the effect of ouabain and the related cardiac glycoside digoxin on kynurenine production in TNF/IFN-ɣ-stimulated cancer cell lines. Titration of ouabain in the kynurenine assay resulted in an IC50 of 89 nM (95% confidence interval 70–112 nM) for MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Titration of digoxin resulted in an apparent IC50 of ∼164 nM for MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Titration of ouabain and digoxin resulted in IC50s of 17 nM (95% confidence interval 14–20 nM) and 40 nM (95% confidence interval 35–46 nM), respectively, for A549 cells (Fig. 2B). In general, ouabain was more potent than digoxin, and A549 cells were more sensitive to cardiac glycosides than MDA-MB-231 cells. Ouabain and digoxin functionally inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA). Using a sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI)-based colorimetric assay, we observed increased intracellular Na+ in TNF/IFN-ɣ-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells treated with cardiac glycoside concentrations near the IC50s measured in the kynurenine assay (100 nM ouabain or 150 nM digoxin) for 24 h (Fig. 2C), confirming that the two compounds inhibited Na+ export through targeting of the NKA in these cells. The increase in intracellular Na+ inversely correlated with decreasing kynurenine resulting from titration of ouabain in TNF/IFN-ɣ-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2D). Having observed a reduction in kynurenine levels upon treatment with cardiac glycosides, we explored the effect of ouabain and digoxin on IDO1 protein expression and mRNA levels in TNF/IFN-ɣ-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and A549 cell lines. Cells were pretreated with concentrations of ouabain near the IC50 measured for each cell line. Ouabain treatment decreased IDO1 protein level in TNF/IFN-ɣ-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells between 100 and 200 nM ouabain and between 25 and 50 nM ouabain, respectively (Fig. 2E). Cells were pretreated with one of three cardiac glycoside concentrations—sub-IC50, IC50, and complete inhibition—to measure the effect on IDO1 expression. Increasing concentrations of ouabain and digoxin markedly decreased IDO1 protein expression in cytokine-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells (Fig. 2F). In cytokine-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells, 100 nM ouabain treatment significantly inhibited IDO1 protein (Fig. 2G) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2H). In addition to IDO1, several enzymes are integral to the tryptophan/kynurenine metabolic pathway (25Opitz C.A. Litzenburger U.M. Sahm F. Ott M. Tritschler I. Trump S. Schumacher T. Jestaedt L. Schrenk D. Weller M. Jugold M. Guillemin G.J. Miller C.L. Lutz C. Radlwimmer B. et al.An endogenous tumour-promoting ligand of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor.Nature. 2011; 478: 197-203Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether IDO1 is the primary determinant of kynurenine production, focusing on MDA-MB-231 cells. We confirmed by Western blot that IDO1 protein expression can be knocked down with siRNA in TNF/IFN-γ-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells pretreated with different concentrations of ouabain (Fig. 3A). Kynurenine assays showed that IDO1 depletion resulted in a drastic reduction in kynurenine production by these cells, from 47 ± 7 μM kynurenine in control cells to 15 ± 5 μM kynurenine in cells transfected with IDO1-targeting siRNA. Importantly, ouabain treatment resulted in a modest downregulation of IDO1 expression in IDO1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A) but did not have a statistically significant effect on kynurenine production (Fig. 3B). Having shown that IDO1 is necessary for kynurenine production in TNF/IFN-γ-stimulated cells, we tested whether IDO1 was sufficient in driving kynurenine production in the absence or presence of cytokines. In agreement with previous reports (30Takikawa O. Kuroiwa T. Yamazaki F. Kido R. Mechanism of interferon-gamma action. Characterization of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in cultured human cells induced by interferon-gamma and evaluation of the enzyme-mediated tryptophan degradation in its anticellular activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2041-2048Google Scholar), we observed that TNF/IFN-γ stimulates IDO1 expression and kynurenine production (Fig. 3C). In empty vector-transfected cells, IDO1 was not observed by Western blot unless stimulated with TNF/IFN-γ (Fig. 3C, IDO1 long exposure). Heterologous expression of IDO1 (pIDO1-FLAG) resulted in intense overexpression of IDO1 regardless of cytokine stimulation or pretreatment with 100 nM ouabain (Fig. 3C, IDO1 short exposure). Kynurenine assays of pIDO1-FLAG transfected cells showed that heterologous expression of IDO1 was sufficient to significantly increase kynurenine concentrations in the media of transfected cells, above those of empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). This demonstrated that in TNF/IFN-γ-stimulated cells, IDO1 is the major determinant of kynurenine production and that ouabain does not affect kynurenine production independently of IDO1. Importantly, it also showed that ouabain did not affect levels of exogenously expressed IDO1. In combination with the observation that ouabain affects both mRNA and protein levels of endogenous IDO1, this suggested that the mechanism of IDO1 regulation is likely to transcriptional or posttranscriptional. We aimed to validate that cardiac glycosides were impacting immune checkpoints through their primary target by performing siRNA knockdown of ATP1A1, the ɑ1 subunit of NKA. NKA promotes maintenance of a stable cell membrane potential by conducting sodium export (3 Na+) and potassium import (2 K+), each against their concentration gradients (35Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. Flexibility of an active center in sodium-plus-potassium adenosine triphosphatase.J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 306-326Google Scholar). NKA is a transmembrane protein consisting of three subunits: α, β, and γ, each with different isoforms expressed in a cell-type-dependent manner (36Sweadner K.J.

Formation of two-dimensional crystals in pure membrane-bound Na+,K+-ATPase.FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 219-222Google Scholar). The α subunit is the pore-forming subunit and contains the ATP-binding catalytic domain on the cytoplasmic side (37Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Palmgren M.G. Nissen P. A structural overview of the plasma membrane Na + ,K + -ATPase and H + -ATPase ion pumps.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 60-70Google Scholar). There are four isoforms of the α subunit encoded by genes ATP1A1 (α1), ATP1A2 (α2), ATP1A3 (α3), and ATP1A4 (α4), α1 being the most widely expressed across different tissues (36Sweadner K.J.

A putative fourth Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit gene is expressed in testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12952-12956Google Scholar). The α subunit is a target of most NKA inhibitors, including cardiac glycosides, a well-characterized class of NKA functional inhibitors including ouabain, digoxin, digitoxin, and bufalin, among others (36Sweadner K.J.

To explore the role of NKA in IDO1 regulation, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATP1A1. This resulted in increased levels of intracellular Na+, indicating functionally relevant levels of knockdown (Fig. 4A). However, we noted that the increase in intracellular Na+ due to ATP1A1 knockdown was modest compared with that observed with treatment with 100 nM ouabain and only reached levels at which we did not observe inhibition of kynurenine production in ouabain-treated cells (around 20 nM, Fig. 2D). Indeed, ATP1A1 siRNA knockdown by itself did not decrease kynurenine production in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Decreased kynurenine was only observed when ATP1A1 siRNA-transfected cells were also treated with ouabain or digoxin, and this decrease was cardiac glycoside concentration dependent (Fig. 4, B and C). ATP1A1 knockdown was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4, D and E). While increasing concentrations of cardiac glycoside treatment upregulated ATP1A1 expression in siRNA-transfected cells, there remained less ATP1A1 in each condition compared with nontargeting control (NTC) siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4, D and E). Independent of ion transport activity and corresponding changes in intracellular ion concentrations, certain concentrations of cardiac glycosides and NKA have been implicated in growth pathways regulating cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation such as PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK (44Xie Z.

We observed decreased percent live cells with ATP1A1 siRNA transfection and cardiac glycoside treatment above 100 nM ouabain (Fig. 4, B and C insets). Digoxin treatment was less cytotoxic (Fig. 4C, inset) than ouabain (Fig. 4B, inset) at corresponding concentrations. Ouabain and digoxin treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells decreased IDO1 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner in both control and ATP1A1-depleted cells (Fig. 4, D and E). Decreased IDO1 also occurred at the mRNA level in ouabain- and digoxin-treated cells (Fig. 4, F and G). Furthermore, the cardiac glycoside-mediated suppression of IDO1 protein and mRNA levels and kynurenine production were drastically enhanced in ATP1A1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4, B–G). Of note, we also measured levels of PD-L1, the expression of which was inhibited in ouabain- but not digoxin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4, D and E), and only the decrease in PD-L1 protein expression due to ouabain was enhanced by ATP1A1 knockdown (Fig. 4D). To see whether the effects of combining cardiac glycoside treatment with depletion of ATP1A1 were cell-type-dependent, we performed equivalent experiments in TNF/IFN-ɣ (24 h) stimulated A549 cells (Fig. 5). In this cell line, ATP1A1 siRNA knockdown and cardiac glycoside treatment produced a similar synergistic effect on kynurenine production as in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). ATP1A1 knockdown was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 5, C and D). In A549 cells, we also observed that increasing concentrations of cardiac glycoside treatment upregulated ATP1A1 expression in ATP1A1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5, C and D). However, there remained less ATP1A1 in each condition compared with NTC siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5, C and D).

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-associated polymorphisms influence HIF-DNA interactions at enhancers of important oncogenes thereby modulating the risk of developing renal cancer. A strong signal of genome-wide association with RCC was determined for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4903064, located on chr14q.24.2 within an intron of DPF3, encoding for Double PHD Fingers 3, a member of chromatin remodeling complexes; however, it is unclear how the risk allele operates in renal cells. In this study, we used tissue specimens and primary renal cells from a large cohort of RCC patients to examine the function of this polymorphism. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue, isolated tumor cells as well as in primary renal tubular cells, in which HIF was stabilized, we determined genotype-specific increases of DPF3 mRNA levels and identified that the risk SNP resides in an active enhancer region, creating a novel HIF-binding motif. We then confirmed allele-specific HIF binding to this locus using chromatin immunoprecipitation of HIF subunits. Consequentially, HIF-mediated DPF3 regulation was dependent on the presence of the risk allele. Finally, we show that DPF3 deletion in proximal tubular cells retarded cell growth, indicating potential roles for DPF3 in cell proliferation. Our analyses suggest that the HIF pathway differentially operates on a SNP-induced hypoxia-response element at 14q24.2, thereby affecting DPF3 expression, which increases the risk of developing renal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4210865303,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV3), robustly expressed in the skin, is a nonselective calcium-permeable cation channel activated by warm temperature, voltage, and certain chemicals. Natural monoterpenoid carvacrol from plant oregano is a known skin sensitizer or allergen that specifically activates TRPV3 channel. However, how carvacrol activates TRPV3 mechanistically remains to be understood. Here, we describe the molecular determinants for chemical activation of TRPV3 by the agonist carvacrol. Patch clamp recordings reveal that carvacrol activates TRPV3 in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 0.2 mM, by increasing the probability of single-channel open conformation. Molecular docking of carvacrol into cryo-EM structure of TRPV3 combined with site-directed mutagenesis further identified a unique binding pocket formed by the channel S2-S3 linker important for mediating this interaction. Within the binding pocket consisting of four residues (Ile505, Leu508, Arg509, and Asp512), we report that Leu508 is the most critical residue for the activation of TRPV3 by carvacrol, but not 2-APB, a widely used nonspecific agonist and TRP channel modulator. Our findings demonstrate a direct binding of carvacrol to TRPV3 by targeting the channel S2-S3 linker that serves as a critical domain for chemical-mediated activation of TRPV3. We also propose that carvacrol can function as a molecular tool in the design of novel specific TRPV3 modulators for the further understanding of TRPV3 channel pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W4210919863,"Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential nutrient that functions as a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in humans. The alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) binds α-tocopherol with high affinity and selectivity and regulates whole-body distribution of the vitamin. Heritable mutations in the TTPA gene result in familial vitamin E deficiency, elevated indices of oxidative stress, and progressive neurodegeneration that manifest primarily in spinocerebellar ataxia. Although the essential role of vitamin E in neurological health has been recognized for over 50 years, the mechanisms by which this essential nutrient is transported in the central nervous system are poorly understood. Here we found that, in the murine cerebellum, TTP is selectively expressed in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, where it facilitates efflux of vitamin E to neighboring neurons. We also show that induction of oxidative stress enhances the transcription of the TtpA gene in cultured cerebellar astrocytes. Furthermore, secretion of vitamin E from astrocytes is mediated by an ABC-type transporter, and uptake of the vitamin into neurons involves the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1. Taken together, our data indicate that TTP-expressing astrocytes control the delivery of vitamin E from astrocytes to neurons, and that this process is homeostatically responsive to oxidative stress. These are the first observations that address the detailed molecular mechanisms of vitamin E transport in the central nervous system, and these results have important implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4210833307,"Acute and chronic inflammations are key homeostatic events in health and disease. Sirtuins (SIRTs), a family of NAD-dependent protein deacylases, play a pivotal role in the regulation of these inflammatory responses. Indeed, SIRTs have anti-inflammatory effects through a myriad of signaling cascades, including histone deacetylation and gene silencing, p65/RelA deacetylation and inactivation, and nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat, and pyrin domain‑containing protein 3 inflammasome inhibition. Nevertheless, recent findings show that SIRTs, specifically SIRT6, are also necessary for mounting an active inflammatory response in macrophages. SIRT6 has been shown to positively regulate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) secretion by demyristoylating pro-TNFα in the cytoplasm. However, how SIRT6, a nuclear chromatin-binding protein, fulfills this function in the cytoplasm is currently unknown. Herein, we show by Western blot and immunofluorescence that in macrophages and fibroblasts there is a subpopulation of SIRT6 that is highly unstable and quickly degraded via the proteasome. Upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation in Raw 264.7, bone marrow, and peritoneal macrophages, this population of SIRT6 is rapidly stabilized and localizes in the cytoplasm, specifically in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting TNFα secretion. Furthermore, we also found that acute SIRT6 inhibition dampens TNFα secretion both in vitro and in vivo, decreasing lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Finally, we tested SIRT6 relevance in systemic inflammation using an obesity-induced chronic inflammatory in vivo model, where TNFα plays a key role, and we show that short-term genetic deletion of SIRT6 in macrophages of obese mice ameliorated systemic inflammation and hyperglycemia, suggesting that SIRT6 plays an active role in inflammation-mediated glucose intolerance during obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4210857601,"While adaptive immunity recognizes a nearly infinite range of antigenic determinants, immune tolerance renders adaptive immunity vulnerable to microbes decorated in self-like antigens. Recent studies suggest that sugar-binding proteins galectin-4 and galectin-8 bind microbes expressing blood group antigens. However, the binding profile and potential antimicrobial activity of other galectins, particularly galectin-9 (Gal-9), has remained incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that while Gal-9 possesses strong binding preference for ABO(H) blood group antigens, each domain exhibits distinct binding patterns, with the C-terminal domain (Gal-9C) exhibiting higher binding to blood group B than the N-terminal domain (Gal-9N). Despite this binding preference, Gal-9 readily killed blood group B-positive Escherichia coli, whereas Gal-9N displayed higher killing activity against this microbe than Gal-9C. Utilization of microarrays populated with blood group O antigens from a diverse array of microbes revealed that Gal-9 can bind various microbial glycans, whereas Gal-9N and Gal-9C displayed distinct and overlapping binding preferences. Flow cytometric examination of intact microbes corroborated the microbial glycan microarray findings, demonstrating that Gal-9, Gal-9N, and Gal-9C also possess the capacity to recognize distinct strains of Providencia alcalifaciens and Klebsiella pneumoniae that express mammalian blood group-like antigens while failing to bind related strains that do not express mammalian-like glycans. In each case of microbial binding, Gal-9, Gal-9N, and Gal-9C induced microbial death. In contrast, while Gal-9, Gal-9N, and Gal-9C engaged red blood cells, each failed to induce hemolysis. These data suggest that Gal-9 recognition of distinct microbial strains may provide antimicrobial activity against molecular mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W4210872025,"Chaperones of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family engage in protein-protein interactions with many cochaperones. One ""hotspot"" for cochaperone binding is the EEVD motif, found at the extreme C terminus of cytoplasmic Hsp70s. This motif is known to bind tetratricopeptide repeat domain cochaperones, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. In addition, the EEVD motif also interacts with a structurally distinct domain that is present in class B J-domain proteins, such as DnaJB4. These observations suggest that CHIP and DnaJB4 might compete for binding to Hsp70's EEVD motif; however, the molecular determinants of such competition are not clear. Using a collection of EEVD-derived peptides, including mutations and truncations, we explored which residues are critical for binding to both CHIP and DnaJB4. These results revealed that some features, such as the C-terminal carboxylate, are important for both interactions. However, CHIP and DnaJB4 also had unique preferences, especially at the isoleucine position immediately adjacent to the EEVD. Finally, we show that competition between these cochaperones is important in vitro, as DnaJB4 limits the ubiquitination activity of the Hsp70-CHIP complex, whereas CHIP suppresses the client refolding activity of the Hsp70-DnaJB4 complex. Together, these data suggest that the EEVD motif has evolved to support diverse protein-protein interactions, such that competition between cochaperones may help guide whether Hsp70-bound proteins are folded or degraded."
https://openalex.org/W4210916234,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mode of cell death caused by excessive oxidative damage to lipids. Lipid peroxidation is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4, which requires reduced glutathione. Cystine is a major resource for glutathione synthesis, especially in cancer cells. Therefore, cystine deprivation or inhibition of cystine uptake promotes ferroptosis in cancer cells. However, the roles of other molecules involved in cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis are unexplored. We report here that the expression of gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), an enzyme that cleaves extracellular glutathione, determines the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis at high cell density (HD). In glioblastoma cells expressing GGT1, pharmacological inhibition or deletion of GGT1 suppressed the cell density-induced increase in intracellular glutathione levels and cell viability under cystine deprivation, which were restored by the addition of cysteinylglycine, the GGT product of glutathione cleavage. On the other hand, cystine deprivation induced glutathione depletion and ferroptosis in GGT1-deficient glioblastoma cells even at an HD. Exogenous expression of GGT1 in GGT1-deficient glioblastoma cells inhibited cystine deprivation-induced glutathione depletion and ferroptosis at an HD. This suggests that GGT1 plays an important role in glioblastoma cell survival under cystine-limited and HD conditions. We conclude that combining GGT inhibitors with ferroptosis inducers may provide an effective therapeutic approach for treating glioblastoma."

Detection dogs could be a possible solution to identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that dogs can detect SARS-CoV-2 on sweat samples. This study aims to establish the dogs' sensitivity (true positive rate) which measures the proportion of people with COVID-19 that are correctly identified, and specificity (true negative rate) which measures the proportion of people without COVID-19 that are correctly identified. Seven search and rescue dogs were tested using a total of 218 axillary sweat samples (62 positive and 156 negative) in olfaction cones following a randomised and double-blind protocol. Sensitivity ranged from 87% to 94%, and specificity ranged from 78% to 92%, with four dogs over 90%. These results were used to calculate the positive predictive value and negative predictive value for each dog for different infection probabilities (how likely it is for an individual to be SARS-CoV-2 positive), ranging from 10-50%. These results were compared with a reference diagnostic tool which has 95% specificity and sensitivity. Negative predictive values for six dogs ranged from ≥98% at 10% infection probability to ≥88% at 50% infection probability compared with the reference tool which ranged from 99% to 95%. Positive predictive values ranged from ≥40% at 10% infection probability to ≥80% at 50% infection probability compared with the reference tool which ranged from 68% to 95%. This study confirms previous results, suggesting that dogs could play an important role in mass-testing situations.

Whether defects in ribosomal processing impact mitochondrial function and could play a pathogenetic role in β-cells and T2D is not known. To this end, we explored expression and the functional role of dimethyladenosine transferase 1 homolog (DIMT1), a homolog of TFB1M and a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferase implicated in the control of rRNA. Expression of DIMT1 was increased in human islets from T2D donors and correlated positively with expression of insulin mRNA, but negatively with insulin secretion. We show that silencing of DIMT1 in insulin-secreting cells impacted mitochondrial function, leading to lower expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins, reduced oxygen consumption rate, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential, and a slower rate of ATP production. In addition, the rate of protein synthesis was retarded upon DIMT1 deficiency. Consequently, we found that DIMT1 deficiency led to perturbed insulin secretion in rodent cell lines and islets, as well as in a human β-cell line. We observed defects in rRNA processing and reduced interactions between NIN1 (RPN12) binding protein 1 homolog (NOB-1) and pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES-1), critical ribosomal subunit RNA proteins, the dysfunction of which may play a part in disturbing protein synthesis in β-cells. In conclusion, DIMT1 deficiency perturbs protein synthesis, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted insulin secretion, both potential pathogenetic processes in T2D."

YidC helps facilitate the removal of transmembrane (TM) proteins from the Sec channel (15Sachelaru I. Winter L. Knyazev D.G. Zimmermann M. Vogt A. Kuttner R. Ollinger N. Siligan C. Pohl P. Koch H.G.

Rep. 2014; 4: 7299Google Scholar) were solved at high resolution using X-ray crystallography. These structures showed that the YidC protein possesses a five TM segment core domain (TM2-TM6 in the case of the E. coli YidC) with an unusual hydrophilic cavity located within the inner leaflet of the membrane that is accessible from the cytoplasm and lipid bilayer, but not from the periplasm. In addition, YidC possesses a conserved coiled-coil region in the cytoplasm comprised of two α-helices CH1 and CH2 that most likely is involved in substrate binding of YidC substrates such as Pf3 coat (20Laskowski P.R. Pluhackova K. Haase M. Lang B.M. Nagler G. Kuhn A. Muller D.J. Monitoring the binding and insertion of a single transmembrane protein by an insertase.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 7082Google Scholar), as well as binding of SRP and the SRP receptor FtsY that targets ribosome nascent chains to YidC (21Petriman N.A. Jauss B. Hufnagel A. Franz L. Sachelaru I. Drepper F. Warscheid B. Koch H.G. The interaction network of the YidC insertase with the SecYEG translocon, SRP and the SRP receptor FtsY.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 578Google Scholar). Interestingly, CH1 forms a continuous helix with the first TM region of the core domain (TM2 of E. coli YidC), which is kinked by two conserved prolines, one in TM1 of the core (TM2 of E. coli YidC) and one in front of CH1. These prolines along with the disordered loop (Pro-Leu-Gly-Gly-Cys-Phe-Pro in E. coli YidC) connecting CH2 to the second TM core segment (TM3 of E. coli YidC) likely function to move the substrate from the coiled-coil domain into the hydrophilic groove. The E. coli YidC residues that have been determined as contacting the TM segment of substrates during insertion were found to cluster on the same face of TM3 and TM5 that forms a ‘greasy slide’ (1Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. How YidC inserts and folds proteins across a membrane.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 435-436Google Scholar, 22Klenner C. Kuhn A. Dynamic disulfide scanning of the membrane-inserting Pf3 coat protein reveals multiple YidC substrate contacts.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 3769-3776Google Scholar), while the hydrophilic region of the substrate was incorporated transiently into the hydrophilic groove prior to translocation across the membrane (23He H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Tracking the stepwise movement of a membrane-inserting protein in vivo.J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432: 484-496Google Scholar). The cavity contains a strictly conserved positively charged residue that is essential in Bacillus subtilis (18Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A. Nishiyama K. Sugano Y. Mori T. Dohmae N. Hirata K. Nakada-Nakura Y. Maturana A.D. Tanaka Y. Mori H. Sugita Y. Arisaka F. et al.Structural basis of Sec-independent membrane protein insertion by YidC.Nature. 2014; 509: 516-520Google Scholar). This residue has been proposed to participate in an electrostatic step to translocate the negatively charged N-terminal tail region of the MifM protein across the membrane (18Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A. Nishiyama K. Sugano Y. Mori T. Dohmae N. Hirata K. Nakada-Nakura Y. Maturana A.D. Tanaka Y. Mori H. Sugita Y. Arisaka F. et al.Structural basis of Sec-independent membrane protein insertion by YidC.Nature. 2014; 509: 516-520Google Scholar). However, the conserved positive charge is not essential for the insertase activity of the E. coli YidC or an Arabidopsis thaliana Alb3 derivative (24Chen Y. Soman R. Shanmugam S.K. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35656-35667Google Scholar). A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of E. coli YidC embedded in a palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine:palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPE:POPG) phospholipid bilayer showed the protein to be more compact than the crystal structure and reveals significant thinning in the vicinity of the protein (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar). The thinning of the membrane bilayer and the presence of the hydrophilic groove reduces the energy cost for translocation, which is a new paradigm in biology (26Wu X. Rapoport T.A. Translocation of proteins through a distorted lipid bilayer.Trends Cell Biol. 2021; 31: 473-484Google Scholar). The strictly conserved arginine 366 in the hydrophilic groove of the E. coli YidC is in proximity to tyrosine 516 and 517 at the top of the groove (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and is likely hydrogen bonded via water molecules. These tyrosine residues are part of an aromatic cluster at the interface between the aqueous environment in the groove and the embedded hydrophobic portion of YidC in the outer leaflet of the membrane. To gain further insights into the role of R366 in the YidC insertase activity, we investigated the function of this conserved positively charged residue in the hydrophilic groove of the E. coli YidC and Streptococcus mutans YidC2. We found that the positive charge (R366) is important for the E. coli YidC when a nearby tyrosine at position 517 is changed to an amino acid with an apolar side chain. However, it is not essential when the tyrosine is changed to a hydrophilic or aromatic amino acid. Similar results were also found with S. mutans YidC2. Solvent accessibility assays show that the arginine is required to keep the upper part of the groove solvent accessible when Y517 is replaced with an apolar residue. Strikingly, both E. coli YidC and S. mutans YidC2 can function in membrane protein insertion when the arginine is replaced with a negatively charged glutamic acid residue, provided that a suppressor mutation is also present, which most likely stabilizes the groove region. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the positively charged residue is employed to keep the groove hydrophilic and water exposed rather than to attract the negative charge region of the substrate to be translocated. Previous structural (19Kumazaki K. Kishimoto T. Furukawa A. Mori H. Tanaka Y. Dohmae N. Ishitani R. Tsukazaki T. Nureki O. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli YidC, a membrane protein chaperone and insertase.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 7299Google Scholar) and MD simulation studies (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar) revealed that the aromatic residues at 516 and 517 in the E. coli YidC are located above arginine 366 at the top of the hydrophilic groove (Fig. 1B). Our first question concerned the necessity of these two aromatic residues. Y516, Y517, or both Y516 and Y517 were mutated to alanines. The activities of these mutants were determined utilizing the YidC depletion strain JS7131, with the endogenous yidC knocked out and a new copy of yidC gene under the control of the araBAD promoter introduced at the lambda attachment site (6Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. YidC mediates membrane protein insertion in bacteria.Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar). The JS7131 cells harboring WT YidC or the YidC mutants were analyzed by serial dilution on a LB glucose or arabinose plate at 37 °C. We found that the Ala substitution of Y517 (Figs. 2A and S1), Y516 (Fig. S1), or Y516/Y517 (Fig. S1) complemented the YidC depletion strain. However, when R366 was mutated to Ala or Cys, then Y517 was important for the activity but not Y516. Ala or Cys substitutions of R366 combined with Y517A did not complement the YidC depletion strain (Figs. 2A and S1), while the single Ala substitutions of R366 (Fig. 2A) and double R366A/Y516C did complement (Fig. S1). Next, we examined directly the activity of the mutants by testing the membrane insertion of two YidC-dependent proteins. First, we analyzed the model protein procoat-Lep (PC) (Fig. 1C). Procoat-Lep corresponds to PC with its C-terminal cytoplasmic region extended by 101 amino acids of the periplasmic domain of leader peptidase (Lep) (9Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Function of YidC for the insertion of M13 procoat protein in E. coli: Translocation of mutants that show differences in their membrane potential dependence and sec requirement.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Google Scholar). If PC-Lep inserts across the membrane, it is cleaved by signal peptidase 1 and converted to coat-Lep (C). The R366A and Y517A YidC single mutants were fully active in inserting PC-Lep while the double R366A/Y517A mutant was inhibited leaving PC partially uncleaved (Fig. 2B, -Ara condition). Similar results were seen with the Pf3-23Lep substrate, which has the Lep residues 23 to 323 fused after the TM segment of Pf3 coat and an arginine introduced after the TM of Pf3-23Lep to prevent translocation of the Lep C-terminal domain (24Chen Y. Soman R. Shanmugam S.K. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35656-35667Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). When Pf3-Lep (P) inserts across the membrane, proteinase K (PK) digests the N-tail of Pf3-Lep and converts it to a smaller fragment (F). Figure 2B shows that Pf3-23Lep was inserted efficiently with either the R366A or Y517A single mutant, while insertion was blocked with the R366A/Y517A double mutant (Fig. 2B, - Ara condition). It is worth noting that unlike Pf3-23Lep, which showed almost complete loss of insertion with the double mutant, PC-Lep was only partially inhibited. This has also been observed previously (24Chen Y. Soman R. Shanmugam S.K. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35656-35667Google Scholar), possibly due to the different insertion mechanisms employed by the two substrates. For all the mutants described here, the protein was stably expressed as determined by Western blotting (Fig. S5). The requirement of the positive charge was confirmed by substituting R366 with neutral (Ala, Cys, Asn), positively charged (Lys), or negatively charged (Asp) residues in the presence of Y517A mutation. As shown in Fig. S1, only the lysine mutant, R366K/Y517A, is active as it complemented the YidC depletion strain. The combined results show that we were able to make the arginine 366 in E. coli YidC essential by mutating the nearby tyrosine 517 residue. To address what characteristics of residue 517 determines whether R366 is required for YidC function, we substituted tyrosine 517 with an apolar, aromatic, or polar residue and tested whether YidC is functional when the positive charge (R366) is removed. Complementation studies revealed that the R366 neutral mutant (R366A or R366N) did not complement the YidC depletion strain when combined with an apolar substitution for Y517 (Y517G, Y517C, Y517A Y517V, or Y517I), while very poor complementation was observed for the Y517T and Y517M mutants (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, when the residue at position 517 had a hydrophilic (517N, 517S) or aromatic side chain (517W and 517F), we observed full complementation under YidC depletion conditions (Fig. 3, A and C). For the 366 residue, no difference was observed if there was a slightly hydrophobic alanine or a hydrophilic asparagine residue (data not shown). As a second test of YidC activity, we performed membrane insertion assays using PC-Lep and Pf3-23Lep (Fig. S2) and determined the amount of inserted protein by quantitation (Fig. 3D). Membrane insertion of PC-Lep and Pf3-23Lep was inhibited when the 517 tyrosine was changed to an apolar, nonaromatic amino acid, and arginine 366 was changed to either an Ala or Asn residue corroborating the complementation results (Fig. S2). Previously, we found that the strictly conserved arginine R73 in S. mutans 247YidC2 (equivalent to R366 in E. coli) is essential as the protein was inactive when the R73 residue in the hydrophilic groove was substituted with a neutral or negatively charged residue (24Chen Y. Soman R. Shanmugam S.K. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35656-35667Google Scholar). 247YidC2 consists of residues 1 to 247 of the E. coli YidC fused to residues 25 to 310 of S. mutans YidC2 containing the conserved arginine at position 73. Since the hydrophobicity at residue 517 can determine whether the R366 is essential or not in the E. coli YidC, we went on to test whether mutation of the W234 residue (corresponding to the Y517 residue in E. coli) in the S. mutans YidC2 could affect the requirement of R73 (corresponding to R366 in E. coli). Remarkably, when the W234 residue at the top of the groove of 247YidC2 was substituted with amino acids with hydrophilic sidechains (Asn or Ser), YidC2 could complement the YidC depletion strain even without the positively charged residue in the groove (R73Q), while it did not complement with an apolar amino acid at 234 (Val or Ile) (Fig. 3B). As expected, the membrane-insertion activities of the S. mutans R73Q/W234V and R73Q/W234I 247YidC2 mutants were inhibited for the PC-Lep substrate and was completely abolished for the Pf3-Lep substrate (Figs. S2 and 3D). Taken together, these results reveal a pattern that applies to both E. coli YidC and S. mutans YidC2: the conserved positively charged residue is required for activity when there is an apolar residue at position 517 in the E. coli YidC or at position 234 in the S. mutans YidC2, but not when there is a hydrophilic residue at these sites. The results reported above show a clear correlation between the requirement of the conserved positive charge and the hydrophobicity near the top of the hydrophilic groove in both E. coli YidC and S. mutans YidC2. We hypothesize that the positively charged residue is required to maintain a hydrophilic environment in the groove. To test this hypothesis, we examined the solvent accessibility of nine previously determined groove residues under WT and mutated conditions in the intact bacterial cells at 30 °C using a well-developed cysteine alkylation assay (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar). Using this technique, each of the groove residues were mutated to single cysteine residues. If the cysteine is in a water-exposed environment, it will be reactive toward N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) because the cysteine thiol is deprotonated. If the cysteine is in a lipid-exposed environment, then the cysteine will not react with NEM because the thiol is protonated. To determine whether the YidC cysteine is modified by NEM, we treated the samples in a later step with methoxypolyethylene glycol maleimide (Mal-PEG), which leads to a 5 kD shift in the molecular weight of YidC, only if it had not reacted with NEM (lipid exposed). Therefore, a change in the position of YidC on the gel when NEM is added prior to the addition of Mal-PEG indicates exposure to lipid. If there is no shift with Mal-PEG when NEM is added, the Cys is solvent exposed. The WT condition starts with the Cys-less YidC (C423S) (Fig. 4A) and refers to the circumstance where Y517 and R366 are left unmutated except when their own solvent accessibility is studied (top panels). Under the mutated condition, Y517 is exchanged to an apolar isoleucine residue and R366 is substituted with a neutral asparagine amino acid simultaneously. Figure 4A shows that the solvent exposure of Y517C is decreased considerably when the R366 is changed to a neutral asparagine. Similarly, R366C is much less water accessible when Y517 is mutated to apolar isoleucine residue. Likewise, the solvent accessibility is decreased for 432C when Y517 and R366 are substituted with an Ile and Asn, respectively. A less dramatic effect on water exposure is observed further down in the groove. With the Y517I and R366N mutations introduced, the solvent exposures of S520C and I428C residues are decreased, but to a lesser extent, than the cysteine mutants in the upper region of the groove. A negligible effect was observed when the water accessibility was examined toward the cytoplasmic side of the groove at positions M475, Y370, M498, and T524 when the Y517I and R366N mutations were made. A summary of the results is shown in Figure 4B, with the top panels representing the WT and the bottom panels the mutated construct. Cyan indicates residues that are completely water exposed, yellow moderate accessibility, and red residues that are not solvent accessible. The top panel shows that the groove is mostly aqueous under WT condition, while a cluster of red and yellow residues can be observed at the dome of the groove under mutated condition as revealed by the bottom panel, implying that the top part of the groove is not hydrated in these cases. To confirm these results, we also performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) power saturation studies to examine solvent accessibility of a spin label incorporated into the hydrophilic groove. His-tagged YidC mutants listed in Figure 4C were purified, spin-labeled with (1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSL), reconstituted into 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposomes, and subjected to EPR power saturation experiments at 22 °C as described in “Experimental procedures”. The saturation curves for each mutant in the presence of either nitrogen, oxygen, or nickel(II) ethylenediaminediacetate (NiEDDA) are shown in Figure 4C, from which the saturation parameters P1/2 were obtained and the immersion depth parameters Φ were calculated using Equation 2 in “Experimental procedures”. As a control, a spin label was introduced at position 366 and determined to be solvent accessible as indicated by the highly negative Φ value (−0.8). When Y517 was substituted with a hydrophilic residue (Y517N), position 366 remained accessible (Φ = −0.8). However, the spin label at 366 was no longer water accessible (Φ = 0.9) when the apolar residue isoleucine was introduced at position 517 (Fig. 4C). A spin label was also attached to the top of the hydrophilic groove (Y517C) and studied with different mutations at R366. Figure 4C shows that in all cases studied (Y517C, R366N/Y517C, R366I/Y517C), position 517 was accessible to solvent. However, a closer investigation of the Φ values suggested that when the positive charge was removed (R366N/Y517C or R366I/Y517C), 517 became much less solvent accessible (−0.2) than when it was present (−0.9), indicating that the positive charge at 366 contributes to keeping the groove hydrated. Additionally, we carried out a series of comprehensive 200-ns long MD simulations of WT E. coli YidC and the Y517I/R366N mutant at ∼27 °C (300 K) embedded in a POPE:POPG (75:25) lipid bilayer. To evaluate the level of hydration at various locations within the groove, the number of water molecules within 6 Å of Cα atoms of various groove residues during the last 40 ns was counted (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar) and normalized to the standard-state accessible surface areas Ao of the fully exposed residues of soluble proteins as previously reported (25Chen Y. Capponi S. Zhu L. Gellenbeck P. Freites J.A. White S.H. Dalbey R.E. YidC insertase of Escherichia coli: Water accessibility and membrane shaping.Structure. 2017; 25: 1403-1414.e3Google Scholar). Fig. S3 shows that the water accessibility decreases surrounding residues 366, 520, 521, and 527 in the middle and bottom part of the groove for the construct Y517I/R366N compared to the WT YidC. The combined results support our hypothesis that the positive charge at site 366 in E. coli is required to maintain a hydrophilic microenvironment in the groove when Y517 is substituted with an apolar residue. We note that 517C appears to be more solvent accessible in EPR studies compared to in alkylation studies, possibly due to the size or polarity of the MTSL spin label. If the arginine in the groove serves to make the groove sufficiently hydrated, then a negative charge should also function in this capacity. However, previous studies showed that the negative charge inactivated YidC (24Chen Y. Soman R. Shanmugam S.K. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35656-35667Google Scholar). To determine if it is possible to obtain a functional E. coli YidC with a negative charged residue replacing the arginine at site 366, we searched for suppressor mutations of the inactive YidCR366E mutant. Intriguingly, we did obtain one suppressor mutation, R366E/F433S, after randomly mutagenizing YidC in the XL1 red mutator strain. This secondary mutation allowed the R366E YidC to complement the YidC depletion strain under glucose condition (Fig. 5A). The new serine side chain (F433S) is located above site 366 in the hydrophilic groove and may interact with the tyrosine 517 residue (see Fig. 6A). As expected, the R366E/F433S YidC mutant promotes membrane insertion of PC-Lep and of Pf3-23Lep (Figs. 5, B and C and S4). Further, in a reconstituted in vitro system, we examined"
https://openalex.org/W4211005821,"DTG/DTS rhodopsin, which was named based on a three-residue motif (DTG or DTS) that is important for its function, is a light-driven proton-pumping microbial rhodopsin using a retinal chromophore. In contrast to other light-driven ion-pumping rhodopsins, DTG/DTS rhodopsin does not have a cytoplasmic proton donor residue, such as Asp, Glu, or Lys. Because of the lack of cytoplasmic proton donor residue, proton directly binds to the retinal chromophore from the cytoplasmic solvent. However, mutational experiments that showed the complicated effects of mutations were not able to clarify the roles played by each residue, and the detail of proton uptake pathway is unclear because of the lack of structural information. To understand the proton transport mechanism of DTG/DTS rhodopsin, here we report the three-dimensional structure of one of the DTG/DTS rhodopsins, PspR from Pseudomonas putida, by X-ray crystallography. We show that the structure of the cytoplasmic side of the protein is significantly different from that of bacteriorhodopsin, the best-characterized proton-pumping rhodopsin, and large cytoplasmic cavities were observed. We propose that these hydrophilic cytoplasmic cavities enable direct proton uptake from the cytoplasmic solvent without the need for a specialized cytoplasmic donor residue. The introduction of carboxylic residues homologous to the cytoplasmic donors in other proton-pumping rhodopsins resulted in higher pumping activity with less pH dependence, suggesting that DTG/DTS rhodopsins are advantageous for producing energy and avoiding intracellular alkalization in soil and plant-associated bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4211241065,"Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex essential for lung function, and insufficiency or altered surfactant composition is associated with major lung diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndromes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pulmonary surfactant is primarily composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in complex with specialized surfactant proteins and secreted by alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Surfactant homeostasis on the alveolar surface is balanced by the rates of synthesis and secretion with reuptake and recycling by AT2 cells, with some degradation by pulmonary macrophages and loss up the bronchial tree. However, whether phospholipid (PL) transporters exist in AT2 cells to mediate reuptake of surfactant PL remains to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a), a sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) transporter, is expressed at the apical surface of AT2 cells. A mouse model with inducible AT2 cell-specific deficiency of Mfsd2a exhibited AT2 cell hypertrophy with reduced total surfactant PL levels because of reductions in the most abundant surfactants, PC containing dipalmitic acid, and PC species containing the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid. These changes in surfactant levels and composition were mirrored by similar changes in the AT2 cell lipidome. Mechanistically, direct tracheal instillation of fluorescent LPC and PC probes indicated that Mfsd2a mediates the uptake of LPC generated by pulmonary phospholipase activity in the alveolar space. These studies reveal that Mfsd2a-mediated LPC uptake is quantitatively important in maintaining surfactant homeostasis and identify this lipid transporter as a physiological component of surfactant recycling."

While there are a number of in vivo rodent models for evaluating tumor biology and response to therapy, these models require significant time and resources. Here, we established the chick-embryo chorioallantoic (CAM) assay as an affordable and time efficient xenograft model for testing a variety of treatment approaches for DIPG. We found that patient-derived DIPG tumors develop in the CAM and maintain the same genetic and epigenetic characteristics of native DIPG tumors. We monitored tumor response to pharmaco- and radiation therapy by 3-D ultrasound volumetric and vasculature analysis. In this study, we established and validated the CAM model as a potential intermediate xenograft model for DIPG and its use for testing novel treatment approaches that include pharmacotherapy or radiation."

https://openalex.org/W4225691171,"Increasing whole-body energy expenditure via the pharmacological activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is a promising weight management strategy, yet most therapeutics studied in rodents to date either induce compensatory increases in energy intake, have thermogenic effects that are confounded by sub-thermoneutral housing temperatures or are not well tolerated in humans. Here, we sought to determine whether the non-invasive topical application of the pharmacological cold mimetic and transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) agonist L-menthol (MNTH), could be used to stimulate BAT thermogenesis and attenuate weight gain in mice housed at thermoneutrality. Using three different strains of mice and multiple complimentary approaches to quantify thermogenesis in vivo, coupled with ex vivo models to quantify direct thermogenic effects, we were able to convincingly demonstrate the following: (1) acute topical MNTH application induces BAT thermogenesis in a TRPM8- and UCP1-dependent manner; (2) MNTH-induced BAT thermogenesis is sufficient to attenuate weight gain over time without affecting energy intake in lean and obese mice; (3) the ability of topical MNTH application to stimulate BAT thermogenesis is mediated, in part, by a central mechanism involving the release of norepinephrine. These data collectively suggest that topical application of MNTH may be a promising weight management strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4210880073,"The viral protein HBx is the key regulatory factor of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the main etiology for HBV-associated liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Historically, HBx has defied biochemical and structural characterization, deterring efforts to understand its molecular mechanisms. Here we show that soluble HBx fused to solubility tags copurifies with either a [2Fe-2S] or a [4Fe-4S] cluster, a feature that is shared among five HBV genotypes. We show that the O2-stable [2Fe-2S] cluster form converts to an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] state when reacted with chemical reductants, a transformation that is best described by a reductive coupling mechanism reminiscent of Fe-S cluster scaffold proteins. In addition, the Fe-S cluster conversions are partially reversible in successive reduction-oxidation cycles, with cluster loss mainly occurring during (re)oxidation. The considerably negative reduction potential of the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ couple (-520 mV) suggests that electron transfer may not be likely in the cell. Collectively, our findings identify HBx as an Fe-S protein with striking similarities to Fe-S scaffold proteins both in cluster type and reductive transformation. An Fe-S cluster in HBx offers new insights into its previously unknown molecular properties and sets the stage for deciphering the roles of HBx-associated iron (mis)regulation and reactive oxygen species in the context of liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4210961368,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a posttranslational glycolipid modification of proteins that anchors proteins in lipid rafts on the cell surface. Although some GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), including the prion protein PrPC, have a glycan side chain composed of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)−galactose−sialic acid on the core structure of GPI glycolipid, in vivo functions of this GPI-GalNAc side chain are largely unresolved. Here, we investigated the physiological and pathological roles of the GPI-GalNAc side chain in vivo by knocking out its initiation enzyme, PGAP4, in mice. We show that Pgap4 mRNA is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, and mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the loss of the GalNAc side chain in PrPC GPI in PGAP4-KO mouse brains. Furthermore, PGAP4-KO mice exhibited various phenotypes, including an elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level, impaired bone formation, decreased locomotor activity, and impaired memory, despite normal expression levels and lipid raft association of various GPI-APs. Thus, we conclude that the GPI-GalNAc side chain is required for in vivo functions of GPI-APs in mammals, especially in bone and the brain. Moreover, PGAP4-KO mice were more vulnerable to prion diseases and died earlier after intracerebral inoculation of the pathogenic prion strains than wildtype mice, highlighting the protective roles of the GalNAc side chain against prion diseases. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a posttranslational glycolipid modification of proteins that anchors proteins in lipid rafts on the cell surface.

Addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) to proteins is a posttranslational modification of proteins widely conserved among eukaryotes (1Kinoshita T. Biosynthesis and biology of mammalian GPI-anchored proteins.Open Biol. 2020; 10: 190290Google Scholar, 2Liu Y.S. Fujita M. Mammalian GPI-anchor modifications and the enzymes involved.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 1129-1138Google Scholar). Approximately 150 types of mammalian proteins, including Thy1, 120-kDa neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM120), alkaline phosphatases (ALPs), and prion protein (PrPC), are modified by GPI and expressed in lipid rafts (usually defined as a detergent-resistant membrane [DRM]) on the cell surface through GPI (3Ferguson M.A.J. Hart G.W. Kinoshita T. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G. Kinoshita T. Packer N.H. Prestegard J.H. Schnaar R.L.

These GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) fulfill significant roles in early development, synaptic formation, and immunological regulation. Mammalian GPI is composed of a common core structure, EtNP-6Manα1−2Manα1−6(EtNP)Manα1−4GlcNα1-6myoinositol-phospholipid (where EtNP, Man, and GlcN are ethanolamine phosphate, mannose, and glucosamine, respectively, Fig. 1A) (1Kinoshita T.

Trans. 2020; 48: 1129-1138Google Scholar). The mammalian GPI core structure can be further modified with various side chains. One modification is the linking of the fourth Man to the third Man via an α1,2 linkage (4Taron B.W. Colussi P.A. Wiedman J.M. Orlean P. Taron C.H. Human Smp3p adds a fourth mannose to yeast and human glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursors in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36083-36092Google Scholar), whereas the other is the attachment of the GalNAc side chain, which is composed of at most three sugar residues, to the first Man residue. The structure of the GalNAc side chain is Neu5Acα2−3Galβ1−3GalNAcβ1−4(Man) (where Neu5Ac, Gal, and GalNAc are N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, respectively, Fig. 1A) (5Homans S.W.

Chem. 2020; 295: 7789-7798Google Scholar). These side chains provide structural diversity to GPI-glycans. The biosynthesis of GPI starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Sugars and EtNP moieties are sequentially added to a phosphatidylinositol by step-wise reactions, and complete GPI precursors are generated, followed by en bloc transfer of the GPI moiety to proteins by GPI transamidase, generating nascent GPI-APs (1Kinoshita T. Biosynthesis and biology of mammalian GPI-anchored proteins.Open Biol. 2020; 10: 190290Google Scholar, 2Liu Y.S. Fujita M. Mammalian GPI-anchor modifications and the enzymes involved.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 1129-1138Google Scholar). GPI-glycan and -lipid structures of nascent GPI-APs are then remodeled in the ER and Golgi to complete GPI maturation (1Kinoshita T. Biosynthesis and biology of mammalian GPI-anchored proteins.Open Biol. 2020; 10: 190290Google Scholar, 2Liu Y.S. Fujita M. Mammalian GPI-anchor modifications and the enzymes involved.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 1129-1138Google Scholar). Although the biosynthetic pathway of the core GPI is well characterized, biosynthesis of the GPI-GalNAc side chain has not been studied for over 30 years since the complete chemical structure of mammalian GPI, including GalNAc addition, was reported in 1988 (5Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Anand R. Williams A.F. Complete structure of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor of rat brain Thy-1 glycoprotein.Nature. 1988; 333: 269-272Google Scholar). We recently identified post-GPI attachment to proteins factor 4 (PGAP4, also known as TMEM246), a GPI-specific GalNAc transferase that catalyzes the first reaction for generating the GalNAc side chain (Fig. 1A) (8Hirata T. Mishra S.K. Nakamura S. Saito K. Motooka D. Takada Y. Kanzawa N. Murakami Y. Maeda Y. Fujita M. Yamaguchi Y. Kinoshita T. Identification of a Golgi GPI-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase with tandem transmembrane regions in the catalytic domain.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 405Google Scholar). PGAP4 has weak homology to GnT-IVa, an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase for N-glycan branching, and uniquely has three transmembrane domains (8Hirata T. Mishra S.K. Nakamura S. Saito K. Motooka D. Takada Y. Kanzawa N. Murakami Y. Maeda Y. Fujita M. Yamaguchi Y. Kinoshita T. Identification of a Golgi GPI-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase with tandem transmembrane regions in the catalytic domain.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 405Google Scholar). More recently, we identified B3GALT4 as the Gal transferase for the GPI side chain (Fig. 1A) (9Wang Y. Maeda Y. Liu Y.S. Takada Y. Ninomiya A. Hirata T. Fujita M. Murakami Y. Kinoshita T. Cross-talks of glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis with glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and ER-associated degradation.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 860Google Scholar). In contrast to PGAP4, B3GALT4 is involved in biosynthesis of not only GPI but also GM1, another type of glycolipid (10Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K.

We also showed that sialic acid of the GPI side chain of human brain PrPC is attached via an α2,3-linkage (7Kobayashi A. Hirata T. Nishikaze T. Ninomiya A. Maki Y. Takada Y. Kitamoto T. Kinoshita T. alpha2,3 Linkage of sialic acid to a GPI anchor and an unpredicted GPI attachment site in human prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 7789-7798Google Scholar). These studies have largely elucidated the structure and the biosynthetic pathway of the GPI-GalNAc side chain. Several lines of studies using knockout (KO) mice of GPI biosynthetic genes have revealed the physiological significance of the core structure of GPI and remodeling of GPI. Loss of GPI-APs or abnormal GPI structures cause severe phenotypes, including early embryonic lethality (12Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J.

In addition, recent genetic studies have reported patients with inherited GPI deficiency (IGD) who have genetic mutations in GPI biosynthetic genes, including GPI remodeling enzymes.

Other symptoms seen in patients with IGD are brain anomalies (such as delayed myelination, cerebral atrophy, and hypoplasia of the cerebellum), dysmorphic facial features, malformations, hyperphosphatasia, skeletal abnormalities (such as scoliosis, osteoporosis, and reduced mineralization), organ anomalies (such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, and muscular anomalies), and deafness (22Johnston J.J.

These lines of evidence clearly demonstrate that GPI is vitally important for development and various physiological functions, and not only loss of GPI-AP expression but also abnormal GPI structures cause severe disorders. These findings suggest that GPI side chains, including the GalNAc side chain, also play significant functional roles in vivo. However, the in vivo functions of the GPI-GalNAc side chain remain unknown. Prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker (GSS) syndrome in humans and scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and chronic wasting syndrome in animals, are lethal, transmissible, and progressive neurodegenerative disorders (28Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 29Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prion protein biology.Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Google Scholar). Prion diseases are caused by the accumulation of the disease type of prion protein (scrapie form of the prion protein, PrPSc), which is converted from normal prion protein (cellular prion protein, PrPC) (28Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). Although the conversion mechanisms of PrPC to PrPSc remain largely unknown, the structural features of PrPC and PrPSc are well described with α-helix-rich and β-sheet-rich structures, respectively (28Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 30Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Conversion of alpha-helices into beta-sheets features in the formation of the scrapie prion proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar). KO mice of the Prnp gene, encoding PrPC, are resistant to the prion disease even after inoculation with PrPSc (31Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Mice devoid of PrP are resistant to scrapie.Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Google Scholar, 32Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A. Koehler R. Foster D. Torchia M. Burton D. Yang S.L. DeArmond S.J.

A. 1993; 90: 10608-10612Google Scholar), demonstrating that the presence of PrPC is critical for the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Furthermore, knocking out Prnp in neurons after inoculation of PrPSc strains prevents further conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in neurons and rescues neurodegeneration caused by the PrPSc infection (33Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Depleting neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Google Scholar). Mice even showed persistent gliosis because of PrPSc accumulation in astrocytes and microglia (33Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Depleting neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Google Scholar). Therefore, preventing PrPSc formation in neurons represents a robust potential therapeutic approach against prion diseases for which no clinical treatment exists. A recent study suggested that the pathology of prion diseases arises from two distinct mechanisms: the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and the neurotoxic signaling from PrPSc (34Sandberg M.K. Al-Doujaily H. Sharps B. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Prion propagation and toxicity in vivo occur in two distinct mechanistic phases.Nature. 2011; 470: 540-542Google Scholar). Previous evidences have shown that the GPI of PrPC is involved in the pathology of prion diseases through both mechanisms (35Puig B. Altmeppen H. Glatzel M. The GPI-anchoring of PrP: Implications in sorting and pathogenesis.Prion. 2014; 8: 11-18Google Scholar). For example, the lifespan of transgenic mice expressing GPI-anchorless PrPC was greatly prolonged after inoculation with PrPSc and persistent accumulation of PrPSc (36Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M.

Fatal transmissible amyloid encephalopathy: A new type of prion disease associated with lack of prion protein membrane anchoring.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1000800Google Scholar), suggesting that neurotoxicity of PrPSc depends on membrane anchoring of PrPSc through GPI. Furthermore, an in vitro study using cultured neurons showed that PrPC with desialylated GPI is resistant to conversion to PrPSc (39Bate C. Nolan W. Williams A. Sialic acid on the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor regulates PrP-mediated cell signaling and prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 160-170Google Scholar). The results from another study suggested that mice expressing PrPC with less sialylated GPI have a prolonged incubation period after challenging with PrPSc because of the reduction in PrPSc accumulation and intracellular signaling (40Puig B. Altmeppen H.C. Linsenmeier L. Chakroun K. Wegwitz F. Piontek U.K. Tatzelt J. Bate C. Magnus T. Glatzel M. GPI-anchor signal sequence influences PrPC sorting, shedding and signalling, and impacts on different pathomechanistic aspects of prion disease in mice.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007520Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the GPI-anchor affects the conversion process of PrPC to PrPSc. The recent identification of the biosynthetic enzymes for the GalNAc side chain enables us to investigate whether the GPI-GalNAc side chain is involved in the pathology of prion diseases in vivo. In this study, we aimed to understand in vivo functions of the GPI-GalNAc side chain in normal and disease states. For this purpose, we generated PGAP4-KO (Pgap4−/−) mice and performed biochemical and behavioral tests. In addition, we intracerebrally inoculated PrPSc in PGAP4-KO mice and measured their lifespan. We reveal that PGAP4-KO mice exhibit various phenotypes and progress of the pathology of prion disease. Thus, our study uncovers the physiological and pathological significance of the GPI-GalNAc side chain. PGAP4-KO mice were generated to elucidate the physiological and pathological roles of the GPI-GalNAc side chain. We designed the KO construct by in-frame insertion of the EGFP sequence into the Pgap4 allele to disrupt PGAP4 expression and to express EGFP under the Pgap4 promoter to detect endogenously PGAP4-expressing cells and tissues (Fig. 1B). The Pgap4 allele was digested with the CRISPR-Cas9 system (41Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F. Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.Science. 2013; 339: 819-823Google Scholar, 42Mali P. Yang L. Esvelt K.M. Aach J. Guell M. DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Google Scholar) in ES cells cotransfected with a targeting vector with the EGFP sequence and homology arms of the Pgap4 sequence (Fig. 1B). ES cells with the EGFP sequence correctly inserted into the Pgap4 allele were introduced to early embryos. The obtained chimeric mice were then crossed with wildtype (WT) mice to obtain heterozygous PGAP4-KO mice. Heterozygotes were crossed with each other, and the genotypes of the obtained mice were determined by PCR (Fig. 1C). PGAP4-KO mice were viable and born along with Mendel’s laws (41:98:54), and both male and female KO mice were fertile, indicating that PGAP4 is not essential for embryonic development and fertilization. Quantitative reverse transcriptional PCR using various tissue samples was performed to reveal the tissue distribution of Pgap4 mRNA. We found that Pgap4 expression was limited to specific tissues, including brain, lung, heart, kidney, and testis, with the highest expression in brain (Fig. 1D), whereas GPI-APs are expressed ubiquitously (3Ferguson M.A.J. Hart G.W. Kinoshita T. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G. Kinoshita T. Packer N.H. Prestegard J.H. Schnaar R.L. Seeberger P.H. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Hobor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015: 137-150Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the GalNAc side chain may have specific functions in select tissues. In the brain, expression of PGAP4, which can be monitored by GFP expression in KO mice, was widely observed (Fig. S1A). Costaining of hippocampal sections for GFP and markers for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), and microglia (Iba1) showed that PGAP4 is expressed predominantly in neurons (Figs. 1E and S1, B and C). The in vivo functions of the GalNAc side chain were examined by first investigating protein expression of particular GPI-APs in the brain. The expression levels of three GPI-APs, NCAM120 (NCAM has three transcriptional isoforms, NCAM180, NCAM140, and NCAM120, in which NCAM120 is the only GPI-AP), PrPC, and Thy1 in KO mouse brains were comparable with those in WT brains (Fig. 1F). This result indicates that the GalNAc side chain is dispensable for the expression of these GPI-APs in cells. Next, we investigated whether adding the GalNAc side chain contributes to the association of GPI-APs with lipid rafts. To this end, we treated the brain homogenates with cold detergent (Triton X-100) and isolated the undissolved fraction as DRM. All three GPI-APs, NCAM120, PrPC, and Thy1, were detected primarily in the DRM fraction and the detection levels were similar between WT and KO samples (Fig. 1G), indicating that the GalNAc side chain does not contribute to raft association of GPI-APs. We noticed that mobility in SDS-PAGE of PrPC and Thy1 from KO brain was slightly faster than WT proteins (Fig. 1, F and G), suggesting that glycosylation of these proteins was altered in KO mice. To investigate whether the mobility shift of these proteins is due to an alteration of N-glycan structures, we treated the brain samples with or without peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to remove N-glycans. Even after PNGase F treatment, the mobility difference between WT and KO samples was still observed (Fig. 1H, compare lanes 3 and 4), strongly suggesting that GPI structures, but not N-glycans on these proteins, are altered in KO mice. We purified PrPC from brain membrane lysates to determine the precise GPI structures in the KO mouse brain (Fig. S2A) and removed N-glycans and GPI-lipids by treatment with PNGase F and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), respectively. Peptides were obtained by in-gel digestion. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis using a C18 column identified peptides mainly from PrPC (Table S1). We then analyzed the structures of GPI-glycans by LC-MS using a HILIC column (Fig. S2, B and C). We identified two species of GPI-glycans in WT PrPC, Hex-HexNAc-(Hex)GPI, and HexNAc-(Hex)GPI; both contain the GalNAc side chain (Fig. 1L and Table S2). Contrary to our expectation based on previous structural analysis of hamster and human PrPC GPIs (6Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Glycosylinositol phospholipid anchors of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins contain sialic acid.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Google Scholar, 7Kobayashi A. Hirata T. Nishikaze T. Ninomiya A. Maki Y. Takada Y. Kitamoto T. Kinoshita T. alpha2,3 Linkage of sialic acid to a GPI anchor and an unpredicted GPI attachment site in human prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 7789-7798Google Scholar), we did not find GPI with sialic acid. This observation was most likely because the amount of WT PrPC we obtained and used for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was too small. In contrast to PrPC from WT brains, (Hex)GPI and GPI only, neither of which has the GalNAc side chain, were detected in PrPC from KO brains (Fig. 1I and Table S2). This demonstrated that loss of PGAP4 almost completely abolished the presence of the GalNAc side chain in the brain. The presence of Hex-HexNAc-(Hex)GPI in WT but not in KO PrPC strongly suggests that the GalNAc side chain is elongated with a Gal residue in WT brain. To confirm that PGAP4 and B3GALT4, the GalNAc and Gal transferases, respectively, are expressed in the same cells, we simultaneously detected GFP and B3galt4 mRNA by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. In all three brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) tested, B3galt4 signals overlapped well with GFP signals in the KO mouse sections (Fig. 1J, white arrowhead), whereas cells with PGAP4 expression without B3galt4 expression were hardly detected (Fig. 1J). These results indicated that PGAP4 and B3GALT4 are expressed in the same cells and the GalNAc side chain is elongated by Gal in the brain. To further investigate the role of PGAP4 in adding GalNAc to GPI in vivo, we examined the production of GalNAc-modified free GPI (Fig. 1A, right), that is, the protein-unlinked form, and detected this species with the specific antibody termed T5_4E10 (T5) (8Hirata T.

https://openalex.org/W4211000287,"Peripheral myelination is a complicated process, wherein Schwann cells (SCs) promote the formation of the myelin sheath around the axons of peripheral neurons. Fibroblasts are the second resident cells in the peripheral nerves; however, the precise function of fibroblasts in SC-mediated myelination has rarely been examined. Here, we show that exosomes derived from fibroblasts boost myelination-related gene expression in SCs. We used exosome sequencing, together with bioinformatic analysis, to demonstrate that exosomal microRNA miR-673-5p is capable of stimulating myelin gene expression in SCs. Subsequent functional studies revealed that miR-673-5p targets the regulator of mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) tuberous sclerosis complex 2 in SCs, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including mTORC1 and sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2. In vivo experiments further confirmed that miR-673-5p activates the tuberous sclerosis complex 2/mTORC1/sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 axis, thus promoting the synthesis of cholesterol and related lipids and subsequently accelerating myelin sheath maturation in peripheral nerves. Overall, our findings revealed exosome-mediated cross talk between fibroblasts and SCs that plays a pivotal role in peripheral myelination. We propose that exosomes derived from fibroblasts and miR-673-5p might be useful for promoting peripheral myelination in translational medicine."

Baseline OCT and OCT-A morphological features and fluid measurements were correlated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to changes in BCVA from baseline to week 52.Total retinal fluid (IRF, SRF and PED) volume at baseline had the strongest correlation to improvement in BCVA at month 12 (PCC = 0.652, p = 0.005). Fluid was subsequently sub-categorized into IRF, SRF and PED, with PED volume having the next highest correlation (PCC = 0.648, p = 0.005) to BCVA improvement. Average total retinal thickness in isolation demonstrated poor correlation (PCC = 0.334, p = 0.189). When two features, mean choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) size and total fluid volume, were combined and correlated with visual outcomes, the highest correlation increased to PCC = 0.695 (p = 0.002).In isolation, total fluid volume most closely correlates with change in BCVA values between baseline and week 52. In combination with complimentary information from OCT-A, an improvement in the linear correlation score was observed. Average total retinal thickness provided a lower correlation, and thus provides a lower predictive outcome than alternative metrics assessed. Clinically, a machine-learning approach to analyzing fluid metrics in combination with lesion size may provide an advantage in personalizing therapy and predicting BCVA outcomes at week 52."
https://openalex.org/W4211155216,"The mitochondrial protein LonP1 is an ATP-dependent protease that mitigates cell stress and calibrates mitochondrial metabolism and energetics. Biallelic mutations in the LONP1 gene are known to cause a broad spectrum of diseases, and LonP1 dysregulation is also implicated in cancer and age-related disorders. Despite the importance of LonP1 in health and disease, specific inhibitors of this protease are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its -methyl and -imidazole derivatives reversibly inhibit LonP1 by a noncompetitive mechanism, blocking ATP-hydrolysis and thus proteolysis. By contrast, we found that CDDO-anhydride inhibits the LonP1 ATPase competitively. Docking of CDDO derivatives in the cryo-EM structure of LonP1 shows these compounds bind a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site. The binding site of CDDO derivatives was validated by amino acid substitutions that increased LonP1 inhibition and also by a pathogenic mutation that causes cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular and skeletal (CODAS) syndrome, which ablated inhibition. CDDO failed to inhibit the ATPase activity of the purified 26S proteasome, which like LonP1 belongs to the AAA+ superfamily of ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities, suggesting that CDDO shows selectivity within this family of ATPases. Furthermore, we show that noncytotoxic concentrations of CDDO derivatives in cultured cells inhibited LonP1, but not the 26S proteasome.

Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im inhibit LonP1 by a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition by blocking ATP binding and hydrolysis, whereas CDDO-anhydride inhibits LonP1 competitively. In addition, we docked these compounds into the cryo-EM structure of human LonP1 (PDB 7NGF) (38Mohammed I. Schmitz K.A. Schenck N. Topitsch A. Maier T. Abrahams J.P. Catalytic cycling of human mitochondrial Lon protease.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.1107.1128.454137Google Scholar) and validated the binding pocket by engineering amino acid substitutions of key binding pocket residues. Our results show that CDDO derivatives bind at two nonoverlapping sites within a hydrophobic pocket contiguous with a channel lined by polar residues forming salt bridges, which is adjacent to the ATP/ADP-binding site. The geometry of this binding site was scrutinized by engineered amino acid substitutions within the pockets that led to increased inhibition by CDDO and by a naturally occurring pathogenic missense LonP1 mutation that blocked inhibition. Lastly, we showed that CDDO does not inhibit the ATPase activity of purified 26S proteasome and noncytotoxic concentrations of CDDO derivatives in cultured cells blocked LonP1 but not the 26S proteasome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CDDO derivatives inhibit LonP1 by a new mechanism and also reveal the topological properties of an unidentified compound binding site, which can be exploited for developing chemical probes and chemotherapeutic agents to specifically target this essential cell stress response regulator.ResultsCDDO and its derivatives inhibit LonP1 by blocking ATP -binding and -hydrolysisWhile our prior work showed that CDDO and CDDO-Me inhibited protein degradation by both purified and cellular LonP1 (15Bernstein S.H.

The mitochondrial ATP-dependent Lon protease: A novel target in lymphoma death mediated by the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO and its derivatives.Blood. 2012; 119: 3321-3329Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of inhibition remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CDDO derivatives (Fig. 1A) inhibited not only the ATP-dependent protease activity of LonP1 as shown by degradation of fluorescently-labeled casein (FITC-casein) (Fig. 1 D, E and G), but also the ATPase activity as shown by endpoint assays (Fig. 1F) and continuous enzyme-coupled assays (Figs. 2 and S3). CDDO-Me and -Im inhibited the ATPase activity of LonP1 with greater potency than CDDO and CDDO-anhydride (Fig. 1F). CDDO-anhydride is a derivative in which the R group is another CDDO molecule (Fig. 1A). Notably, TP-82, which is identical to CDDO but lacks the electron-withdrawing nitrile moiety (Fig. 1B) (21Liby K.T. Sporn M.B.

Similarly, a pentacyclic triterpenoid enoxolone, lacking an electron-withdrawing group, did not inhibit the LonP1 ATPase (Fig. 1F). These results show that the electron-withdrawing moiety of CDDO derivatives is crucial for inhibiting LonP1.

The inhibitory effect of CDDO on ATP-dependent proteolysis was most pronounced after ≥20 min preincubation at 30 °C (Fig. 1, E and G), whereas CDDO-Me and -Im inhibited LonP1 after only 5 min at 30 °C (Figs. 1, E and G and S2B). The reversibility of inhibition by CDDO derivatives was demonstrated by preincubating LonP1 for 60 min at 30 °C with CDDO-Me with a high concentration of compound (10 μM) to completely block the degradation of FITC-casein (Fig. 1H), followed by dialyzing the reaction mixture at 4 °C for 24 h, which restored proteolytic activity (Fig. 1I). Collectively, these results support the notion that CDDO derivatives reversibly block the ATPase activity of LonP1, and that inhibition occurs by a mechanism independent of peptide bond hydrolysis.The LonP1 ATPase is inhibited noncompetitively by CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im, whereas CDDO-anhydride inhibits LonP1 competitivelyTo determine the mechanism of inhibition, enzyme kinetic assays were performed using an NADH coupled ATPase assay (Fig. 2) after preincubating LonP1 with compound or DMSO for 30 min at 25 °C. The noncompetitive inhibition of LonP1 by CDDO derivatives was demonstrated by determining the apparent Ki (αKi), apparent Vmax, Ki, and αKi values (Fig. 2, A–D for CDDO-Me and Fig. S3 for CDDO and CDDO-Im). Noncompetitive inhibition was readily apparent in the Lineweaver–Burk plots that produced plots with the same X-intercept (Figs. 2B and S3, B and F) but different Y-intercepts. CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im had α-values of 5.4, 4.3, and 1.1, respectively (Table 1), which indicated a higher affinity of the inhibitor for the free enzyme. We noted that the apparent Km increased with increasing inhibitor concentration, whereas the apparent Vmax decreased, suggesting that increasing substrate concentration was unable to overcome inhibition (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these results demonstrate a noncompetitive mechanism by which CDDO and its methyl and imidazole derivatives inhibit the ATPase and protease activities of LonP1 and a competitive mechanism of inhibition by CDDO-anhydride (Fig. S4).Table 1CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im inhibit the LonP1 ATPase by a noncompetitive mechanism, whereas CDDO-anhydride inhibits by a competitive mechanismCompoundModalityKi (μM)αKi (μM)αIC50 (μM)NCDDOnoncompetitive2.6 ± 0.514.0 ± 2.05.413 ± 66CDDO-Menoncompetitive0.8 ± 0.13.3 ± 1.04.31.9 ± 0.34CDDO-Imnoncompetitive1.9 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.11.12.0 ± 0.83CDDO-anhydridecompetitive9.5 ± 1.4N/AN/A19.4 ± 3.32Ki, αKi, and α were determined from continuous ATPase assays.

Open table in a new tab The Ki values for CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im inhibition of LonP1 were 2.6 ± 0.5, 0.8 ± 0.1, and 1.9 ± 0.7 μM, respectively (Table 1 and Figs. 2C and S3, D and H). The Ki was determined by Lineweaver–Burk plots. The inhibitory dissociation constants for E and ES complex (Ki and αKi, respectively) were independent of the substrate concentration by contrast to IC50 values (Table 1). Ki was determined by plotting the reciprocal of Vmax against the inhibitor concentration and the X-intercept provided an absolute values of αKi. The αKi values for CDDO, CDDO-Me, and CDDO-Im were 14 ± 2, 3.3 ±1.0, and 2.0 ± 0.1 μM, respectively (Table 1 and Figs. 2D and S3, C and G). The αKi values of these compounds were determined by plotting the reciprocal of Vmax against the inhibitor concentration and fitting the data by linear regression. The α values for CDDO and CDDO-Me were 5.4 and 4.3, respectively (Table 1), whereas the α for CDDO-Im was 1.1, and hence the Ki and αKi are nearly equal representing a unique case where the Ki and IC50 are predicted to be equal and independent of the substrate concentration.Identification of a unique binding pocket for CDDO derivatives adjacent to the LonP1 ATP-binding siteCryo-EM structures of human LonP1 consisting of the ATPase and protease domains have been reported (45Shin M.

It consists of a globular head and a flexible stalk domain that anchors the protein into the viral membrane. While the head domain has been extensively studied, the properties of the adjoining stalk are poorly understood. Here, we characterize the coiled-coil formation and thermodynamic stability of the stalk domain and its segments. We find that the N-terminal segment of the stalk does not form coiled-coils and remains disordered in solution. The C-terminal stalk segment forms a trimeric coiled-coil in solution, which becomes significantly stabilized in the context of the full-length stalk. Its crystal structure reveals a novel antiparallel tetramer coiled-coil with an unusual combination of a-d and e-a-d hydrophobic core packing. Structural analysis shows that a subset of hydrophobic residues stabilizes different coiled-coil structures: trimer, tetramer, and heterohexamer, underscoring a highly polymorphic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 stalk sequence."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a key role in PDAC tumor progression, which is often associated with aberrant glycosylation.

Here, we investigated the TGF-β-mediated response and glycosylation changes in the PaTu-8955S (PaTu-S) cell line deficient in SMA-related and MAD-related protein 4 (SMAD4), a signal transducer of the TGF-β signaling. PaTu-S cells responded to TGF-β by upregulating SMAD2 phosphorylation and target gene expression. We found that TGF-β induced expression of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin but did not significantly affect epithelial marker E-cadherin expression. We also examined differences in N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipid-linked glycans in PaTu-S cells upon TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β treatment primarily induced N-glycome aberrations involving elevated levels of branching, core fucosylation, and sialylation in PaTu-S cells, in agreement with TGF-β-induced changes in the expression of glycosylation-associated genes. In addition, we observed differences in O glycosylation and glycosphingolipid glycosylation profiles after TGF-β treatment, including lower levels of sialylated Tn antigen and neoexpression of globosides. Furthermore, the expression of transcription factor sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility group box 4 was upregulated upon TGF-β stimulation, and its depletion blocked TGF-β-induced N-glycomic changes. Thus, TGF-β-induced N-glycosylation changes can occur in a sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility group box 4–dependent and SMAD4-independent manner in the pancreatic PaTu-S cancer cell line.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal tumors in the world. It is characterized by a poor prognosis and a failure to respond to therapy (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 7-34Google Scholar). Genomic analysis of PDAC revealed that the most frequent genetic alterations include the activation of oncogene KRAS and inactivation of the tumor suppressors tumor protein p53 (TP53), SMA-related and MAD-related protein 4 (SMAD4), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (2Vincent A.

The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and immune evasion, contributing to various diseases, including cancer (18Colak S.

Transforming growth factor-β signaling in immunity and cancer.Immunity. 2019; 50: 924-940Google Scholar). TGF-β is a secreted cytokine for which cellular responses are initiated by binding to specific cell surface TGF-β type I and type II receptors, that is, TβRI and TβRII. Upon TGF-β interaction with TβRII, TβRI is recruited, and a heteromeric complex is formed (20Massague J. How cells read TGF-β signals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar, 21Massague J. TGFβ signalling in context.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 616-630Google Scholar). Thereafter, the TβRII kinase phosphorylates the serine and threonine residues of TβRI, and thereby the extracellular signal is transduced across the plasma membrane (22Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. TGF-β signalling from cell membrane to nucleus through SMAD proteins.Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar). Subsequently, intracellular signaling by TβRI proceeds via the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, that is, SMAD2 and SMAD3. Then, phosphorylated SMAD2/3 can form heteromeric complexes with the common SMAD mediator, that is, SMAD4, which translocates into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes (23Budi E.H. Duan D. Derynck R. Transforming growth factor-β receptors and smads: Regulatory complexity and functional versatility.Trends Cell Biol. 2017; 27: 658-672Google Scholar). SMAD4 is a critical mediator of TGF-β-induced growth arrest (24Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Partnership between DPC4 and SMAD proteins in TGF-β signalling pathways.Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar, 25Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Receptor-associated Mad homologues synergize as effectors of the TGF-β response.Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar) and apoptosis (26Schuster N. Krieglstein K. Mechanisms of TGF-β-mediated apoptosis.Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 1-14Google Scholar), which results in its role as a tumor suppressor at the early stages of cancer progression. However, the tumor-suppressive action of TGF-β–SMAD4 signaling is lost in nearly half of PDACs because of the inactivation of SMAD4 (27Dardare J. Witz A. Merlin J.L. Gilson P. Harle A. SMAD4 and the TGFβ pathway in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 3534Google Scholar). The SMAD4 gene deletion, frameshift mutation, or single point mutation can lead to the deficiency of functional SMAD4 protein, which further prevents or disrupts transduction of the canonical TGF-β–SMAD4 signaling pathway. Phosphorylated TGF-β receptors can activate SMAD2/3-dependent and SMAD4-independent pathways; in that case, receptor-regulated SMADs can make complexes with sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility group box 4 (SOX4) or thyroid transcription factor-1 (also known as NKX2-1), which compete with SMAD4 for interaction with SMAD3 (28Vervoort S.J.

The SMAD-dependent and non-SMAD signaling pathways are involved in multiple cellular processes, including TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (37Yamashita M. Fatyol K. Jin C. Wang X. Liu Z. Zhang Y.E. TRAF6 mediates Smad-independent activation of JNK and p38 by TGF-β.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 918-924Google Scholar, 38Zhang L. Zhou F. Garcia de Vinuesa A. de Kruijf E.M.

Cell. 2013; 51: 559-572Google Scholar). EMT is a crucial step toward cell metastasis, during which the epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell–cell contacts and gain mesenchymal abilities such as enhanced migratory and invasive abilities (39Derynck R. Weinberg R.A. EMT and cancer: More than meets the eye.Dev. Cell. 2019; 49: 313-316Google Scholar). EMT can be associated with morphological or phenotypic changes accompanied by a switch in the expression of EMT marker proteins, a loss of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, claudin, and an increase of mesenchymal markers, including N-cadherin, vimentin (VIM), SNAIL, and SLUG (40Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Mechanisms of TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Clin. Med. 2016; 5: 63Google Scholar, 41Katsuno Y. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2013; 25: 76-84Google Scholar). EMT is a dynamic and reversible process, and cells can undergo a complete EMT or, more commonly, take on a hybrid E/M status named “partial EMT”. The new term epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity is used to describe the cells undergoing intermediate E/M phenotypic states (42Yang J. Antin P. Berx G. Blanpain C. Brabletz T. Bronner M. Campbell K. Cano A. Casanova J. Christofori G. Dedhar S. Derynck R. Ford H.L. Fuxe J. Garcia de Herreros A. et al.Guidelines and definitions for research on epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 341-352Google Scholar). Both complete EMT and partial EMT exist in PDACs, and the latter is speculated to be involved in collective cell migration and result in an enhanced metastasis rate through the formation of clusters of circulating tumor cells (43Saxena K. Jolly M.K. Balamurugan K. Hypoxia, partial EMT and collective migration: Emerging culprits in metastasis.Transl. Oncol. 2020; 13: 100845Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided several mechanistic explanations for the TGF-β signaling in PDACs; for example, the restoration of SMAD4 in PDAC cells leads to a TGF-β-induced lethal EMT by triggering cell apoptosis via SOX4, indicating that EMT switches SOX4 function from protumorigenic to proapoptotic (30David C.J. Huang Y.H. Chen M. Su J. Zou Y. Bardeesy N. Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Massague J. TGF-β tumor suppression through a lethal EMT.Cell. 2016; 164: 1015-1030Google Scholar). Glycosylation of cellular proteins and lipids is a common post-translational modification in cells, which affects many cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion (44Pinho S.S. Reis C.A. Glycosylation in cancer: Mechanisms and clinical implications.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 540-555Google Scholar, 45Munkley J. The glycosylation landscape of pancreatic cancer.Oncol. Lett. 2019; 17: 2569-2575Google Scholar). Dysregulated glycosylation is associated with TGF-β signaling and TGF-β-induced EMT in various cancers (46Zhang J. Ten Dijke P. Wuhrer M. Zhang T. Role of glycosylation in TGF-β signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer.Protein Cell. 2021; 12: 89-106Google Scholar) by affecting the secretion, bioavailability of TGF-β (47Yang Y. Dignam J.D. Gentry L.E. Role of carbohydrate structures in the binding of β1-latency-associated peptide to ligands.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11923-11932Google Scholar), TβRII localization in cells, and interaction with TGF-β (48Kim Y.W.

Moreover, specific glycan structures and glycogenes involved in the biosynthesis of N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipid (GSL)-linked glycans always increase or decrease during TGF-β-induced EMT in various cancers (49Li X. Wang X. Tan Z. Chen S. Guan F. Role of glycans in cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Front. Oncol. 2016; 6: 33Google Scholar), such as lung cancer (50Huang C. Huang M. Chen W.

Chem. 2012; 287: 16563-16574Google Scholar). During PDAC progression, aberrant glycosylation is highly correlated with several pathological processes (4Pan S. Brentnall T.A. Chen R. Proteome alterations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Cancer Lett. 2020; 469: 429-436Google Scholar, 52Wang M. Zhu J. Lubman D.M. Gao C. Aberrant glycosylation and cancer biomarker discovery: A promising and thorny journey.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2019; 57: 407-416Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated a number of glycosylation changes, including increased fucosylation and sialylation in pancreatic cancer progression in PDACs (53Yue T. Goldstein I.J. Hollingsworth M.A. Kaul K. Brand R.E. Haab B.B. The prevalence and nature of glycan alterations on specific proteins in pancreatic cancer patients revealed using antibody-lectin sandwich arrays.Mol.

The glycosylation changes of proteins, such as mucin 5AC, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP3), and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP), are involved in various signaling pathways, including TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor, and NF-κB pathways (55Pan S.

In addition, the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3), one of the enzymes that catalyze the initial step in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, can promote the growth of pancreatic cells (57Taniuchi K.

Hollingsworth M.A. Overexpression of GalNAc-transferase GalNAc-T3 promotes pancreatic cancer cell growth.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 4843-4854Google Scholar). Moreover, some aberrations in glycosylation strongly influence the properties of tumor-associated extracellular matrix and contribute to increased cell migration and invasion (58Janik M.E. Litynska A. Vereecken P. Cell migration-the role of integrin glycosylation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 545-555Google Scholar, 59Leeming D.J. Bay-Jensen A.C. Vassiliadis E. Larsen M.R.

Proteome Res. 2014; 13: 1873-1884Google Scholar). A better understanding of the aberrant glycosylation of PDAC induced by TGF-β may aid the identification of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of TGF-β signaling in SMAD4-deficient PDAC cells and their relation to glycosylation are not well understood. In this study, the PaTu-8988S (PaTu-S) cell line, a human epithelial-like PDAC cell line exhibiting KRAS activation and inactivation of SMAD4 and CDKN2A, was employed to investigate TGF-β responses and resulting glycosylation changes. Upon TGF-β treatment, PaTu-S cells were first analyzed for any effects on gene expression, morphological changes, loss of epithelial traits, and gain of mesenchymal markers. Next, by combining transcriptomic analysis of glycosylation-associated genes with mass spectrometry glycomics, we systematically assessed the TGF-β-induced alterations in the three major classes of cell surface glycans of PaTu-S, namely, N-glycans, O-glycans, and GSL-linked glycans. Furthermore, we investigated the critical role of SOX4 in TGF-β signaling and TGF-β-induced glycosylation in PaTu-S cells. This provides a stepping-stone for further studies on how glycosylation alterations contribute to TGF-β-mediated tumorigenesis of PDAC. To investigate whether the PaTu-S cell line, which lacks SMAD4, is responsive to TGF-β treatment (Fig. S1A), we performed Western blot analysis of phosphorylated SMAD2 levels of PaTu-S cells without and with TGF-β challenge. In PaTu-S cells, SMAD2 phosphorylation was significantly upregulated upon TGF-β stimulation for 1 h, which was blocked by treatment with TβRI kinase inhibitor SB431542 (Fig. 1A). The expression of TGF-β target genes, including cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2) (66Meyer C. Godoy P. Bachmann A. Liu Y. Barzan D. Ilkavets I. Maier P. Herskind C. Hengstler J.G.

These genes can be induced by TGF-β–SMAD and non-SMAD pathways and in cells in which SMAD4 was inactivated (72Levy L. Hill C.S.

Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8108-8125Google Scholar). In response to TGF-β stimulation for 2 days, the PaTu-S cells showed an upregulation in the expression of both the epithelial marker gene cadherin 1 (CDH1, encoding the protein E-cadherin) and the mesenchymal marker genes CDH2 (encoding the protein N-cadherin), SNAIL family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2, encoding the protein SLUG), and VIM (encoding the protein VIM) (Fig. 1C). At the protein level, the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was increased after TGF-β stimulation, whereas E-cadherin and SLUG expression levels were not significantly affected (Fig. 1D). In addition, no morphological changes of PaTu-S cells were observed after 2 days of TGF-β treatment (Fig. S1B) or even longer treatment times (data not shown). The response of PaTu-S cells to TGF-β treatment was further analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of E-cadherin and filamentous (F)-actin. We observed that TGF-β induced an increase in the formation of lamellipodia and broadened and increased flat membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cells (Fig. S1C). However, in response to TGF-β, no significant changes in E-cadherin expression and localization were observed. As an increase of lamellipodia formation has been linked to an increase in cell migration (73Krause M. Gautreau A.

https://openalex.org/W4211114108,"Infection by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Many current acellular pertussis vaccines include the antigen pertactin, which has presumptive adhesive and immunomodulatory activities, but is rapidly lost from clinical isolates after the introduction of these vaccines. To better understand the contributions of pertactin antibodies to protection and pertactin's role in pathogenesis, we isolated and characterized recombinant antibodies binding four distinct epitopes on pertactin. We demonstrate that four of these antibodies bind epitopes that are conserved across all three classical Bordetella strains, and competition assays further showed that antibodies binding these epitopes are also elicited by B. pertussis infection of baboons. Surprisingly, we found that representative antibodies binding each epitope protected mice against experimental B. pertussis infection. A cocktail of antibodies from each epitope group protected mice against a subsequent lethal dose of B. pertussis and greatly reduced lung colonization levels after sublethal challenge. Each antibody reduced B. pertussis lung colonization levels up to 100-fold when administered individually, which was significantly reduced when antibody effector functions were impaired, with no antibody mediating antibody-dependent complement-induced lysis. These data suggest that antibodies binding multiple pertactin epitopes protect primarily by the same bactericidal mechanism, which overshadows contributions from blockade of other pertactin functions. These antibodies expand the available tools to further dissect pertactin's role in infection and understand the impact of antipertactin antibodies on bacterial fitness."

A top priority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 adults who were managed in an outpatient setting compared to patients who required hospitalization at US academic centers.Using the Vizient clinical database, Discharge records of adults with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021 were reviewed. Outcome measures included demographics, characteristics, rate of hospitalization, and mortality, and data were analyzed based on inpatient versus outpatient management.Among COVID-19 adults, 1,360,078 patients were managed in an outpatient setting while 545,635 patients required hospitalization. Compared to hospitalized COVID-19 adults, COVID-19 adults who were managed in an outpatient setting were more likely to be female (56.1% vs 47.5%, p <0.001), white (57.7% vs 54.8%, p <0.001), within younger age group of 18-50 years (p<0.001) and have lower rate of comorbidities. Mortality was significantly lower in outpatient group compared to hospitalized group (0.2% vs 12.2%, respectively, p <0.01%). For outpatient group, mortality increased with increasing age group: 0.02% (52 of 295,112) for patients 18-30 years and 1.2% (1,373 of 117,866) for patients >75 years. The rate of hospitalization was lowest for age group 18-30 years at 10.6% (35,607 of 330,719) and highest for age group >75 years at 56.1% (150,381 of 268,247).This analysis of US academic centers showed that 28.6% of COVID-19 adults who sought care at one of the hospitals reporting data to the Vizient clinical database required in-patient treatment. The rate of hospitalization in our study was lowest for the youngest age group of 18-30 years and highest for age group >75 years. Beside older age, other factors associated with outpatient management included female gender, white race, and having commercial insurance."

However, the precise mechanisms coordinating cell fate decisions and cell cycle regulation remain to be fully explored. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we show that in ESCs, deficiency of components of the cell cycle regulatory MuvB complex Lin54 or Lin52, but not Lin9 or Lin37, triggers G2/M arrest, loss of pluripotency, and spontaneous differentiation. Further dissection of these phenotypes demonstrated that this cell cycle arrest is accompanied by the gradual activation of mesoendodermal lineage-specifying genes. Strikingly, the abnormalities observed in Lin54-null ESCs were partially but significantly rescued by ectopic coexpression of genes encoding G2/M proteins Cyclin B1 and Cdk1.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess an indefinite proliferative and self-renewal potential, while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a wide array of cell types found in the body. It has been demonstrated that several transcription factors, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog along with other genetic and epigenetic factors, form the core of a transcription factor network that maintain ESC identity while simultaneously repressing the expression of genes that promote differentiation (1Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A.

The mammalian core MuvB complex, consisting of five subunits Lin9, Lin37, Lin52, Lin54, and Rbbp4, associates with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB)-related pocket proteins, p107 and p130, and with the transcription factor heterodimer, E2F4-DP1, to form DREAM (Drosophila RBF, dE2F2 and dMyb-interacting proteins), which globally represses cell cycle genes in G0/G1, maintaining the cell in a quiescent state (7Litovchick L.

When cells enter the cell cycle, the MuvB core complex is released from the p130-E2F4-DP1-containing DREAM complex and independently partners with B-Myb transcription factor to form Myb-MuvB (MMB) complex that activates expression of a subset of late cell cycle genes required for progression through mitosis and cytokinesis (7Litovchick L.

The importance of MMB in transcriptional activation of mitotic genes is emphasized by the observation that disruption of the MMB complex causes mitotic defects and G2/M arrest (14Osterloh L. von Eyss B.

Among the core MuvB complex components, Lin54 is the only sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. It possesses dual tandem cysteine-rich (CXC) domains (with the consensus sequence CXCX4CX3YCXCX6CX3CXCX2C) separated by a conserved hinge domain. The CXC domains of Lin54 direct MuvB binding to the cell cycle genes homology region (CHR) of target genes (16Schmit F. Cremer S. Gaubatz S.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12301Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in our understanding of cell cycle progression, the precise role of the cell cycle machinery in maintaining ESC self-renewal and pluripotency remains largely uncharacterized. Here we examined the role of MuvB core complex members in the cell cycle and the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency in ESCs. Our results show that ablation of Lin54 or Lin52, but not Lin9 or Lin37, resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition accompanied by rapid exit of undifferentiated state in ESCs and the initiation of differentiation toward the mesoendoderm lineages. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MuvB complex-mediated activation of Cyclin B1/Cdk1, key components in the control of cell cycle progression from G2 to M phase, exerts control over cell fate decisions and pluripotency. To systematically assess the role for MuvB core family in ESCs, we first determined the expression status of MuvB genes in ESCs. Each MuvB core member was expressed in ESCs assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. S1A). To circumvent the potential lethality associated with complete loss of MuvB members in ESCs, we generated ESCs with conditional knockout of the MuvB genes, in which the critical exons of both alleles were flanked by parallel loxP sites, based on Cre-loxP system (Figs. 1A and S1–S4). As studies in Rbbp4 knockout ESCs have been reported elsewhere (19Huang Y. Su T. Wang C. Dong L. Liu S. Zhu Y. Hao K. Xia Y. Jiang Q. Qin J. Rbbp4 suppresses premature differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Stem Cell Rep. 2021; 16: 566-581Google Scholar), we decided to further examine the potential role of the remaining members of MuvB complex in maintaining ESC identity in this study. In these conditional floxed ESC lines (Lin54F/F, Lin52F/F, Lin9F/F, and Lin37F/F), Cre-mediated ablation of the floxed genes was substantially achieved by 48 h after transfection with a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase, with their proteins being essentially absent by 72 h after transfection, as evident in Western blot (Figs. 1B, S2D, S3D and S4D). Therefore, unless otherwise stated, the cells were used for the experiments after 72 h of transfection throughout this study. These mutant cells were first monitored for their ability to form colonies from single cells after seeding on mitotically inactivated murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layer (Fig. 1C). ESCs harboring the floxed alleles showed normal protein levels and formed tightly packed domed colonies that were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type controls (Figs. 1, B and C, S2D, S3D and S4D). However, in contrast to their floxed cells, ablation of Lin54 (Lin54Δ/Δ) or Lin52 (Lin52Δ/Δ) resulted in flat and spreading colonies with irregular edges (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the observed growth defects coincided with exit from pluripotency and spontaneous differentiation, we performed alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining (Fig. 1D). The floxed as well as wild-type ESC colonies were stained uniform and bright, while Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ colonies appeared very weak or negative, suggesting loss of self-renewal ability and spontaneous differentiation (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the AP staining results, gene expression of pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog was enormously reduced upon loss of Lin54 or Lin52 gene expression (Fig. 1, E and F). Importantly, lentivirus-mediated reintroduction of FLAG-tagged full-length Lin54 or Lin52 fully restored all these defective phenotypes observed in these mutants (Fig. 1, C–F). Unexpectedly, ESCs deficient for either Lin9 or Lin37 were viable and maintained a typical undifferentiated state as characterized by tightly packed morphology (Fig. 1C), AP staining (Fig. 1D), high levels of the core pluripotency-associated transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog even after long-term culture (Figs. S3E and S4E). Pluripotency of Lin9Δ/Δ or Lin37Δ/Δ lines was confirmed by teratoma formation assay, which is often considered as the most stringent standard of pluripotency for ESCs. After 4 to 6 weeks of subcutaneous injection of Lin9Δ/Δ or Lin37Δ/Δ ESCs into immunodeficient mice, teratomas containing tissue or structures derived from all three embryonic germ layers were observed, indicating that these cells retained pluripotency (Fig. S5). Together, these results suggest that inactivation of MuvB core components Lin54 and Lin52 is sufficient to cause loss of self-renewal and pluripotency of ESCs. The severe growth defects of Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs might be due to cell cycle redistribution and/or an increase in apoptosis. To exploit these possibilities, we compared cell cycle profile and survival in Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs and their corresponding controls. Cell-cycle analysis indicated that Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs had a remarkably extended G2/M phase and a shortened S phase (Fig. 2A). The alteration of cell cycle profile in Lin54-and Lin52-deficient cells was almost completely rescued by ectopic expression of Lin54 and Lin52, respectively. In contrast, the loss of either Lin9 or Lin37 had no effect on cell cycle progression. Furthermore, Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs exhibited the same apoptotic rates as their floxed cells, as determined by annexin V staining (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the impaired growth of Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ cells was due to changed cell cycle progression. To get a further understanding of MuvB genes in mediating ESC self-renewal, we conducted a competition assay in which MuvB genes-deleted cells (GFP+) were mixed with their parental floxed ESCs (GFP−) at an 8:2 ratio, and the percentage of GFP(+) cells was determined over time by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 2C). Lin54Δ/Δ or Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs got rapidly eliminated, whereas cell survival of Lin9Δ/Δ or Lin37Δ/Δ ESCs was unaffected (Fig. 2D). Additionally, inactivation of Lin54 or Lin52 also almost abrogated secondary ESC colony formation (Fig. 2E). Together, these results indicate that inactivation of MuvB core components Lin54 and Lin52 is sufficient to trigger G2/M cell cycle arrest and loss of self-renewal of ESCs. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypic alterations associated with MuvB inactivation, we performed RNA-seq analysis in ESCs deficient in the MuvB components (Tables S1–S4). Complete loss of Lin54 and Lin52 in ESCs resulted in 3529 (1972 up and 1557 down) and 3300 (1815 up and 1485 down) differentially expressed genes, respectively, compared with their corresponding controls. In contrast, only a total of 695 (441 up and 254 down) and 506 (248 up and 258 down) genes were deregulated in Lin9 and Lin37 single mutants, respectively, further supporting a minor role of Lin9 and Lin37 in maintaining ESC identity (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, a large number of the genes deregulated in Lin54Δ/Δ were also observed in ESCs deficient for Lin52 and vice versa, consistent with the similar phenotypes of the Lin54 and Lin52 null mutants (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, a substantial number of the genes deregulated in Lin9Δ/Δ and Lin37Δ/Δ cells were also observed in ESCs deficient for Lin54 or Lin52, consistent with the notion that they exist as components of the same complex. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that among genes upregulated in Lin54Δ/Δ and Lin52Δ/Δ ESCs were genes primarily linked to epithelial cell differentiation, cell fate commitment, negative regulation of cell proliferation, and embryonic morphogenesis (Fig. 3E). In contrast, processes related to regulation of cell division, mesodermal cell fate commitment, and cell–cell adhesion were overrepresented among the genes downregulated in Lin54Δ/Δ and Lin52Δ/Δ cells (Fig. 3F). Importantly, among the genes downregulated in Lin54Δ/Δ and Lin52Δ/Δ cells, our analysis revealed the pluripotency genes, including Nanog, Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Nr5a2, and Dppa5a (Fig. 4, A and B), which have been demonstrated to have critical roles in maintaining pluripotency in ESCs. Additionally, RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that loss of Lin54 or Lin52 led to the upregulation of mesoendoderm markers (Gata6, Gata4, Tbx2, Sox17, Foxa2, Msx2, and Hand1) and trophectoderm markers (Ets2, Gata3, and Krt18, Cdx2, and Krt8), whereas ectoderm markers (Sox11, Pax6, Neurod1, Olig1, and Olig2) were instead either unchanged or slightly reduced (Fig. 4, A and B). By performing reverse transcription followed by qPCR (RT-qPCR), we confirmed the differential expression of selected genes observed by RNA-seq analysis and observed that Lin54Δ/Δ ESCs displayed downregulation and upregulation in expression of core pluripotency factors and key mesoendodermal lineage identity genes, respectively (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the cell cycle analysis (Fig. 2A), we found a substantial number of genes involved in cell cycle control to be differentially expressed in both Lin54Δ/Δ and Lin52Δ/Δ cells. These include Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and Cdk1, crucial regulators of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 4, B and C). Together, these results suggest that Lin54 and Lin52 normally function to maintain ESCs in an undifferentiated state by repressing differentiation toward mesoendoderm lineages. To rigorously evaluate the importance of transcriptional mediators responsible for loss of pluripotency and lineage commitment upon Lin54 or Lin52 deficiency, we assessed the temporal mRNA expression changes of pluripotency genes as well as three germ layer-specific genes in Lin54F/F or Lin52F/F ESCs after transfection with Cre recombinase plasmid. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the mRNA levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 were significantly reduced within 3 days after Cre transfection and declined steadily thereafter to baseline levels on day 7 (Fig. 5A). The loss of expression of key pluripotency markers was accompanied by the aberrant activation of lineage specific genes. Markers for mesoendoderm (Gata4, Gata6, Foxa2, Hand1, Msx2, and Flk1) and trophectoderm (Cdx2) were upregulated. These findings were corroborated by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, which demonstrated that loss of either Lin54 or Lin52 led to precocious differentiation of ESCs and activation of a subset of lineage-specific genes (Figs. 5B and S6). In Lin54F/F and Lin52F/F ESCs, the expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) was high, whereas positivity for different lineage-associated markers (Foxa2, Gata6, and Cdx2) was rarely observed, indicating the undifferentiated state of the cells. After transient transfection of plasmid DNA expressing Cre, the expression of these lineage-associated markers gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, which was accompanied by the loss of expression of pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. In accordance with the Western blot results (Figs. S3E and S4E), our IF analysis also supports the idea that Lin9Δ/Δ and Lin37Δ/Δ cells retained their high expression of pluripotency factors without displaying any obvious differentiation toward three germ layer lineages (Fig. S6). As mentioned above, all of the cellular phenotypes observed in Lin54Δ/Δ cells were fully rescued by reexpression of wild-type full-length Lin54 (Fig. 1, C–F), thus providing us with an excellent opportunity to study Lin54 structure and function in ESCs. Lin54 contains two tandem CXC domains, each consisting of nine cysteines that enable its DNA-binding function (16Schmit F. Cremer S. Gaubatz S.

LIN54 harboring a mutation in CHC domain is localized to the cytoplasm and inhibits cell cycle progression.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 3227-3236Google Scholar), separated by a short spacer called hinge. Next, we performed a structure–function analysis to map the regions within the Lin54 protein that are responsible for its chromatin tethering activity. The series of FLAG-tagged Lin54 deletion mutants shown in Figure 6A was constructed and introduced into Lin54F/F ESCs (Fig. 6B). Of note, all the mutants were overall expressed at similar levels as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 6C). To determine whether these mutants could keep the DNA-binding activities and to examine the capacity of these mutants to maintain the expression of cell cycle target genes in the absence of endogenous Lin54, the cells were transiently transfected with Cre recombinase and analyzed 12 days later. ChIP-qPCR analyses showed that the C-terminally deleted protein and the mutants with deletion of CXC domains (including the spacer connecting the two CXC domains) did not bind to the promoter of Cyclin B1 (Fig. 6D). Consistent with their failure to tightly associate with chromatin in ESCs, these mutants lost completely the ability to rescue target gene expression (Fig. 6E). In contrast, the N terminus of Lin54 was dispensable for DNA binding and thus retained these gene expressions as effectively as the wild-type. To gain insight into the capacity of these mutants to restore the self-renewal defect of Lin54-deficient ESCs, we tested their ability to form colonies after seeding single-cell suspensions onto inactivated MEF feeder layers. As shown in Figure 6F, a mutant lacking the first 519 amino acids completely rescued wild-type levels of self-renewal growth in ESCs, while Lin54 mutants in which the CXC domains or C-terminal regions are deleted abolished their ability to rescue the colony growth defect. Next, to examine whether the conserved cysteines in the two CXC domains were essential for binding to the Cyclin B1 promoter, the two conserved cysteine residues in the CXC domains (C525 and C613) were mutated to alanines (Fig. S7) (16Schmit F. Cremer S. Gaubatz S. LIN54 is an essential core subunit of the DREAM/LINC complex that binds to the cdc2 promoter in a sequence-specific manner.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5703-5716Google Scholar, 20Matsuo T. Kuramoto H. Kumazaki T. Mitsui Y. Takahashi T. LIN54 harboring a mutation in CHC domain is localized to the cytoplasm and inhibits cell cycle progression.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 3227-3236Google Scholar). We found that mutation of C525 and C613 abolished the binding of Lin54 to the Cyclin B1 promoter. Consistently, substitution of these two conserved residues also abolished the ability of Lin54 to rescue defects associated with Lin54 deficiency in ESCs (Fig. S7). Overall, these results suggest that both C-terminal and CXC domains are essential for the targeting of Lin54 to chromatin and show that these regions confer upon Lin54 the ability to maintain the identity of ESC. Because the inactivation of Lin54 in ESCs was accompanied by a coincidental decline in the mRNA and protein levels of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Figs. 1E and 5, A and B and Table S1), we assessed whether Lin54 contributed to the maintenance of ESC property via regulation of these core pluripotency transcription factors. The Lin54-null rescue system utilized Lin54F/F ESCs, in which the floxed alleles were excised upon Cre-recombinase. Lentivirus-mediated expression of Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog did not restore the defects observed in Lin54Δ/Δ ESCs (Fig. 7, A–D), suggesting that keeping the requisite levels of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog might not be responsible for Lin54-mediated ESC maintenance. Our above-noted data indicate that inactivation of Lin54 resulted in G2/M arrest and in transcriptional inhibition of G2/M genes. One prediction from these observations is that Lin54 preserves the undifferentiated state of ESCs through regulation of these G2/M genes. To test this possibility, we attempted to rescue Lin54Δ/Δ ESCs by introducing the transgenes of Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, or Cdk1. Introducing Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, or Cdk1 did not restore the self-renewal defect observed in Lin54Δ/Δ ESCs. In contrast, ectopic expression of Cdk1 together with Cyclin B1, but not Cyclin B2, partially rescued the proliferation defect of Lin54-deficient ESCs (Fig. 7, A–C), indicating that Lin54 controls ESC self-renewal through a Cyclin B1/Cdk1-dependent mechanism. The rescued cells were able to form viable colonies on feeder cells and could be continuously propagated (for at least 30 passages) without any significant change in colony morphology. Although these colonies were much smaller than usual, they maintained an undifferentiated state as characterized by their morphology, staining for AP, expression of the pluripotency markers, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Fig. 7, B–F). Consistent with these results, these rescued cells formed teratoma when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In histologic analysis, Cyclin B1/Cdk1 teratomas featured a paucity of mature elements (Fig. 7G). Yet examples of differentiation into tissues from all three germ layers could be found. Immunohistochemistry of wild-type ESC-derived teratomas with antibody specific to α-smooth muscle actin (SMA; mesoderm marker), TROMA1 (endoderm), and GFAP (ectoderm) revealed large numbers of positive cells, whereas teratomas derived from Cyclin B1/Cdk1 ESC had decreases in all three germ layer derivatives (Fig. 7H). Therefore, our data suggest a critical role for Lin54 in the transcriptional regulation of G2/M genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs. The nature of the relationship between the cell cycle machinery and pluripotency of ESCs has remained largely elusive, although it has been proposed that pluripotency and self-renewal are intimately linked to cell cycle control in ESCs (4Coronado D.

Mutations in GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase are known to cause lysosomal storage disorders such as mucolipidoses. However, the molecular mechanism of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity remains unclear. Mammalian GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferases are α2β2γ2 hexamers in which the core catalytic α- and β-subunits are derived from the GNPTAB (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase subunits alpha and beta) gene. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Drosophila melanogaster GNPTAB homolog, DmGNPTAB. We identified four conserved regions located far apart in the sequence that fold into the catalytic domain, which exhibits structural similarity to that of the UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Comparison with UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase also revealed a putative donor substrate-binding site, and the functional requirements of critical residues in human GNPTAB were validated using GNPTAB-knockout cells. Finally, we show that DmGNPTAB forms a homodimer that is evolutionarily conserved and that perturbing the dimer interface undermines the maturation and activity of human GNPTAB. These results provide important insights into GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase function and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4210976386,"Early studies revealed that chicken embryos incubated with a rare analog of l-proline, 4-oxo-l-proline, showed increased levels of the metabolite 4-hydroxy-l-proline. In 1962, 4-oxo-l-proline reductase, an enzyme responsible for the reduction of 4-oxo-l-proline, was partially purified from rabbit kidneys and characterized biochemically. However, only recently was the molecular identity of this enzyme solved. Here, we report the purification from rat kidneys, identification, and biochemical characterization of 4-oxo-l-proline reductase. Following mass spectrometry analysis of the purified protein preparation, the previously annotated mammalian cytosolic type 2 (R)-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH2) emerged as the only candidate for the reductase. We subsequently expressed rat and human BDH2 in Escherichia coli, then purified it, and showed that it catalyzed the reversible reduction of 4-oxo-l-proline to cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline via chromatographic and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Specificity studies with an array of compounds carried out on both enzymes showed that 4-oxo-l-proline was the best substrate, and the human enzyme acted with 12,500-fold higher catalytic efficiency on 4-oxo-l-proline than on (R)-β-hydroxybutyrate. In addition, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells efficiently metabolized 4-oxo-l-proline to cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline, whereas HEK293T BDH2 KO cells were incapable of producing cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline. Both WT and KO HEK293T cells also produced trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline in the presence of 4-oxo-l-proline, suggesting that the latter compound might interfere with the trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline breakdown in human cells. We conclude that BDH2 is a mammalian 4-oxo-l-proline reductase that converts 4-oxo-l-proline to cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline and not to trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline, as originally thought.

Lipidomic analysis revealed that the major change in lipid level in Chkb+/− and Chkb−/− hearts was an increase in the arrhythmogenic lipid acylcarnitine. An increase in acylcarnitine level is also associated with a defect in the ability of mitochondria to use fatty acids for energy and we observed that mitochondria from Chkb−/− hearts had abnormal cristae and inefficient electron transport chain activity.

Human cell membranes separate and protect cells from their external environment, transmit cellular signals, establish an electrochemical gradient via the transport of ions, and generate action potential in neurons and muscle cells (1Molnar P. Hickman J.J. Modeling of action potential generation in NG108-15 cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1183: 253-261Google Scholar). The phospholipid bilayer is the fundamental structure of membranes and interacts with peripheral and integral membrane proteins to regulate critical biological processes (2Whited A.M. Johs A. The interactions of peripheral membrane proteins with biological membranes.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2015; 192: 51-59Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant membrane phospholipid constituting between 30% and 60% of the phospholipid mass of eukaryotic cell membranes (3Vance J.E. Phospholipid synthesis and transport in mammalian cells.Traffic. 2015; 16: 1-18Google Scholar). The first enzymatic step in the synthesis of PC is the phosphorylation of choline by choline kinases to produce phosphocholine. In humans and mice, two separate genes, CHKA and CHKB, encoding choline kinase alpha (CHKA) and choline kinase beta (CHKB), respectively, catalyze this reaction. In humans and mice autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in CHKB (Chkb in mouse) cause congenital muscular dystrophy with megaconial myopathy (OMIM: 602541) (4Sher R.B. Aoyama C.

Clinical characteristics of CHKB-associated muscular dystrophy include delayed motor development, neonatal hypotonia, and intellectual disability without brain malformation.

How a cardiac phenotype is manifested owing to decreased CHKB level is not known. Here we report that both homozygous and heterozygous Chkb mice have cardiomyopathy, decreased cardiac functional capacity, and increased susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. Alteration of cardiac lipid metabolism in Chkb+/− and Chkb−/− mice results in accumulation of the arrhythmogenic intermediary fatty acid metabolite acyl carnitine (AcCa). Furthermore, Chkb+/− and Chkb−/− mice displayed reduced expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and its receptor (NPRA), along with specific defects in cellular signaling pathways known to enable heart function. Our data from Chkb-deficient mice provide mechanistic and observational insights into how a defect in PC synthesis can result in cardiac defects and may help explain similar phenotypes observed in CHKB-deficient patients. Chkb encodes choline kinase β, the first enzymatic step in the synthesis of PC. A second choline kinase isoform, Chka, encoded by a separate gene, is present in mouse (and human) tissues. We investigated the protein expression pattern of these two choline kinase isoforms in cardiac muscle from Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice. Western blot analysis revealed that, as expected, Chkb protein expression is significantly reduced in Chkb heterozygous mice and is completely absent in homozygous knockout mice. Chka is expressed at a similar level in cardiac tissue from wildtype, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice; no compensatory upregulation of Chka protein was observed in mice lacking the Chkb isoform (Fig. 1, A–C). The data are consistent with previous work that Chkb deficiency does not alter Chka mRNA expression in heart (4Sher R.B. Aoyama C. Huebsch K.A. Ji S. Kerner J. Yang Y. Frankel W.N. Hoppel C.L. Wood P.A. Vance D.E. Cox G.A. A rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy caused by a defect in choline kinase beta, the first enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4938-4948Google Scholar). Echocardiography was used to assess systolic and diastolic function in hearts from 5-month-old Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice (Fig. 2 and Table 1). After cardiac function assessment, mouse body weight was determined and hearts were surgically removed from anaesthetized mice and heart weight was measured. Chkb−/− mice weighed 40% less than Chkb+/+ or Chkb+/− mice (Fig. 2A), whereas heart weight was similar among the three different genotypes. Heart weight to body weight ratio, an index of hypertrophy, was significantly increased in Chkb−/− mice compared with the Chkb+/+ and Chkb+/− mice (Fig. 2, B and C).Table 1Cardiac phenotypes of 5-month-old mice deficient in ChkbParameterChkb+/+ (n =5)Chkb+/− (n = 9)Chkb−/− (n = 3)SignificantGender (male; female)(2; 3)(3; 6)(1; 2)-Heart rate (bpm)504.88 ± 44.90515.1 ± 60.0551.38 ± 47.80NSM-Mode LVID (sys) (mm)2.56 ± 0.302.52 ± 0.481.92 ± 0.27NS LVID(d) (mm)3.78 ± 0.223.85 ± 0.473.08 ± 0.20aSignificant from WT.,bSignificant from HET.p < 0.05 LVPW(sys) (mm)1.14 ± 0.151.20 ± 0.261.11 ± 0.05NS LVPW(d) (mm)0.87 ± 0.100.88 ± 0.160.87 ± 0.09NS LV Vol(sys) (μl)24.14 ± 6.8424.14 ± 10.8911.73 ± 4.35 LV Vol(d) (μl)61.44 ± 8.8265.28 ± 18.4837.61 ± 5.85aSignificant from WT.p < 0.05 Calculated stroke volume (μl)37.3 ± 4.2841.14 ± 8.7525.88 ± 2.38aSignificant from WT.p < 0.05 EF%61.16 ± 6.9264.51 ± 7.4969.41 ± 6.73NS FS%32.4 ± 4.934.91 ± 5.3538.05 ± 5.12NS Calculated cardiac output (ml)18.87 ± 3.0920.87 ± 3.5513.97 ± 0.92aSignificant from WT.p < 0.05 LV mass AW (mg)115.58 ± 16.98113.66 ± 14.8475.07 ± 13.15aSignificant from WT.,bSignificant from HET.p < 0.01 LV mass AW (corrected) (mg)92.47 ± 13.5990.93 ± 11.8760.06 ± 10.52aSignificant from WT.,bSignificant from HET.p < 0.01 LVAW(sys) (mm)1.29 ± 0.181.27 ± 0.121.09 ± 0.04NS LVAW(d) (mm)0.82 ± 0.140.76 ± 0.100.71 ± 0.02NSPulse-wave Doppler echocardiography MV E (m/s)546.05 ± 72.17607.41 ± 77.31543.06 ± 63.45NS MV A (m/s)454.86 ± 75.05495.07 ± 86.35413.80 ± 38.67NS MV E/A1.21 ± 0.081.24 ± 0.161.32 ± 0.17NSAbbreviations: EF%, percent ejection fraction; FS%, percent fraction shortening; HET, heterozygous for Chkb; LVID(d), left ventricle internal diameter during diastole mm; LVID(sys), left ventricle internal diameter during systole; LV Vol(d), left ventricle volume during diastole; LV Vol(sys) (μl), left ventricle volume during systole; LV Mass AW (mg), left ventricle mass; LV Mass AW (Corrected), left ventricle mass; LVAW(d), left ventricle anterior wall during diastole; LVAW(sys) (mm), left ventricle anterior wall during systole; LVPW(d), left ventricle posterior wall during diastole; LVPW(sys), left ventricle posterior wall during systole; MVA, mitral valve active phase; MVE, mitral valve early phase; MVE/A, ratio of early to active phase.a Significant from WT.b Significant from HET.

Cardiac structural parameters were measured for Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice. Heart rate was not significantly different during echocardiogram measurements between each group (Table 1). There were no structural differences at diastole and systole in hearts from Chkb+/+ and Chkb+/− mice (Fig. 2 and Table 1); however, Chkb−/− mice had a smaller left ventricular (LV) mass and smaller LV internal diameter during diastole (Fig. 2, E–G). In terms of functional parameters, there were no differences between Chkb+/+ and Chkb+/− mice, whereas Chkb−/− mice had significantly smaller calculated stroke volume (Fig. 2I), calculated cardiac output (Fig. 2J), and a reduction in LV volume during diastole (Table 1). We also measured diastolic function using pulse-wave Doppler echocardiography. There were no significant differences in mitral valve, E wave, A wave, and the E-to-A ratio between groups (Table 1). Together, these findings suggest that a complete loss of Chkb reduces LV mass, internal diameter during diastole, LV volume during diastole, and stroke volume and cardiac output and increases cardiac hypertrophy. To determine if there were additional cardiac anomalies associated with decreased Chkb level, we evaluated mouse heart function by electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline and when challenged with isoproterenol (ISO), a β1 and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist whose administration can reveal increased predilection toward arrhythmia. ECG measurements obtained from Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice determined that none of the mice displayed arrhythmic events at baseline. ISO treatment did not induce arrhythmic events in wildtype mice (Fig. 3A); ISO treatment resulted in 60% of the Chkb+/− mice and 100% of Chkb−/− mice exhibiting arrhythmic events (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantification of the baseline ECG parameters did not show a significant difference in RR intervals (Fig. 3C), PR interval (Fig. 3D), heart rate (Fig. 3E), ST height (Fig. 3F), QTc (Fig. 3G), or QRS interval (Fig. 3H) between Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice. When animals were treated with ISO, there was a significant decrease in RR interval in all genotypes compared with baseline RR intervals (Fig. 3C); however, there were no significant differences between RR intervals of animals that were stimulated with ISO (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, when Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice were challenged with ISO, only the PR interval of Chkb+/− mice showed a significant reduction (Fig. 3D). There were no significant changes in ST height (Fig. 3F), QTc (Fig. 3G), and QRS interval (Fig. 3H) after treatment with ISO. In summary, infusion of ISO had little effect on ECG parameters but had a significant increase in arrhythmic events in Chkb-deficient mice. PC synthesis is integrated with the synthesis of other major phospholipid classes, as well as AcCa, fatty acids, and the neutral lipids diacylglycerol (DG) and triacylglycerol (TG) (Fig. 4A). Fatty acids derived from plasma are first activated by esterification to fatty acyl-CoA. Subsequently, they will either be converted to AcCa to be used as energy by mitochondrial β-oxidation or be funneled into phosphatidic acid synthesis that can either enter the cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) pathway to generate phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL) or be converted to DG. DG can be metabolized into the two most abundant membrane phospholipids, PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or be used for the production of TG where it forms cytosolic lipid droplets. Lipidomics was used to determine if complete or partial loss of Chkb function alters lipid levels in heart. In cardiac muscle isolated from Chkb+/+, Chkb+/−, and Chkb−/− mice the levels of the major glycerophospholipids, PC, PE, CL, PG, PI, PS, the neutral lipids, TG and DG, the sphingolipids, sphingomyelin and ceramide, the PC and PE metabolites, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine, as well as acylcarnitine (AcCa) were quantified (Fig. 4B and Table 2). By far the largest change observed in the cardiac lipid profile was a 3.1-fold increase in AcCa level in cardiac muscle from Chkb−/− mice and a 1.7-fold increase in Chkb+/− mice, compared with wildtype. Small but statistically significant changes were also observed in several lipid species including a small increase in PC of 1.18- and 1.35-fold (Table 2) and a significant decrease in LPC to 0.62 and 0.52 in the Chkb+/− and Chkb−/− mice, respectively. The level of PC was not found to be significantly different in heart and other organs in previous work (4Sher R.B. Aoyama C. Huebsch K.A. Ji S. Kerner J. Yang Y. Frankel W.N. Hoppel C.L. Wood P.A. Vance D.E. Cox G.A. A rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy caused by a defect in choline kinase beta, the first enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4938-4948Google Scholar); this may be due to either differences in methods used or the fact that the previous study used 1-month-old mice, whereas the mice used in the current study were 5 months of age, a stage where the disease is much more advanced.Table 2Fold change in lipid levels due to Chkb deficiencyLipidFold-changeChkb+/−/Chkb+/+p-valueSignificanceFold-changeChkb−/−/Chkb+/+p-valueSignificanceAcCa1.680.0053∗3.070.0002∗∗∗Cer0.600.0000∗∗∗0.650.0000∗∗∗CL1.670.0000∗∗∗1.400.0074∗DG1.370.0000∗∗∗1.050.5291LPC0.620.0001∗∗∗0.520.0007∗∗∗LPE0.540.0039∗0.790.2500PC1.180.0000∗∗∗1.350.0000∗∗∗PE1.240.0071∗1.040.7155PG0.640.81251.211.0000PI0.870.78191.240.0174∗PS1.740.06250.880.6250SM0.820.0027∗1.060.3777TG1.190.0418∗0.550.0155∗Pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to determine the significance of a median pair-wise fold-increase in lipid amounts at an overall significance level of 5%.

Increases in two lipids are known to cause arrhythmia, AcCa and LPC. The level of LPC decreased in Chkb−/− mice, whereas that of AcCa was substantively higher. We suggest that the dramatic increase in AcCa predisposes Chkb+/− and Chkb−/− mice to cardiac arrhythmia (10Kalim S. Clish C.B. Wenger J. Elmariah S. Yeh R.W. Deferio J.J. Pierce K. Deik A.

Metabolic profiling associates with disease severity in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Card. Fail. 2020; 26: 212-222Google Scholar). Fatty acids are the main energy substrate of the heart and provide most cofactors necessary for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (22Fillmore N. Mori J. Lopaschuk G.D. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation alterations in heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 2080-2090Google Scholar). Since an increase in AcCa can be a result of a decreased ability of mitochondria to uptake and use fatty acids as source of energy, palmitoyl-carnitine was used as an energy source to determine β-oxidation capacity in wildtype and Chkb−/− mice. Intact/respiring cardiac mitochondria were isolated, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of isolated mitochondria was measured using a Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer. We included saturating concentration of ADP to ensure the maximal state three rate for the duration of the measurement cycle, and sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A/rotenone followed. Mitochondria from Chkb−/− heart showed significantly lower OCR in all respiratory states compared with mitochondria isolated from wildtype heart when using palmitoyl-carnitine as substrate (Fig. 5, A and B). It is known that mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities are dependent on membrane phospholipid composition (23Daum G. Lipids of mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Google Scholar); therefore, we tested if the decrease in OCR in Chkb−/− cardiac mitochondria is fatty acid specific or is due to a general defect in function of the electron transport chain in the heart. We assessed respiration in wildtype and Chkb−/− cardiac mitochondria using succinate, which feeds directly into the electron transport system through complex II. Rotenone (a complex I inhibitor) was used with succinate to prevent any complex I–driven respiration. Similar to fatty acid–driven OCR, when succinate was used as energy source, the Chkb−/− hearts showed significantly lower OCR in all respiratory states determined compared with mitochondria isolated from wildtype mice (Fig. 5, C and D). There appears to be a general defect in electron transport chain function in cardiac muscle of Chkb−/− mice. The electron transport chain is present on the inner mitochondrial membrane, and we determined that cardiac muscle from Chkb−/− mice have decreased electron transport chain efficacy. To assess if mitochondrial morphological changes are present in hearts from Chkb-deficient mice, we examined cardiac mitochondrial morphology by transmission electron microscopy. Electron microscopic examination of heart muscles from wildtype and Chkb-deficient mice revealed mitochondria with cristae (inner mitochondrial membrane) deformation and reduced cristae density in Chkb+/− mice, with cristae deformation and lack of density further exacerbated in the Chkb−/− mice (Fig. 5E). To further evaluate mitochondria in cardiac muscle of Chkb-deficient mice, we employed stereological methods (24Weibel E.R. Gehr P. Cruz-Orive L.M. Muller A.E. Mwangi D.K. Haussener V. Design of the mammalian respiratory system. IV Morphometric estimation of pulmonary diffusing capacity; critical evaluation of new sampling method.Respir. Physiol. 1981; 44: 39-59Google Scholar). The number of mitochondria in heart samples from Chkb+/− mice is 38% more than that of the wildtype (Fig. 5F), whereas the percentage of cardiac volume occupied by mitochondria was similar among the different groups (Fig. 5G). Consistent with the stereological analysis, the mitochondrial gene expression of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (MT-Nd1) in Chkb+/− mouse cardiac muscle was increased 1.9-fold (Fig. 5H).

https://openalex.org/W4213067815,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing in incidence in adult and pediatric patients. Identification of patients at high risk for progression to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is crucial, as it can lead to increased mortality and health system cost. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases which degrade extracellular matrix proteins and increase activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate MMP activity. Prior limited studies of MMPs and TIMPs have found some to be associated with development of SAP. The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of MMPs and TIMPs in detecting pediatric patients at risk for developing moderately severe AP or SAP.Plasma samples were prospectively collected for patients <21 years of age presenting with AP between November 2015 and October 2019, along with healthy controls. Bead-based multiplex assays were utilized to test levels of 12 MMPs and TIMPs.Samples were collected from 7 subjects who developed SAP, 7 with moderately severe AP, 45 with mild AP and 44 healthy controls. MMP-9 (p = 0.04) and TIMP-1 (p = 0.01) levels were significantly higher in SAP patients. A multivariable logistic regression model using MMP-9 and TIMP-1 predicted SAP (AUROC 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.98).We have demonstrated that MMP9 and TIMP1 levels are increased at AP presentation in pediatric patients who developed SAP during the course of illness. Further studies are needed to validate the use of MMPs and TIMPs as predictive tools for development of SAP in pediatric pancreatitis."

https://openalex.org/W4211010641,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of all death globally. Timely and accurate identification of people at risk of developing an atherosclerotic CVD and its sequelae is a central pillar of preventive cardiology. One widely used approach is risk prediction models; however, currently available models consider only a limited set of risk factors and outcomes, yield no actionable advice to individuals based on their holistic medical state and lifestyle, are often not interpretable, were built with small cohort sizes or are based on lifestyle data from the 1960s, e.g. the Framingham model. The risk of developing atherosclerotic CVDs is heavily lifestyle dependent, potentially making many occurrences preventable. Providing actionable and accurate risk prediction tools to the public could assist in atherosclerotic CVD prevention. Accordingly, we developed a benchmarking pipeline to find the best set of data preprocessing and algorithms to predict absolute 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk. Based on the data of 464,547 UK Biobank participants without atherosclerotic CVD at baseline, we used a comprehensive set of 203 consolidated risk factors associated with atherosclerosis and its sequelae (e.g. heart failure). Our two best performing absolute atherosclerotic risk prediction models provided higher performance, (AUROC: 0.7573, 95% CI: 0.755-0.7595) and (AUROC: 0.7544, 95% CI: 0.7522-0.7567), than Framingham (AUROC: 0.680, 95% CI: 0.6775-0.6824) and QRisk3 (AUROC: 0.725, 95% CI: 0.7226-0.7273). Using a subset of 25 risk factors identified with feature selection, our reduced model achieves similar performance (AUROC 0.7415, 95% CI: 0.7392-0.7438) while being less complex. Further, it is interpretable, actionable and highly generalizable. The model could be incorporated into clinical practice and might allow continuous personalized predictions with automated intervention suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W4211022903,"The hemerythrin-like protein from Mycobacterium kansasii (Mka HLP) is a member of a distinct class of oxo-bridged diiron proteins that are found only in mycobacterial species that cause respiratory disorders in humans. Because it had been shown to exhibit weak catalase activity and a change in absorbance on exposure to nitric oxide (NO), the reactivity of Mka HLP toward NO was examined under a variety of conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, we found that NO was converted to nitrite (NO2-) via an intermediate, which absorbed light at 520 nm. Under aerobic conditions NO was converted to nitrate (NO3-). In each of these two cases, the maximum amount of nitrite or nitrate formed was at best stoichiometric with the concentration of Mka HLP. When incubated with NO and H2O2, we observed NO peroxidase activity yielding nitrite and water as reaction products. Steady-state kinetic analysis of NO consumption during this reaction yielded a Km for NO of 0.44 μM and a kcat/Km of 2.3 × 105 M-1s-1. This high affinity for NO is consistent with a physiological role for Mka HLP in deterring nitrosative stress. This is the first example of a peroxidase that uses an oxo-bridged diiron center and a rare example of a peroxidase utilizing NO as an electron donor and cosubstrate. This activity provides a mechanism by which the infectious Mycobacterium may combat against the cocktail of NO and superoxide (O2•-) generated by macrophages to defend against bacteria, as well as to produce NO2- to adapt to hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4211175592,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) targeting specific cell types are powerful tools for studying distinct cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), e.g., enhancers, are highly cell-type-specific and can be integrated into AAVs to render cell type specificity. Chromatin accessibility has been commonly used to nominate CRMs, which have then been incorporated into AAVs and tested for cell type specificity in the CNS. However, chromatin accessibility data alone cannot accurately annotate active CRMs, as many chromatin-accessible CRMs are not active and fail to drive gene expression in vivo. Using available large-scale datasets on chromatin accessibility, such as those published by the ENCODE project, here we explored strategies to increase efficiency in identifying active CRMs for AAV-based cell-type-specific labeling and manipulation. We found that prescreening of chromatin-accessible putative CRMs based on the density of cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) can significantly increase efficiency in identifying active CRMs. In addition, generation of synthetic CRMs by stitching chromatin-accessible regions flanking cell-type-specific genes can render cell type specificity in many cases. Using these straightforward strategies, we generated AAVs that can target the extensively studied interneuron and glial cell types in the retina and brain. Both strategies utilize available genomic datasets and can be employed to generate AAVs targeting specific cell types in CNS without conducting comprehensive screening and sequencing experiments, making a step forward in cell-type-specific research."
https://openalex.org/W4212845444,"The expression of TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) is essential for many physiological processes. Here we studied the phenotype of TRAF6[L74H] knock-in mice which are devoid of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity in every cell of the body, but express normal levels of the TRAF6 protein. Remarkably, TRAF6[L74H] mice have none of the phenotypes seen in TRAF6 KO mice. Instead TRAF6[L74H] mice display an entirely different phenotype, exhibiting autoimmunity, and severe inflammation of the skin and modest inflammation of the liver and lungs. Similar to mice with a Treg-specific knockout of TRAF6, or mice devoid of TRAF6 in all T cells, the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes displayed an activated effector memory phenotype with CD44 high /CD62L low expression on the cell surface. In contrast, T cells from WT mice exhibited the CD44 low /CD62L high phenotype characteristic of naïve T cells. The onset of autoimmunity and autoinflammation in TRAF6[L74H] mice (two weeks) was much faster than in mice with a Treg-specific knockout of TRAF6 or lacking TRAF6 expression in all T cells (2–3 months) and we discuss whether this may be caused by secondary inflammation of other tissues. The distinct phenotypes of mice lacking TRAF6 expression in all cells appears to be explained by their inability to signal via TNF Receptor Superfamily members, which does not seem to be impaired significantly in TRAF6[L74H] mice."
https://openalex.org/W4212895688,"Knee ligaments and tendons play an important role in stabilizing and controlling the motions of the knee. Injuries to the ligaments can lead to abnormal mechanical loading of the other supporting tissues (e.g., cartilage and meniscus) and even osteoarthritis. While the condition of knee ligaments can be examined during arthroscopic repair procedures, the arthroscopic evaluation suffers from subjectivity and poor repeatability. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is capable of non-destructively quantifying the composition and structure of collagen-rich connective tissues, such as articular cartilage and meniscus. Despite the similarities, NIRS-based evaluation of ligament composition has not been previously attempted. In this study, ligaments and patellar tendon of ten bovine stifle joints were measured with NIRS, followed by chemical and histological reference analysis. The relationship between the reference properties of the tissue and NIR spectra was investigated using partial least squares regression. NIRS was found to be sensitive towards the water ( R 2 CV = .65) and collagen ( R 2 CV = .57) contents, while elastin, proteoglycans, and the internal crimp structure remained undetectable. As collagen largely determines the mechanical response of ligaments, we conclude that NIRS demonstrates potential for quantitative evaluation of knee ligaments."

These “doubtful melanocytic lesions” pose a very common and challenging scenario in clinical practice and were selected at this study for reflectance confocal microscopy evaluation and subsequent surgical excision for histopathological diagnosis. The study included 110 lesions and three confocal features were statistically able to distinguish benign melanocytic lesions from melanomas: “peripheral hotspot at dermo-epidermal junction”, “nucleated roundish cells at the dermo-epidermal junction” and “sheet of cells”. The finding of a peripheral hotspot (atypical cells in 1mm 2 ) at the DEJ is highlighted because has not been previously reported in the literature as a confocal feature related to melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W4210862862,"The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) is of utmost importance for overall cellular metabolism and has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in cancer cells. This enzyme is also conserved in the rapidly proliferating malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which have a similar metabolic framework as cancer cells and rely on glycolysis as the sole energy-yielding process during intraerythrocytic development. There is no redundancy among the annotated PGM enzymes in Plasmodium, and PfPGM1 is absolutely required for the parasite survival as evidenced by conditional knockdown in our study. A detailed comparison of PfPGM1 with its counterparts followed by in-depth structure-function analysis revealed unique attributes of this parasitic protein. Here, we report for the first time the importance of oligomerization for the optimal functioning of the enzyme in vivo, as earlier studies in eukaryotes only focused on the effects in vitro. We show that single point mutation of the amino acid residue W68 led to complete loss of tetramerization and diminished catalytic activity in vitro. Additionally, ectopic expression of the WT PfPGM1 protein enhanced parasite growth, whereas the monomeric form of PfPGM1 failed to provide growth advantage. Furthermore, mutation of the evolutionarily conserved residue K100 led to a drastic reduction in enzymatic activity. The indispensable nature of this parasite enzyme highlights the potential of PfPGM1 as a therapeutic target against malaria, and targeting the interfacial residues critical for oligomerization can serve as a focal point for promising drug development strategies that may not be restricted to malaria only."
https://openalex.org/W4211194241,"Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs) regulate the hypoxic induction of >300 genes required for survival and adaptation under oxygen deprivation. Inhibition of HIF-P4H-2 has been shown to be protective in focal cerebral ischemia rodent models, while that of HIF-P4H-1 has no effects and inactivation of HIF-P4H-3 has adverse effects. A transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H-TM) is highly expressed in the brain and contributes to the regulation of HIF, but the outcome of its inhibition on stroke is yet unknown. To study this, we subjected WT and P4htm-/- mice to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Lack of P4H-TM had no effect on lesion size following pMCAO, but increased inflammatory microgliosis and neutrophil infiltration was observed in the P4htm-/- cortex. Furthermore, both the permeability of blood brain barrier and ultrastructure of cerebral tight junctions were compromised in P4htm-/- mice. At the molecular level, P4H-TM deficiency led to increased expression of proinflammatory genes and robust activation of protein kinases in the cortex, while expression of tight junction proteins and the neuroprotective growth factors erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor was reduced. Our data provide the first evidence that P4H-TM inactivation has no protective effect on infarct size and increases inflammatory microgliosis and neutrophil infiltration in the cortex at early stage after pMCAO. When considering HIF-P4H inhibitors as potential therapeutics in stroke, the current data support that isoenzyme-selective inhibitors that do not target P4H-TM or HIF-P4H-3 would be preferred."
https://openalex.org/W4211242454,"Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are conserved proteins involved in the regulation of life span and age-related diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. Stress stimuli or growth factor deprivation promotes nuclear localization and activation of FoxO proteins, which-depending on the cellular context-can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In endothelial cells (ECs), they further regulate angiogenesis and may promote inflammation and vessel destabilization implicating a role of FoxOs in vascular diseases. In several cancers, FoxOs exert a tumor-suppressive function by regulating proliferation and survival. We and others have previously shown that FoxOs can regulate these processes via two different mechanisms: by direct binding to forkhead-responsive elements at the promoter of target genes or by a poorly understood alternative process that does not require direct DNA binding and regulates key targets in primary human ECs. Here, we performed an interaction study in ECs to identify new nuclear FoxO3 interaction partners that might contribute to FoxO-dependent gene regulation. Mass spectrometry analysis of FoxO3-interacting proteins revealed transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP), a member of multiple histone acetyltransferase complexes, as a novel binding partner of FoxO family proteins. We demonstrate that TRRAP is required to support FoxO3 transactivation and FoxO3-dependent G1 arrest and apoptosis in ECs via transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and the proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family member, BIM. Moreover, FoxO-TRRAP interaction could explain FoxO-induced alternative gene regulation via TRRAP-dependent recruitment to target promoters lacking forkhead-responsive element sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4212869303,"Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) have an increased risk of additional cancers, including prostate cancer. Our understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer in testicular cancer survivors is very limited due to its rare incidence.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry from 1978 to 2011, we identified 282 TCS with subsequent prostate cancer and examined the tumor grade and clinical outcomes in contrast to men with primary prostate cancer in the general population.TCS with a subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis were more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age than men with primary prostate cancer (65.2% vs. 37.6% for age ≤65, 34.8% vs. 62.4% for age >65, p<0.001) and were more likely to have grade III/IV tumors (46.2% vs. 37.0%, p<0.002). Longer latency between testicular and prostate cancer diagnoses was associated with a higher risk of grade III/IV (p<0.001) cancer. Despite the increased risk for high-grade tumors, 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival were not significantly different between TCS and men with primary prostate cancer. Based on the available information in SEER, we found that prior history of radiotherapy for testicular cancer had no impact on tumor grade or survival outcomes.Prostate cancer in TCS was more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age and with higher grades. Risks of grade III/IV disease increased with longer latency between testicular and prostate cancer diagnoses. Radiotherapy for testicular cancer did not appear to have a significant impact on the outcome of subsequent prostate cancer."
