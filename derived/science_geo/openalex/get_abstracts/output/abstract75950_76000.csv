https://openalex.org/W1583697237,"Abstract Histones rich in lysine were prepared by a procedure based on the direct extraction of calf thymus with aqueous trichloracetic acid. The protein obtained included what appeared to be degradation products, unless care was taken to isolate the histone rapidly (25 min) in the cold (0–3.5°) from thymus which had been frozen for transport to the laboratory. The protein preparations made according to this procedure appeared to be the same as other lysine-rich histone preparations described in the literature when examined by electrophoresis, chromatography, and amino acid analysis. These preparations seemed homogeneous in free boundary electrophoresis, and in zone electrophoresis in paper and starch gel. These preparations appeared homogeneous when examined by stepwise elution from carboxymethyl cellulose and when eluted from Amberlite IRC-50 by a gradient of barium acetate. Some resolution of these preparations was obtained by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. This technique was especially powerful in detecting degradation products in the preparations. The most effective resolution of lysinerich histones, however, was obtained by chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with a gradient (7 to 14%) of guanidinium chloride in 0.1 m phosphate (pH 6.8). This method yielded three major fractions, one of which occasionally showed further partial resolution. Electrophoresis of the chromatographic fractions in polyacrylamide gel confirmed the presence of a total of four components in the lysine-rich histone prepared as noted above."
https://openalex.org/W1571951882,"Abstract Evidence from many sources indicates that the ribonucleic acid and protein of normal animal tissues are replaced more rapidly than are the cells themselves. However, the significance of this macromolecular turnover and the mechanisms that regulate synthesis in concert with catabolism to maintain cellular composition have remained obscure. In beginning a study of factors that influence protein and RNA turnover in mammalian cells, we have compared the rates of synthesis and degradation of liver cytoplasmic ribosomes in fed and in fasted animals. Synthesis was measured by labeling ribosomal protein and RNA and by measuring the rate at which the specific activities decreased owing to continuing synthesis from unlabeled precursors. In fed, nearly mature animals, degradation approximates synthesis. In fasting, degradation exceeds synthesis and was measured as the difference between rates of synthesis and of net loss of liver ribosomes. Our results indicate that ribosomal protein and RNA are replaced at the same rate. The normal kinetics are first order, with turnover half-times of 5 days. During starvation, the cellular ribosome content decreases steadily due to an increased degradative and a diminished synthetic rate."

https://openalex.org/W1593839182,"Abstract The bell-shaped pH rate profile for the reaction of tetrahydrofolic acid with formaldehyde to form 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolic acid has been shown to result from a change in rate-determining step with changing acidity. In alkaline solution, the rate-determining step is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of hydroxymethyl tetrahydrofolic acid and its conjugate base. This step is subject to general acid catalysis with a Bronsted slope, α, of approximately 0.75. In acid solution, attack of tetrahydrofolic acid on formaldehyde is rate-determining. This step is subject to catalysis by general acids, including the solvated proton, with a Bronsted slope of 0.20. At pH values above 4, the reaction is inhibited by thiols, which combine with formaldehyde in a base-catalyzed reaction to form hemithioacetals. Depending on the reaction conditions, this inhibition can result from a lowering of the equilibrium concentration of formaldehyde or from a trapping by thiol anion of unhydrated formaldehyde, as it is formed from formaldehyde hydrate. The equilibrium constant for hemithioacetal formation from formaldehyde and mercaptoethanol is approximately 620 m-1. Secondary amines such as morpholine and imidazole catalyze the reaction of tetrahydrofolic acid with formaldehyde by nucleophilic catalysis by a pathway which must involve the intermediate formation of cationic imines, [see PDF for structure]"
https://openalex.org/W1583409444,"The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity of the protease produced by Bacillus thermoproteolyticus was examined in the temperature range between 25° and 88°. The kinetic analysis of the enzyme which was heated for 1 hour at 80° indicates that the heated enzyme has the same maximum velocity but lower affinity for substrate than the native one. Molecular weight of the protease was found to be 37,500. The value of intrinsic viscosity was 3.3 ml per g. The ionization behavior of the tyrosine residue of the native and the heat-treated enzyme was examined by spectrophotometric titration. The titration curves indicated that nearly two-thirds of the tyrosine residues in the native enzyme ionized abnormally above pH 10.5. The analysis of the fluorescence spectra of tryptophan residues in the native enzyme was carried out in comparison with those of tryptophan in various solvents. These experiments suggest that some tryptophan residues of the enzyme in the native state are buried in a nonpolar environment with high refractive index rather than exposed to water. From the measurement of the optical rotatory dispersion in the 300 to 600 mµ spectral zone and the ultraviolet region, it appeared that there was a low helix content in the native enzyme. The Cotton effect caused by tyrosine residues was observed by the measurement of the rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. Amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined by column chromatography with the use of the automatic amino acid analyzer. The structure of the thermostable protease was discussed based on the study of the physicochemical properties of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596717967,"A structural study was made of the four lysine-rich histones isolated previously. Two of these histones (Fraction I and Fraction II) were studied individually, but the other two were studied as a mixture (Fraction III). Amino acid analysis established only a few conclusive differences among these fractions. Fraction I had 4 moles of arginine per mole of histone (mol wt 21,000), Fraction II had 3, and Fraction III had 3.5. Fractions I and II had 10 moles of valine per mole of histone, while Fraction III had 8. Peptide fractionation by ion exchange chromatography and paper electrophoresis resolved 50 to 55 components in the tryptic digest of each histone fraction. There was a coincidence of 45 of these components when the three fractions were compared, suggesting that the four histones in these fractions had very closely related primary structures. All these fractions appeared to have the same amino acid sequence around the tyrosine residue and around the phenylalanine residue found in each fraction. All seemed to have identical sequences around 3 arginine residues, but Fraction II and one of the histones in Fraction III apparently lacked a fourth arginine-containing sequence. Although much of the primary structure of these histones is common to all of them, a number of differences were established. There was one peptide unique to Fraction I, four unique to Fraction II, and seven unique to Fraction III. One peptide found in Fractions II and III was missing from Fraction I; two peptides found in Fractions I and III were missing from Fraction II; two peptides found in Fractions I and II were missing from Fraction III. It was concluded that these four lysine-rich histones have closely related primary structures, but exist endogenously as distinct molecular species."

https://openalex.org/W1569763864,"Abstract The existence of protonated hydroxymethylamines of secondary amines, R2(+)/NHCH2OH, in equilibrium with hydroxy-methylamines and protonated amines, has been demonstrated by titration at equilibrium and by rapid titration of the protonated hydroxymethylamines. Analogous compounds, R3(+)/NCH2OH, are formed from formaldehyde and the sterically favorable tertiary amines: pyridine, N-methylimidazole, and triethylenediamine. The equilibrium constants for the formation of these cationic hydroxymethylamines are two to three orders of magnitude less favorable than for the formation of neutral hydroxymethylamines; conversely, the basicity of hydroxymethylamines is two to three orders of magnitude less than that of the parent amines. These differences are ascribed primarily to solvation and polar effects. Protonation of the dihydroxymethyl adducts of primary amines was not detected. An analysis of the complex equilibria for the addition of protons and hydroxymethyl groups to imidazole suggests that protonation and hydroxymethylation do not occur on the same nitrogen atom. The equilibrium constant Kd = [R2NCH2NR2]/[R2NH]2[H2C(OH)2] for the formation of the methylenediamine adduct of morpholine has been shown to be 15,500 ± 600 by two titrimetric methods. An attempt is made to evaluate the effects on the formol titration of changes in water concentration, formaldehyde polymerization, the methanol introduced with commercial formalin, and nonspecific medium effects in concentrated formaldehyde solutions. It is concluded that these factors either have little significant effect or largely cancel each other out."
https://openalex.org/W1535582903,"Abstract A simple method, applicable to large amounts of starting material, has been developed for the preparation of plant ferredoxins, and applied to alfalfa. Highly purified alfalfa ferredoxin contains 2 atoms of iron and 2 moles of sulfur per molecular weight of 11,500. Spectral absorption maxima occur at 465, 422, 331, and 277 mµ. The ratios of the optical densities at 465, 422, and 331 mµ to that at 277 mµ are 0.43, 0.48, and 0.65, respectively. The amino acid composition of alfalfa ferredoxin is: Trp1, Lys5, His2, Arg1, Asp10, Thr6, Ser8, Glu17, Pro3, Gly8, Ala10, Cys6, Val9, Ile4, Leu6, Tyr4, Phe2. The aromatic residues and the spectral contribution of the 2 iron atoms account for the entire absorption at 277 mµ. The spectrum provides no evidence for the existence of any nonprotein organic constituent, such as a prosthetic group. The activity of the purest preparations in the photoreduction of TPN in the presence of chloroplasts is over 40 units per mg of protein. It was shown that the labile sulfur does not arise from cysteinyl residues by β elimination. The native protein deteriorates rapidly in the presence of O2 but can be protected indefinitely under N2. During deterioration there is a parallel loss of enzymic activity, of the spectral bands at 465, 422, and 331 mµ and of the labile sulfur. There is also a concomitant polymerization, the weight average molecular weight rising to about 30,000. The polymers are colorless and separate readily from the intact protein by electrophoresis. No disulfide bonds occur either in native or deteriorated ferredoxin. However, following deterioration the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups become less reactive and the iron more strongly bound than in the native protein. Mercurial titrations and carboxymethylation experiments indicate that all 6 cysteinyl residues have identical reactivities, and it appears that the active site of alfalfa ferredoxin does not conform to the model proposed for the bacterial proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1545445256,"Abstract The formation of deoxycytidylate in soluble extracts of Ehrlich ascites cells grown in white Swiss mice and of L cells grown in monolayer cultures was shown to occur by ribonucleotide reduction without cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Meso-α,β-diphenylsuccinate, which had previously been described as a specific inhibitor for the activation of deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase, was found to block the nucleotide reductase reaction in these extracts. The inhibitory effectiveness was indistinguishable from that observed with hydroxyurea, and both agents affected the reduction reaction but not the kinases responsible for converting cytidine monophosphate to cytidine diphosphate and triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1582986593,"Abstract 1. Threonine deaminase has been purified about 1400-fold from extracts of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas spheroides by ammonium sulfate fractionation and by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite columns. The purified enzyme is almost completely resolved with respect to bound coenzyme, and the activity of holoenzyme is specific for pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme is fairly stable in solution in the presence of l-isoleucine. 2. Kinetic studies indicate that there are more than one threonine-binding sites on the enzyme, and that substratesubstrate interactions may be influenced by feedback modifiers, e.g. isoleucine and valine, either by direct or indirect interactions. 3. The purified enzyme is subject to feedback inhibition by l-isoleucine and the inhibition due to l-isoleucine is reversed by low concentrations of l-valine. 4. In the absence of l-isoleucine, l-valine at low concentrations activates the deamination reaction, and the stimulatory effect is eliminated at high threonine concentration. At high l-valine concentrations, the enzyme activity is inhibited at all substrate concentrations tested; the substrate saturation curve is similar to that obtained when l-isoleucine was the enzyme inhibitor. 5. Inhibition of enzyme activity by l-isoleucine or by high l-valine is counteracted by HgCl2; Hg++ ions do not influence the stimulatory influence due to low levels of l-valine. Furthermore, the enzyme can be completely inactivated by incubation with HgCl2, and the activity may be regenerated by addition of β-mercaptoethanol. 6. It is concluded from these studies that there are two binding sites for valine per molecule of enzyme and that one of these binding sites is closely associated with a threoninebinding site, whereas, the second one is identical with or closely overlapping that of the isoleucine site."
https://openalex.org/W1538402004,"Abstract A nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-requiring galactose dehydrogenase (d-galactose:NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.48) has been identified in rat liver. The conditions for extraction of the enzyme from liver were studied and it was purified 100-fold. Liver galactose dehydrogenase activity is 7 times greater than glucose dehydrogenase, and, in contrast with the latter enzyme, 85% of the activity is present in the soluble cellular fraction. In crude preparations and under optimum conditions, its specific activity is similar to that of galactokinase (7 mµmoles per min per mg of protein). Galactose dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of the aldehyde group of galactose to produce galactonolactone which under the alkaline conditions of assay is spontaneously converted to galactonic acid. There is evidence that liver contains an enzyme which rapidly catalyzes the hydrolysis of the lactone to yield the free acid; this reaction appears to be irreversible. Liver is the only rat tissue with substantial galactose dehydrogenase activity, although some activity is detectable in preparations of testis, kidney, intestine, and mammary gland. Human red and white blood cells have no detectable activity. Galactose dehydrogenase activity is present in liver preparations of eight mammalian species, including man. Pigeon liver has very weak activity, and none is found in frog or fish liver."

The enzyme, l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate dehydratase, which catalyzes the conversion of l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate to α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde, has been purified and crystallized. The enzyme is homogeneous on starch gel electrophoresis and shows a single asymmetrical peak in the ultracentrifuge. No cofactor has been observed."

https://openalex.org/W1484391548,"Abstract 1. The enzyme aspartokinase has been purified about 240-fold from extracts of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. An absolute requirement for adenosine triphosphate and a divalent cation for enzyme activity has been shown. No other nucleoside phosphates can serve as the phosphate donor; Mn++ can replace Mg++. Potassium ion stimulates the phosphorylation reaction by increasing the maximal velocity of the reaction and by facilitating the binding of an additional ATP molecule per molecule of enzyme. 2. None of the end product amino acids of the aspartic family, namely, lysine, methionine, threonine, or isoleucine, or any combination of these has any regulatory effect on the enzyme activity. However, the activity is strongly inhibited by aspartate β-semialdehyde, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the amino acids noted. The inhibition is competitive with respect to both aspartate and ATP. It is concluded that feedback inhibition by aspartate β-semialdehyde of R. spheroides aspartokinase provides an effective mechanism in regulating biosynthesis of these four important amino acids. 3. Results of heating experiments show that several end product amino acids, particularly lysine and threonine, protect the enzyme against heat inactivation, indicating binding sites for these amino acids on the enzyme molecule. It is suggested that, in contrast to other bacterial aspartokinases, these amino acids although bound on the enzyme, have lost the ability to interact with the catalytic sites, and thus are unable to modify enzyme activity."

The serum was also effective in mice which were made immunologically incompetent by radiation with cobalt-60."
https://openalex.org/W1487000710,"Abstract Nonactivated, partially purified bovine heart phosphorylase b kinase was activated by incubation with adenosine triphosphate and Mg++ ion prior to assay. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate increased the rate of activation, but there was no absolute requirement for the cyclic nucleotide. Activation was particularly prominent when the subsequent assay for kinase activity was carried out at pH 7.0, where the enzyme has low activity. Significant activation was also evident when the assay was performed at pH 8.2, where the nonactivated enzyme is partially active. The response to adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate was linear from 1 x 10-8 to 2 x 10-7 m. Other ribonucleoside 3',5'-cyclic phosphates were without effect except at much higher concentrations. Supramaximal doses of epinephrine (2 µg), when injected into perfused rat hearts, caused a modest but significant activation of phosphorylase b kinase as compared with controls. A 5-fold increase in enzyme activity occurred as determined by assaying 30,000 x g supernatant fractions at pH 6.8. Activation was also apparent, but proportionately less, when extracts were assayed at pH 8.2. Activation was characterized by a 3-fold increase in pH 6.8 to 8.2 activity ratios. The activation occurred rapidly, was maximal at 3 sec after epinephrine injection, and rose well ahead of the contractile response, which reached a maximum in 10 sec."

The animals were sacrificed at various times between 30 min and 24 hours, and a nonprotein amino acid fraction and myosin were isolated from skeletal muscle. Myosin was subjected to brief tryptic hydrolysis and the resulting heavy and light meromyosins (HMM and LMM) were isolated and purified. LMM Fr. I was prepared from LMM. After complete acid hydrolysis of myosin, HMM, and LMM Fr. I, arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine residues were isolated from the hydrolysates by ion exchange chromatography. The specific radioactivities of these residues were determined in the three proteins. Maximal amino acid incorporation occurred in the first 6 hours. The turnover ratios of the 14C-amino acid residues were determined and found to be essentially constant in all of the protein fractions, a finding which fails to support earlier evidence for a significant difference in the rate of replacement of amino acid residues in the meromyosins. The results support the view that the heavy and light meromyosins derived from myosin are synthesized at similar rates. The metabolic turnover time of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and the meromyosins was found to be approximately 29 days."
https://openalex.org/W1546612323,"Abstract Radioimmunoassay of endogenous plasma growth hormone in human plasma fractions separated by starch gel electrophoresis shows that the plasma hormone migrates in a fairly narrow peak behind serum albumin. A similar electrophoretic mobility is exhibited by certain pituitary growth hormone preparations (the A type of Wilhelmi), added to plasma in physiological concentrations or on electrophoresis in the absence of plasma. Other pituitary growth hormone preparations (the B type of Wilhelmi) exhibit greater heterogeneity, with several more anodally migrating fractions. On prolonged storage in 5 x 10-3 m HCl at -15° or after short periods in acid, neutral, or alkaline solutions at 20–37°, increase in acidic components is observed in all preparations. Growth hormone preparations lightly iodinated with 131I show electrophoretic mobilities similar to those of the respective unlabeled hormones, but more heavily iodinated preparations show greater anodal mobility. Immunoreactivities of A type and B type hormones were identical in an antiserum used for immunoassay of growth hormone in human plasma. It is concluded that the electrophoretic mobility of endogenous plasma growth hormone corresponds to that of unaltered pituitary growth hormone, that electrophoretic heterogeneity of pituitary growth hormone preparations is the consequence of deamidation or other alteration of native hormone, and that neither pituitary growth hormone added to plasma nor endogenous plasma hormone is bound to normal plasma proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1499275910,"Abstract During the normal 4-day growth cycle of Chang's liver cells in tissue culture, ornithine δ-transaminase increased and returned to the initial level in a fairly regular and reproducible manner. These changes in activity appeared to be the net result of synthesis and degradation of enzyme. Synthesis of enzyme was prevented or decreased by omitting as essential amino acid from the medium or by the addition of puromycin. Inhibition of synthesis allowed a minimum degradation rate to be determined. Synthesis of enzyme began again when the missing amino acid was restored. If the missing amino acid was glutamine or phenylalanine, the subsequent rise of ornithine δ-transaminase took place as a single continuous stage after transferring the cells to complete medium. In contrast, when arginine was the amino acid omitted from the preceding incubation medium, the subsequent increase of enzymatic activity was biphasic. The addition of actinomycin either initially or after prior incubation of cells in medium lacking an essential amino acid stimulated the first phase rise; the second phase increase then was not observed. Leucine, valine, isoleucine, or ornithine, each of which is inhibitory to ornithine δ-transaminase, increased enzymatic activity when added at a 6 mm concentration and extended the period of normal increase of the enzyme. Other amino acids were without effect. It is proposed that the biosynthesis of ornithine δ-transaminase in Chang's liver cells is repressed by an as yet unidentified metabolic product. In addition, it is suggested that the enzyme is synthesized in response to messenger ribonucleic acid of an appreciable lifetime."

https://openalex.org/W1598673010,"Abstract An increase of arginase activity has been produced in Chang's liver cells in suspension cultures by increasing the concentration in the growth medium of lysine, leucine, valine, or ornithine. These amino acids are known to inhibit enzymes in the arginase-initiated reaction sequence from arginine to proline. An increase in arginase also occurred with o-aminobenzaldehyde, a compound which reacts with a metabolite (Δ1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate) of the same reaction chain. A stimulation of arginase has been also shown following substitution of citrulline for arginine in the growth medium. A decrease in arginase was found after addition of proline, a product of the same reaction sequence. Experiments in which protein synthesis was inhibited by puromycin indicate that the rate of accumulation of enzyme protein was involved rather than an activation or inactivation of preformed enzyme. When arginase was stabilized by the addition of manganese to the growth medium, the compounds mentioned above produced the same results as before, although greater in magnitude, indicating an effect on the rate of synthesis rather than on the rate of degradation of the enzyme during general protein turnover. These results suggest that synthesis of arginase in Chang's liver cells during a normal 4-day growth cycle is regulated, in part at least, by product repression."

https://openalex.org/W1504682752,"Abstract A complex formed between phosphoglycerate mutase from rabbit muscle and its cofactor, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, has been isolated and examined. With a column of Sephadex G-25, enzyme-bound radioactivity equivalent to 0.85 mole of cofactor per mole of enzyme was separated from 2,3-diphosphoglycerate-32P. As much as 80% of the enzymebound 32P could be incorporated into nonradioactive substrate or cofactor during very short reaction periods. These exchange reactions suggested that the bound radioactivity was not in the form enzyme-phosphate, but rather in the form enzyme·P2·glycerate. Subjecting enzyme with bound 32P to paper chromatography confirmed this; the radioactivity was distributed about equally between orthophosphate and monophosphoglycerate. This enzyme-bound cofactor was labile to treatment with 0.4 m KOH or HClO4, and was then detected as 32Pi after paper chromatography. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate alone was not hydrolyzed under the same conditions. Thus, in the process of binding to the enzyme, the glycerate-phosphate bonds of the cofactor are rendered labile. The complex was unstable at 4°, decomposing into Pi and, apparently, glyceric acid. In a 24-hour period, the exchangeable bound radioactivity decreased from 73 to 24%, while paper chromatography of the complex showed a decrease in the monophosphoglycerate fraction and an increase in the Pi fraction. Enzyme-bound 32P from 3-phosphoglycerate-32P was obtained by a similar procedure. The binding was equivalent to 0.34 mole of substrate per mole of enzyme. This bound radioactivity was labile to treatment with 0.4 m HClO4 or KOH. Most of the bound radioactivity could be exchanged with nonradioactive cofactor or substrate. Unlike the enzyme-cofactor complex, a high percentage of bound radioactivity was not exchanged, and was recovered as Pi in exchange reactions with high concentrations of combined unlabeled 3-phosphoglycerate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Exchange between 3-phosphoglycerate-32P and nonradioactive 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the presence of phosphoglycerate mutase showed that free 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is not an obligatory reactant in every conversion of substrate to product. This is consistent with a cofactor role for free 2,3-diphosphoglycerate of maintaining saturating levels of an active intermediate, enzyme·P2·glycerate."
https://openalex.org/W1538036036,"Abstract The rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorobenzenoneindophenol by xanthine oxidase plus its aldehydic or purine substrates is strikingly stimulated by the admixture of water-miscible organic solvents. In addition to acting as the electron acceptor in these assays, 2,6-dichlorobenzenoneindophenol is found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase with a KI of 1 x 10-6 M. The leuco form of this dye is a much less effective inhibitor, with a KI of 1.5 x 10-5 M. Dimethoxyethane and other water-miscible organic solvents reduce the inhibitory potency of 2,6-dichlorobenzenoneindophenol and thus give the appearance of activating the enzyme in this dye reduction assay. The inhibition of the enzyme by several other competitive inhibitors was not affected by dimethoxyethane. Dimethoxyethane, per se, is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Its effects on the kinetics of this enzyme are notably complex. The reversal of the 2,6-dichlorobenzenoneindophenol inhibition by organic solvents appears best explained in terms of their effects on the solvent properties of the medium."

Metachromasy may also be induced in solution in the absence of chromotropic substances in three different ways5: by increasing the dye concentration (dye-induced), by adding salt (salt-induced) and by lowering the dielectric constant of the solvent from medium (about 20) to low (about 3) values (solvent-induced)."
