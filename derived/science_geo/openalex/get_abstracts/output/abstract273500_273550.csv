https://openalex.org/W1988397939,"The initial occupation of Eastern North America was by small bands of people who gained their livelihood by hunting and gathering. As time passed, the occupants of different regions be came increasingly familiar with the available natural resources. The de velopment or introduction of new tools and devices enabled the people to ex ploit their environments more effective ly, until, by Late Archaic times, popu lation size had increased, in terms both of density within a given area and num ber of people in individual social units. The initial agricultural productivity aided the culmination of the long cul tural traditions in the remarkable pro ductions and practices of the Hope wellian complexes of Middle Woodland times. The major Hopewellian centers reflect the marked change in societal organization and patterns. The costumes of the dead and the manner of their burial clearly reflect individual status differentiations, while artistic creativity is probably to be equated with incipient specialization of labor. Many of the Mississippian societies reached an even more advanced plateau of cultural de velopment, with fortified towns, an or ganized priesthood, dominant hereditary chiefs, political and military alliances, and a well-developed class system. The details of the cultural develop ment in Eastern North America are unique, but the general trend may be regarded as a common one in human society, and the patterns of behavior, as analogous to those developed by other peoples in other areas of the Old World and the New."
https://openalex.org/W2056275877,"Shock effects in quartz, plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, and some accessory minerals have been observed in rocks subjected to various degrees of meta morphism by meteoritic impact. The shock features described are unique; they are never observed in rocks from normal geologic environments. Such features are described: 1) Multiple sets of closely spaced planar microstructures occur in quartz, plagioclase, and other rock-forming minerals. Those characteristic of shock consist of alternating platelets, with a range of reduced mean index of re fraction and birefringence; they con sist of platelets that have been partially or completely transformed to an amor phous phase. 2) Quartz and plagioclase are selec tively and completely transformed to silica glass and plagioclase glass in the solid state, whereas the associated mafic minerals remained crystalline. There is no reaction between adjacent minerals. 3) High-pressure polymorphs occur, such as coesite or stishovite. Coesite oc Curs exclusively within silica glass; it has not been observed as a reaction or breakdown product. 4) Nickel-iron spherules occur in the fused glass or impactites. 5) The occurrence of droplets of ilmenite, rutile, pseudobrookite, and baddaleyite in impactites indicates a temperature of formation exceeding 150 degrees C. 6) Dense glass occurs, similar in composition to bulk rock, in which iron oxide, such as fine particles of mag netite, is completely dissolved. All these features are characteristic of a process involving the rapid rise and fall of extremiiely high pressures and temperatures. Minerals and mineral as semblages experiencing such high strain rates and sudden changes of pressures and temperatures react and change in dependently to the bulk chemical com position, under nonequilibrium condi tions. Many aspects of shock features re quire careful study. Kink bands in biotite and deformation lamellae in quartz occur in tectonically deformed rocks. These features should be studied with great care in order to determine whether reduction in mean index of refraction and total birefringence along the planar structures have resulted from vitrification or phase transition; their presence is additional evidence in favor of a shock mechanism. Vitreous phases or glasses formed by shock also have many unique prop erties; they have not been studied by such methods as thermoluminescence, electron spin resonance, low-angle x ray diffraction, or infrared spectroscopy. Shock-fused glass of high density needs to be studied in detail in carefully con trolled laboratory conditions. Experimental shock-wave studies of the equation-of-state of single minerals and mineral assemblages, under care fully controlled conditions, must pre cede estimates of peak pressures and peak and residual temperatures of shocked natural mineral assemblages. Detailed petrographic and mineralogic studies, however, have provided useful and definitive criteria for characteriza tion of impact events. Such data should be of paramount importance in the study of samples brought back from Moon."

The vertebrate fauna from Clovis components suggests a deciduous woodland and meadow habitat. Such an environmental reconstruction provides a new perspective for Clovis adaptations and the ecological tolerances of Mammut americanum."
https://openalex.org/W2079773681,"The filtering rate of the copepod Diaptomus tyrrelli is reduced in the presence of its potential competitor and predator, Epischura nevadensis, by as much as 60 percent. This effect is caused by a chemical released into the water by Epischura. The chemical does not pass through dialysis tubing with a pore size of 104 angstroms, indicating that it is a large molecular weight compound. The reduction in filtering rate is the result of interference competition between two species and may be linked to the evolution of a mechanism for avoiding predation."
https://openalex.org/W1971486926,"Predacious mites fed for two generations solely on the eggs of wild-type spider mites responded normally to short day lengths by entering diapause. However, predacious mites fedfor two generations on eggs of albino spider mites, which are completely devoid of carotenoids, did not respond to short-day photoperiods. Apparently carotenoids are essential for photoperiodic induction; possibly a carotenoid or carotenoid derivative functions as the photopigment concerned in photoperiodic light reception in these mites."
https://openalex.org/W2071216509,"Teeth of mastodons and mammoths have been recovered by fishermen from at least 40 sites on the continental shelf as deep as 120 meters. Also present are submerged shorelines, peat deposits, lagoonal shells, anz relict sands. Evidently elephants and other large mammals ranged this region during the glacial stage of low sea level of the last 25,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2048367268,Recent laboratory and observational data support the hypothesis that the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is consistent with the relative abundances of the elements found in the sun. A model based on this assumption provides a reasonable interpretation of abundances of hydrogen and other gases obtained from studies of various regions of the planet's spectrum. Two presently unidentified absorptions may be caused by organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W2074655031,"Short-term power spectra of the fluctuations in the precipitable water vapor measured with a dual-channel microwave radiometer are presented. The spectra, taken over 34-hour sampling periods, encompass periodicities from I day to about 10 minutes. The fluctuation power is associated with the average precipitable water vapor for the sampling period. The background noise spectrum of the radiometric instrument is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2023472134,"Neolithic cemeteries in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces from about 5000 to 2000 B.C. show increases in the mean numbers of burial goods, goods found with males, and tools used as grave goods; separation of burial localities; differentiation of sets of tools found with males and females; a decrease in goods found with children; and common ornaments found with males and females. The distribution of tools seems to reflect a sexual division, with an increase in the prominence of males which may be associated with intensification of cultivation. Emergence of ranking is suggested by very rich graves and ornaments shared by males and females. Chinese theories of cultural evolution are introduced."
https://openalex.org/W2034550525,"During an almost yearlong period of observations made with a current meter in the fracture zone between the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia, several overflow events were recorded at a depth of 3000 meters carrying cold bottom water from the Scotia Sea into the Argentine Basin. The outflow bursts of Scotia Sea bottom water, a mixing product of Weddell Sea and eastern Pacific bottom water, were associated with typical speeds of more than 28 centimeters per second toward the northwest and characteristic temperatures below 0.6 degrees C. The maximum 24-hour average speed of 65 centimeters per second, together with a temperature of 0.29 degrees C, was encountered on 14 November 1980 at a water depth of 2973 meters, 35 meters above the sea floor."
https://openalex.org/W1987595475,"Carbon unusually rich in C13(δC13 = +5.4 to +19.0 per mil relative to the Peedee belemnite carbonate standard of the University of Chicago) is characteristic of certain diagenetic limestones and dolomites in the Miocene Monterey Shale of California and the Nye Mudstone of Oregon. This heavy carbon may have originated through low-temperature equilibration between CO3- - and CO2 in migrating carbonated waters or between CH4 and CO2 in natural gas. Light carbon (δC13 = -5.6 to -18.2 per mil) derived through nonequilibrium oxidation of organic matter also occurs in the carbonate of Monterey Shale in some localities, but at most places it is much less common than heavy carbon."
