https://openalex.org/W3004369136,"Alteration of gut microbiome composition has been linked to cardiovascular diseases. To identify specific bacterial communities associated with coronary artery diseases (CAD), we conducted a case-control study with 53 advanced CAD patients and 53 age-, sex-, race-, and BMI-matched controls. V3-V5 regions of the 16S rDNA from the fecal gut material were analyzed to compare the gut microbiome composition between CAD patients and controls. The alpha diversity, including Chao-1, Shannon-index, and the number of observed taxonomy units were significantly decreased in CAD patients indicating, decreased richness and evenness of gut microbiome. Among 23 different abundant taxa at the genus level, 12 taxa belonged to Lachnospiraceae family, which are known to produce butyrate. Further, we identified five taxa which showed more than two log-fold changes with maximum proportion >0.002, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Lachnospiraceae anaerosporobacter, Lachnospiraceae NK4B4 group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii. After adjustment for coronary risk factors (diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia), decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4B4 group and Ruminococcus Gauvreauii and increased relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus were associated with the presence of advanced CAD. The observed differences in taxa between CAD patients and controls in this study may provide insight into the link between the gut microbiome and CAD."
https://openalex.org/W3004368032,"To prospectively assess perceptions of abortion stigma after receiving or being denied an abortion over 5 years, the factors associated with perceived abortion stigma, and the effects of perceived abortion stigma on psychological well-being.We recruited people seeking abortion from 30 facilities across the US, and interviewed them by phone one week post-abortion seeking, then semiannually for 5 years. We used adjusted mixed effects regression analyses to examine the abortion stigma trajectories of those who obtained an abortion near a facility's gestational age limit (Near-limits) compared to those denied an abortion because they were just over the limit and carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway-births).Of the 956 people recruited, we removed 28 due to ineligibility or missing data, leaving a final sample of 928. In unadjusted analyses, at one-week post-abortion seeking, over half of those seeking abortion perceived that if others knew they had sought an abortion, they would be looked down upon at least ""a little bit"" by people close to them (60%) or by people in their community (56%). In longitudinal adjusted analyses, people denied an abortion and who carried their pregnancies to term (Turnaway-birth group) reported significantly lower baseline perceived abortion stigma from people close to them (-0.38; 95% CI, -0.59, -0.16) and from people in their community (0.30; 95% CI, -0.52, -0.08), than Near-limits, differences that remained statistically significant for 1.5 years. Overall perceived abortion stigma declined significantly (p < .001) for both study groups. High perceived abortion stigma at baseline was associated with higher odds of experiencing psychological distress years later (adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.39, 11.37).Most people considering abortion perceive some abortion stigma, which is associated with psychological distress years later."
https://openalex.org/W3003433309,"Background The psychological health (PH) of doctors affects the quality of medical service and is related to the safety of patients. The serious problems with the doctor-patient relationship in China can lead to long-term imbalances in doctor PH, and the poor PH status of doctors has raised scholars’ concern. Current research mainly focuses on how factors such as social support and the impact of the residential environment correlate with individual PH. We continue this direction of research to see how the mechanism of social support impacts physician PH, also investigating the moderating effect of demographic indicators on physician PH. Methods Based on a survey of 399 physicians, a descriptive analysis of measured data was done using SPSS 19.0. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the correlations between PH and the social support rating scale (SSRS) and the demographic variables. KMO and Bartlett methods were used to examine the correlations between PH and SDS (a scale to measure depression) and between PH and SAS (a scale to measure anxiety). The method of factor analysis was used for multicollinearity tests, and multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the demographic factors correlated with PH and SSRS. Two-way interactions in moderated multiple regression were used to test the moderating effect of education level and title on SSRS, SDS, and SAS. Results Our results indicate that the level of PH is influenced by the age, education, and title of a doctor. A physician’s title is significantly and positively correlated with PH, but age and education are significantly negatively related. Age, education, and title also affect the level of SSRS in physicians. SSRS is positively correlated with age, education, and title, and SSRS positively influences PH. Education and title had significant effects on the moderating influences of SSRS, SDS, SAS, and PH. Conclusion The factors directly affecting PH include SSRS, age, and title, while education was found to be an indirect influencing factor. To meet goals expressed in Chinese government policy related to these issues, we suggest strengthening the guidance of the media, introducing laws and regulations on doctor-patient risk management and control, reforming the review mechanism of hospital job titles, improving the education level of doctors, building a comprehensive evaluation system of “practice performance + doctor-patient satisfaction”, and strengthening doctor-patient empathy. Through such measures, the level of PH in physicians will improve."
https://openalex.org/W3003587598,"Assessment of functional independence and residual disability is very important for measuring treatment outcome after stroke. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the modified Barthel Index (MBI) are commonly used scales to measure disability or dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke survivors. Lack of consensus regarding MBI score categories has caused confusion in interpreting stroke outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify the optimal corresponding MBI and modified Rankin scale (mRS) grades for categorization of MBI. The Korean versions of the MBI (K-MBI) and mRS were collected from 5,759 stroke patients at 3 months after onset of stroke. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated at K-MBI score cutoffs for each mRS grade to obtain optimally corresponding K-MBI scores and mRS grades. We also plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of sensitivity and specificity and determined the area under the curve (AUC). The K-MBI cutoff points with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity were 100 (sensitivity 0.940; specificity 0.612), 98 (sensitivity 0.904; specificity 0.838), 94 (sensitivity 0.885; specificity 0.937), 78 (sensitivity 0.946; specificity, 0.973), and 55 (sensitivity 937; specificity 0.986) for mRS grades 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. From this result, the K-MBI cutoff score range for each mRS grade can be obtained. For mRS grade 0, the K-MBI cutoff score is 100, indicating no associated score range. For mRS grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the K-MBI score ranges is from 99 to 98, 97 to 94, 93 to 78, 77 to 55, and under 54, respectively.The AUC for the ROC curve was 0.791 for mRS grade 0, 0.919 for mRS grade 1, 0.970 for mRS grade 2, 0.0 for mRS grade 3, and 0.991 for mRS grade 4. The K-MBI cutoff score ranges for representing mRS grades were variable; mRS grades 0, 1, and 2 had narrow K-MBI score ranges, while mRS grades 3, 4, and 5 exhibited broad K-MBI score ranges. mRS grade seemed to sensitively differentiate mild residual disability of stroke survivors, whereas K-MBI provided more specific information of the functional status of stroke survivors with moderate to severe residual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3004116735,"Resistance to chemotherapy represents a major obstacle to the successful treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of this study was to determine how PIM kinases impact mitochondrial dynamics, ROS production, and response to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Live-cell imaging and microscopy were used to determine the effect of PIM loss or inhibition on mitochondrial phenotype and ROS. Inhibition of PIM kinases caused excessive mitochondrial fission and significant upregulation of mitochondrial superoxide, increasing intracellular ROS. Mechanistically, we define a signaling axis linking PIM1 to Drp1 and mitochondrial fission in lung cancer. PIM inhibition significantly increased the protein levels and mitochondrial localization of Drp1, causing marked fragmentation of mitochondria. An inverse correlation between PIM1 and Drp1 was confirmed in NSCLC patient samples. Inhibition of PIM sensitized NSCLC cells to chemotherapy and produced a synergistic antitumor response in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy verified that PIM inhibitors promote mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in vivo. These data improve our knowledge about how PIM1 regulates mitochondria and provide justification for combining PIM inhibition with chemotherapy in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3003518127,"Genetic ancestry testing is a billion-dollar industry, with more than 26 million tests sold by 2018, which raises concerns over how it might influence test-takers’ understandings of race. While social scientists argue that genetic ancestry tests may promote an essentialist view of race as fixed and determining innate abilities, others suggest it could reduce essentialist views by reinforcing a view of race as socially constructed. Essentialist views are a concern because of their association with racism, particularly in its most extreme forms. Here we report the first randomized controlled trial of genetic ancestry testing conducted to examine potential causal relationships between taking the tests and essentialist views of race. Native-born White Americans were randomly assigned to receive Admixture and mtDNA tests or no tests. While we find no significant average effect of genetic ancestry testing on essentialism, secondary analyses reveal that the impact of these tests on racial essentialism varies by type of genetic knowledge. Within the treatment arm, essentialist beliefs significantly declined after testing among individuals with high genetic knowledge, but increased among those with the least genetic knowledge. Additional secondary analysis show that essentialist beliefs do not change based on the specific ancestries reported in test-takers’ results. These results indicate that individuals’ interpretations of genetic ancestry testing results, and the links between genes and race, may depend on their understanding of genetics."
https://openalex.org/W3003581481,"Prosthetic vision is being applied to partially recover the retinal stimulation of visually impaired people. However, the phosphenic images produced by the implants have very limited information bandwidth due to the poor resolution and lack of color or contrast. The ability of object recognition and scene understanding in real environments is severely restricted for prosthetic users. Computer vision can play a key role to overcome the limitations and to optimize the visual information in the prosthetic vision, improving the amount of information that is presented. We present a new approach to build a schematic representation of indoor environments for simulated phosphene images. The proposed method combines a variety of convolutional neural networks for extracting and conveying relevant information about the scene such as structural informative edges of the environment and silhouettes of segmented objects. Experiments were conducted with normal sighted subjects with a Simulated Prosthetic Vision system. The results show good accuracy for object recognition and room identification tasks for indoor scenes using the proposed approach, compared to other image processing methods."
https://openalex.org/W3003311619,"A better understanding of deforestation drivers across countries and spatial scales is a precondition for designing efficient international policies and coherent land use planning strategies such as REDD+. However, it is so far unclear if the well-studied drivers of tropical deforestation behave similarly across nested subnational jurisdictions, which is crucial for efficient policy implementation. We selected three countries in Africa, America and Asia, which present very different tropical contexts. Making use of spatial econometrics and a multi-level approach, we conducted a set of regressions comprising 3,035 administrative units from the three countries at micro-level, plus 361 and 49 at meso- and macro-level, respectively. We included forest cover as dependent variable and seven physio-geographic and socioeconomic indicators of well-known drivers of deforestation as explanatory variables. With this, we could provide a first set of highly significant econometric models of pantropical deforestation that consider subnational units. We identified recurrent drivers across countries and scales, namely population pressure and the natural condition of land suitability for crop production. The impacts of demography on forest cover were strikingly strong across contexts, suggesting clear limitations of sectoral policy. Our findings also revealed scale and context dependencies, such as an increased heterogeneity at local scopes, with a higher and more diverse number of significant determinants of forest cover. Additionally, we detected stronger spatial interactions at smaller levels, providing empirical evidence that certain deforestation forces occur independently of the existing de jure governance boundaries. We demonstrated that neglecting spatial dependencies in this type of studies can lead to several misinterpretations. We therefore advocate, that the design and enforcement of policy instruments—such as REDD+—should start from common international entry points that ensure for coherent agricultural and demographic policies. In order to achieve a long-term impact on the ground, these policies need to have enough flexibility to be modified and adapted to specific national, regional or local conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3004068963,"Techno-biofunctional characteristics of nanoemulsion and (nano)emulgel loaded with mangostin extracts were elucidated. Crude mangostins from mangosteen peels recovered by virgin coconut oil (VCO), mixed VCO and propylene glycol (PG), and pure PG were used. The extracts were loaded in the dispersed phase in the presence of mixed surfactants (Tween20/Span20) with a varying hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) from 10.2 to 15.1. Results showed that globular and uniformly distributed droplets of the nanoemulsion were observed. The small particle sizes (typically 18-62 nm) with the zeta potential of -39 to -54.5 mV were obtained when mixed emulsifiers with HLB values of 12.6 and 15.1 were employed. With HLB values of 12.6 and 15.1, nanoemulsions loaded with mangostin extracts prepared with mixed VCO-PG and pure PG-based extracts showed approximately a 2 to 3-fold lower droplet size diameter when compared with the VCO-based extract. For the stability test, all nanoemulsions were stable over three freeze-thaw cycles with some changes in pH, zeta potential, and droplet size. The DPPH● scavenging activity, H2O2 scavenging activity, reducing power and antibacterial activities (E. coli and S. aureus) of the nanoemulsions were greater than their corresponding bulk extracts. Nanoemulgels produced by embedding the nanoemulsions in a hydrogel matrix was homogeneous and creamy yellow-white in appearance. The nanoemulgels had a higher mangostin release (87-92%) than their normal emulgels (74-78%). Therefore, this study presented the feasibility of nanoemulsions and nanoemulgels loaded with mangostin extracts as a promising delivery system for bioactive polyphenol in food supplements, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."
https://openalex.org/W3004263591,"BACKGROUND We conducted a literature review on the studies that investigated the relationship of preterm birth, including spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), with vitamin D status. Overall, these studies demonstrated that the incidence of sPTB was associated with maternal vitamin D insufficiency in early pregnancy. However, the potential mechanisms and biological pathways are unknown. OBJECTIVES To investigate early pregnancy gene expression signatures associated with both vitamin D insufficiency and sPTB. We further constructed a network of these gene signatures and identified the common biological pathways involved. STUDY DESIGN We conducted peripheral blood transcriptome profiling at 10-18 weeks of gestation in a nested case-control cohort of 24 pregnant women who participated in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART). In this cohort, 8 women had spontaneous preterm delivery (21-32 weeks of gestation) and 17 women had vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 30 ng/mL). We separately identified vitamin D-associated and sPTB gene signatures at 10 to 18 weeks and replicated the overlapping signatures in the mid-pregnancy peripheral blood of an independent cohort with sPTB cases. RESULT At 10-18 weeks of gestation, 146 differentially expressed genes (25 upregulated) were associated with both vitamin D insufficiency and sPTB in the discovery cohort (FDR < 0.05). Of these genes, 43 (25 upregulated) were replicated in the independent cohort of sPTB cases and controls with normal pregnancies (P < 0.05). Functional enrichment and network analyses of the replicated gene signatures suggested several highly connected nodes related to inflammatory and immune responses. CONCLUSIONS Our gene expression study and network analyses suggest that the dysregulation of immune response pathways due to early pregnancy vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to the pathobiology of sPTB."
https://openalex.org/W3003893050,"Introduction Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in sub-Saharan Africa and requires ongoing monitoring. The burden of both infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases is high and medicines used to treat comorbidities may interact with warfarin. We describe service provision, patient characteristics, and anticoagulation control at selected anticoagulation clinics in Uganda and South Africa. Methods We evaluated two outpatient anticoagulation services in Kampala, Uganda and three in Cape Town, South Africa between 1 January and 31 July 2018. We collected information from key staff members about the clinics’ service provision and extracted demographic and clinical data from a sample of patients’ clinic records. We calculated time in therapeutic range (TTR) over the most recent 3-month period using the Rosendaal interpolation method. Results We included three tertiary level, one secondary level and one primary level anticoagulation service, seeing between 30 and 800 patients per month. Care was rendered by nurses, medical officers, and specialists. All healthcare facilities had on-site pharmacies; laboratory INR testing was off-site at two. Three clinics used warfarin dose-adjustment protocols; these were not validated for local use. We reviewed 229 patient clinical records. Most common indications for warfarin were venous thrombo-embolism in 112/229 (49%), atrial fibrillation in 74/229 (32%) and valvular heart disease in 30/229 (13%). Patients were generally followed up monthly. HIV prevalence was 20% and 5% at Ugandan and South African clinics respectively. Cardiovascular comorbidity predominated. Furosemide, paracetamol, enalapril, simvastatin, and tramadol were the most common concomitant drugs. Anticoagulation control was poor at all included clinics with median TTR of 41% (interquartile range 14% to 69%). Conclusions TTR was suboptimal at all included sites, despite frequent patient follow-up. Strategies to improve INR control in sub-Saharan patients taking warfarin are needed. Locally validated warfarin dosing algorithms in Uganda and South Africa may improve INR control."
https://openalex.org/W3003548082,"The Karoo igneous rocks represent one of the largest continental flood basalt events (by volume) on Earth, and are not normally associated with fossils remains. However, these Pliensbachian-Toarcian lava flows contain sandstone interbeds that are particularly common in the lower part of the volcanic succession and are occasionally fossiliferous. On a sandstone interbed in the northern main Karoo Basin, we discovered twenty-five tridactyl and tetradactyl vertebrate tracks comprising five trackways. The tracks are preserved among desiccation cracks and low-amplitude, asymmetrical ripple marks, implying deposition in low energy, shallow, ephemeral water currents. Based on footprint lengths of 2-14 cm and trackway patterns, the trackmakers were both bipedal and quadrupedal animals of assorted sizes with walking and running gaits. We describe the larger tridactyl tracks as ""grallatorid"" and attribute them to bipedal theropod dinosaurs, like Coelophysis, a genus common in the Early Jurassic of southern Africa. The smallest tracks are tentatively interpreted as Brasilichnium-like tracks, which are linked to synapsid trackmakers, a common attribution of similar tracks from the Lower to Middle Jurassic record of southern and southwestern Gondwana. The trackway of an intermediate-sized quadruped reveals strong similarities in morphometric parameters to a post-Karoo Zimbabwean trackway from Chewore. These trackways are classified here as a new ichnogenus attributable to small ornithischian dinosaurs as yet without a body fossil record in southern Africa. These tracks not only suggest that dinosaurs and therapsids survived the onset of the Drakensberg volcanism, but also that theropods, ornithischians and synapsids were among the last vertebrates that inhabited the main Karoo Basin some 183 Ma ago. Although these vertebrates survived the first Karoo volcanic eruptions, their rapidly dwindling habitat was turned into a land of fire as it was covered by the outpouring lavas during one of the most dramatic geological episodes in southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3003739297,"Christians are one of the most underrepresented groups in science, and one potential explanation is that scientists have a bias against Christian students, which could discourage and actively prevent Christian students from becoming scientists. Although there is a general perception in society that there is bias against Christians in science, we do not know whether science students, who frequently interact with scientists, perceive this bias. Further, no researchers have attempted to experimentally document the existence of bias against Christians in science. To address these gaps in the literature, we designed three studies. In the first study, we found that college science students report a perceived bias against Christians in science and that evangelical Christians perceive greater bias than Catholic and non-Christian students. Then in two studies, biology professors evaluated Ph.D. program applicants and we examined whether the professors rated a student less favorably when the student revealed a Christian religious identity. We found no statistically significant differences in how biology professors rated a student who was President of the Christian Association compared to a student who was President of the Atheist Association or a student who was President of the Activities Association. However, in Study 3, biology professors did rate a Christian student who went on a mission trip with Campus Crusade for Christ as less hireable, less competent, and less likeable than a student who did not reveal a Christian identity. Taken together, these studies indicate that perceived bias against Christians in science may contribute to underrepresentation of Christians but actual bias against Christians in science may be restricted to a specific type of Christianity that scientists call fundamentalist and/or evangelical."
https://openalex.org/W3003928458,"Theba pisana is a serious snail pest in many parts of the world and affects diverse crops including grain, vegetables, grapevines, and ornamental plants and shrubs. Due to its gregarious nature, ability to reproduce rapidly, and the difficulty of controlling it by conventional methods, it has the potential to become a significant pest where introduced. Mitigating this pest is an important challenge that must be addressed. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, is a gastropod-killing nematode that is commercially available only in Europe (Nemaslug ®) and Sub-Saharan Africa (Slugtech ® SP). The use of effective gastropod-killing nematodes in the genus Phasmarhabditis (P. hermaphrodita, P. californica and P. papillosa) in California may provide one strategy for alleviating the potential damage and further spread of these snails, which are currently limited to San Diego and Los Angeles counties. Laboratory assays demonstrated for the first time that US isolates of P. hermaphrodita, P. californica and P. papillosa at 150 DJs/cm2 caused significant mortality and are equally lethal to T. pisana. Molluscicidal efficacy of these nematodes are comparable with those of iron phosphate, at the recommended high dose of 4.88 kg/m2. Additional trials are needed to determine their effects at lower dose and whether they are dependent on the size or age of the snails."
https://openalex.org/W3004062019,"Introduction Hospital based studies for psychotic disorders are scarce in low and middle income countries. This may impact on development of intervention programs. Objective We aimed to determine the burden of psychotic disorders among first treatment contact patients at the national psychiatric referral hospital in Uganda. Methods A retrospective patient chart-file review was carried out in March 2019 for all patients presenting to the hospital for the first time in the previous year. Patients were categorised into those with and without psychotic disorders. We collected sociodemographic data on age, gender, occupation, level of education, ethnicity, religion and home district. We determined the one year prevalence of psychotic disorders among first treatment contact patients. Using logistic regression models, we also determined the association between psychotic disorders and various exposure variables among first treatment contact patients. Results In 2018, 63% (95% CI: 60.2–65.1) of all first time contact patients had a psychosis related diagnosis. Among the patients with psychotic disorders, the median age was 29 years (IQR 24–36). Most of the patients were male (62.8%) and unemployed (63.1%). After adjusting for patients’ residence, psychotic disorders were found to be more prevalent among the female gender [OR 1.58 (CI1.46–1.72)] and those of Pentecostal faith [OR 1.25 (CI 1.10–1.42)]. Conclusion Among first treatment contact patients in Uganda, there is a large burden of psychotic disorders. The burden was more prevalent among females as well as people of Pentecostal faith who seemed to use their church for faith-based healing. Incidence studies are warranted to determine if this phenomenon is replicated at illness onset."
https://openalex.org/W3003341733,"The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) in Australia underwent major changes on December 1st, 2017. The program changed from 2-yearly Pap testing for women aged 18–69 years to 5-yearly HPV testing for women aged 25–74 years including differential management pathways for oncogenic HPV 16/18 positive versus HPV non16/18 positive test results and the option of self-collection for under-screened women. We conducted a survey among cervical screening providers in primary care to assess their level of preparedness in undertaking cervical screening before (pre-renewal) and after (post-renewal) the new program was implemented. Surveys were conducted between 14th August and 30th November 2017 (pre-renewal) and 9th February and 26th October 2018 (post-renewal) among cervical screening providers who attended education sessions related to the new guidelines. Preparedness was assessed in three areas: 1) level of comfort implementing the new guidelines (7 questions), 2) level of confidence in their ability to convey information about the new guidelines (9 questions) and 3) level of agreement regarding access to resources to support implementation (11 questions). Proportions were calculated for each question response and pre- and post-renewal periods compared using generalised linear models. Open-ended questions related to anticipated barriers and ways to overcome barriers were also included in the questionnaires. Compared to the pre-renewal period, a higher proportion of practitioners in the post-renewal period were more comfortable offering routine screening to women ≥25 years (p = 0.005) and more confident explaining the rationale for not screening before 25 years (p = 0.015); confident explaining a positive HPV 16/18 (p = 0.04) and HPV non 16/18(p = 0.013) test result and were comfortable with not referring women with a positive HPV non 16/18 test result and low grade/negative cytology for colposcopy (p = 0.01). A higher proportion of Victorian practitioners in the post-renewal period sample were also comfortable (p = 0.04) and confident (p = 0.015) recommending self-collection to under-screened women and agreed that self-collection is a reliable test (p = 0.003). The most commonly reported suggestion was to provide information, education and communication materials to both patients and practitioners. Compared to the pre-renewal period, practitioners in the post-renewal period were better prepared to implement the renewed screening program. Healthcare providers require further support to implement the self-collection pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3003281674,"Oxidative stress in humans is related to various pathophysiological processes, which can manifest in numerous diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease. On the atomistic level, oxidative stress causes posttranslational modifications, thus inducing structural and functional changes into the proteins structure. This study focuses on fibrinogen, a blood plasma protein that is frequently targeted by reagents causing posttranslational modifications in proteins. Fibrinogen was in vitro modified by three reagents, namely sodium hypochlorite, malondialdehyde, and 3-morpholinosydnonimine that mimic the oxidative stress in diseases. Newly induced posttranslational modifications were detected via mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy was used to visualize changes in the fibrin networks, which highlight the extent of disturbances in fibrinogen behavior after exposure to reagents. We used molecular dynamics simulations to observe the impact of selected posttranslational modifications on the fibrinogen structure at the atomistic level. In total, 154 posttranslational modifications were identified, 84 of them were in fibrinogen treated with hypochlorite, 51 resulted from a reaction of fibrinogen with malondialdehyde, and 19 were caused by 3-morpholinosydnonimine. Our data reveal that the stronger reagents induce more posttranslational modifications in the fibrinogen structure than the weaker ones, and they extensively alter the architecture of the fibrin network. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the effect of posttranslational modifications on fibrinogen secondary structure varies from negligible alternations to serious disruptions. Among the serious disruptions is the oxidation of γR375 resulting in the release of Ca2+ ion that is necessary for appropriate fibrin fiber formation. Folding of amino acids γE72–γN77 into a short α-helix is a result of oxidation of γP76 to glutamic acid. The study describes behaviour of fibrinogen coiled-coil connecter in the vicinity of plasmin and hementin cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W3003439680,"Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth (PTB). This has not been studied in Puerto Rico, an area with high PTB rates. Our objective was to develop a conceptual model describing the interrelationships between measures of psychosocial stress and depression, a result of stress, among pregnant women in Puerto Rico and to examine their associations with PTB. We used data from the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats pregnancy cohort (PROTECT, N = 1,047) to examine associations among depression and different continuous measures of psychosocial stress using path analysis. Psychosocial stress during pregnancy was assessed using validated measures of perceived stress, negative life experiences, neighborhood perceptions and social support. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between psychosocial stress measures in tertiles and PTB. Perceived stress, negative life experiences, and neighborhood perceptions influenced depression through multiple pathways. Our model indicated that perceived stress had the strongest direct effect on depression, where one standard deviation (SD) increase in perceived stress was associated with a 57% SD increase in depression. Negative life experiences were directly but also indirectly, through perceived stress, associated with depression. Finally, neighborhood perceptions directly influenced negative life experiences and perceived stress and consequently had an indirect effect on depression. Psychosocial stress was not associated with PTB across any of the measures examined. Our study examined interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial stress and depression among a pregnant Puerto Rican population and identified negative neighborhood perceptions as important upstream factors leading to depression. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between psychosocial stress measures and indicate that psychosocial stress and depression, assessed using 5 different scales, were not associated with PTB. Future research should investigate other environmental and behavioral risk factors contributing to higher rates of PTB in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3003682200,"Notch receptors play critical roles in cell-fate decisions and in the regulation of skeletal development and bone remodeling. Gain–of–function NOTCH2 mutations can cause Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, an untreatable disease characterized by osteoporosis and fractures, craniofacial developmental abnormalities, and acro-osteolysis. We have previously created a mouse model harboring a point 6955C→T mutation in the Notch2 locus upstream of the PEST domain, and we termed this model Notch2tm1.1Ecan. Heterozygous Notch2tm1.1Ecan mutant mice exhibit severe cancellous and cortical bone osteopenia due to increased bone resorption. In this work, we demonstrate that the subcutaneous administration of Notch2 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) down-regulates Notch2 and the Notch target genes Hes-related family basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor with YRPW motif 1 (Hey1), Hey2, and HeyL in skeletal tissue from Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice. Results of microcomputed tomography experiments indicated that the administration of Notch2 ASOs ameliorates the cancellous osteopenia of Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice, and bone histomorphometry analysis revealed decreased osteoclast numbers in Notch2 ASO-treated Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice. Notch2 ASOs decreased the induction of mRNA levels of TNF superfamily member 11 (Tnfsf11, encoding the osteoclastogenic protein RANKL) in cultured osteoblasts and osteocytes from Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures from the Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice displayed enhanced osteoclastogenesis, which was suppressed by Notch2 ASOs. In conclusion, Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice exhibit cancellous bone osteopenia that can be ameliorated by systemic administration of Notch2 ASOs."

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of these personality traits as resilience or risk factors, respectively, in diabetes self-management and glycaemic control. Further, it was examined whether diabetes-specific self-efficacy could serve as a mediator of these relationships. Design/Measures Data of 77 participants with type 2 diabetes was ascertained, using self-report instruments for NFC, impulsivity, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and diabetes self-management. Glycemic control was assessed by the biomarker HbA1c. Results While NFC was strongly positively associated with diabetes self-management and glycemic control, impulsivity showed a reverse pattern. Results of simple and serial mediation models showed that the effects on diabetes self-management and HbA1c of both, impulsivity and NFC, were mediated by self-efficacy. Conclusion The moderate to high standardized coefficients suggests that NFC might be an important protective factor and impulsivity a possible risk factor for effective diabetes self-management and glycemic control. These traits could be applied for an easy-to-use questionnaire-based patient screening, enabling trait-tailored treatments and programs which in turn may lower economic and health costs associated with poor diabetes-care."

The objective was to determine the extent to which maternal nutrition interventions commenced before conception or in the 1st trimester improved fetal growth in this region. This was a secondary analysis of combined newborn anthropometric data for the South Asian sites (India and Pakistan) in the Women First Preconception Maternal Nutrition Trial. Participants were 972 newborn of mothers who were poor, rural, unselected on basis of nutritional status, and had been randomized to receive a daily lipid-based micronutrient supplement commencing ≥3 months prior to conception (Arm 1), in the 1st trimester (Arm 2), or not at all (Arm 3). An additional protein-energy supplement was provided if BMI <20 kg/m2 or gestational weight gain was less than guidelines. Gestational age was established in the 1st trimester and newborn anthropometry obtained <48-hours post-delivery. Mean differences at birth between Arm 1 vs. 3 were length +5.3mm and weight +89g. Effect sizes (ES) and relative risks (RR) with 95% CI for Arm 1 vs. 3 were: length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) +0.29 (0.11-0.46, p = 0.0011); weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) +0.22 (0.07-0.37, p = 0.0043); weight-to-length-ratio-for-age Z-score (WLRAZ) +0.27 (0.06-0.48, p = 0.0133); LAZ<-2, 0.56 (0.38-0.82, p = 0.0032); WAZ <-2, 0.68 (0.53-0.88, p = 0.0028); WLRAZ <-2, 0.76 (0.64-0.89, p = 0.0011); small-for-gestational-age (SGA), 0.74 (0.66-0.83, p<0.0001); low birth weight 0.81 (0.66-1.00, p = 0.0461). For Arm 2 vs. 3, LAZ, 0.21 (0.04-0.38); WAZ <-2, 0.70 (0.53-0.92); and SGA, 0.88 (0.79-0.97) were only marginally different. ES or RR did not differ for preterm birth for either Arm 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 3. In conclusion, point estimates for both continuous and binary anthropometric outcomes were consistently more favorable when maternal nutrition supplements were commenced ≥3 months prior to conception indicating benefits to fetal growth of improving women's nutrition in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3003391244,"Spectrophotometers are commonly used to measure the concentrations of a wide variety of analytes in drinking water and other matrixes; however, many laboratories with limited resources cannot afford to buy these very useful instruments. To meet this need, an accurate, precise, and affordable light emitting diode (LED) spectrophotometer was designed and built using best engineering practices and modern circuit design. The cost and performance of this LED spectrophotometer was compared against 4 common commercial spectrophotometers. More specifically, the performance of these spectrophotometers was evaluated from the upper limits of linear range, upper limits of operational range, calibration sensitivities, R2 values, precisions of standards, estimated limits of detection, and percent calibration check standard recoveries for the determinations of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and fluoride (F-) in drinking water. This evaluation was done in the United States (U.S.) and India. Our LED spectrophotometer costs $63 United States Dollars (USD) for parts. The 4 commercial spectrophotometers ranged in cost from $2,424 to $7,644 USD. There are no practical differences in the upper limits of linear range, upper limits of operational range, R2 values, precisions of standards, and estimated limits of detection for our LED spectrophotometer and the 4 commercial spectrophotometers. For 2 of the 3 analytes, there is a practical difference in the calibration sensitivities our LED spectrophotometer and the 4 commercial spectrophotometers. More specifically, the calibration sensitivities for Mn and F- using our LED spectrophotometer were 65.2% and 67.0% of those using the 4 commercial spectrophotometers, respectively. In conclusion, this paper describes the design, use, and performance of an accurate, precise, and extremely affordable LED spectrophotometer for drinking water and other testing with limited resources."

Nonclassical (class-Ib) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (MHC-Ibs) have recently been identified as ligands for the CD8αα homodimer. This was demonstrated by the observation that histocompatibility 2, Q region locus 10 (H2-Q10) is a high-affinity ligand for CD8αα which also binds the MHC-Ib molecule H2-TL. This suggests that MHC-Ib proteins may be an extended source of CD8αα ligands. Expression of H2-T3/TL and H2-Q10 is restricted to the small intestine and liver, respectively, yet CD8αα-containing lymphocytes are present more broadly. Therefore, here we sought to determine whether murine CD8αα binds only to tissue-specific MHC-Ib molecules or also to ubiquitously expressed MHC-Ib molecules. Using recombinant proteins and surface plasmon resonance–based binding assays, we show that the MHC-Ib family furnishes multiple binding partners for murine CD8αα, including H2-T22 and the CD94/NKG2-A/B-activating NK receptor (NKG2) ligand Qa-1b. We also demonstrate a hierarchy among MHC-Ib proteins with respect to CD8αα binding, in which Qa-1b > H2-Q10 > TL. Finally, we provide evidence that Qa-1b is a functional ligand for CD8αα, distinguishing it from its human homologue MHC class I antigen E (HLA-E). These findings provide additional clues as to how CD8αα-expressing cells are controlled in different tissues. They also highlight an unexpected immunological divergence of Qa-1b/HLA-E function, indicating the need for more robust studies of murine MHC-Ib proteins as models for human disease.

https://openalex.org/W3003954402,"In our daily life we often make complex actions comprised of linked movements, such as reaching for a cup of coffee and bringing it to our mouth to drink. Recent work has highlighted the role of such linked movements in the formation of independent motor memories, affecting the learning rate and ability to learn opposing force fields. In these studies, distinct prior movements (lead-in movements) allow adaptation of opposing dynamics on the following movement. Purely visual or purely passive lead-in movements exhibit different angular generalization functions of this motor memory as the lead-in movements are modified, suggesting different neural representations. However, we currently have no understanding of how different movement kinematics (distance, speed or duration) affect this recall process and the formation of independent motor memories. Here we investigate such kinematic generalization for both passive and visual lead-in movements to probe their individual characteristics. After participants adapted to opposing force fields using training lead-in movements, the lead-in kinematics were modified on random trials to test generalization. For both visual and passive modalities, recalled compensation was sensitive to lead-in duration and peak speed, falling off away from the training condition. However, little reduction in force was found with increasing lead-in distance. Interestingly, asymmetric transfer between lead-in movement modalities was also observed, with partial transfer from passive to visual, but very little vice versa. Overall these tuning effects were stronger for passive compared to visual lead-ins demonstrating the difference in these sensory inputs in regulating motor memories. Our results suggest these effects are a consequence of state estimation, with differences across modalities reflecting their different levels of sensory uncertainty arising as a consequence of dissimilar feedback delays."
https://openalex.org/W3003678805,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Pneumococcal vaccination is part of the South African pediatric public immunization program but the potential cost-effectiveness of such an intervention for adults is unknown. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of two widely used pneumococcal vaccines: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in South African adults, 18 years and older. Four analyses were carried out in a) both the private and public health care sectors; and b) for the HIV-infected population alone and for the total mixed population (all HIV-infected and -uninfected people). A previously published global pharmacoeconomic model was adapted and populated to represent the South African adult population. The model utilized a Markov-type process to depict the lifetime clinical and economic outcomes of patients who acquire pneumococcal disease in 2015, from a societal perspective. Costs were sourced in South African rand and converted to US dollar (USD). The incremental cost divided by the incremental effectiveness (expressed as quality-adjusted life years gained) represented the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCV13 compared to PPSV23. Results indicated that the use of PCV13 compared to PPSV23 is highly cost-effective in the public sector cohorts with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $771 (R11,106)/quality-adjusted life year and $956 (R13,773)/quality-adjusted life year for the HIV-infected and mixed populations, respectively. The private sector cohort showed similar highly cost-effective results for the mixed population (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $626 (R9,013)/quality-adjusted life year) and the HIV-infected cohort (dominant). In sensitivity analysis, the model was sensitive to vaccine price and effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses found predominantly cost-effective ICERs. From a societal perspective, these findings provide some guidance to policy makers for consideration and implementation of an immunization strategy for both the public and private sector and amongst different adult patient pools in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3003801967,"Introduction Waiting is inevitable for customers of service organizations, yet having to wait can trigger aggression by care receivers toward hospital staff. We explore the effect of waiting times on care receivers’ sense of procedural justice and aggressive tendencies, and show the attenuating effects of providing explanatory information. Methods Data were collected using survey responses in two studies, both conducted in the waiting area of a large hospital emergency department. Study 1 (n = 328) was a quasi-experiment involving an intervention in which care receivers were provided with information about wait times. Study 1 included three phases: (1) pre-test (week 1, n = 98), in which no information was provided; (2) information condition (weeks 2 & 3, n = 155), in which information was provided through large signs and pamphlets; and (3) post-test (week 4, n = 75), in which no information was provided. Study 2 (n = 99) was conducted a year later and involved the same information provision as the intervention stage of Study 1. Results The longer the wait duration, the lower care receivers’ procedural justice perceptions and the greater their aggressive tendencies. Information provision moderated the association, such that receiving information reduced aggressive tendencies during shorter waits but increased aggressive tendencies during longer waits. We show these effects in two separate data collections, conducted one year apart. Conclusion Competing theories predict that explanatory information should variously reduce and increase aggressive tendencies among people waiting in a queue. Our findings resolve this contradiction by identifying boundaries for the effectiveness of providing information in reducing aggression. We show that providing information is likely to reduce aggression until such point as the wait duration becomes longer than expected based on the information provided."
https://openalex.org/W3003921678,"The human settlement of the Americas has been a topic of intense debate for centuries, and there is still no consensus on the tempo and mode of early human dispersion across the continent. When trying to explain the biological diversity of early groups across North, Central and South America, studies have defended a wide range of dispersion models that tend to oversimplify the diversity observed across the continent. In this study, we aim to contribute to this debate by exploring the cranial morphological affinities of four late Pleistocene/early Holocene specimens recovered from the caves of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The four specimens are among the earliest human remains known in the continent and permit the contextualization of biological diversity present during the initial millennia of human presence in the Americas. The specimens were compared to worldwide reference series through geometric morphometric analyses of 3D anatomical landmarks. Morphological data were analyzed through exploratory visual multivariate analyses and multivariate classification based on Mahalanobis distances. The results show very different patterns of morphological association for each Quintana Roo specimen, suggesting that the early populations of the region already shared a high degree of morphological diversity. This contrasts with previous studies of South American remains and opens the possibility that the initial populations of North America already had a high level of morphological diversity, which was reduced as populations dispersed into the southern continent. As such, the study of these rare remains illustrates that we are probably still underestimating the biological diversity of early Americans."
https://openalex.org/W3003516538,"Background Most patients with nonallergic asthma have normal serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Recent reports suggest that total and aeroallergen-specific IgE levels in induced sputum may be higher in nonallergic asthmatics than in healthy controls. Our objective is to compare total and dust-mite specific (Der p 1) IgE levels in induced sputum in allergic and nonallergic asthmatics and healthy controls. Methods Total and Der p 1-specific IgE were measured in induced sputum (ImmunoCAP immunoassay) from 56 age- and sex-matched asthmatics (21 allergic, 35 nonallergic) and 9 healthy controls. Allergic asthma was defined as asthma with a positive prick test and/or clinically-significant Der p 1-specific serum IgE levels. Results Patients with allergic asthma presented significantly higher total and Der p 1-specific serum IgE levels. There were no significant between-group differences in total sputum IgE. However, Der p 1-specific sputum IgE levels were significantly higher (p = 0.000) in the allergic asthmatics, but without differences between the controls and nonallergic asthmatics. Serum and sputum IgE levels were significantly correlated, both for total IgE (rho = 0.498; p = 0.000) and Der p 1-specific IgE (rho, 0.621; p = 0001). Conclusions Total IgE levels measured in serum and induced sputum are significantly correlated. No significant differences were found between the differents groups in total sputum IgE. Nevertheless, the levels of Der p 1-specific sputum IgE levels were significantly higher in the allergic asthmatics, but without differences between the controls and nonallergic asthmatics. Probably due to the lack of sensitivity of the test used, but with the growing evidence for local allergic reactions better methods are need to explore its presence. The Clinical Trials Identifier for this project is NCT03640936."
https://openalex.org/W3003541656,"Information on the buoyancy of eggs and larvae from deep-sea species is rare but necessary for explaining the position of non-swimming larvae in the water column. Due to embryonic morphology and ecology diversities, egg buoyancy has important variations within one species and among other ones. Nevertheless, it has hardly been explored if this buoyancy variability can be a strategy for deep-sea larvae to optimize their transport beyond their spawning areas. In the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, protozoea and mysis larvae of the commercial deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus were recently found in upper layers, but to present, earlier stages like eggs and nauplii have not been collected. Using a Lagrangian transport model and larval characteristics, we evaluate the buoyancy and hydrodynamic effects on the transport of A. antennatus' larvae in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The transport models suggested that 75% of buoyant eggs released between 500 and 800 m depth (i.e., known spawning area), reached the upper water layers (0-75 m depth). Then, according to the modeled larval drifts, three spawning regions were defined in the studied area: 1) the northern part, along a continental margin crossed by large submarine canyons; 2) the central part, with two circular circulation structures (i.e., eddies); and 3) the southern part, with currents flowing through a channel. The number of larvae in the most upper layer (0-5 m depth) was higher if the larval transport model accounted for the ascent of eggs and nauplii (81%) instead of eggs reaching the surface before hatching (50%). The larvae reaching the most water upper layer (0-5 m depth) had higher rates of dispersal than the ones transported below the surface layer (deeper than 5 m depth). The results of larval dispersal simulations have implications for the understanding of A. antennatus larval ecology and for management decisions related to the shrimp fisheries in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W3003566985,"Fatty acid–binding protein 4 (FABP4) is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages and regulates metabolic and inflammatory pathways. FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes during lipolysis, and elevated circulating FABP4 levels are associated with obesity, metabolic disease, and cardiac dysfunction. We previously reported that the bacterial respiratory pathogen <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i> infects murine adipocytes and exploits host FABP4 to mobilize fat and replicate within adipocytes. However, whether <i>C. pneumoniae</i> induces FABP4 secretion from adipocytes has not been determined. Here, we show that FABP4 is actively secreted by murine adipocytes upon <i>C. pneumoniae</i> infection. Chemical inhibition of lipase activity and genetic deficiency of hormone-sensitive lipase blocked FABP4 secretion from <i>C. pneumoniae</i>–infected adipocytes. Mechanistically, <i>C. pneumoniae</i> infection induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in elevated levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Of note, exposure to a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–specific scavenger, MitoTEMPO, reduced FABP4 release from <i>C. pneumoniae</i>–infected adipocytes. Furthermore, treatment with azoramide, which protects cells against ER stress, decreased FABP4 release from <i>C. pneumoniae</i>–infected adipocytes. Using gene silencing of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), a central regulator of ER stress, we further validated the role of <i>C. pneumoniae</i> infection–induced ER stress/UPR in promoting FABP4 secretion. Overall, these results indicate that <i>C. pneumoniae</i> infection robustly induces FABP4 secretion from adipocytes by stimulating ER stress/UPR. Our findings shed additional light on the etiological link between <i>C. pneumoniae</i> infection and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3003166496,"Most existing cancer treatments involve high-cost chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with major side effects, prompting effort to develop alternative treatment modalities. It was reported that the combination of thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) and phenolic compound exhibited a moderate cytotoxic effect against human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of triple combination in PANC-1 cancer cells by adopting low-intensity pulsed electric field (LIPEF) to couple with TC-HT and CGA (chlorogenic acid). The study finds that this triple combination can significantly impede the proliferation of PANC-1 cells, with only about 20% viable cells left after 24h, whereas being non-toxic to normal cells. The synergistic activity against the PANC-1 cells was achieved by inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, which were associated with up-regulation of p53 and coupled with increased expression of downstream proteins p21 and Bax. Further mechanism investigations revealed that the cytotoxic activity could be related to mitochondrial apoptosis, characterized by the reduced level of Bcl-2, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sequential activation of caspase-9 and PARP. Also, we found that the triple treatment led to the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Notably, the triple treatment-induced cytotoxic effects and the elevated expression of p53 and p21 proteins as well as the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, all could be alleviated by the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). These findings indicate that the combination of CGA, TC-HT, and LIPEF may be a promising modality for cancer treatment, as it can induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through accumulation of ROS in PANC-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3003196747,"Polarized epithelial cells have functionally distinct apical and basolateral membranes through which they communicate with external and internal bodily environments, respectively. The establishment and maintenance of this asymmetric structure depend on polarized trafficking of specific cargos, but the precise molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. We previously showed that Rab35, a member of the Rab family small GTPases, differentially regulates the trafficking of an apical cargo, podocalyxin (PODXL), in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cell cultures through specific interactions with two distinct effectors, OCRL inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (OCRL) and ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat and pleckstrin homology domains 2 (ACAP2), respectively. However, whether the upstream regulators of Rab35 also differ depending on the culture conditions remains completely unknown. Here, we investigated four known guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of Rab35, namely DENN domain–containing 1A (DENND1A), DENND1B, DENND1C, and folliculin (FLCN), and demonstrate that DENND1A and FLCN exhibit distinct requirements for Rab35-dependent PODXL trafficking under the two culture conditions. In 3D cell cultures, only DENDN1A-knockout cysts exhibited the inverted localization of PODXL similar to that of Rab35-knockout cysts. Moreover, the DENN domain, harboring GEF activity toward Rab35, was required for proper PODXL trafficking to the apical membrane. By contrast, FLCN-knockdown cells specifically accumulated PODXL in actin-rich structures similar to the Rab35-knockdown cells in 2D cell cultures. Our findings indicate that two distinct functional cascades of Rab35, the FLCN-Rab35-OCRL and the DENND1A-Rab35-ACAP2 axes, regulate PODXL trafficking in 2D and 3D MDCK II cell cultures, respectively."

This study uses abundant sports data and data mining techniques to assess player performance and to determine the influence of 2WL on performance. WL, locomotor activity and rugby specific actions were collected on 14 professional players (26.9 ± 1.9 years) during training and official matches. In order to highlight key performance indicators, a mixed-linear model was used to compare the players’ activity relatively to competition results. This analysis showed that defensive skills represent a fundamental factor of team performance. Furthermore, a principal component analysis demonstrated that 88% of locomotor activity could be highlighted by 2 dimensions including total distance, high-speed/metabolic efforts and the number of sprints and accelerations. The final purpose of this study was to analyze the influence that WL has on match performance. To verify this, 2 different statistical models were used. A threshold-based model, from data mining processes, identified the positive influence (p<0.05) that chronic body impacts has on the ability to win offensive 1 on 1 duels during competition. This study highlights practical implications necessary for developing a better understanding of rugby match performance through the use of data mining processes."
https://openalex.org/W3003746703,"Leaf color is an important agronomic trait in flowering plants, including orchids. However, factors underlying leaf phenotypes in plants remain largely unclear. A mutant displaying yellow leaves was obtained by the γ-ray-based mutagenesis of a Cymbidium orchid and characterized using RNA sequencing. A total of 144,918 unigenes obtained from over 25 million reads were assigned to 22 metabolic pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. In addition, gene ontology was used to classify the predicted functions of transcripts into 73 functional groups. The RNA sequencing analysis identified 2,267 differentially expressed genes between wild-type and mutant Cymbidium sp. Genes involved in the chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation, as well as ion transport, were identified and assayed for their expression levels in wild-type and mutant plants using quantitative real-time profiling. No critical expression changes were detected in genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. In contrast, seven genes involved in ion transport, including two metal ion transporters, were down-regulated, and chlorophyllase 2, associated with chlorophyll degradation, was up-regulated. Together, these results suggest that alterations in chlorophyll metabolism and/or ion transport might contribute to leaf color in Cymbidium orchids."
https://openalex.org/W3003751164,"An increasing number of citizen science water monitoring programs is continuously collecting water quality data on streams throughout the United States. Operating under quality assurance protocols, this type of monitoring data can be extremely valuable for scientists and professional agencies, but in some cases has been of limited use due to concerns about the accuracy of data collected by volunteers. Although a growing body of studies attempts to address accuracy concerns by comparing volunteer data to professional data, rarely has this been conducted with large-scale datasets generated by citizen scientists. This study assesses the relative accuracy of volunteer water quality data collected by the Texas Stream Team (TST) citizen science program from 1992-2016 across the State of Texas by comparing it to professional data from corresponding stations during the same time period. Use of existing data meant that sampling times and protocols were not controlled for, thus professional and volunteer comparisons were refined to samples collected at stations within 60 meters of one another and during the same year. Results from the statewide TST dataset include 82 separate station/year ANOVAs and demonstrate that large-scale, existing volunteer and professional data with unpaired samples can show agreement of ~80% for all analyzed parameters (DO = 77%, pH = 79%, conductivity = 85%). In addition, to assess whether limiting variation within the source datasets increased the level of agreement between volunteers and professionals, data were analyzed at a local scale. Data from a single partner city, with increased controls on sampling times and locations and correction of a systematic bias in DO, confirmed this by showing an even greater agreement of 91% overall from 2009-2017 (DO = 91%, pH = 83%, conductivity = 100%). An experimental sampling dataset was analyzed and yielded similar results, indicating that existing datasets can be as accurate as experimental datasets designed with researcher supervision. Our findings underscore the reliability of large-scale citizen science monitoring datasets already in existence, and their potential value to scientific research and water management programs."
https://openalex.org/W3003753629,"In the last decade, there has been a marked increase in opioid-related human deaths in the U.S. However, the effects of the growth in opioid use on vulnerable populations, such as pet dogs, are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate potential risk factors at the dog, county, and state-levels that contributed to accidental dog opioid poisonings. Dog demographic information was collected during calls to the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), operated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about pet dog exposures to poisons from 2006–2014. Data concerning state-level opioid-related human death rates and county-level human opioid prescription rates were collected from databases accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state was fitted to explore associations between the odds of a call to the APCC being related to dog opioid poisonings with the following independent variables: sex, weight, age, reproductive status, breed class, year, source of calls, county-level human opioid prescription rate, and state-level opioid human death rate. There was a significant non-linear positive association between accidental opioid dog poisoning calls and county-level human opioid prescription rates. Similarly, the odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning significantly declined over the study period. Depending on the breed class, the odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning event were generally lower for older and heavier dogs. The odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning were significantly higher for intact compared to neutered dogs, and if the call was made by a veterinarian compared to a member of the public. Veterinarians responding to poisonings may benefit from knowledge of trends in the use and abuse of both legal and illegal drugs in human populations."

Although the association between the two traits is well established, there still exists a gap in the evidence for the direction of causality.This study aimed to examine the direction of the causal relationship between lipids and glycemic traits in an Indian population using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (BMR).The BMR analysis was conducted on 4900 individuals (2450 sib-pairs) from the Indian Migration Study. Instrument variables were generated for each lipid and glycemic trait (fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides) to examine the causal relationship by applying two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression in both directions.Lipid and glycemic traits were found to be associated observationally, however, results from 2SLS showed that only triglycerides, defined by weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) of 3 SNPs (rs662799 at APOAV, rs780094 at GCKR and rs4420638 at APOE/C1/C4), were observed to be causally effecting 1.15% variation in HOMA-IR (SE = 0.22, P = 0.010), 1.53% in HOMA- β (SE = 0.21, P = 0.001) and 1.18% in fasting insulin (SE = 0.23, P = 0.009). No evidence for a causal effect was observed in the reverse direction or between any other lipid and glycemic traits.The study findings suggest that triglycerides may causally impact various glycemic traits. However, the findings need to be replicated in larger studies."

We conducted a pilot feasibility study in Lusaka, Zambia to investigate uptake, adherence, and retention in preparation for a future efficacy trial. This was a double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 200mg daily self-administered VP suppository or placebo. Pregnant women with HIV who were initiating or continuing antiretroviral therapy were eligible for participation. Potential participants underwent ultrasound to assess eligibility; we excluded those ≥24 gestational weeks, with non-viable, multiple gestation, or extrauterine pregnancies, with short cervix (<2.0cm), or with prior spontaneous PTB. Participants initiated study product between 20–24 weeks of gestation and continued to 37 weeks (or delivery, if sooner). The primary outcome was adherence (proportion achieving ≥80% study product use), assessed by dye stain assay of returned single-use vaginal applicators. Secondary outcomes with pre-defined feasibility targets were: uptake (≥50% eligible participants enrolled) and retention (≥90% ascertainment of delivery outcomes). We also evaluated preliminary efficacy by comparing the risk of spontaneous PTB <37 weeks between groups. From July 2017 to June 2018, 208 HIV-infected pregnant women were eligible for screening and 140 (uptake = 67%) were randomly allocated to VP (n = 70) or placebo (n = 70). Mean adherence was 94% (SD±9.4); 91% (n = 125/137) achieved overall adherence ≥80%. Delivery outcomes were ascertained from 134 (96%) participants. Spontaneous PTB occurred in 10 participants (15%) receiving placebo and 8 (12%) receiving progesterone (RR 0.82; 95%CI:0.34–1.97). Spontaneous PTB < 34 weeks occurred in 6 (9%) receiving placebo and 4 (6%) receiving progesterone (RR 0.67; 95%CI:0.20–2.67). In contrast to findings from vaginal microbicide studies in HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women, our trial participants were highly adherent to daily self-administered vaginal progesterone. The study’s a priori criteria for uptake, adherence, and retention were met, indicating that a phase III efficacy trial would be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3003905842,"Introduction The aim of our study was to perform an economic assessment in order to check whether or not telemonitoring of users with pacemakers offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional follow-up in outpatient clinics. Methods We used effectiveness and cost data from the NORDLAND trial, which is a controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial. Fifty patients were assigned to receive either telemonitoring (TM; n = 25) or conventional monitoring (CM; n = 25) and were followed up for 12 months after the implantation. A cost–utility analysis was performed in terms of additional costs per additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) attained from the perspectives of the Norwegian National Healthcare System and patients and their caregivers. Results Effectiveness was similar between alternatives (TM: 0.7804 [CI: 0.6864 to 0.8745] vs. CM: 0.7465 [CI: 0.6543 to 0.8387]), while cost per patient was higher in the RM group, both from the Norwegian NHS perspective (TM: €2,079.84 [CI: 0.00 to 4,610.58] vs. €271.97 [CI: 158.18 to 385.76]; p = 0.147) and including the patient/family perspective (TM: €2,295.91 [CI: 0.00 to 4,843.28] vs. CM: €430.39 [CI: 0.00 to 4,841.48]), although these large differences—mainly due to a few patients being hospitalized in the TM group, as opposed to none in the CM group—did not reach statistical significance. The Incremental Cost–Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from the Norwegian NHS perspective (€53,345.27/QALY) and including the patient/caregiver perspective (€55,046.40/QALY), as well as the Incremental Net Benefit (INB), favors the CM alternative, albeit with very broad 95%CIs. The probabilistic analysis confirmed inconclusive results due to the wide CIs even suggesting that TM was not cost-effective in this study. Supplemental analysis excluding the hospitalization costs shows positive INBs, whereby suggesting a discrete superiority of the RM alternative if hospitalization costs were not considered, albeit also with broad CIs. Conclusions Cost–utility analysis of TM vs. CM shows inconclusive results because of broad confidence intervals with ICER and INB figures ranging from potential savings to high costs for an additional QALY, with the majority of ICERs being above the usual NHS thresholds for coverage decisions.

https://openalex.org/W3004044081,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of density measurements in the diagnosis of an underlying residual tumor beyond iodine depositions after Lipiodol-based conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE).Thirty follow-up CT scans of 20 patients 6-12 weeks after Lipiodol-based cTACE, receiving a digital subtraction angiography at the same time, were analyzed. Reference for the detection of a residual tumor was the angiography, and a visible contrast enhancement was categorized as a residual tumor (n = 16 with residual tumor; n = 14 without residual tumor). The density of the iodine depositions was measured in all containing slices in non-contrast-, arterial- and portal venous-phase CT scans, with a slice thickness of 5.00 mm. The mean density of the iodine deposition during the portal venous phase was subtracted from the mean density of the arterial phase to calculate the density changes (a positive enhancement score represents washout in the portal venous phase). In addition, a quotient relating to the non-contrast measurement was evaluated.Patients with a residual tumor displayed significantly higher enhancement scores in favor of density reduction between the arterial and portal venous phases, compared to patients without a residual tumor (1.41 ± 3.59, n = 14 vs. -13.97 ± 2.88, n = 16; p-value < 0.01). Furthermore, 87.75% of patients with an enhancement score higher than -1.00 (n = 9) had a residual tumor, whereas 100.00% of patients with an enhancement score lower than -20.00 (n = 6) were shown to be tumor-free. The enhancement score quotient resulted in similar findings.After cTACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the presence of a viable tumor correlated with enhancement scores based on the density measurements of iodine depositions in different phases of the CT scan. Low enhancement scores were associated with completely treated tumors and can aid the decision process to avoid possibly unnecessary angiographies."
https://openalex.org/W3004229944,"Most of the approved monoclonal antibodies used in the clinic were initially discovered in mice. However, many targets of therapeutic interest are highly conserved proteins that do not elicit a robust immune response in mice. There is a need for non-mammalian antibody discovery platforms which would allow researchers to access epitopes that are not recognized in mammalian hosts. Recently, we introduced the OmniChicken®, a transgenic animal carrying human VH3-23 and VK3-15 at its immunoglobulin loci. Here, we describe a new version of the OmniChicken which carries VH3-23 and either VL1-44 or VL3-19 at its heavy and light chain loci, respectively. The Vλ-expressing birds showed normal B and T populations in the periphery. A panel of monoclonal antibodies demonstrated comparable epitope coverage of a model antigen compared to both wild-type and Vκ-expressing OmniChickens. Kinetic analysis identified binders in the picomolar range. The Vλ-expressing bird increases the antibody diversity available in the OmniChicken platform, further enabling discovery of therapeutic leads."
https://openalex.org/W3003615643,"Objectives In this paper, we aim to estimate the effect cancer diagnosis has on labour-force participation among middle-aged and older populations in Japan. We investigate the impact of cancer diagnosis on job cessation and the gap between gender or job types. Methods We sourced data from a nationwide, annual survey targeted population aged 51–70 featuring the same cohort throughout, and examined respondents’ cancer diagnoses and whether they continued to work, while also considering differences between gender (observations: 53 373 for men and 44 027 for women) and occupation type (observations: 64 501 for cognitive worker and 20 921 for manual worker) in this regard. We also examined one-year lag effects, using propensity score matching to control for confounding characteristics. We also implement Logistic regression and derive the odds ratio to evaluate the relative risk of cancer diagnosis, which supplements the main result by propensity score matching. Results Overall, the diagnosis of cancer has a huge effect on labour-force participation among the population, but this effect varies across subpopulations. Male workers are more likely to quit their job in the year they are diagnosed with cancer (10.1 percentage points), and also in the following year (5.0 percentage points). Contrastingly, female workers are more likely to quit their job immediately after being diagnosed with cancer (18.6 percentage points); however, this effect totally disappears when considering likelihoods for the following year. Cognitive workers are more prone to quit their job in the year of diagnosis by 11.6 percentage points, and this effect remains significant, 3.8 percentage points, in the following year. On the other hand, for manual workers the effect during the year of diagnosis is huge. It amounts to 18.7 percentage points; however, the effect almost disappears in the following year. Conclusion Our results indicate the huge effect of cancer on job cessation, and that there might be a degree of discrimination in workplaces between gender and job types."
https://openalex.org/W3004093623,"Smallholder farmers undertake a number of strategies to cope with climate shocks in a community. The sharing of resources across households constitutes one coping mechanism when environmental shocks differentially impact households. This paper investigates commodity sharing dynamics among households in eight communities in an environmentally heterogeneous highland-lowland area in central Kenya. We use survey data and meteorological data to test whether commodity sharing, measured at the household level by net inflow of commodities, varies across a regional precipitation gradient, and we reveal how sharing fluctuates with rainfall over the course of a year. We find both precipitation and income to be significant predictors of households’ net value of shared commodities. Specifically, farmers who live in drier areas with less income are more likely to receive more commodities than they give. We also find that the length of time a household has been established in the area is significantly related to commodity sharing. Further, commodity sharing follows the pattern of harvest and food storage over the course of the year, with households giving the most commodities at times when food storage levels are higher, that is, post-harvest. The study sheds light on the relationship between commodity sharing as a coping mechanism and environmental heterogeneity in a region prone to seasonal food insecurity."
https://openalex.org/W3004164571,"Introduction Guidelines advocate the treatment of HCV in all HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. The aim of this randomized, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02707601; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02707601) was to evaluate the safety/efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) co-administered with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) or rilpivirine/F/TAF (R/F/TAF) in HIV-1/HCV co-infected participants. Methods Participants with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and chronic HCV-genotype (GT) 1 (HCV treatment-naïve ± compensated cirrhosis or HCV treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic) were randomized 1:1 to switch to E/C/F/TAF or R/F/TAF. If HIV suppression was maintained at Week 8, participants received 12 weeks of LDV/SOF. The primary endpoint was sustained HCV virologic response 12 weeks after LDV/SOF completion (SVR12). Results Of 150 participants, 148 received ≥1 dose of HIV study drug and 144 received LDV/SOF (72 in each F/TAF group; 83% GT1a, 94% HCV treatment-naïve, 12% cirrhotic). Overall, SVR12 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 93–99%). Black race did not affect SVR12. Of four participants not achieving SVR12, one had HCV relapse, one had HCV virologic non-response due to non-adherence, and two missed the post-HCV Week 12 visit. Of 148 participants, 96% receiving E/C/F/TAF and 95% receiving R/F/TAF maintained HIV suppression at Week 24; no HIV resistance was detected. No participant discontinued LDV/SOF or E/C/F/TAF due to adverse events; one participant discontinued R/F/TAF due to worsening of pre-existing hypercholesterolemia. Renal toxicity was not observed in either F/TAF regimen during LDV/SOF co-administration. In conclusion, high rates of HCV SVR12 and maintenance of HIV suppression were achieved with LDV/SOF and F/TAF-based regimens. Conclusion This study supports LDV/SOF co-administered with an F/TAF-based regimen in HIV-1/HCV-GT1 co-infected patients."

https://openalex.org/W3003903571,"Background The effect of phase-change material blood containers on the quality of stored red blood cells (RBCs) transported in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau remains to be studied. Study design and methods RBCs stored in a phase-change material blood container were transported from Chengdu to Tibet and then back to Chengdu. The detection time points were the 1st day of fresh-collected RBCs (group 1), the 14th day of resting refrigerated storage (group 2), and the 14th day of plateau transportation under refrigerated storage in the container (group 3). RBC counts, hemoglobin (HGB) content, free hemoglobin (FHb) content, blood biochemical indexes, hemorheologic indexes and 2,3-DPG content were detected. Results Compared with group 2, RBC counts and HGB were decreased, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), FHb and K+ content were increased in group 3. The glucose consumption and lactic acid production were significantly increased in groups 2 and 3. Compared with group 2, the 2,3-DPG content and whole blood viscosity were decreased in group 3. After resting refrigerated storage and plateau transportation, the RBC quality still met the national standard (GB18469-2012 whole blood and component blood quality requirements). Conclusion The phase-change material blood container can be maintained at a constant temperature under plateau environmental conditions, ensuring that the quality of the stored RBCs is compliant with GB18469-2012 whole blood and component blood quality requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4248983797,"Mutations conferring susceptibility to complex disorders also occur in healthy individuals but at significantly lower frequencies than in patients, indicating that these mutations are not completely penetrant. Therefore, it is important to estimate the penetrance or the likelihood of developing a disease in presence of a mutation. Recently, a method to calculate penetrance and its credible intervals was developed on the basis of the Bayesian method and since been used in literature. However, in the present form, this approach demands programming skills for its utility. Here, we developed 'CalPen', a web-based tool for straightforward calculation of penetrance and its credible intervals by entering the number of mutations identified in controls and patients, and the number of patients and controls studied. For validation purposes, we show that CalPen-derived penetrance values are in good agreement with the published values. As further demonstration of its utility, we used schizophrenia as an example of complex disorder and estimated penetrance values for 15 different copy number variants (CNVs) reported in 39,059 patients and 55,084 controls, and 145 SNPs reported in 45,405 patients and 122,761 controls. CNVs showed an average penetrance of 7% with 22q11.21 CNVs having highest value (~20%) and 15q11.2 deletions with lowest value (~1.4%). Most SNPs, on the other hand showed a penetrance of 0.7% with rs1801028 having the highest penetrance (1.6%). In summary, CalPen is an accurate and user-friendly web-based tool useful in human genetic research to ascertain the ability of the mutation/ variant to cause a complex genetic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3003562359,"In endemic regions, the age distribution of malaria varies according to the infecting Plasmodium species. We aimed to delineate the pattern of malaria-related hospitalization from birth in Timika, Papua-an area co-endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax.Between April 2004 and December 2013, infants born at Mitra Masyarakat Hospital, or presenting within the first 7 days of life, were enrolled retrospectively into a cohort study and followed passively using routinely-collected hospital surveillance data. Outcomes were stratified by the presence or absence of Plasmodium parasitemia and included re-presentation to hospital, requirement for hospital admission and death.Overall, 11,408 infants were enrolled into the cohort. Median follow-up was 4.3 (maximum 9.7) years. In total, 7,847 (68.9%) infants made 90,766 re-presentations to hospital, 18,105 (19.9%) of which were associated with Plasmodium parasitemia. The incidence of re-presentations with malaria during the first year of life was 213 per 1,000 person-years (py) for P. vivax and 79 per 1,000py for P. falciparum (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 2.69, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 2.48-2.92). After the age of 5 years, the incidence of P. vivax had fallen to 77/1,000py and the incidence of P. falciparum had risen to 95/1,000py (IRR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.73-0.88). Overall, 79.7% (14,431/18,105) of malaria re-presentations were recurrences rather than initial infections. Malaria accounted for 31.7% (2,126/3,120) of all hospital admissions. The infant mortality rate in this study was 52 deaths per 1,000 live births. Beyond the early neonatal period, 13.4% of deaths were associated with Plasmodium parasitemia.In Papua, Indonesia, malaria is a major cause of hospital presentation and admission in early life. The initial predominance of P. vivax over P. falciparum inverts after five years of age. Malaria is directly associated with nearly one in seven deaths after the early neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W3003594464,"The existing diagnostic techniques for detecting schistosomiasis turkestanica, such as aetiological assays, identify infection by parasitic worms via the incubation of miracidia from faeces or observing eggs under microscopy. However, they are limited in the diagnosis of low-grade and prepatent infections, which lead to a high misdetection rates. Therefore, a new method for parasite diagnosis with increased sensitivity is urgently needed.Goats in Nimu County (Tibet, China) infected with Schistosoma turkestanicum in an epidemic area were selected according positivity for the infection by faecal examination. Adult worms were collected, eggs were extracted by the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) erosion method, and soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) and soluble egg antigen (SEA) were isolated. The best coating concentration of the antigens and the best degree of dilution for serum were determined by square array experiments, and the optimal blocking solution and serum diluents were selected. The specificity, sensitivity and crossover of the ELISA method were determined using 48 samples of goat sera positive for S. turkestanicum, 100 samples of goat sera negative for S. turkestanicum, and 54 samples of buffalo sera positive for S. japonicum. Serological assays were established with samples from goats naturally grazed in a rural area of Nimu County, Tibet Province, by using the indirect ELISA method for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, and faeces were collected for miracidia hatching. The sensitivity of the two detection methods was compared.Eggs of S. turkestanicum were distributed in the host duodenum and small intestine. Eggs in the host intestinal wall were extracted by the NaOH erosion method, which provided intact eggs with reduced impurities. The testing results obtained by isolating SEA were more stable than those obtained by using SWAP and less affected by the coating concentration and serum dilution. Additionally, the value of positive serum/negative (P/N) serum for SEA was much higher than that for SWAP. The optimal coating concentration of SEA was 0.5 μg/ml, and the optimal serum dilution was 1:100. The specificity and sensitivity of the indirect ELISA based on SEA (S. turkestanicum) were both 100%, and no cross-reactivity was found with schistosomiasis japonica. An epidemiological survey of goats in naturally infected areas showed that the prevalence rate of schistosomiasis turkestanica was 93%, and the infection rate increased with the ages of the goats.We aimed to develop a sensitive method to utilize in the mass field screening of livestock. As a diagnostic antigen, SEA (S. turkestanicum) was more suitable for serological testing than SWAP (S. turkestanicum). The indirect ELISA using SEA (S. turkestanicum) exhibited good sensitivity, specificity and no cross-reactivity with schistosomiasis japonica. The degree of infectivity and prevalence of S. turkestanicum infection in endemic areas are serious and should be a focus of concern among local departments."
