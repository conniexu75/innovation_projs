https://openalex.org/W2022770379,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent and reversible internal modification in mammalian messenger and noncoding RNAs. We report here that human methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) catalyzes m(6)A RNA methylation. Together with METTL3, the only previously known m(6)A methyltransferase, these two proteins form a stable heterodimer core complex of METTL3-METTL14 that functions in cellular m(6)A deposition on mammalian nuclear RNAs. WTAP, a mammalian splicing factor, can interact with this complex and affect this methylation."

Here the authors describe a unique TGF-β dependent molecular and functional microglia signature that distinguishes these cells from other immune and glial cells in the periphery and brain. Microglia are myeloid cells of the CNS that participate both in normal CNS function and in disease. We investigated the molecular signature of microglia and identified 239 genes and 8 microRNAs that were uniquely or highly expressed in microglia versus myeloid and other immune cells. Of the 239 genes, 106 were enriched in microglia as compared with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. This microglia signature was not observed in microglial lines or in monocytes recruited to the CNS, and was also observed in human microglia. We found that TGF-β was required for the in vitro development of microglia that express the microglial molecular signature characteristic of adult microglia and that microglia were absent in the CNS of TGF-β1–deficient mice. Our results identify a unique microglial signature that is dependent on TGF-β signaling and provide insights into microglial biology and the possibility of targeting microglia for the treatment of CNS disease."
https://openalex.org/W2091363184,"The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) has recently been identified as a key RIP3 (receptor interacting protein 3) downstream component of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis. MLKL is phosphorylated by RIP3 and is recruited to the necrosome through its interaction with RIP3. However, it is still unknown how MLKL mediates TNF-induced necroptosis. Here, we report that MLKL forms a homotrimer through its amino-terminal coiled-coil domain and locates to the cell plasma membrane during TNF-induced necroptosis. By generating different MLKL mutants, we demonstrated that the plasma membrane localization of trimerized MLKL is critical for mediating necroptosis. Importantly, we found that the membrane localization of MLKL is essential for Ca2+ influx, which is an early event of TNF-induced necroptosis. Furthermore, we identified that TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin related 7) is a MLKL downstream target for the mediation of Ca2+ influx and TNF-induced necroptosis. Hence, our study reveals a crucial mechanism of MLKL-mediated TNF-induced necroptosis. Liu and colleagues find that MLKL translocates to the plasma membrane to induce TNF-induced necroptosis, possibly through an effect on calcium influx and the action of the cation channel TRPM7."
https://openalex.org/W2014440105,"Evolution drives, and is driven by, demography. A genotype moulds its phenotype's age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in turn determine the genotype's fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity, there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant, decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long- and short-lived species. This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species."
https://openalex.org/W2008440267,"The airway mucin Muc5b (but not Muc5ac) is required for mucociliary clearance, defence against bacterial infection in the airways and middle ear, and maintenance of immune homeostasis in the lungs; Muc5b deficiency causes accumulation of apoptotic macrophages, impairment of phagocytosis and reduced production of interleukin-23, leading to infection and inflammation. The mucosal surfaces in the lungs are a first line of defence against airborne pathogens but overproduction of mucus can itself cause respiratory disease. This study identifies a specific glycoprotein component of airway mucus, called Muc5b, as essential for mucociliary clearance in mice. Surprisingly Muc5b also contributes to innate defence against bacterial infection through the regulation of macrophage function both in mice and in humans with allergic asthma. Absence of Muc5b causes materials to accumulate in the airways, culminating in chronic infection by multiple bacterial species. This work could have relevance for the treatment of airway diseases. Respiratory surfaces are exposed to billions of particulates and pathogens daily. A protective mucus barrier traps and eliminates them through mucociliary clearance (MCC)1,2. However, excessive mucus contributes to transient respiratory infections and to the pathogenesis of numerous respiratory diseases1. MUC5AC and MUC5B are evolutionarily conserved genes that encode structurally related mucin glycoproteins, the principal macromolecules in airway mucus1,3. Genetic variants are linked to diverse lung diseases4,5,6, but specific roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in MCC, and the lasting effects of their inhibition, are unknown. Here we show that mouse Muc5b (but not Muc5ac) is required for MCC, for controlling infections in the airways and middle ear, and for maintaining immune homeostasis in mouse lungs, whereas Muc5ac is dispensable. Muc5b deficiency caused materials to accumulate in upper and lower airways. This defect led to chronic infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, and to inflammation that failed to resolve normally7. Apoptotic macrophages accumulated, phagocytosis was impaired, and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production was reduced in Muc5b−/− mice. By contrast, in mice that transgenically overexpress Muc5b, macrophage functions improved. Existing dogma defines mucous phenotypes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as driven by increased MUC5AC, with MUC5B levels either unaffected or increased in expectorated sputum1,8. However, in many patients, MUC5B production at airway surfaces decreases by as much as 90%9,10,11. By distinguishing a specific role for Muc5b in MCC, and by determining its impact on bacterial infections and inflammation in mice, our results provide a refined framework for designing targeted therapies to control mucin secretion and restore MCC."
https://openalex.org/W2055797258,"Using long-term intravital photography to explore the cellular changes after compression-induced traumatic brain injury in a murine model, it is shown that parenchymal and meningeal inflammation as well as cell death can be modulated by topical treatment with purinergic receptor antagonists and glutathione. Traumatic brain injury, often a consequence of road accidents, is a major killer and cause of neurological disorders. This study describes a closed-skull mouse model with a pathology resembling mild traumatic brain injury in humans. The authors use long-term intravital microscopy to study the dynamics of the injury response from its inception. Using the model they show that parenchymal and meningeal cell death can be reduced by topical treatment with purinergic receptor antagonists and the antioxidant glutathione. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly appreciated to be highly prevalent and deleterious to neurological function1,2. At present, no effective treatment options are available, and little is known about the complex cellular response to TBI during its acute phase. To gain insights into TBI pathogenesis, we developed a novel murine closed-skull brain injury model that mirrors some pathological features associated with mild TBI in humans and used long-term intravital microscopy to study the dynamics of the injury response from its inception. Here we demonstrate that acute brain injury induces vascular damage, meningeal cell death, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately breach the glial limitans and promote spread of the injury into the parenchyma. In response, the brain elicits a neuroprotective, purinergic-receptor-dependent inflammatory response characterized by meningeal neutrophil swarming and microglial reconstitution of the damaged glial limitans. We also show that the skull bone is permeable to small-molecular-weight compounds, and use this delivery route to modulate inflammation and therapeutically ameliorate brain injury through transcranial administration of the ROS scavenger, glutathione. Our results shed light on the acute cellular response to TBI and provide a means to locally deliver therapeutic compounds to the site of injury."
https://openalex.org/W1982344272,"Bacterial cytokinesis is commonly initiated by the Z-ring, a cytoskeletal structure that assembles at the site of division. Its primary component is FtsZ, a tubulin superfamily GTPase, which is recruited to the membrane by the actin-related protein FtsA. Both proteins are required for the formation of the Z-ring, but if and how they influence each other’s assembly dynamics is not known. Here, we reconstituted FtsA-dependent recruitment of FtsZ polymers to supported membranes, where both proteins self-organize into complex patterns, such as fast-moving filament bundles and chirally rotating rings. Using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical perturbations, we found that these large-scale rearrangements of FtsZ emerge from its polymerization dynamics and a dual, antagonistic role of FtsA: recruitment of FtsZ filaments to the membrane and negative regulation of FtsZ organization. Our findings provide a model for the initial steps of bacterial cell division and illustrate how dynamic polymers can self-organize into large-scale structures. In bacteria, the tubulin-related GTPase FtsZ and the actin-related protein FtsA cooperate to form the Z-ring required for cytokinesis. Loose and Mitchison now show that FtsZ and FtsA can self-organize into dynamic structures in vitro, providing insights into the potential regulatory interplay of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1973256834,"Genetic circuits perform computational operations based on interactions between freely diffusing molecules within a cell. When transcription factors are combined to build a circuit, unintended interactions can disrupt its function. Here, we apply 'part mining' to build a library of 73 TetR-family repressors gleaned from prokaryotic genomes. The operators of a subset were determined using an in vitro method, and this information was used to build synthetic promoters. The promoters and repressors were screened for cross-reactions. Of these, 16 were identified that both strongly repress their cognate promoter (5- to 207-fold) and exhibit minimal interactions with other promoters. Each repressor-promoter pair was converted to a NOT gate and characterized. Used as a set of 16 NOT/NOR gates, there are >10(54) circuits that could be built by changing the pattern of input and output promoters. This represents a large set of compatible gates that can be used to construct user-defined circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2082188082,"In this study, Mainland and colleagues de-orphan 18 human odorant receptors and find that 68% of these receptors exhibit polymorphisms that affect their function in vitro. They also show that the polymorphisms in one these odorant receptors, OR10G4, affect odor intensity and valence perception thus linking the molecular functioning of a single odorant receptor to human olfactory perception. Humans have ∼400 intact odorant receptors, but each individual has a unique set of genetic variations that lead to variation in olfactory perception. We used a heterologous assay to determine how often genetic polymorphisms in odorant receptors alter receptor function. We identified agonists for 18 odorant receptors and found that 63% of the odorant receptors we examined had polymorphisms that altered in vitro function. On average, two individuals have functional differences at over 30% of their odorant receptor alleles. To show that these in vitro results are relevant to olfactory perception, we verified that variations in OR10G4 genotype explain over 15% of the observed variation in perceived intensity and over 10% of the observed variation in perceived valence for the high-affinity in vitro agonist guaiacol but do not explain phenotype variation for the lower-affinity agonists vanillin and ethyl vanillin."
https://openalex.org/W2093970530,"One of the most likely substrates for metabolic imaging of response to treatment in cancer is glucose, but until now, using hyperpolarized 13C-labelled glucose has been problematic because of the short lifetime of the hyperpolarization in this molecule. Using [U-13C, U-2H]glucose, Tiago Rodrigues et al. now show that they are able to image its glycolytic conversion to lactate in two mouse tumor models in vivo, and that in one model, flux is markedly reduced after treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. In this study, we monitored glycolysis in mouse lymphoma and lung tumors by measuring the conversion of hyperpolarized [U-2H, U-13C]glucose to lactate using 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging. We observed labeled lactate only in tumors and not in surrounding normal tissue or other tissues in the body and found that it was markedly decreased at 24 h after treatment with a chemotherapeutic drug. We also detected an increase in a resonance assigned to 6-phosphogluconate in the pentose phosphate pathway. This technique could provide a new way of detecting early evidence of tumor treatment response in the clinic and of monitoring tumor pentose phosphate pathway activity."
https://openalex.org/W2171197491,"Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of mutations acquired by bacterial pathogens during infection. However, it remains unclear whether adaptive mutations fix in the population or lead to pathogen diversification within the patient. Here we study the genotypic diversity of Burkholderia dolosa within individuals with cystic fibrosis by resequencing individual colonies and whole populations from single sputum samples. We find extensive intrasample diversity, suggesting that mutations rarely fix in a patient's pathogen population--instead, diversifying lineages coexist for many years. Under strong selection, multiple adaptive mutations arise, but none of these sweep to fixation, generating lasting allele diversity that provides a recorded signature of past selection. Genes involved in outer-membrane components, iron scavenging and antibiotic resistance all showed this signature of within-patient selection. These results offer a general and rapid approach for identifying the selective pressures acting on a pathogen in individual patients based on single clinical samples."

https://openalex.org/W2081826742,"Autophagy regulates cell death both positively and negatively, but the molecular basis for this paradox remains inadequately characterized. We demonstrate here that transient cell-to-cell variations in autophagy can promote either cell death or survival depending on the stimulus and cell type. By separating cells with high and low basal autophagy using flow cytometry, we demonstrate that autophagy determines which cells live or die in response to death receptor activation. We have determined that selective autophagic degradation of the phosphatase Fap-1 promotes Fas apoptosis in Type I cells, which do not require mitochondrial permeabilization for efficient apoptosis. Conversely, autophagy inhibits apoptosis in Type II cells (which require mitochondrial involvement) or on treatment with TRAIL in either Type I or II cells. These data illustrate that differences in autophagy in a cell population determine cell fate in a stimulus- and cell-type-specific manner. This example of selective autophagy of an apoptosis regulator may represent a general mechanism for context-specific regulation of cell fate by autophagy. Data suggest that autophagy, a process normally associated with cell survival, also promotes cell death, depending on the stimulus or cell type. Thorburn and colleagues find that differences in basal autophagy levels in cells determine survival or death in response to death receptor activation, through modulation of Fap-1 degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2037833933,"Nephrotic syndrome is marked by excess of both protein in the urine (proteinuria) and triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Sumant Chugh and his colleagues now explain these linked pathologies while also suggesting a possible new therapy to treat the proteinuria without aggravating the hypertriglyceridemia. The molecular link between proteinuria and hyperlipidemia in nephrotic syndrome is not known. We show in the present study that plasma angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) links proteinuria with hypertriglyceridemia through two negative feedback loops. In previous studies in a rat model that mimics human minimal change disease, we observed localized secretion by podocytes of hyposialylated Angptl4, a pro-proteinuric form of the protein. But in this study we noted high serum levels of Angptl4 (presumably normosialylated based on a neutral isoelectric point) in other glomerular diseases as well. Circulating Angptl4 was secreted by extrarenal organs in response to an elevated plasma ratio of free fatty acids (FFAs) to albumin when proteinuria reached nephrotic range. In a systemic feedback loop, these circulating pools of Angptl4 reduced proteinuria by interacting with glomerular endothelial αvβ5 integrin. Blocking the Angptl4–β5 integrin interaction or global knockout of Angptl4 or β5 integrin delayed recovery from peak proteinuria in animal models. But at the same time, in a local feedback loop, the elevated extrarenal pools of Angptl4 reduced tissue FFA uptake in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue, subsequently resulting in hypertriglyceridemia, by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides to FFAs. Injecting recombinant human ANGPTL4 modified at a key LPL interacting site into nephrotic Buffalo Mna and Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats reduced proteinuria through the systemic loop but, by bypassing the local loop, without increasing plasma triglyceride levels. These data show that increases in circulating Angptl4 in response to nephrotic-range proteinuria reduces the degree of this pathology, but at the cost of inducing hypertriglyceridemia, while also suggesting a possible therapy to treat these linked pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1980087135,"Proteins with Bcl2-associated anthanogene (BAG) domains act as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) for the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). There are six BAG family NEFs in humans, and each is thought to link Hsp70 to a distinct cellular pathway. However, little is known about how the NEFs compete for binding to Hsp70 or how they might differentially shape its biochemical activities. Toward these questions, we measured the binding of human Hsp72 (HSPA1A) to BAG1, BAG2, BAG3, and the unrelated NEF Hsp105. These studies revealed a clear hierarchy of affinities: BAG3 > BAG1 > Hsp105 ≫ BAG2. All of the NEFs competed for binding to Hsp70, and their relative affinity values predicted their potency in nucleotide and peptide release assays. Finally, we combined the Hsp70-NEF pairs with cochaperones of the J protein family (DnaJA1, DnaJA2, DnaJB1, and DnaJB4) to generate 16 permutations. The activity of the combinations in ATPase and luciferase refolding assays were dependent on the identity and stoichiometry of both the J protein and NEF so that some combinations were potent chaperones, whereas others were inactive. Given the number and diversity of cochaperones in mammals, it is likely that combinatorial assembly could generate a large number of distinct permutations."
https://openalex.org/W2074979419,"Inhibitors of the bile acid transporter ASBT may be useful therapeutics for treating hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 diabetes; here, two X-ray crystal structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii are solved. This paper reports two X-ray crystal structures of a bacterial homologue of the human apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, also known as SLC10A2), one of two transporters involved in retrieving secreted bile acids from the intestine. The homologue (termed ASBTYf), from Yersinia frederiksenii, was crystallized in a lipid environment. The structures reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives alternate accessibility to the highly conserved 'crossover' region, where two discontinuous transmembrane helices cross each other. This result has implications for the location and orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation pathway for sodium ions. The authors cite evidence that implies that overall fold and transport mechanism are similar between ASBT and ASBTYf and they suggest that ASBTYf may serve as a useful model system for understanding mechanisms of transport and inhibition in the mammalian ASBT homologues. ASBT inhibitors are being studied as potential therapeutics for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and type II diabetes. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and secreted through the biliary tract into the small intestine, where they aid in absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Through a process known as enterohepatic recirculation, more than 90% of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion1. In humans, there are two Na+-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation, the Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum2. In recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently cholesterol consumption3,4. However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing functional data2,5,6,7,8. The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBTNM) in detergent was reported recently9, showing the protein in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na+ and a taurocholic acid. However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na+ across the membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na+ and bile acids, here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii (ASBTYf) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved ‘crossover’ region, where two discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either side of the cell membrane. This result has implications for the location and orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation pathway for Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2049315781,"Phagocytosis is a conserved cellular response among metazoans. Opsonins are some molecules that label targets to increase their susceptibility to phagocytosis. Opsonins are usually captured by receptors on the surface of phagocytes. Our previous study found the C-type lectin FcLec4 from Chinese white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis might function as an opsonin to facilitate bacterial clearance. In the present study we purified the native FcLec4 protein and confirmed its opsonic activity in the near relation, kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. The possible receptor of FcLec4 was identified as β-integrin by panning a T7 phage display library of shrimp hemocytes and then confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. We further proved that the interaction between FcLec4 and β-integrin did not rely on the carbohydrate recognition domain but on the N terminus of FcLec4. In addition, inhibition of FcLec4 expression using RNAi delayed bacterial clearance, and β-integrin knockdown suppressed the opsonic activity of FcLec4. This study is the first to show the direct interaction between an opsonin and its receptor in crustaceans. Our study provides new insights into invertebrate phagocytosis and the functions of C-type lectins."
https://openalex.org/W2080533950,"David Adams and colleagues identify inactivating mutations in CUX1 in diverse human cancers. They validate CUX1 as a tumor suppressor using mouse and Drosophila cancer models, and show that CUX1 deficiency activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling through transcriptional downregulation of a PI3K inhibitor. A major challenge in cancer genetics is to determine which low-frequency somatic mutations are drivers of tumorigenesis. Here we interrogate the genomes of 7,651 diverse human cancers and find inactivating mutations in the homeodomain transcription factor gene CUX1 (cut-like homeobox 1) in ∼1–5% of various tumors. Meta-analysis of CUX1 mutational status in 2,519 cases of myeloid malignancies reveals disruptive mutations associated with poor survival, highlighting the clinical significance of CUX1 loss. In parallel, we validate CUX1 as a bona fide tumor suppressor using mouse transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis and Drosophila cancer models. We demonstrate that CUX1 deficiency activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling through direct transcriptional downregulation of the PI3K inhibitor PIK3IP1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1), leading to increased tumor growth and susceptibility to PI3K-AKT inhibition. Thus, our complementary approaches identify CUX1 as a pan-driver of tumorigenesis and uncover a potential strategy for treating CUX1-mutant tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2063618061,"In this paper, we aimed to improve the carbohydrate productivity of Spirulina platensis by generating mutants with increased carbohydrate content and growth rate. ARTP was used as a new mutagenesis tool to generate a mutant library of S. platensis with diverse phenotypes. Protocol for rapid mutation of S. platensis by 60 s treatment with helium driven ARTP and high throughput screening method of the mutants using the 96-well microplate and microplate reader was established. A mutant library of 62 mutants was then constructed and ideal mutants were selected out. The characteristics of the mutants after the mutagenesis inclined to be stable after around 9(th) subculture, where the total mutation frequency and positive mutation frequency in terms of specific growth rate reached 45% and 25%, respectively. The mutants in mutant library showed diverse phenotypes in terms of cell growth rate, carbohydrate content and flocculation intensity. The positive mutation frequency in terms of cellular carbohydrate content with the increase by more than 20% percent than the wild strain was 32.3%. Compared with the wild strain, the representative mutants 3-A10 and 3-B2 showed 40.3% and 78.0% increase in carbohydrate content, respectively, while the mutant 4-B3 showed 10.5% increase in specific growth rate. The carbohydrate contents of the representative mutants were stable during different subcultures, indicating high genetic stability. ARTP was demonstrated to be an effective and non-GMO mutagenesis tool to generate the mutant library for multicellular microalgae."

https://openalex.org/W2084295601,"In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, E2 enzymes such as Cdc34A mediate the transfer of ubiquitin to protein substrates, which are thus marked for proteasomal degradation or other fates. New structural data reveal that the small-molecule inhibitor CC0651 impairs Cdc34A activity by stabilizing the normally transient Cdc34A–ubiquitin complex. Weak protein interactions between ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) enzymes that mediate its covalent attachment to substrates serve to position ubiquitin for optimal catalytic transfer. We show that a small-molecule inhibitor of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34A, called CC0651, acts by trapping a weak interaction between ubiquitin and the E2 donor ubiquitin-binding site. A structure of the ternary CC0651–Cdc34A–ubiquitin complex reveals that the inhibitor engages a composite binding pocket formed from Cdc34A and ubiquitin. CC0651 also suppresses the spontaneous hydrolysis rate of the Cdc34A-ubiquitin thioester without decreasing the interaction between Cdc34A and the RING domain subunit of the E3 enzyme. Stabilization of the numerous other weak interactions between ubiquitin and UPS enzymes by small molecules may be a feasible strategy to selectively inhibit different UPS activities."
https://openalex.org/W2072913161,"Apolipoprotein M (apoM), a lipocalin family member, preferentially associates with plasma HDL and binds plasma sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a signaling molecule active in immune homeostasis and endothelial barrier function. ApoM overexpression in ABCA1-expressing HEK293 cells stimulated larger nascent HDL formation, compared with cells that did not express apoM; however, the in vivo role of apoM in HDL metabolism remains poorly understood. To test whether hepatic apoM overexpression increases plasma HDL size, we generated hepatocyte-specific apoM transgenic (APOM Tg) mice, which had an ∼3-5-fold increase in plasma apoM levels compared with wild-type mice. Although HDL cholesterol concentrations were similar to wild-type mice, APOM Tg mice had larger plasma HDLs enriched in apoM, cholesteryl ester, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and S1P. Despite the presence of larger plasma HDLs in APOM Tg mice, in vivo macrophage reverse cholesterol transport capacity was similar to that in wild-type mice. APOM Tg mice had an ∼5-fold increase in plasma S1P, which was predominantly associated with larger plasma HDLs. Primary hepatocytes from APOM Tg mice generated larger nascent HDLs and displayed increased sphingolipid synthesis and S1P secretion. Inhibition of ceramide synthases in hepatocytes increased cellular S1P levels but not S1P secretion, suggesting that apoM is rate-limiting in the export of hepatocyte S1P. Our data indicate that hepatocyte-specific apoM overexpression generates larger nascent HDLs and larger plasma HDLs, which preferentially bind apoM and S1P, and stimulates S1P biosynthesis for secretion. The unique apoM/S1P-enriched plasma HDL may serve to deliver S1P to extrahepatic tissues for atheroprotection and may have other as yet unidentified functions."
https://openalex.org/W2141876587,"Multidrug antiporters of the major facilitator superfamily couple proton translocation to the extrusion of cytotoxic molecules. The conformational changes that underlie the transport cycle and the structural basis of coupling of these transporters have not been elucidated. Here we used extensive double electron-electron resonance measurements to uncover the conformational equilibrium of LmrP, a multidrug transporter from Lactococcus lactis, and to investigate how protons and ligands shift this equilibrium to enable transport. We find that the transporter switches between outward-open and outward-closed conformations, depending on the protonation states of specific acidic residues forming a transmembrane protonation relay. Our data can be framed in a model of transport wherein substrate binding initiates the transport cycle by opening the extracellular side. Subsequent protonation of membrane-embedded acidic residues induces substrate release to the extracellular side and triggers a cascade of conformational changes that concludes in proton release to the intracellular side."
https://openalex.org/W2094962874,"Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) has an essential role in governing cell morphology and motility, and increased ROCK activity contributes to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Burgeoning data suggest that ROCK is also involved in the growth regulation of tumor cells. However, thus far, the molecular mechanisms responsible for ROCK-governed tumor cell growth have not been clearly elucidated. Here we showed that inhibition of ROCK kinase activity, either by a selective ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or by specific ROCK small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, attenuated not only motility but also the proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, mechanistic investigation revealed that ROCK endowed cancer cells with tumorigenic capability, mainly by targeting c-Myc. ROCK could increase the transcriptional activity of c-Myc by promoting c-Myc protein stability, and ROCK inhibition reduced c-Myc-mediated expression of mRNA targets (such as HSPC111) and microRNA targets (such as miR-17-92 cluster). We provided evidence demonstrating that ROCK1 directly interacted with and phosphorylated c-Myc, resulting in stabilization of the protein and activation of its transcriptional activity. Suppression of ROCK-c-Myc downstream molecules, such as c-Myc-regulated miR-17, also impaired tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, c-Myc was shown to exert a positive feedback regulation on ROCK by increasing RhoA mRNA expression. Therefore, inhibition of ROCK and its stimulated signaling might prove to be a promising strategy for restraining tumor progression in prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2053440359,"Cardiolipin (CL) that is synthesized de novo is deacylated to monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is reacylated by tafazzin. Remodeled CL contains mostly unsaturated fatty acids. In eukaryotes, loss of tafazzin leads to growth and respiration defects, and in humans, this results in the life-threatening disorder Barth syndrome. Tafazzin deficiency causes a decrease in the CL/MLCL ratio and decreased unsaturated CL species. Which of these biochemical outcomes contributes to the physiological defects is not known. Yeast cells have a single CL-specific phospholipase, Cld1, that can be exploited to distinguish between these outcomes. The cld1Δ mutant has decreased unsaturated CL, but the CL/MLCL ratio is similar to that of wild type cells. We show that cld1Δ rescues growth, life span, and respiratory defects of the taz1Δ mutant. This suggests that defective growth and respiration in tafazzin-deficient cells are caused by the decreased CL/MLCL ratio and not by a deficiency in unsaturated CL. CLD1 expression is increased during respiratory growth and regulated by the heme activator protein transcriptional activation complex. Overexpression of CLD1 leads to decreased mitochondrial respiration and growth and instability of mitochondrial DNA. However, ATP concentrations are maintained by increasing glycolysis. We conclude that transcriptional regulation of Cld1-mediated deacylation of CL influences energy metabolism by modulating the relative contribution of glycolysis and respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2063390425,"To understand the mechanisms of action of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, two related pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), we applied a variety of '-omics' techniques to the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cell lines: (1) kinase interaction assays, (2) affinity competition on immobilized broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors, (3) affinity chromatography on immobilized (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, (4) whole genome transcriptomics analysis and specific quantitative PCR studies, (5) global quantitative proteomics approach and western blot analysis of selected proteins. Altogether, the results show that the major direct targets of these two molecules belong to the CDKs (1,2,5,7,9,12), DYRKs, CLKs and CK1s families. By inhibiting CDK7, CDK9 and CDK12, these inhibitors transiently reduce RNA polymerase 2 activity, which results in downregulation of a large set of genes. Global transcriptomics and proteomics analysis converge to a central role of MYC transcription factors downregulation. Indeed, CDK inhibitors trigger rapid and massive downregulation of MYCN expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells as well as in nude mice xenografted IMR32 cells. Inhibition of casein kinase 1 may also contribute to the antitumoral activity of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8. This dual mechanism of action may be crucial in the use of these kinase inhibitors for the treatment of MYC-dependent cancers, in particular neuroblastoma where MYCN amplification is a strong predictor factor for high-risk disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018047723,"Cancer metastasis is a lethal problem that claims the lives of over 90% of cancer patients. In this study, we have investigated metastatic potential of cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from mammary tumors of a Brca1-mutant mouse model. Our data indicated that CSCs, which are enriched in CD24(+)CD29(+)/CD49f(+) cell population, displayed much higher migration ability than CD24(-)CD29(-)/CD49f(-) cells in tissue culture and enhanced metastatic potential in allograft-nude mice. CD24(+)CD29(+) cells maintained the ability to differentiate and reconstitute heterogeneity in the metastatic tumors whereas CD24(-)CD29(-) cells could not. Corresponding to their enhanced metastatic ability, CD24(+)CD29(+) cells exhibited features of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Finally, using short hairpin RNA to knock down CD29 and/or CD49f in metastatic cancer cells, we demonstrated that while acute knockdown of CD29 or CD49f alone slightly decreased cell migration ability, knockdown of both genes generated a profound effect to block their migration, revealing an overlapping, yet critical function of both genes in the migration of CSCs. Our findings indicate that in addition to serving as markers of CSCs, CD29 and CD49f may also serve as potential therapeutic targets for cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2043095119,"Lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs) are frequently mutated or overexpressed in cancer and contribute toward malignant behaviors; however, the molecular bases of their oncogenic properties are largely unknown. As TF activities are difficult to inhibit directly with small molecules, the genes and pathways they regulate might represent more tractable targets for drug therapy. We studied GATA6, a TF gene that is frequently amplified or overexpressed in gastric, esophageal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. GATA6-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines cluster in gene expression space, separate from non-overexpressing lines. This expression clustering signifies a shared pathogenic group of genes that GATA6 may regulate through direct cis-element binding. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify GATA6-bound genes and considered TF occupancy in relation to genes that respond to GATA6 depletion in cell lines and track with GATA6 mRNA (synexpression groups) in primary gastric cancers. Among other cellular functions, GATA6-occupied genes control apoptosis and govern the M-phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of GATA6 reduced the levels of the latter transcripts and arrested cells in G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Synexpression in human tumor samples identified likely direct transcriptional targets substantially better than consideration only of transcripts that respond to GATA6 loss in cultured cells. Candidate target genes responded to the loss of GATA6 or its homolog GATA4 and even more to the depletion of both proteins. Many GATA6-dependent genes lacked nearby binding sites but several strongly dependent, synexpressed and GATA6-bound genes encode TFs such as MYC, HES1, RARB and CDX2. Thus, many downstream effects occur indirectly through other TFs and GATA6 activity in gastric cancer is partially redundant with GATA4. This integrative analysis of locus occupancy, gene dependency and synexpression provides a functional signature of GATA6-overexpressing gastric cancers, revealing both limits and new therapeutic directions for a challenging and frequently fatal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012197995,"Noscapine is a phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid investigated for its potent pharmacological properties. Although structurally elucidated more than a century ago, the biosynthesis of noscapine has not been established. Radiotracer studies have shown that noscapine is derived from the protoberberine alkaloid (S)-scoulerine and has been proposed to proceed through (S)-N-methylcanadine. However, pathway intermediates involved in the conversion of N-methylcanadine to noscapine have not been identified. We report the isolation and characterization of the cytochrome P-450 CYP82Y1, which catalyzes the 1-hydroxylation of N-methylcanadine to 1-hydroxy-N-methylcanadine. Comparison of transcript and metabolite profiles of eight opium poppy chemotypes revealed four cytochrome P-450s, three from the CYP82 and one from the CYP719 families, that were tightly correlated with noscapine accumulation. Recombinant CYP82Y1 was the only enzyme that accepted (R,S)-N-methylcanadine as a substrate with strict specificity and high affinity. As expected, CYP82Y1 was abundantly expressed in opium poppy stems where noscapine accumulation is highest among plant organs. Suppression of CYP82Y1 using virus-induced gene silencing caused a significant reduction in the levels of noscapine, narcotoline, and a putative downstream secoberbine intermediate and also resulted in increased accumulation of the upstream pathway intermediates scoulerine, tetrahydrocolum-bamine, canadine, and N-methylcanadine. The combined biochemical and physiological data support the 1-hydroxylation of (S)-N-methylcanadine catalyzed by CYP82Y1 as the first committed step in the formation of noscapine in opium poppy."
https://openalex.org/W2092514903,"Biohydrogen gas has enormous potential as a source of reductant for the microbial production of biofuels, but its low solubility and poor gas mass transfer rates are limiting factors. These limitations could be circumvented by engineering biofuel production in microorganisms that are also capable of generating H2 from highly soluble chemicals such as formate, which can function as an electron donor. Herein, the model hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus furiosus, which grows optimally near 100 °C by fermenting sugars to produce H2, has been engineered to also efficiently convert formate to H2. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome vector, the 16.9-kb 18-gene cluster encoding the membrane-bound, respiratory formate hydrogen lyase complex of Thermococcus onnurineus was inserted into the P. furiosus chromosome and expressed as a functional unit. This enabled P. furiosus to utilize formate as well as sugars as an H2 source and to do so at both 80° and 95 °C, near the optimum growth temperature of the donor (T. onnurineus) and engineered host (P. furiosus), respectively. This accomplishment also demonstrates the versatility of P. furiosus for metabolic engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W1967942094,"Substrates of a major drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 display increased elimination during pregnancy, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown in part due to a lack of experimental models. Here, we introduce CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice as an animal model where hepatic CYP2D6 expression is increased during pregnancy. In the mouse livers, expression of a known positive regulator of CYP2D6, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), did not change during pregnancy. However, HNF4α recruitment to CYP2D6 promoter increased at term pregnancy, accompanied by repressed expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP). In HepG2 cells, SHP repressed HNF4α transactivation of CYP2D6 promoter. In transgenic (Tg)-CYP2D6 mice, SHP knockdown led to a significant increase in CYP2D6 expression. Retinoic acid, an endogenous compound that induces SHP, exhibited decreased hepatic levels during pregnancy in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. Administration of all-trans-retinoic acid led to a significant decrease in the expression and activity of hepatic CYP2D6 in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. This study provides key insights into mechanisms underlying altered CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism during pregnancy, laying a foundation for improved drug therapy in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2059909324,"Mice in which lung epithelial cells can be induced to express an oncogenic Kras(G12D) develop lung adenocarcinomas in a manner analogous to humans. A myriad of genetic changes accompany lung adenocarcinomas, many of which are poorly understood. To get a comprehensive understanding of both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes that accompany lung adenocarcinomas, we took an omics approach in profiling both the coding genes and the non-coding small RNAs in an induced mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. RNAseq transcriptome analysis of Kras(G12D) tumors from F1 hybrid mice revealed features specific to tumor samples. This includes the repression of a network of GTPase-related genes (Prkg1, Gnao1 and Rgs9) in tumor samples and an enrichment of Apobec1-mediated cytosine to uridine RNA editing. Furthermore, analysis of known single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed not only a change in expression of Cd22 but also that its expression became allele specific in tumors. The most salient finding, however, came from small RNA sequencing of the tumor samples, which revealed that a cluster of ∼53 microRNAs and mRNAs at the Dlk1-Dio3 locus on mouse chromosome 12qF1 was markedly and consistently increased in tumors. Activation of this locus occurred specifically in sorted tumor-originating cancer cells. Interestingly, the 12qF1 RNAs were repressed in cultured Kras(G12D) tumor cells but reactivated when transplanted in vivo. These microRNAs have been implicated in stem cell pleuripotency and proteins targeted by these microRNAs are involved in key pathways in cancer as well as embryogenesis. Taken together, our results strongly imply that these microRNAs represent key targets in unraveling the mechanism of lung oncogenesis."

ILD is characterized by recurrent injury to the alveolar epithelium, resulting in distortion of its architecture and a failure of tissue repair. Tissue fibrosis is regarded as a final consequence when organs face continuous injury. In response to stimuli from injured areas, affected tissues initially undergo a series of steps typical of wound healing. Injury is followed by 1) damage to the basement membrane of the epithelial/endothelial barrier; 2) release of TGF-β1, the major fibrogenic cytokine; 3) overexpression of hyaluronan (HA); 4) recruitment of inflammatory cells; 5) induction of reactive oxygen species; 6) activation of collagen-producing cells; and 7) matrix activation of myofibroblasts. When the cause of continuous injury is removed, the basement membrane of the epithelial/endothelial barrier can regain its integrity, and reversal of fibrosis can occur. However, when exposed to chronic injuries, the wound-healing process fails, leading to tissue fibrosis, which is characterized by the overproduction of extracellular matrix, which ultimately causes fibrotic lesions and tissue scarring. interstitial lung disease hepatocyte growth factor hyaluronan CD44 containing variable exon 6 ILD fibroblast normal lung fibroblast α-smooth muscle cell actin systemic sclerosis collagen type I c-Met pSicoR-scrambled shRNA pSicoR-CD44v6 shRNA pSicoR-Met shRNA quantitative RT-PCR pAKT, and pp38, phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and p38MAPK, and Smad2, respectively.

Importantly, involvement of the closely connected CD44v6 with TGF-β1-induced Met has not been studied in ILD. The aim of the current study was to define the relationships between CD44v6, Met, and TGF-β1 autoregulation and the potential modulating influence of HGF on TGF-β1-induced CD44v6-dependent signaling and function in ILD fibrosis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) low glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate were from Life Technologies. Fetal bovine serum was from Atlanta Biologicals, and l-glutamine, gentamicin sulfate, and amphotericin B were from Hyclone. Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, Nonidet P-40, EGTA, sodium orthovanadate, glycerol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies against c-Met, CD44, collagen-1, HSP47, Smad7, phosphorylated Smad2, TGF-βRI, α-SMA, pERK, ERK, GAPDH, β-actin, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, and Luminol reagent were purchased from commercial sources (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Abcam, Ebioscience, Thermo Fisher, Cell Signaling Technology, and Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.). The bromodeoxyuridine kit was purchased from Millipore Corp. CD44v6 siRNA, Met siRNA, and TGF-β1 siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by ID Technology. ILDFbs, isolated from lung tissues, were obtained from Dr. Galina Bogatkevich, Dr. R. M. Silver, and Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick. The lung tissues were obtained from autopsy and from explants following lung transplantation from three scleroderma patients. Normal lung tissues were isolated from three age- and gender-matched normal healthy subjects whose lungs were not used for transplantation. 6-Week-old mice (C57BL/6 strain) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Bleomycin (0.05 units/20 g of animal) was instilled intratracheally. All animal care and experimentation were done in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee protocol (AR 3220) approved by the Medical University of South Carolina according to the rules of the National Institutes of Health. Lung tissues at 21 days after vehicle or bleomycin (Sigma) instillations were perfused with Z-Fix (Anatech Ltd.) and processed for paraffin sections. Fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as reported previously (31Hsu E. Shi H. Jordan R.M. Lyons-Weiler J. Pilewski J.M. Feghali-Bostwick C.A. Lung tissues in patients with systemic sclerosis have gene expression patterns unique to pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension.Arthritis Rheum. 2011; 63: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, lung tissues were diced (∼0.5 × 0.5-mm pieces) and cultured in DMEM with normal glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, gentamicin sulfate (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days to remove dead and non-attached cells until fibroblasts reached confluence. Monolayer cultures were maintained in the same medium. Lung fibroblasts were used between the second and fourth passages in all experiments. The purity of isolated lung fibroblasts was determined by crystal violet staining and by immunofluorescence staining using monoclonal antibody 3C4 against human fibroblasts as described previously (26Bogatkevich G.S.

The proteins on the blots were analyzed with antibodies for c-Met, CD44v6, CD44s, HSP47, ERK, pERK, AKT, pAKT, p38MAPK, and pp38MAPK (β-tubulin and β-actin were used as internal standards) and detected by Luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) following treatment with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies as secondary antibodies. Each protein was analyzed in samples from at least three independent experiments from each set of fibroblasts. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ∼1–1.5 × 107 fibroblasts. Cells were washed in ice-cold 1× PBS and incubated for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. At the end of the incubation, 0.1 volumes of 1% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the lysates were immediately centrifuged at low speed (∼350 × g) at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C with vigorous shaking, the lysed nuclei were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to clear the debris. The supernatants were aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. 30-μg protein samples were separated using 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2) (Ser-465/467; 1:1000) and reprobed for β-actin (1:1500) (antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology).

Cell proliferation was determined in immunofluorescence-based assays by BrdU incorporation in NLFb and ILDFb cultures treated with or without TGF-β1 using Millipore's HCS213 assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (4 × 103) were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. 48 h after incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were serum-starved in serum-free medium (QBSF-51).

https://openalex.org/W2072268939,"As a multifaceted molecule, p21 plays multiple critical roles in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, senescence, aging and stem cell reprogramming. The important roles of p21 in the interphase of the cell cycle have been intensively investigated. The function of p21 in mitosis has been proposed but not systematically studied. We show here that p21 is abundant in mitosis and binds to and inhibits the activity of Cdk1/cyclin B1. Deficiency of p21 prolongs the duration of mitosis by extending metaphase, anaphase and cytokinesis. The activity of Aurora B is reduced and the localization of Aurora B on the central spindle is disturbed in anaphase cells without p21. Moreover, HCT116 p21-/-, HeLa and Saos-2 cells depleted of p21 encounter problems in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Gently inhibiting the mitotic Cdk1 or add-back of p21 rescues segregation defect in HCT116 p21-/- cells. Our data demonstrate that p21 is important for a fine-tuned control of the Cdk1 activity in mitosis, and its proper function facilitates a smooth mitotic progression. Given that p21 is downregulated in the majority of tumors, either by the loss of tumor suppressors like p53 or by hyperactive oncogenes such as c-myc, this finding also sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms by which p21 functions as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2090646422,"Annexin A5 belongs to a large family of calcium-binding and phospholipid-binding proteins and may act as an endogenous regulator of various pathophysiological processes. There is increasing evidence that annexin A5 is related to cytotoxicity, but the precise function of this protein has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to verify the function of annexin A5 in the apoptosis of renal epithelial cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, together with immunofluorescence analysis, showed that the expression of annexin A5 significantly increased in the presence of cisplatin in both human and rat renal epithelial cells. With regard to the mechanism of cisplatin-induced apoptosis, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release into the cytosol was observed, and the underlying mechanism was identified as voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) oligomerization. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was found to be greatly disrupted in cisplatin-treated cells. Moreover, cisplatin strongly induced translocation of annexin A5 into mitochondria. To understand the functional significance of annexin A5 in renal cell death, we used a siRNA-mediated approach to knock down annexin A5. Annexin A5 depletion by siRNA led to decreased annexin A5 translocation into mitochondria and significantly reduced VDAC oligomerization and AIF release. Annexin A5 siRNA also increased cell viability compared with the control. Moreover, expression of annexin A5 was induced by other nephrotoxicants such as CdCl2 and bacitracin. Taken together, our data suggest that annexin A5 may play a crucial role in cisplatin-induced toxicity by mediating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via the induction and oligomerization of VDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2085275254,"Parasympathetic activity decreases heart rate (HR) by inhibiting pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN). Dysregulation of parasympathetic influence has been linked to sinus node dysfunction and arrhythmia. RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins are negative modulators of the parasympathetic regulation of HR and the prototypical M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R)-dependent signaling pathway in the SAN that involves the muscarinic-gated atrial K(+) channel IKACh. Both RGS4 and RGS6-Gβ5 have been implicated in these processes. Here, we used Rgs4(-/-), Rgs6(-/-), and Rgs4(-/-):Rgs6(-/-) mice to compare the relative influence of RGS4 and RGS6 on parasympathetic regulation of HR and M2R-IKACh-dependent signaling in the SAN. In retrogradely perfused hearts, ablation of RGS6, but not RGS4, correlated with decreased resting HR, increased heart rate variability, and enhanced sensitivity to the negative chronotropic effects of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. Similarly, loss of RGS6, but not RGS4, correlated with enhanced sensitivity of the M2R-IKACh signaling pathway in SAN cells to carbachol and a significant slowing of M2R-IKACh deactivation rate. Surprisingly, concurrent genetic ablation of RGS4 partially rescued some deficits observed in Rgs6(-/-) mice. These findings, together with those from an acute pharmacologic approach in SAN cells from Rgs6(-/-) and Gβ5(-/-) mice, suggest that the partial rescue of phenotypes in Rgs4(-/-):Rgs6(-/-) mice is attributable to another R7 RGS protein whose influence on M2R-IKACh signaling is masked by RGS4. Thus, RGS6-Gβ5, but not RGS4, is the primary RGS modulator of parasympathetic HR regulation and SAN M2R-IKACh signaling in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2081396536,"Iontophoresis is a technology for transdermal delivery of ionic small medicines by faint electricity. Since iontophoresis can noninvasively deliver charged molecules into the skin, this technology could be a useful administration method that may enhance patient comfort. Previously, we succeeded in the transdermal penetration of positively charged liposomes (diameters: 200-400 nm) encapsulating insulin by iontophoresis (Kajimoto, K., Yamamoto, M., Watanabe, M., Kigasawa, K., Kanamura, K., Harashima, H., and Kogure, K. (2011) Int. J. Pharm. 403, 57-65). However, the mechanism by which these liposomes penetrated the skin was difficult to define based on general knowledge of principles such as electro-repulsion and electro-osmosis. In the present study, we confirmed that rigid nanoparticles could penetrate into the epidermis by iontophoresis. We further found that levels of the gap junction protein connexin 43 protein significantly decreased after faint electric stimulus (ES) treatment, although occludin, CLD-4, and ZO-1 levels were unchanged. Moreover, connexin 43 phosphorylation and filamentous actin depolymerization in vivo and in vitro were observed when permeation of charged liposomes through intercellular spaces was induced by ES. Ca(2+) inflow into cells was promoted by ES with charged liposomes, while a protein kinase C inhibitor prevented ES-induced permeation of macromolecules. Consequently, we demonstrate that ES treatment with charged liposomes induced dissociation of intercellular junctions via cell signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ES could be used to regulate skin physiology."

https://openalex.org/W2031563240,"Pregnancy-associated breast cancers (PABCs) are tumors diagnosed during pregnancy or up to 5 years following parturition, and are usually high-grade, connective tissue-rich, and estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor-negative. Little is known about the cellular origin of PABCs or the mechanisms by which PABCs are initiated. Using the RCAS retrovirus to deliver the ErbB2 oncogene into the mammary epithelium of our previously reported MMTV-tva transgenic mice, we detected high-grade, poorly differentiated, stroma-rich and ER-negative tumors during pregnancy and lactation. These high-grade and stroma-rich tumors were less frequent in involuted mice or in age-matched nulliparous mice. More importantly, by generating a WAP-tva transgenic line for expression of ErbB2 selectively in WAP(+) mammary alveolar cells, we found that tumors had similar morphological phenotypes (high grade, poorly differentiated, stroma-rich and ER-negative), irrespective of the time since pregnancy and even in the absence of pregnancy. These data suggest that PABCs arise preferentially from an alveolar cell population that expands during pregnancy and lactation. This somatic mouse model may also be useful for preclinical testing of new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against PABC."
https://openalex.org/W2015707911,"Nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription is activated by Gln3 and Gat1. In nitrogen excess, Gln3 and Gat1 are cytoplasmic, and transcription is minimal. In poor nitrogen, Gln3 and Gat1 become nuclear and activate transcription. A long standing paradox has surrounded Gat1 production. Gat1 was first reported as an NCR-regulated activity mediating NCR-sensitive transcription in gln3 deletion strains. Upon cloning, GAT1 transcription was, as predicted, NCR-sensitive and Gln3- and Gat1-activated. In contrast, Western blots of Gat1-Myc(13) exhibited two constitutively produced species. Investigating this paradox, we demonstrate that wild type Gat1 isoforms (IsoA and IsoB) are initiated at Gat1 methionines 40, 95, and/or 102, but not at methionine 1. Their low level production is the same in rich and poor nitrogen conditions. When the Myc(13) tag is placed after Gat1 Ser-233, four N-terminal Gat1 isoforms (IsoC-F) are also initiated at methionines 40, 95, and/or 102. However, their production is highly NCR-sensitive, being greater in proline than glutamine medium. Surprisingly, all Gat1 isoforms produced in sufficient quantities to be confidently analyzed (IsoA, IsoC, and IsoD) require Gln3 and UASGATA promoter elements, both requirements typical of NCR-sensitive transcription. These data demonstrate that regulated Gat1 production is more complex than previously recognized, with wild type versus truncated Gat1 proteins failing to be regulated in parallel. This is the first reported instance of Gln3 UASGATA-dependent protein production failing to derepress in nitrogen poor conditions. A Gat1-lacZ ORF swap experiment indicated sequence(s) responsible for the nonparallel production are downstream of Gat1 leucine 61."
https://openalex.org/W1986199300,"The human homolog of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, hHR23A, has been found previously to interact with the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 accessory protein Vpr. hHR23A is a modular protein containing an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and two ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA1 and UBA2) separated by a xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C binding (XPCB) domain. All domains are connected by flexible linkers. hHR23A binds ubiquitinated proteins and acts as a shuttling factor to the proteasome. Here, we show that hHR23A utilizes both the UBA2 and XPCB domains to form a stable complex with Vpr, linking Vpr directly to cellular DNA repair pathways and their probable exploitation by the virus. Detailed structural mapping of the Vpr contacts on hHR23A, by NMR, revealed substantial contact surfaces on the UBA2 and XPCB domains. In addition, Vpr binding disrupts an intramolecular UBL-UBA2 interaction. We also show that Lys-48-linked di-ubiquitin, when binding to UBA1, does not release the bound Vpr from the hHR23A-Vpr complex. Instead, a ternary hHR23A·Vpr·di-Ub(K48) complex is formed, indicating that Vpr does not necessarily abolish hHR23A-mediated shuttling to the proteasome."

Previous studies suggested that the second Glu was involved in binding a third noncatalytic ion in bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase. In the protein-primed DNA polymerase subgroup, the LEXE motif lacks the first Glu in most cases, but it has a conserved Phe/Trp and a Gly preceding that position. To ascertain the role of those residues, we have analyzed the behavior of mutants at the corresponding φ29 DNA polymerase residues Gly-481, Trp-483, Ala-484, and Glu-486.

Faithful synthesis of DNA depends mostly on the high intrinsic nucleotide selectivity exhibited by replicative DNA polymerases that bind correct dNTPs with about 10- to >1000-fold higher affinity than incorrect dNTPs. Such a selectivity relies on the common structure of their polymerization domains formed by the universal fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains that form a U-shaped groove responsible for dsDNA binding (1Kunkel T.A.

Therefore, the high insertion fidelity displayed by DNA polymerases largely depends on the geometrical fitting between a canonical Watson-Crick base pair and this pocket (9Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Once the polymerization domain has adopted the catalytically competent closed state, phosphodiester bond formation between the 3′-OH group of the growing strand and the α-phosphate of the incoming dNTP takes place. Extensive structural, kinetic, and mutational studies performed in a great variety of DNA polymerases have given sufficient experimental evidence for the two-metal ion mechanism as the one responsible for the phosphoryl transfer reaction (4Doublié S.

Thus, metal ion A would lower the pKa value of the 3′-OH group to support its attack on the α-phosphate of the incoming dNTP, whereas metal ion B chelates the β- and γ-phosphates, stabilizing the pentacovalent transition state and facilitating the further pyrophosphate release (14Steitz T.A.

Two conserved carboxylic residues placed at the palm subdomain and belonging to conserved sequence motifs A and C coordinate these two metal ions. Although the two-metal ion mechanism for nucleotide insertion in DNA polymerases has been accepted for many years, recent crystallographic studies show the involvement of a third metal ion located between α- and β-phosphates of the incoming nucleotide in the Y family DNA polymerase η (17Nakamura T.

In the former case, it was proposed as a transition state stabilization role for the third metal ion, whereas in pol 4The abbreviations used are: polpolymeraseTPterminal proteinexoexonuclease. β, a potential role during pyrophosphorolysis, the reversal of the polymerization reaction has been suggested. polymerase terminal protein exonuclease. Bacteriophage φ29 DNA polymerase is a protein-primed DNA-dependent replicase belonging to the eukaryotic type family of DNA polymerases (family B). Like many other replicative polymerases, besides the 5′–3′ synthetic activity, in the same polypeptide chain it contains a 3′–5′-exonuclease that proofreads polymerization errors (19Blanco L. Salas M. Characterization of a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity in the phage φ29-encoded DNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Garmendia C. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Blanco L. Salas M. The bacteriophage φ29 DNA polymerase, a proofreading enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2594-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase forms a heterodimer with the phage terminal protein (TP) to initiate DNA replication at the origins, located at both ends of the linear genome. Thus, the polymerase catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between the initiator dAMP and the hydroxyl group of Ser-232 of the primer TP (21Salas M. Protein-priming of DNA replication.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) in the so-called initiation reaction. Once the TP-dAMP initiation product is formed, the same DNA polymerase catalyzes processive chain elongation via a strand displacement mechanism to fulfill TP-DNA replication (22Blanco L. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Martín G. Garmendia C. Salas M. Highly efficient DNA synthesis by the phage φ29 DNA polymerase. Symmetrical mode of DNA replication.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8935-8940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structure of φ29 DNA polymerase ternary complex has shown that metal ions A and B are coordinated not only by the α- and γ-phosphates of the incoming nucleotide and the catalytic residues Asp-249 (motif A) and Asp-458 (motif C), but also by the carbonyl group of Val-250 (motif A) (3Berman A.J. Kamtekar S. Goodman J.L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Blanco L. Salas M. Steitz T.A. Structures of φ29 DNA polymerase complexed with substrate: the mechanism of translocation in B-family polymerases.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved in the protein-primed subgroup of DNA polymerases (see Fig. 1A). In addition, multiple sequence alignments identified a conserved Glu residue (Glu-486 in φ29 DNA polymerase) placed at the polymerization active site of family B DNA polymerases. This residue has been originally proposed as a new indirect ligand of a noncatalytic metal ion C in RB69 DNA polymerase (5Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

Ito J. Compilation, alignment, and phylogenetic relationships of DNA polymerases.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to ascertain the role of residues belonging to the LEXE motif of family B DNA polymerases during the polymerization reaction, using as a model the φ29 DNA polymerase. The biochemical analyses of φ29 DNA polymerase mutants at residues Gly-481, Trp-483, Glu-486 (see Fig. 1B), and Ala-484 suggest a role for this motif in establishing indirect contacts with the incoming dNTP at the polymerization active site and support the presence of a third metal ion at the catalytic site. Unlabeled nucleotides and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides 15-mer (5′-GATCACAGTGAGTAC), 21-mer (5′-TCTATTGTACTCACTGTGATC), and 21-mer-A (5′-TCTATAGTACTCACTGTGATC) were purified electrophoretically on 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels. The 15-mer oligonucleotide was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and further hybridized to the 21-mer and 21-mer-A oligonucleotides in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, resulting in a primer-template molecule that can be used in the coupled DNA polymerization/exonuclease assay. M13mp18 single-stranded DNA was hybridized to the universal primer in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the resulting molecule was used as a primer-template to analyze processive DNA polymerization coupled to strand displacement by φ29 DNA polymerase variants. Terminal protein-containing φ29 DNA (φ29 TP-DNA) was obtained as described (25Peñalva M.A. Salas M.

U.S.A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Wild-type φ29 DNA polymerase was purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pJLPM (a derivative of pT7-4w2), as described (26Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M.

The DNA polymerase mutants were obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit provided by Stratagene, using as template a recombinant derivative of plasmid pT7-4 (28Tabor S.

The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of additional ones were determined by sequencing the entire gene. DNA polymerase mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and further purified essentially as described for the wild-type DNA polymerase (26Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. Purification of bacteriophage φ29 DNA polymerase.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primer-template molecule 15/21-mer (double-stranded DNA; dsDNA) contains a 6-nucleotide 5′-protruding end and therefore can be used as substrate for the exonuclease activity (dsDNA) and also for DNA-dependent DNA polymerization. The incubation mixture contained, in 12.5 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 25 ng of wild-type or the indicated mutant φ29 DNA polymerase. Protein was incubated with 1.2 nm of 5′-labeled 15/21-mer substrate and the indicated increasing concentrations of the four dNTPs. After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA up to a final concentration of 10 mm. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels, and autoradiography. Polymerization or 3′–5′-exonucleolysis was detected as an increase or decrease, respectively, in the size (15-mer) of the 5′-labeled primer. The measurements were performed essentially as described (30Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Gel fidelity assay measuring nucleotide misinsertion, exonucleolytic proofreading, and lesion bypass efficiencies.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained in a final volume of 12.5 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.2 nm of the 5′-labeled 15/21-mer-A substrate, and the indicated concentrations of either the correct (dTTP) or incorrect (dCTP) nucleotide. Reaction times and enzyme concentration were adjusted for each polymerase to optimize product detection while ensuring that all reactions were conducted in the steady state. Only those reactions that fell within the linear range of substrate utilization (<30% primer extension) were used for analysis. Apparent value for Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the correct dTTP in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 was carried out with the following amounts of exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase: WTExo− (1 ng); G481FExo− (25 ng); G481LExo− (1 ng); W483FExo− (1 ng); W483LExo− (4 ng); A484EExo− (1 ng); E486AExo− (2 ng); and E486DExo− (2 ng). In the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, the amount of DNA polymerases were as follows: WTExo− (1.25 ng); G481FExo− (30 ng); G481LExo− (3 ng); W483FExo− (1 ng); W483LExo− (1.5 ng); A484EExo− (1.5 ng); E486AExo− (1 ng), and E486DExo− (1 ng). Estimation of the Km value for the incorrect dCTP was carried out in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and the following amounts of DNA polymerase: WTExo− (2 ng); G481FExo− (14 ng); G481LExo− (6 ng); W483FExo− (1.5 ng); W483LExo− (5 ng); A484EExo− (6 ng); E486AExo− (6 ng), and E486DExo− (4 ng). Samples were incubated for 30 s at 25 °C and quenched by adding EDTA up to 10 mm. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Formation of the extended product was plotted against dNTP concentration. Apparent values for Km and the corresponding Vmax were obtained by least squares nonlinear regression to a rectangular hyperbola using Kaleidagraph 3.6.4 software. The discrimination factor during nucleotide addition was defined as the ratio of incorrect to correct insertion catalytic efficiencies (30Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Gel fidelity assay measuring nucleotide misinsertion, exonucleolytic proofreading, and lesion bypass efficiencies.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Data are shown as mean ± S.D. corresponding to four independent experiments. The incubation mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 40 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (1 μCi), 0.25 μg of primed M13mp18 single-stranded DNA, and 100 ng of either wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerases. After incubation for the indicated times at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS, and the samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns. Relative activity was calculated from Cerenkov radiation corresponding to the excluded volume. For size analysis, the labeled DNA was denatured by treatment with 0.7 m NaOH, and subjected to electrophoresis in alkaline 0.7% agarose gels, as described (31McDonell M.W. Simon M.N. Studier F.W.

After electrophoresis, the position of unit length φ29 DNA (19285 bases) was detected by ethidium bromide staining, and then the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The ability to carry out the initiation step during TP-DNA replication was analyzed as described (32de Vega M. Blanco L.

Samples were incubated for 4 min (with Mg2+) or 2 min (with Mn2+) at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and the samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% polyacrylamide gels. Quantification was done by densitometric analysis of the labeled band corresponding to the TP-dAMP complex detected by autoradiography. Pyrophosphorolytic activity was measured on the 15/21-mer substrate. The reaction mixture contained in 12.5 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 ng of the 3′–5′-exonuclease-deficient wild-type or mutant φ29 DNA polymerases to avoid exonuclease activity on this substrate, 1.2 nm of the 5′-labeled 15/21-mer, either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 as metal activator, and the indicated concentrations of tetra-sodium pyrophosphate (Merck). After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to 10 mm. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments of family B DNA polymerases allowed the identification in their polymerization domain of a conserved motif with the consensus sequence LEXE (24Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Compilation, alignment, and phylogenetic relationships of DNA polymerases.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The second glutamate of this motif was previously proposed to interact with the γ-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide through a third noncatalytic metal ion and a water molecule at the polymerization active site of bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase (5Franklin M.C.

In the protein-primed subgroup of DNA polymerases, only the second Glu residue is conserved (in cyan in Fig. 2). Preceding the first Glu, bacterial, viral, and cellular DNA polymerases show a conserved Leu residue, whereas most members of the protein-primed subgroup have an aromatic residue (Phe/Trp) (colored in green in Fig. 2). In addition, protein-primed DNA polymerases contain a conserved Gly residue located two positions N-terminally from the aromatic one (in dark blue in Fig. 2), unlike the Leu/Ile amino acid exhibited by the polymerases belonging to the cellular, viral, and bacterial subgroups. Crystallographic resolution of φ29 DNA polymerase ternary complex structure showed that the corresponding residues Gly-481 and Trp-483 are forming a structural cavity with residue Leu-253 (from motif A) (see Fig. 1B) (3Berman A.J.

Such hydrophobic pocket would allocate the side chain of φ29 DNA polymerase Val-250, a residue that participates in the coordination of metal B (3Berman A.J. Kamtekar S. Goodman J.L.

To analyze the effect of mutations in each of the amino acids described above, single changes were introduced at residues Gly-481, Trp-483, Ala-484, and Glu-486 of φ29 DNA polymerase. Gly-481 was mutated to Leu (G481L), as this residue is the most abundant in the rest of DNA polymerases, and to Phe (G481F), because several bacterial/viral DNA polymerases contain this residue at the homologous position. Trp-483 was substituted for Phe (W483F), as in other protein-primed members, and for Leu (W483L), because this residue is conserved in the rest of DNA polymerases. Ala-484 was changed into Glu (A484E) as in the case of the cellular, viral, and bacterial DNA polymerases. Finally, residue Glu-486 was replaced by Ala (E486A), to eliminate the electronegative charge, and by Asp (E486D), to conserve it. Site-directed mutagenesis and protein purification were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As in most replicases, the exonuclease and polymerization activities of φ29 DNA polymerase reside in the structurally independent N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (34Blanco L.

Despite their structural separation, both active sites must work in concert to ensure a productive and faithful DNA synthesis, preventing the accumulation of errors in the newly synthesized strand while allowing a proper elongation rate. The decision to synthesize versus to degrade the primer-terminus depends on several factors, the relative velocity of both activities and the comparative stabilization of the primer-terminus at such active sites (36Joyce C.M.
