https://openalex.org/W3198233589,"Abstract The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout India, outcompeting pre-existing lineages including B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) 1 . In vitro, B.1.617.2 is sixfold less sensitive to serum neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals, and eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies, compared with wild-type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralizing titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx1 vaccinees than in BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies to the receptor-binding domain and the amino-terminal domain. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency than B.1.1.7 in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems, associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared with B.1.1.7 spike. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate highly efficient syncytium formation that was less sensitive to inhibition by neutralizing antibody, compared with that of wild-type spike. We also observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike-mediated entry than B.1.617.1, potentially explaining the B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of more than 130 SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation, we observed reduced ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2, with the caveat of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine efficacy against the highly fit and immune-evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era."

The SAVE-MORE double-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of anakinra, an IL-1α/β inhibitor, in 594 patients with COVID-19 at risk of progressing to respiratory failure as identified by plasma suPAR ≥6 ng ml-1, 85.9% (n = 510) of whom were receiving dexamethasone. At day 28, the adjusted proportional odds of having a worse clinical status (assessed by the 11-point World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS)) with anakinra, as compared to placebo, was 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.26-0.50). The median WHO-CPS decrease on day 28 from baseline in the placebo and anakinra groups was 3 and 4 points, respectively (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40, P < 0.0001); the respective median decrease of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 7 from baseline was 0 and 1 points (OR = 0.63, P = 0.004). Twenty-eight-day mortality decreased (hazard ratio = 0.45, P = 0.045), and hospital stay was shorter."

https://openalex.org/W3196495189,"Abstract Molecular profiling of single cells has advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of development. However, current approaches mostly rely on dissociating cells from tissues, thereby losing the crucial spatial context of regulatory processes. Here, we apply an image-based single-cell transcriptomics method, sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), to detect mRNAs for 387 target genes in tissue sections of mouse embryos at the 8–12 somite stage. By integrating spatial context and multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome atlases, we characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate that spatially resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning of the midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB) and the developing gut tube. We uncover axes of cell differentiation that are not apparent from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, such as early dorsal–ventral separation of esophageal and tracheal progenitor populations in the gut tube. Our method provides an approach for studying cell fate decisions in complex tissues and development."

Here, we report the metabolic changes associated with the peripheral immune response of 198 individuals with COVID-19 through an integrated analysis of plasma metabolite and protein levels as well as single-cell multiomics analyses from serial blood draws collected during the first week after clinical diagnosis. We document the emergence of rare but metabolically dominant T cell subpopulations and find that increasing disease severity correlates with a bifurcation of monocytes into two metabolically distinct subsets. This integrated analysis reveals a robust interplay between plasma metabolites and cell-type-specific metabolic reprogramming networks that is associated with disease severity and could predict survival."
https://openalex.org/W3197562406,"Cancers adapt to increasingly potent targeted therapies by reprogramming their phenotype. Here we investigated such a phenomenon in prostate cancer, in which tumours can escape epithelial lineage confinement and transition to a high-plasticity state as an adaptive response to potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonism. We found that AR activity can be maintained as tumours adopt alternative lineage identities, with changes in chromatin architecture guiding AR transcriptional rerouting. The epigenetic regulator enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) co-occupies the reprogrammed AR cistrome to transcriptionally modulate stem cell and neuronal gene networks—granting privileges associated with both fates. This function of EZH2 was associated with T350 phosphorylation and establishment of a non-canonical polycomb subcomplex. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the plasticity of the lineage-infidelity state governed by AR reprogramming that enabled us to redirect cell fate by modulating EZH2 and AR, highlighting the clinical potential of reversing resistance phenotypes. Davies et al. demonstrate that androgen receptor–targeted therapy induces lineage-plastic transcriptional reprogramming, which is mediated by EZH2 and favours stem cell and neuronal gene networks in treatment-resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3197597953,"Ductal cells have been proposed as a source of adult β cell neogenesis, but this has remained controversial. By combining lineage tracing, 3D imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches, we show that ductal cells contribute to the β cell population over time. Lineage tracing using the Neurogenin3 (Ngn3)-CreERT line identified ductal cells expressing the endocrine master transcription factor Ngn3 that were positive for the δ cell marker somatostatin and occasionally co-expressed insulin. The number of hormone-expressing ductal cells was increased in Akita+/- diabetic mice, and ngn3 heterozygosity accelerated diabetes onset. scRNA-seq of Ngn3 lineage-traced islet cells indicated that duct-derived somatostatin-expressing cells, some of which retained expression of ductal markers, gave rise to β cells. This study identified Ngn3-expressing ductal cells as a source of adult β cell neogenesis in homeostasis and diabetes, suggesting that this mechanism, in addition to β cell proliferation, maintains the adult islet β cell population."
https://openalex.org/W3197446795,"The seasonal nature of outbreaks of respiratory viral infections with increased transmission during low temperatures has been well established. Accordingly, temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein is known to bind to its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral fusion. Using biochemical, biophysical, and functional assays to dissect the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction, we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures, resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike glycoprotein with the ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly, the RBD N501Y mutation, present in emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that are fueling the pandemic worldwide (including the B.1.1.7 (α) lineage), bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested."
https://openalex.org/W3197249571,"Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet the low donor pool, poor islet engraftment, and life-long immunosuppression prevent it from becoming the standard of care. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic cells could eliminate donor shortages, but interventions to improve graft survival are needed. Here, we enhanced subcutaneous engraftment by employing a unique vascularization strategy based on ready-made microvessels (MVs) isolated from the adipose tissue. This resulted in improved cell survival and effective glucose response of both human islets and hESC-derived pancreatic cells, which ameliorated preexisting diabetes in three mouse models of T1D."

https://openalex.org/W3198512815,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarize genetic liability to a disease at the individual level, and the aim is to use them as biomarkers of disease and poor outcomes in real-world clinical practice. To date, few studies have assessed the prognostic value of PRS relative to standards of care. Schizophrenia (SCZ), the archetypal psychotic illness, is an ideal test case for this because the predictive power of the SCZ PRS exceeds that of most other common diseases. Here, we analyzed clinical and genetic data from two multi-ethnic cohorts totaling 8,541 adults with SCZ and related psychotic disorders, to assess whether the SCZ PRS improves the prediction of poor outcomes relative to clinical features captured in a standard psychiatric interview. For all outcomes investigated, the SCZ PRS did not improve the performance of predictive models, an observation that was generally robust to divergent case ascertainment strategies and the ancestral background of the study participants. The inclusion of polygenic risk scores does not improve the performance of standard-of-care predictive models of disease outcomes in patients with psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W3196675602,"Many animals have a conserved adaptive genome defence system known as the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which is essential for germ cell development and function. Disruption of individual mouse Piwi genes results in male but not female sterility, leading to the assumption that PIWI genes play little or no role in mammalian oocytes. Here, we report the generation of PIWI-defective golden hamsters, which have defects in the production of functional oocytes. The mechanisms involved vary among the hamster PIWI genes, whereby the lack of PIWIL1 has a major impact on gene expression, including hamster-specific young transposon de-silencing, whereas PIWIL3 deficiency has little impact on gene expression in oocytes, although DNA methylation was reduced to some extent in PIWIL3-deficient oocytes. Our findings serve as the foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W3198191819,"Background The objective of this study is to document whether and to what extent there is an association between socioeconomic status (SES) and disease outcomes in the last five influenza pandemics. Methods/principle findings The review included studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Records were identified through systematic literature searches in six databases. We summarized results narratively and through meta-analytic strategies. Only studies for the 1918 and 2009 pandemics were identified. Of 14 studies on the 2009 pandemic including data on both medical and social risk factors, after controlling for medical risk factors 8 demonstrated independent impact of SES. In the random effect analysis of 46 estimates from 35 studies we found a pooled mean odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2–1.7, p &lt; 0.001), comparing the lowest to the highest SES, but with substantial effect heterogeneity across studies,–reflecting differences in outcome measures and definitions of case and control samples. Analyses by pandemic period (1918 or 2009) and by level of SES measure (individual or ecological) indicated no differences along these dimensions. Studies using healthy controls tended to document that low SES was associated with worse influenza outcome, and studies using infected controls find low SES associated with more severe outcomes. A few studies compared severe outcomes (ICU or death) to hospital admissions but these did not find significant SES associations in any direction. Studies with more unusual comparisons (e.g., pandemic vs seasonal influenza, seasonal influenza vs other patient groups) reported no or negative non-significant associations. Conclusions/significance We found that SES was significantly associated with pandemic influenza outcomes with people of lower SES having the highest disease burden in both 1918 and 2009. To prepare for future pandemics, we must consider social vulnerability. The protocol for this study has been registered in PROSPERO (ref. no 87922) and has been published Mamelund et al. (2019)."
https://openalex.org/W3196555817,"Abstract Countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region have experienced a wide range of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics. This study aimed to identify predictors of the timing of the first COVID-19 case and the per capita mortality in WHO African Region countries during the first and second pandemic waves and to test for associations with the preparedness of health systems and government pandemic responses. Using a region-wide, country-based observational study, we found that the first case was detected earlier in countries with more urban populations, higher international connectivity and greater COVID-19 test capacity but later in island nations. Predictors of a high first wave per capita mortality rate included a more urban population, higher pre-pandemic international connectivity and a higher prevalence of HIV. Countries rated as better prepared and having more resilient health systems were worst affected by the disease, the imposition of restrictions or both, making any benefit of more stringent countermeasures difficult to detect. Predictors for the second wave were similar to the first. Second wave per capita mortality could be predicted from that of the first wave. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights unanticipated vulnerabilities to infectious disease in Africa that should be taken into account in future pandemic preparedness planning."

However, the spliceosome machinery is insufficient to fully specify splicing complexity. In considering the role of the epigenome in activity-dependent alternative splicing, we and others find the histone modification H3K36me3 to be a putative splicing regulator. In this study, we found that mouse cocaine self-administration caused widespread differential alternative splicing, concomitant with the enrichment of H3K36me3 at differentially spliced junctions. Importantly, only targeted epigenetic editing can distinguish between a direct role of H3K36me3 in splicing and an indirect role via regulation of splice factor expression elsewhere on the genome. We targeted Srsf11, which was both alternatively spliced and H3K36me3 enriched in the brain following cocaine self-administration. Epigenetic editing of H3K36me3 at Srsf11 was sufficient to drive its alternative splicing and enhanced cocaine self-administration, establishing the direct causal relevance of H3K36me3 to alternative splicing of Srsf11 and to reward behavior.

https://openalex.org/W3197925548,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) support the germline by suppressing retrotransposons. Studies of the pathway in mice have strongly shaped the view that mammalian piRNAs are essential for male but not for female fertility. Here, we report that the role of the piRNA pathway substantially differs in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the piRNA pathway setup of which more closely resembles that of other mammals, including humans. The loss of the Mov10l1 RNA helicase-an essential piRNA biogenesis factor-leads to striking phenotypes in both sexes. In contrast to mice, female Mov10l1-/- hamsters are sterile because their oocytes do not sustain zygotic development. Furthermore, Mov10l1-/- male hamsters have impaired establishment of spermatogonia accompanied by transcriptome dysregulation and an expression surge of a young retrotransposon subfamily. Our results show that the mammalian piRNA pathway has essential roles in both sexes and its adaptive nature allows it to manage emerging genomic threats and acquire new critical roles in the germline."

https://openalex.org/W3198226484,"The interacting-heads motif (IHM) is a structure of myosin that has been proposed to modulate cardiac output by occluding myosin molecules from undergoing the force-generating cycle. It is hypothesized to be the structural basis for the super-relaxed state (SRX), a low-ATPase kinetic state thought to be cardioprotective. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis by determining directly and quantitatively the fractions of myosin in the IHM and SRX under the same conditions in solution. To detect the structural IHM, we used time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer to quantitate two distinct populations. One population was observed at a center distance of 2.0 nm, whereas the other was not detectable by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, implying a distance greater than 4 nm. We confirmed the IHM assignment to the 2.0-nm population by applying the same cross-linking protocol used previously to image the IHM by electron microscopy. Under the same conditions, we also measured the fraction of myosin in the SRX using stopped-flow kinetics. Our results show that the populations of SRX and IHM myosin were similar, unless treated with mavacamten, a drug that recently completed phase III clinical trials to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is proposed to act by stabilizing both the SRX and IHM. However, we found that mavacamten had a much greater effect on the SRX (55% increase) than on the IHM (4% increase). We conclude that the IHM structure is sufficient but not necessary to produce the SRX kinetic state."
https://openalex.org/W3196545457,"Inactivation of p53 is present in almost every tumor, and hence, p53-reactivation strategies are an important aspect of cancer therapy. Common mechanisms for p53 loss in cancer include expression of p53-negative regulators such as MDM2, which mediate the degradation of wildtype p53 (p53α), and inactivating mutations in the TP53 gene. Currently, approaches to overcome p53 deficiency in these cancers are limited. Here, using non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma multiforme cell line models, we show that two alternatively spliced, functional truncated isoforms of p53 (p53β and p53γ, comprising exons 1 to 9β or 9γ, respectively) and that lack the C-terminal MDM2-binding domain have markedly reduced susceptibility to MDM2-mediated degradation but are highly susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a regulator of aberrant mRNA stability. In cancer cells harboring MDM2 overexpression or TP53 mutations downstream of exon 9, NMD inhibition markedly upregulates p53β and p53γ and restores activation of the p53 pathway. Consistent with p53 pathway activation, NMD inhibition induces tumor suppressive activities such as apoptosis, reduced cell viability, and enhanced tumor radiosensitivity, in a relatively p53-dependent manner. In addition, NMD inhibition also inhibits tumor growth in a MDM2-overexpressing xenograft tumor model. These results identify NMD inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for restoration of p53 function in p53-deficient tumors bearing MDM2 overexpression or p53 mutations downstream of exon 9, subgroups that comprise approximately 6% of all cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3197428844,"The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6) is considered to be a stem cell marker in many normal tissues and promotes tissue development, regeneration, and repair. LGR6 is also related to the initiation and progression of some malignant tumors. However, the role of LGR6 in cervical cancer has not been reported. Here, immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that LGR6 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer, compared with the normal cervix. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas database, LGR6 was found to be correlated with a poor prognosis of cervical cancer. Then, a small population of LGR6high cells isolated by using the fluorescence-activated cell sorting exhibited enhanced properties of cancer stem cells including self-renewal, differentiation, and tumorigenicity. Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed that LGR6 was correlated with the Wnt signaling pathway and TOP/FOP, reverse transcription-PCR, and western blotting further proved that LGR6 could activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Interestingly, LGR6 upregulated the expression of TCF7L2 by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Then, TCF7L2 combining with β-catenin in the nucleus enhanced LGR6 transcription by binding the promoter of LGR6, which further activated the Wnt signaling to form a positive feedback loop. Thus, our study demonstrated that LGR6 activated a novel β-catenin/TCF7L2/LGR6-positive feedback loop in LGR6high cervical cancer stem cells (CSCs), which provided a new therapeutic strategy for targeting cervical CSCs to improve the prognosis of cervical cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3198310727,"Automatic cell segmentation and tracking enables to gain quantitative insights into the processes driving cell migration. To investigate new data with minimal manual effort, cell tracking algorithms should be easy to apply and reduce manual curation time by providing automatic correction of segmentation errors. Current cell tracking algorithms, however, are either easy to apply to new data sets but lack automatic segmentation error correction, or have a vast set of parameters that needs either manual tuning or annotated data for parameter tuning. In this work, we propose a tracking algorithm with only few manually tunable parameters and automatic segmentation error correction. Moreover, no training data is needed. We compare the performance of our approach to three well-performing tracking algorithms from the Cell Tracking Challenge on data sets with simulated, degraded segmentation-including false negatives, over- and under-segmentation errors. Our tracking algorithm can correct false negatives, over- and under-segmentation errors as well as a mixture of the aforementioned segmentation errors. On data sets with under-segmentation errors or a mixture of segmentation errors our approach performs best. Moreover, without requiring additional manual tuning, our approach ranks several times in the top 3 on the 6th edition of the Cell Tracking Challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3197811658,"Human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) differentiate into decidual cells by the action of progesterone, which is essential for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. We previously reported that glucose uptake by human ESCs increases during decidualization and that glucose is indispensable for decidualization. Although glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is upregulated during decidualization, it remains unclear whether it is involved in glucose uptake. Here, we attempted to determine the role of GLUT1 during decidualization as well as the factors underlying its upregulation. ESCs were incubated with cAMP to induce decidualization. Knockdown of GLUT1 suppressed cAMP-increased glucose uptake and the expressions of specific markers of decidualization, IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and prolactin (PRL). To investigate the regulation of GLUT1 expression, we focused on CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) as the upstream transcription factors regulating GLUT1 expression. Knockdown of either C/EBPβ or WT1 suppressed cAMP-increased GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake. cAMP treatment also increased the recruitment of C/EBPβ and WT1 to the GLUT1 promoter region. Interestingly, cAMP increased the H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and p300 recruitment in the GLUT1 promoter region. Knockdown of C/EBPβ or WT1 inhibited these events, indicating that both C/EBPβ and WT1 contribute to the increase of H3K27ac by recruiting p300 to the GLUT1 promoter region during decidualization. These findings indicate that GLUT1 is involved in glucose uptake in ESCs during decidualization, thus facilitating the establishment of pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W3196550950,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of pathological tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) drive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. The injection of misfolded tau aggregates extracted from human AD brains drives templated spreading of tau pathology within WT mouse brain. Here, we assessed the impact of Aβ copathology, of deleting loci known to modify AD risk (Ptk2b, Grn, and Tmem106b) and of pharmacological intervention with an Fyn kinase inhibitor on tau spreading after injection of AD tau extracts. The density and spreading of tau inclusions triggered by human tau seed were unaltered in the hippocampus and cortex of APPswe/PSEN1ΔE9 transgenic and AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in mice. In mice with human tau sequence replacing mouse tau, template matching enhanced neuritic tau burden. Human AD brain tau-enriched preparations contained aggregated Aβ, and the Aβ coinjection caused a redistribution of Aβ aggregates in mutant AD model mice. The injection-induced Aβ phenotype was spatially distinct from tau accumulation and could be ameliorated by depleting Aβ from tau extracts. These data suggest that Aβ and tau pathologies propagate by largely independent mechanisms after their initial formation. Altering the activity of the Fyn and Pyk2 (Ptk2b) kinases involved in Aβ-oligomer-induced signaling, or deleting expression of the progranulin and TMEM106B lysosomal proteins, did not alter the somatic tau inclusion burden or spreading. However, mouse aging had a prominent effect to increase the accumulation of neuritic tau after injection of human AD tau seeds into WT mice. These studies refine our knowledge of factors capable of modulating tau spreading."

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the survival of lung cancer patients is affected by the presence of ILD documented on CT.146 patients with ILD at initial chest CT were retrospectively included in the study. 146 lung cancer controls without ILD were selected. Chest CTs were evaluated for the presence of pulmonary fibrosis which was classified in 4 categories. Presence and type of emphysema, extent of ILD and emphysema, location and histologic type of cancer, clinical staging and treatment were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models were used to assess survival probability and hazard of death of different groups. P value < 0.05 was considered significant.5-year survival for the study group was 41% versus 48% for the control group (log-rank test p = 0.0092). No significant difference in survival rate was found between the four different categories of ILD (log-rank test, p = 0.195) and the different histologic types (log-rank test, p = 0.4005). A cox proportional hazard model was used including presence of ILD, clinical stage and age. The hazard of death among patients with ILD was 1.522 times that among patients without ILD (95%CI, p = 0.029).Patients with lung cancer and CT evidence of ILD have a significantly shorter survival compared to patients with lung cancer only. Documenting the type and grading the severity of ILD in lung cancer patients will significantly contribute to their challenging management."
https://openalex.org/W3197366172,"Biochemical studies require large quantities of proteins, which are typically obtained using bacterial overexpression. However, the folding machinery in bacteria is inadequate for expressing many mammalian proteins, which additionally undergo posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that bacteria, yeast, or insect cells cannot perform. Many proteins also require native N- and C-termini and cannot tolerate extra tag amino acids for proper function. Tropomyosin (Tpm), a coiled coil protein that decorates most actin filaments in cells, requires both native N- and C-termini and PTMs, specifically N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation), to polymerize along actin filaments. Here, we describe a new method that combines native protein expression in human cells with an intein-based purification tag that can be precisely removed after purification. Using this method, we expressed several nonmuscle Tpm isoforms (Tpm1.6, Tpm1.7, Tpm2.1, Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2) and the muscle isoform Tpm1.1. Proteomics analysis revealed that human-cell-expressed Tpms present various PTMs, including Nt-acetylation, Ser/Thr phosphorylation, Tyr phosphorylation, and Lys acetylation. Depending on the Tpm isoform (humans express up to 40 Tpm isoforms), Nt-acetylation occurs on either the initiator methionine or on the second residue after removal of the initiator methionine. Human-cell-expressed Tpms bind F-actin differently than their Escherichia coli-expressed counterparts, with or without N-terminal extensions intended to mimic Nt-acetylation, and they can form heterodimers in cells and in vitro.

For example, most human proteins undergo multiple types of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (2Khoury G.A. Baliban R.C. Floudas C.A. Proteome-wide post-translational modification statistics: Frequency analysis and curation of the swiss-prot database.Sci. Rep. 2011; 1: 90Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Such PTMs play crucial roles in the regulation of protein function, including protein stability, protein–protein interactions, and enzymatic activity (3Bah A. Forman-Kay J.D.

Filutowicz M. Hexahistidine (His6)-tag dependent protein dimerization: A cautionary tale.Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We were confronted with these problems while studying tropomyosin (Tpm), a protein of central importance in the actin cytoskeleton (22Gunning P.W. Hardeman E.C. Lappalainen P. Mulvihill D.P. Tropomyosin - master regulator of actin filament function in the cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Tpm is a coiled coil dimer that polymerizes head-to-tail to form two contiguous chains, one on each side of the actin filament (F-actin). Through alternative splicing of four different genes (TPM1–4), up to 40 distinct Tpm isoforms can be expressed (23Geeves M.A. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Gunning P.W. A systematic nomenclature for mammalian tropomyosin isoforms.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2015; 36: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Most isoforms are ∼280-amino acids long (called long isoforms), comprising seven pseudo-repeats of ∼40 amino acids, with each pseudo-repeat spanning the length of one actin subunit along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament. Long Tpms decorate the contractile actin filaments of muscle cells. In nonmuscle cells, the majority of actin filaments are also decorated with Tpm (24Meiring J.C.M. Bryce N.S. Wang Y. Taft M.H. Manstein D.J. Liu Lau S. Stear J. Hardeman E.C. Gunning P.W. Co-polymers of actin and tropomyosin account for a major fraction of the human actin cytoskeleton.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 2331-2337.e2335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Some of the genes encoding nonmuscle Tpm isoforms lack exon 2 and as a consequence such Tpm isoforms are one pseudo-repeat shorter (called short isoforms). Because the six human actin isoforms are very similar, sharing 93 to 99% sequence identity, it has been proposed that the decoration of actin filaments with distinct Tpm isoforms provides a mechanism for filaments to assume different identities and become functionally segregated in cells (25Gunning P.W. Ghoshdastider U. Whitaker S. Popp D. Robinson R.C. The evolution of compositionally and functionally distinct actin filaments.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2009-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Tpm can move azimuthally on actin, helping to regulate the interactions of most actin-binding proteins, including myosin (26Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V. Rosol M. Thomas L. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. Tropomyosin and actin isoforms modulate the localization of tropomyosin strands on actin filaments.J. Mol.

J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar).Although there is high sequence similarity among Tpm isoforms, gene knockout and isoform overexpression studies have shown that they often play nonredundant roles (22Gunning P.W. Hardeman E.C. Lappalainen P. Mulvihill D.P. Tropomyosin - master regulator of actin filament function in the cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, Tpm4.2 knockout causes low platelet count (28Cheng C. Nowak R.B. Amadeo M.B. Biswas S.K. Lo W.-K. Fowler V.M. Tropomyosin 3.5 protects the F-actin networks required for tissue biomechanical properties.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs222042Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas Tpm3.5 knockout causes softer, less mechanically resilient lenses in the eye (29Pleines I. Woods J. Chappaz S. Kew V.

Invest. 2017; 127: 814-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that other Tpm isoforms cannot compensate for the lack of Tpm4.2 or Tpm3.5. Similarly, different Tpm isoforms have been implicated in processes such as muscle contraction (30Kee A.J. Gunning P.W. Hardeman E.C.

Thus, 16 isoforms are up- or downregulated at different stages of brain development in rodents (37Dufour C. Weinberger R.P. Gunning P.

Despite the importance of these factors, previous biochemical studies have focused on one or two Tpm isoforms purified from muscle or Escherichia coli-expressed full-length and peptide fragments of Tpm isoforms that lack PTMs and native N- and C-termini. While extra amino acids have been added at the N-terminus to substitute for Nt-acetylation (40Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear how precisely this approach mimics acetylation. Tpm coexpression with the yeast acetyltransferase NatB in E. coli has been also used to acetylate the N-terminus (50Johnson M. Coulton A.T. Geeves M.A. Mulvihill D.P. Targeted amino-terminal acetylation of recombinant proteins in E. coli.PLoS One. 2010; 5e15801Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, while yeast NatB can acetylate the N-terminus in E. coli, the extent of this modification varies for different Tpm isoforms, being as low as 30% for certain mammalian Tpm isoforms (50Johnson M. Coulton A.T. Geeves M.A. Mulvihill D.P. Targeted amino-terminal acetylation of recombinant proteins in E. coli.PLoS One. 2010; 5e15801Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, E. coli cannot add other types of PTMs (8Brown C.W. Sridhara V. Boutz D.R. Person M.D. Marcotte E.M. Barrick J.E. Wilke C.O. Large-scale analysis of post-translational modifications in E. coli under glucose-limiting conditions.BMC Genomics. 2017; 18: 301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as we show here, for many Tpm isoforms the initiator methionine is removed by mammalian N-terminal aminopeptidases and Nt-acetylation occurs on the second residue. E. coli lacks the necessary regulatory and modification machineries to perform such multistep Nt-processing reactions (51Wingfield P.T. N-terminal methionine processing.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2017; 88: 6.14.1-6.14.3Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We finally show here that Nt-acetylation mimics are not always capable of recapitulating the F-actin-binding properties of native Tpm isoforms.Here, we describe a method that combines expression in human Expi293F cells, which grow in suspension to high density and contain the native PTM machinery, with an intein-based affinity tag that can be precisely removed through self-cleavage after purification. We applied this method to the expression of six nonmuscle Tpm isoforms and one muscle isoform (Tpm1.1). We demonstrate the general applicability of this method to other proteins by also showing expression of α-synuclein, a protein implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders and whose function is critically regulated by numerous PTMs (52Schmid A.W. Fauvet B. Moniatte M. Lashuel H.A. Alpha-synuclein post-translational modifications as potential biomarkers for Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies.Mol. Cell.

The roles of post-translational modifications on alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's diseases.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 381Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We performed a functional analysis of the expressed Tpms in comparison with their E. coli-expressed counterparts, revealing significant differences in their ability to bind F-actin. Further, a comprehensive proteomics analysis of the human-cell-expressed Tpms showed the type and location of various PTMs, including Nt-acetylation and phosphorylation sites. We finally show that nonmuscle Tpm isoforms can form heterodimers in vitro and in cells, as previously shown for muscle isoforms purified from tissues.ResultsHuman cell expression and intein-mediated purification method and its application to Tpm and α-synucleinThe expression method developed here combines mammalian cell expression with a self-cleavable affinity tag. The cells used are Expi293F, commercialized by Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are based on human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and have been adapted to grow in suspension to high density (54Backliwal G.

These cells can be transiently transfected, display high protein expression levels, and have the endogenous protein folding and PTM machineries necessary for native expression and modification of human proteins. The self-cleavable affinity tag consists of a modified intein element followed by a chitin-binding domain (CBD) and is based on the IMPACT (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag) system marketed by New England Biolabs (56Shah N.H.

Both, N- and C-terminal intein-CBD tags are commercially available for bacterial protein expression, but we opted here to use a C-terminal intein-CBD tag for expression in mammalian cells to allow for N-terminal processing and acetylation, which occurs on ∼90% of human proteins (58Aksnes H.

Self-cleavage of the intein is thiol-catalyzed, meaning that a portion of the intein of bacterial origin is prematurely activated in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, likely explaining why they have not been used for mammalian cell expression. Yet, we show here that a significant portion of the expressed protein remains fused to the intein-CBD tag, and milligram yields of purified protein can be obtained.We built a new vector (named pJCX4), which incorporates the Mxe GyrA intein and CBD into a mammalian-cell expression vector (Fig. 1A). The Mxe GyrA intein is a 198-amino acid self-splicing protein from Mycobacterium xenopi (63Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Perler F.B. The Mycobacterium xenopi GyrA protein splicing element: Characterization of a minimal intein.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its native form, the intein catalyzes its own excision from the precursor protein, forming a new peptide bond between the N- and C-terminal fragments that flank the intein (64Hirata R. Ohsumk Y.

https://openalex.org/W3197769926,"Collagens play important roles in development and homeostasis in most higher organisms. In order to function, collagens require the specific chaperone HSP47 for proper folding and secretion. HSP47 is known to bind to the collagen triple helix, but the exact positions and numbers of binding sites are not clear. Here, we employed a collagen II peptide library to characterize high-affinity binding sites for HSP47. We show that many previously predicted binding sites have very low affinities due to the presence of a negatively charged amino acid in the binding motif. In contrast, large hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine at certain positions in the collagen sequence increase binding strength. For further characterization, we determined two crystal structures of HSP47 bound to peptides containing phenylalanine or leucine. These structures deviate significantly from previously published ones in which different collagen sequences were used. They reveal local conformational rearrangements of HSP47 at the binding site to accommodate the large hydrophobic side chain from the middle strand of the collagen triple helix and, most surprisingly, possess an altered binding stoichiometry in the form of a 1:1 complex. This altered stoichiometry is explained by steric collisions with the second HSP47 molecule present in all structures determined thus far caused by the newly introduced large hydrophobic residue placed on the trailing strand. This exemplifies the importance of considering all three sites of homotrimeric collagen as independent interaction surfaces and may provide insight into the formation of higher oligomeric complexes at promiscuous collagen-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W3196385014,"Background Prolonged periods of confined living on a cruise ship increase the risk for respiratory disease transmission. We describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Australian passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and provide recommendations to mitigate future cruise ship outbreaks. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australian passengers who travelled on the Diamond Princess from 20 January until 4 February 2020 and were either hospitalised, remained in Japan or repatriated. The main outcome measures included an epidemic curve, demographics, symptoms, clinical and radiological signs, risk factors and length of time to clear infection. Results Among 223 Australian passengers, 56 were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive. Forty-nine cases had data available and of these over 70% had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Of symptomatic cases, 17% showed signs and symptoms before the ship implemented quarantine and a further two-thirds had symptoms within one incubation period of quarantine commencing. Prior to ship-based quarantine, exposure to a close contact or cabin mate later confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive was associated with a 3.78 fold (95% CI, 2.24–6.37) higher risk of COVID-19 acquisition compared to non-exposed passengers. Exposure to a positive cabin mate during the ship’s quarantine carried a relative risk of 6.18 (95% CI, 1.96–19.46) of developing COVID-19. Persistently asymptomatic cases represented 29% of total cases. The median time to the first of two consecutive negative PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 assays was 13 days for asymptomatic cases and 19 days for symptomatic cases ( p = 0.002). Conclusion Ship based quarantine was effective at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst Australian passengers, but the risk of infection was higher if an individual shared a cabin or was a close contact of a confirmed case. Managing COVID-19 in cruise ship passengers is challenging and requires enhanced health measures and access to onshore quarantine and isolation facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3197226516,"Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are found in many different organisms ranging from marine bacteria to fungi and insects. These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from chitinous substrates generating various chitosans, linear copolymers consisting of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine. CDAs influence the degree of acetylation of chitosans as well as their pattern of acetylation, a parameter that was recently shown to influence the physicochemical properties and biological activities of chitosans. The binding site of CDAs typically consists of around four subsites, each accommodating a single sugar unit of the substrate. It has been hypothesized that the subsite preferences for GlcNAc or glucosamine units play a crucial role in the acetylation pattern they generate, but so far, this characteristic was largely ignored and still lacks structural data on the involved residues. Here, we determined the crystal structure of an Aspergillus niger CDA. Then, we used molecular dynamics simulations, backed up with a variety of in vitro activity assays using different well-defined polymeric and oligomeric substrates, to study this CDA in detail. We found that Aspergillus niger CDA strongly prefers a GlcNAc sugar unit at its -1 subsite and shows a weak GlcNAc preference at the other noncatalytic subsites, which was apparent both when deacetylating and N-acetylating oligomeric substrates. Overall, our results show that the combination of in vitro and in silico methods used here enables the detailed analysis of CDAs, including their subsite preferences, which could influence their substrate targets and the characteristics of chitosans produced by these species."
https://openalex.org/W3197922020,"Cytochrome P450 27C1 (P450 27C1) is a retinoid desaturase expressed in the skin that catalyzes the formation of 3,4-dehydroretinoids from all-trans retinoids. Within the skin, retinoids are important regulators of proliferation and differentiation. In vivo, retinoids are bound to cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) and cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs). Interaction with these binding proteins is a defining characteristic of physiologically relevant enzymes in retinoid metabolism. Previous studies that characterized the catalytic activity of human P450 27C1 utilized a reconstituted in vitro system with free retinoids. However, it was unknown whether P450 27C1 could directly interact with holo-retinoid-binding proteins to receive all-trans retinoid substrates. To assess this, steady-state kinetic assays were conducted with free all-trans retinoids and holo-CRBP-1, holo-CRABP-1, and holo-CRABP-2. For holo-CRBP-1 and holo-CRABP-2, the kcat/Km values either decreased 5-fold or were equal to the respective free retinoid values. The kcat/Km value for holo-CRABP-1, however, decreased ∼65-fold in comparison with reactions with free all-trans retinoic acid. These results suggest that P450 27C1 directly accepts all-trans retinol and retinaldehyde from CRBP-1 and all-trans retinoic acid from CRABP-2, but not from CRABP-1. A difference in substrate channeling between CRABP-1 and CRABP-2 was also supported by isotope dilution experiments. Analysis of retinoid transfer from holo-CRABPs to P450 27C1 suggests that the decrease in kcat observed in steady-state kinetic assays is due to retinoid transfer becoming rate-limiting in the P450 27C1 catalytic cycle. Overall, these results illustrate that, like the CYP26 enzymes involved in retinoic acid metabolism, P450 27C1 interacts with cellular retinoid-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3198835537,"In plasma, iron is normally bound to transferrin, the principal protein in blood responsible for binding and transporting iron throughout the body. However, in conditions of iron overload when the iron-binding capacity of transferrin is exceeded, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) appears in plasma. NTBI is taken up by hepatocytes and other parenchymal cells via NTBI transporters and can cause cellular damage by promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, how NTBI affects endothelial cells, the most proximal cell type exposed to circulating NTBI, has not been explored. We modeled in vitro the effects of systemic iron overload on endothelial cells by treating primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with NTBI (ferric ammonium citrate [FAC]). We showed by RNA-Seq that iron loading alters lipid homeostasis in HUVECs by inducing sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis. We also determined that FAC increased the susceptibility of HUVECs to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Moreover, we showed that cholesterol biosynthesis contributes to iron-potentiated apoptosis. Treating HUVECs with a cholesterol chelator hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin demonstrated that depletion of cholesterol was sufficient to rescue HUVECs from TNFα-induced apoptosis, even in the presence of FAC. Finally, we showed that FAC or cholesterol treatment modulated the TNFα pathway by inducing novel proteolytic processing of TNFR1 to a short isoform that localizes to lipid rafts. Our study raises the possibility that iron-mediated toxicity in human iron overload disorders is at least in part dependent on alterations in cholesterol metabolism in endothelial cells, increasing their susceptibility to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3198907750,"Acylation modifications, such as the succinylation of lysine, are post-translational modifications and a powerful means of regulating protein activity. Some acylations occur nonenzymatically, driven by an increase in the concentration of acyl group donors. Lysine succinylation has a profound effect on the corresponding site within the protein, as it dramatically changes the charge of the residue. In eukaryotes, it predominantly affects mitochondrial proteins because the donor of succinate, succinyl-CoA, is primarily generated in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Although numerous succinylated mitochondrial proteins have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a more detailed characterization of the yeast mitochondrial succinylome is still lacking. Here, we performed a proteomic MS analysis of purified yeast mitochondria and detected 314 succinylated mitochondrial proteins with 1763 novel succinylation sites. The mitochondrial nucleoid, a complex of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial proteins, is one of the structures whose protein components are affected by succinylation. We found that Abf2p, the principal component of mitochondrial nucleoids responsible for compacting mitochondrial DNA in S. cerevisiae, can be succinylated in vivo on at least thirteen lysine residues. Abf2p succinylation in vitro inhibits its DNA-binding activity and reduces its sensitivity to digestion by the ATP-dependent ScLon protease. We conclude that changes in the metabolic state of a cell resulting in an increase in the concentration of tricarboxylic acid intermediates may affect mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W3196533448,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a master regulatory kinase that drives cell cycle progression and stimulates expression of oncogenes in a myriad of cancers. Inhibitors of CDK7 (CDK7i) are currently in clinical trials; however, as with many cancer therapies, patients will most likely experience recurrent disease due to acquired resistance. Identifying targets underlying CDK7i resistance will facilitate prospective development of new therapies that can circumvent such resistance. Here we utilized triple-negative breast cancer as a model to discern mechanisms of resistance as it has been previously shown to be highly responsive to CDK7 inhibitors. After generating cell lines with acquired resistance, high-throughput RNA sequencing revealed significant upregulation of genes associated with efflux pumps and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of ABCG2, an efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, resensitized resistant cells to CDK7i, indicating a reliance on these transporters. Expression of activin A (INHBA), a member of the TGF-β family of ligands, was also induced, whereas its intrinsic inhibitor, follistatin (FST), was repressed. In resistant cells, increased phosphorylation of SMAD3, a downstream mediator, confirmed an increase in activin signaling, and phosphorylated SMAD3 directly bound the ABCG2 promoter regulatory region. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β/activin receptors or genetic silencing of SMAD4, a transcriptional partner of SMAD3, reversed the upregulation of ABCG2 in resistant cells and phenocopied ABCG2 inhibition. This study reveals that inhibiting the TGF-β/Activin-ABCG2 pathway is a potential avenue for preventing or overcoming resistance to CDK7 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3197615801,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Downregulation or overexpression of PKD1 or PKD2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2. We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones. GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone. Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro. Taken together our data uncovered a novel HDAC6-GRP94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W3197915593,"Pheromone receptors (PRs) recognize specific pheromone compounds to guide the behavioral outputs of insects, which are the most diverse group of animals on earth. The activation of PRs is known to couple to the calcium permeability of their coreceptor (Orco) or putatively with G proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process are not yet fully understood. Moreover, whether this transverse seven transmembrane domain (7TM)-containing receptor is able to couple to arrestin, a common effector for many conventional 7TM receptors, is unknown. Herein, using the PR BmOR3 from the silk moth Bombyx mori and its coreceptor BmOrco as a template, we revealed that an agonist-induced conformational change of BmOR3 was transmitted to BmOrco through transmembrane segment 7 from both receptors, resulting in the activation of BmOrco. Key interactions, including an ionic lock and a hydrophobic zipper, are essential in mediating the functional coupling between BmOR3 and BmOrco. BmOR3 also selectively coupled with Gi proteins, which was dispensable for BmOrco coupling. Moreover, we demonstrated that trans-7TM BmOR3 recruited arrestin in an agonist-dependent manner, which indicates an important role for BmOR3-BmOrco complex formation in ionotropic functions. Collectively, our study identified the coupling of G protein and arrestin to a prototype trans-7TM PR, BmOR3, and provided important mechanistic insights into the coupling of active PRs to their downstream effectors, including coreceptors, G proteins, and arrestin."
https://openalex.org/W3198206636,"Leukemia patients bearing the t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocations can be divided into two subgroups: those expressing both reciprocal fusion genes, and those that have only the MLL-AF4 fusion gene. Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that patients expressing both fusion genes have a better outcome than patients that are expressing the MLL-AF4 fusion protein alone. All this may point to a clonal process where the reciprocal fusion gene AF4-MLL could be lost during disease progression, as this loss may select for a more aggressive type of leukemia. Therefore, we were interested in unraveling the decisive role of the AF4-MLL fusion protein at an early timepoint of disease development. We designed an experimental model system where the MLL-AF4 fusion protein was constitutively expressed, while an inducible AF4-MLL fusion gene was induced for only 48 h. Subsequently, we investigated genome-wide changes by RNA- and ATAC-Seq experiments at distinct timepoints. These analyses revealed that the expression of AF4-MLL for only 48 h was sufficient to significantly change the genomic landscape (transcription and chromatin) even on a longer time scale. Thus, we have to conclude that the AF4-MLL fusion protein works through a hit-and-run mechanism, probably necessary to set up pre-leukemic conditions, but being dispensable for later disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3196436845,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a refractory disease that has a highly infiltrative characteristic. Over the past decade, GBM perivascular niche (PVN) has been described as a route of dissemination. Here, we investigated that trailed membrane structures, namely retraction fibers (RFs), are formed by perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. By using the anatomical GBM database, we validated that the ECM-related genes were highly expressed in the cells within the PVN where fibronectin (FN) induced RF formation. By disrupting candidates of FN-binding integrins, integrin α5β1 was identified as the main regulator of RF formation. De novo RFs were produced at the trailing edge, and focal adhesions were actively localized in RFs, indicating that adhesive force makes RFs remain at the bottom surface. Furthermore, we observed that GBM cells more frequently migrated along the residual RFs formed by preceding cells in microfluidic channels in comparison to those in the channels without RFs, suggesting that the infiltrative characteristics GBM could be attributed to RFs formed by the preceding cells in concert with chemoattractant cues. Altogether, we demonstrated that shedding membrane structures of GBM cells are maintained by FN-integrin α5β1 interaction and promoted their motility ."
https://openalex.org/W3196886184,"ToxR represents an essential transcription factor of Vibrio cholerae, which is involved in the regulation of multiple, mainly virulence associated genes. Its versatile functionality as activator, repressor or coactivator suggests a complex regulatory mechanism, whose clarification is essential for a better understanding of the virulence expression system of V. cholerae. Here, we provide structural information elucidating the organization and binding behavior of the cytoplasmic DNA-binding domain of ToxR (cToxR), containing a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motif. Our analysis reveals unexpected structural features of this domain expanding our knowledge of a poorly defined subfamily of wHTH proteins. cToxR forms an extraordinary long α-loop and furthermore has an additional C-terminal beta strand, contacting the N-terminus and thus leading to a compact fold. The identification of the exact interactions between ToxR and DNA contributes to a deeper understanding of this regulatory process. Our findings not only show general binding of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of ToxR to DNA, but also indicate a higher affinity for the toxT motif. These results support the current theory of ToxR being a ""DNA-catcher"" to enable binding of the transcription factor TcpP and thus activation of virulence-associated toxT transcription. Although, TcpP and ToxR interaction is assumed to be crucial in the activation of the toxT genes, we could not detect an interaction event of their isolated cytoplasmic domains. We therefore conclude that other factors are needed to establish this protein-protein interaction, e.g., membrane attachment, the presence of their full-length proteins and/or other intermediary proteins that may facilitate binding."
https://openalex.org/W3197009776,"Natal dispersal affects many processes such as population dynamics. So far, most studies have examined the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine the distance between the place of birth and of first breeding. In contrast, few researchers followed the first steps of dispersal soon after fledging. To study this gap, we radio-tracked 95 barn owl nestlings (Tyto alba) to locate their diurnal roost sites from the fledging stage until December. This was used to test whether the age of nest departure, post-fledging movements and dispersal distance were related to melanin-based coloration, which is correlated to fitness-related traits, as well as to corticosterone, a hormone that mediates a number of life history trade-offs and the physiological and behavioural responses to stressful situations. We found that the artificial administration of corticosterone delayed the age when juveniles left their parental home-range in females but not in males. During the first few months after fledging, longer dispersal distances were reached by females compared to males, by individuals marked with larger black feather spots compared to individuals with smaller spots, by larger individuals and by those experimentally treated with corticosterone. We conclude that the onset and magnitude of dispersal is sensitive to the stress hormone corticosterone, melanin-based coloration and body size."
https://openalex.org/W3197321460,"Tissue factor (TF) is the principal initiator of blood coagulation and is necessary for thrombosis. We previously reported that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent bioactive lipid, highly induces TF expression at the transcriptional level in vascular smooth muscle cells. To date, however, the specific role of the LPA receptor is unknown, and the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to LPA induction of TF have been largely undetermined. In the current study, we found that LPA markedly induced protein kinase D (PKD) activation in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (MASMCs). Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PKD2 blocked LPA-induced TF expression and activity, indicating that PKD2 is the key intracellular mediator of LPA signaling leading to the expression and cell surface activity of TF. Furthermore, our data reveal a novel finding that PKD2 mediates LPA-induced TF expression via the p38α and JNK2 MAPK signaling pathways, which are accompanied by the PKD-independent MEK1/2-ERK-JNK pathway. To identify the LPA receptor(s) responsible for LPA-induced TF expression, we isolated MASMCs from LPA receptor-knockout mice. Our results demonstrated that SMCs isolated from LPA receptor 1 (LPA1)-deficient mice completely lost responsiveness to LPA stimulation, which mediates induction of TF expression and activation of PKD and p38/JNK MAPK, indicating that LPA1 is responsible for PKD2-mediated activation of JNK2 and p38α. Taken together, our data reveal a new signaling mechanism in which the LPA1-PKD2 axis mediates LPA-induced TF expression via the p38α and JNK2 pathways.

Our previous study demonstrated that LPA-induced TF expression is controlled at the transcriptional level and that LPA induction of TF gene expression in SMCs depends on the activation of a Gi protein and the subsequent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEKs) and extracellular signaling–regulated kinases (ERKs) (18Cui M.Z.

In the current study, we aimed to explore other essential signaling pathways mediating LPA-induced TF expression and to identify the specific LPA receptor that controls TF expression. The protein kinase D (PKD) family comprises three members: PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3. This family possesses substrate specificity similar to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and structural features reminiscent of PKCs. The structure of PKDs consists of a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal region with autoinhibitory, regulatory domains such as the diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain and the pleckstrin homology domain (23Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Protein kinase D signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Activated forms of PKD1 and PKD2 (but not PKD3) autophosphorylate at a consensus phosphorylation motif of PKD1 and PKD2 (in a PDZ domain-binding motif) at the extreme C-terminus. This modification regulates interactions with scaffolding proteins, trafficking to distinct cellular subdomains, and the amplitude/tempo of PKD signaling responses (24Sanchez-Ruiloba L. Cabrera-Poch N. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Lopez-Menendez C. Jean-Mairet R.M. Higuero A.M. Iglesias T.

PKD1 has been reported to be involved in LPA-promoted angiogenesis (25Ren B. Hale J. Srikanthan S. Silverstein R.L. Lysophosphatidic acid suppresses endothelial cell CD36 expression and promotes angiogenesis via a PKD-1-dependent signaling pathway.Blood. 2011; 117: 6036-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and CD36 transcription (26Ren B.

Biol. 2016; 36: 1197-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells. However, the role of the other PKD isoforms in LPA-induced vascular signaling remains undocumented. Also, whether and how PKD mediates LPA signaling leading to the expression of the coagulation initiator TF has not been revealed. In the current study, our data demonstrate that LPA markedly induces PKD activation in mouse aortic SMCs. Interestingly, we found that PKD2 mediates LPA-induced TF expression via JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. We further identified that PKD2-mediated, LPA-induced TF expression is specifically dependent on the activation of p38α MAPK and JNK2. In addition, using isolated primary SMCs from LPA receptor knockout mice, our data reveal that LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) is the key receptor controlling LPA-induced TF expression. Targeting this signaling cascade could be a novel approach for preventing blood coagulation and thrombus formation. These results offer new insights into the LPA-triggered mechanisms of blood coagulation and atherothrombosis. To examine whether PKD mediates LPA signaling in SMCs, we first examined the expression levels of PKD isoforms in mouse aortic SMCs (MASMCs). Cell lysates of MASMCs were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies against PKD family members: PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3. Cell lysate from HEK293 cells was used as a positive control, because all three PKD isoforms are known to be expressed in this cell line (27Tan M. Hao F. Xu X. Chisolm G.M. Cui M.Z. Lysophosphatidylcholine activates a novel PKD2-mediated signaling pathway that controls monocyte migration.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A, all three PKD isoforms, PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3, are expressed in MASMCs. To determine whether LPA activates PKD in MASMCs, we next examined PKD phosphorylation in MASMCs. The PKD activation loop is fully conserved in all three mammalian PKD isoforms (Table 1). Hence, PKD “activation loop” phospho-specific antibodies should cross-react equally with PKD1 (phosphorylated on Ser744/Ser748), PKD2 (phosphorylated on Ser707/Ser711), and PKD3 (phosphorylated on Ser730/Ser734) (28Matthews S.A.

J. 2010; 432: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been shown that phosphorylation of the serine residue at the C terminus of PKD1 (Ser916) occurs by auto-phosphorylation and correlates with the activation status of PKD1 (29Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. Characterization of serine 916 as an in vivo autophosphorylation site for protein kinase D/Protein kinase Cmu.J. Biol.

All three isoforms of PKD share phosphorylation sites in the activation loop (23Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Protein kinase D signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cultured MASMCs were starved for 24 h and then treated with 10 μM LPA for various time periods. Specific antibodies against PKD1's C-terminal auto-phosphorylation site (Ser 916) and the PKD activation loop (Ser744/748) were used to detect PKD activation in these cell lysates. As shown in Figure 1, B and C, we observed that PKD1 auto-phosphorylation and PKD activation (phosphorylation at the PKD activation loop) were markedly and rapidly induced, with a peak around 45 s–5 min. PKD1 protein expression showed no change after LPA stimulation. The LPA-induced phosphorylation of serine residues at both the C terminus of PKD1 and the PKD activation loop declined to baseline at around 3 h (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Figure 1, D and E, LPA also induced phosphorylation of both the PKD1 C terminus (S916) and the PKD activation loop (S744 and S748 in PKD1) in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that LPA markedly induces activation of PKD in MASMCs. In the following studies, the LPA concentration of 10 μM was chosen to stimulate MASMCs because it is in the range of pathological concentrations found in atherosclerotic lesions in vivo (19Siess W.

PKD1 and PKD2 have autophosphorylation sites, but not PKD3. The effect of LPA on the activation of all three PKD isoforms is currently undocumented. Our experiment demonstrated that all three isoforms of PKD are expressed in MASMCs (Fig. 1A) and that LPA markedly induced the phosphorylation of the PKD1 C-terminus and the activation loop of PKD (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether all three PKD isoforms were activated (phosphorylated at the activation loop site), we immunoprecipitated PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 using three isoform-specific PKD antibodies in both untreated and LPA-stimulated MASMCs. We then used phospho-PKD activation loop-specific antibody (against p-Ser744/748 in PKD1) to detect activation loop phosphorylation of each PKD isoform by Western blot analysis. We found that phosphorylation of the PKD activation loop was detected in all three PKD isoforms (PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3) in response to LPA stimulation (Fig. 1F, top panel), The data from the lower three panels of Figure 1F verified the successful immunoprecipitation applied in our experiments, including the use of IgG as a negative control. These results reveal that LPA induces activation of all three isoforms of PKD in MASMCs. To date, it has been unknown whether any isoforms of PKD mediate LPA signaling, leading to TF expression and TF coagulant activity on cell surface. Our result demonstrated that LPA prominently induces TF expression in MASMCs (Fig. 2A). To determine the role of PKD in LPA-induced TF expression, we examined whether depletion of the expression of each PKD isoform, using specific siRNA knockdown approach, affects TF expression in response to LPA. Our results reveal that knockdown of PKD2 protein expression nearly completely abolished TF expression induced by LPA. However, depletion of PKD1 and PKD3 expression had no effect on TF expression (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that PKD2 plays an important and specific role in the LPA signaling pathway, controlling TF expression. We next examined the effect that knockdown of the specific PKD isoforms has on TF coagulant activity on cell surface. Our results show that knockdown of PKD2 expression with the specific PKD2 siRNA resulted in remarkably blocking LPA-induced TF surface activity, while knockdown of PKD1 and PKD3 had no effect on the surface activity of TF in MASMCs (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data strongly support the conclusion that PKD2 predominantly mediates LPA-induced TF expression and TF coagulant activity on cell surface. To investigate the downstream signaling molecules in this PKD-mediated signaling pathway, we evaluated the effect of PKD on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, as LPA has been reported to activate MAPKs (18Cui M.Z.

We examined the relationship of PKD and MAPKs in this LPA-triggered signaling pathway by evaluating whether depletion of the expression of PKD isoforms, using specific siRNA for PKD1, PKD2, or PKD3, has an effect on phosphorylation of MAPKs. The specific PKD siRNAs were transfected into MASMCs for 48 h, followed by serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with LPA (10 μM) for 5 min. As shown in Figure 3, A and B, transfection of PKD1 and PKD3 siRNAs nearly completely depleted endogenous protein expression of PKD1 and PKD3, but had no significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. However, transfection of PKD2 siRNA, which nearly completely depleted endogenous PKD2 protein expression, markedly inhibited phosphorylation of p38 and JNK MAPKs. In contrast, depletion of PKD2 protein expression had no effect on phosphorylation of ERK MAPK in response to LPA. These results indicate that PKD2, but not PKD1 or PKD3, is required for the activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs in response to LPA stimulation in MASMCs. MAPKs have been reported to be involved in TF expression brought about by various inducers (38Steffel J. Akhmedov A. Greutert H. Luscher T.F. Tanner F.C.

To determine whether PKD2-mediated JNK and p38 MAPK activation is required for LPA-induced TF expression in MASMCs, we pretreated cells with the specific JNK inhibitor SP600128 and the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and measured LPA-induced TF expression. We found that both inhibitors SP600128 and SB203580 individually and dose-dependently reduced LPA-induced TF protein expression in MASMCs (Fig. 4, A–D). Furthermore, treatment with a combination of SP600128 and SB203580 showed an additive effect on the inhibition of TF expression and nearly completely blocked LPA-induced TF expression (Fig. 4, E and F). In light of our previous report that MEK1/2-ERK MAPK contributes to LPA-induced TF expression in rat SMCs (18Cui M.Z. Zhao G. Winokur A.L. Laag E. Bydash J.R. Penn M.S. Chisolm G.M. Xu X.

Biol. 2003; 23: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the PKD-independent MEK1/2-ERK MAPK pathway may merge into the JNK pathway, contributing to LPA-induced TF expression. This speculation was supported by our previously published data that MEK1/2-ERK pathway-mediated JNK activation leads to LPA-induced early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) expression (37Iyoda T. Zhang F. Sun L. Hao F. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Xu X. Cui M.Z.

Here we show that several strains of type 2 diabetic mice spontaneously enter into hibernation-like suspended animation (HLSA) in cold temperatures. Nondiabetic mice injected with ATP mimic the severe hypothermia analogous to that observed in diabetic mice. We identified that uric acid, an ATP metabolite, is a key molecular in the entry of HLSA. Uric acid binds to the Na+ binding pocket of the Na+/H+ exchanger protein and inhibits its activity, acidifying the cytoplasm and triggering a drop in metabolic rate. The suppression of uric acid biosynthesis blocks the occurrence of HLSA, and hyperuricemic mice induced by treatment with an uricase inhibitor can spontaneously enter into HLSA similar to that observed in type 2 diabetic mice. In rats and dogs, injection of ATP induces a reversible state of HLSA similar to that seen in mice. However, ATP injection fails to induce HLSA in pigs due to the lack of their ability to accumulate uric acid. Our results raise the possibility that nonhibernating mammals could spontaneously undergo HLSA upon accumulation of ATP metabolite, uric acid."

Here, we have addressed unknown aspects of LysO function pertaining to its membrane topology and the mechanism by which it mediates Lys/Thl export. Using substituted cysteine (Cys) accessibility, here we delineated the membrane topology of LysO. Our studies support a model in which both the N- and C-termini of LysO are present at the periplasmic face of the membrane with a transmembrane (TM) domain comprising eight TM segments (TMSs) between them. In addition, a feature of intramembrane solvent exposure in LysO is inferred with the identification of membrane-located solvent-exposed Cys residues. Isosteric substitutions of a pair of conserved acidic residues, one E233, located in the solvent-exposed TMS7 and the other D261, in a solvent-exposed intramembrane segment located between TMS7 and TMS8, abolished LysO function in vivo. Thl, but not Lys, elicited proton release in inside-out membrane vesicles, a process requiring the presence of both E233 and D261. We postulate that Thl may be exported in antiport with H+ and that Lys may be a low-affinity export substrate. Our findings are compatible with a physiological scenario wherein in vivo LysO exports the naturally occurring antimetabolite Thl with higher affinity over the essential cellular metabolite Lys, thus affording protection from Thl toxicity and limiting wasteful export of Lys."

To investigate how the Tnp26 transposase recognizes the 14-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) that bound the IS, amino acids in two domains in the N-terminal (amino acids M1-P56) region were replaced. These changes substantially reduced cointegration in both modes. Tnp26 was purified as a maltose-binding fusion protein and shown to bind specifically to dsDNA fragments that included an IS26 TIR. However, Tnp26 with an R49A or a W50A substitution in helix 3 of a predicted trihelical helix-turn-helix domain (amino acids I13-R53) or an F4A or F9A substitution replacing the conserved amino acids in a unique disordered N-terminal domain (amino acids M1-D12) did not bind. The N-terminal M1-P56 fragment also bound to the TIR but only at substantially higher concentrations, indicating that other parts of Tnp26 enhance the binding affinity. The binding site was confined to the internal part of the TIR, and a G to T nucleotide substitution in the TGT at positions 6 to 8 of the TIR that is conserved in most IS26 family members abolished binding of both Tnp26 (M1-M234) and Tnp26 M1-P56 fragment. These findings indicate that the helix-turn-helix and disordered domains of Tnp26 play a role in Tnp26-TIR complex formation. Both domains are conserved in all members of the IS26 family."
https://openalex.org/W3197926468,"The CD8αβ heterodimer plays a crucial role in the stabilization between major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC-I) and the T cell receptor (TCR). The interaction between CD8 and MHC-I can be regulated by posttranslational modifications, which are proposed to play an important role in the development of CD8 T cells. One modification that has been proposed to control CD8 coreceptor function is ribosylation. Utilizing NAD+, the ecto-enzyme adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosyl transferase 2.2 (ART2.2) catalyzes the addition of ADP-ribosyl groups onto arginine residues of CD8α or β chains and alters the interaction between the MHC and TCR complexes. To date, only interactions between modified CD8 and classical MHC-I (MHC-Ia), have been investigated and the interaction with non-classical MHC (MHC-Ib) has not been explored. Here, we show that ADP-ribosylation of CD8 facilitates the binding of the liver-restricted nonclassical MHC, H2-Q10, independent of the associated TCR or presented peptide, and propose that this highly regulated binding imposes an additional inhibitory leash on the activation of CD8-expressing cells in the presence of NAD+. These findings highlight additional important roles for nonclassical MHC-I in the regulation of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3198740692,"The parasite Trypanosoma brucei exists in both a bloodstream form (BSF) and a procyclic form (PCF), which exhibit large carbohydrate extensions on the N-linked glycans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, respectively. The parasite's glycoconjugate repertoire suggests at least 38 glycosyltransferase (GT) activities, 16 of which are currently uncharacterized. Here, we probe the function(s) of the uncharacterized GT67 glycosyltransferase family and a β3 glycosyltransferase (β3GT) superfamily gene, TbGT10. A BSF-null mutant, created by applying the diCre/loxP method in T. brucei for the first time, showed a fitness cost but was viable in vitro and in vivo and could differentiate into the PCF, demonstrating nonessentiality of TbGT10. The absence of TbGT10 impaired the elaboration of N-glycans and GPI anchor side chains in BSF and PCF parasites, respectively. Glycosylation defects included reduced BSF glycoprotein binding to the lectin ricin and monoclonal antibodies mAb139 and mAbCB1. The latter bind a carbohydrate epitope present on lysosomal glycoprotein p67 that we show here consists of (-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-)≥4 poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats. Methylation linkage analysis of Pronase-digested glycopeptides isolated from BSF wild-type and TbGT10 null parasites showed a reduction in 6-O-substituted- and 3,6-di-O-substituted-Gal residues. These data define TbGT10 as a UDP-GlcNAc:βGal β1-6 GlcNAc-transferase. The dual role of TbGT10 in BSF N-glycan and PCF GPI-glycan elaboration is notable, and the β1-6 specificity of a β3GT superfamily gene product is unprecedented. The similar activities of trypanosome TbGT10 and higher-eukaryote I-branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.150), which belong to glycosyltransferase families GT67 and GT14, respectively, in elaborating N-linked glycans, are a novel example of convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3196445809,"Background Circulating levels of the endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), are positively associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in cross-sectional investigations. It is unclear if circulating ADMA and other methylarginines are associated with incident MetS prospectively. Methods We related circulating ADMA, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), L-arginine (ARG) concentrations (measured with a validated tandem mass spectrometry assay) and the ARG/ADMA ratio to MetS and its components in 2914 (cross-sectional analysis, logistic regression; mean age 58 years, 55% women) and 1656 (prospective analysis, Cox regression; mean age 56 years, 59% women) individuals from the Framingham Offspring Study who attended a routine examination. Results Adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and eGFR, we observed significant associations of ADMA (direct) and ARG/ADMA (inverse) with odds of MetS (N = 1461 prevalent cases; Odds Ratio [OR] per SD increment 1.13, 95%CI 1.04–1.22; and 0.89, 95%CI 0.82–0.97 for ADMA and ARG/ADMA, respectively). Upon further adjustment for waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, we observed a positive relation between SDMA and MetS (OR per SD increment 1.15, 95% CI 1.01–1.30) but the other associations were rendered statistically non-significant. We did not observe statistically significant associations between any of the methylarginines and the risk of new-onset MetS (752 incident events) over a median follow-up of 11 years. Conclusion It is unclear whether dimethylarginines play an important role in the incidence of cardiometabolic risk in the community, notwithstanding cross-sectional associations. Further studies of larger samples are needed to replicate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3198590840,"Cell migration is an essential physiological process, and aberrant migration of epithelial cells underlies many pathological conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms governing cell migration are not fully understood. We report here that growth factor-induced epithelial cell migration is critically dependent on the crosstalk of two molecular switches, namely phosphorylation switch (P-switch) and transcriptional switch (T-switch). P-switch refers to dynamic interactions of deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and PI3K with tensin-3 (TNS3), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), C-terminal tension, and vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (VAV2) that are dictated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2-dependent phosphorylation of TNS3, PTEN, and VAV2. Phosphorylation of TNS3 and PTEN on specific Thr residues led to the switch of DLC1-TNS3 and PI3K-PTEN complexes to DLC1-PTEN and PI3K-TNS3 complexes, whereas Ser phosphorylation of VAV2 promotes the transition of the PI3K-TNS3/PTEN complexes to PI3K-VAV2 complex. T-switch denotes an increase in C-terminal tension transcription/expression regulated by both extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) via interleukin-6-Janus kinase-STAT3 signaling pathway. We have found that, the P-switch is indispensable for both the initiation and continuation of cell migration induced by growth factors, whereas the T-switch is only required to sustain cell migration. The interplay of the two switches facilitated by the interleukin-6-Janus kinase-STAT3 pathway governs a sequence of dynamic protein-protein interactions for sustained cell migration. That a similar mechanism is employed by both normal and tumorigenic epithelial cells to drive their respective migration suggests that the P-switch and T-switch are general regulators of epithelial cell migration and potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3197467929,"Metaplasia is a well documented and deleterious effect of crude oil components on oysters. This reversible transformation of one cell type to another is a common response to petroleum-product exposure in molluscs. It has been shown experimentally in previous work that eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to petroleum products will exhibit metaplasia of digestive tissues. Here we document for the first time that wild adult oysters inhabiting coastal waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico during and in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010) exhibited metaplasia in both ctenidial (respiratory and suspension feeding) and digestive tract tissues at significantly higher frequencies than geographic controls of C. virginica from Chesapeake Bay. Metaplasia included the loss of epithelial cilia, transformations of columnar epithelia, hyperplasia and reduction of ctenidial branches, and vacuolization of digestive tissues. Evidence for a reduction of metaplasia following the oil spill (2010-2013) is suggestive but equivocal."
