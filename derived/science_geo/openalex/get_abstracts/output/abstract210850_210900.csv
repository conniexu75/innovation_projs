https://openalex.org/W2021477755,"IT is customary, in prolonging the survival of homografts with a chemical agent, to give frequent doses of the agent over a prolonged period. Effective agents are generally toxic, and their use is attended by considerable mortality, in both laboratory animals and man. The immune response is not uniformly susceptible to inhibition by these agents throughout its course1, nor is it uniformly active. It is likely, therefore, that dose-schedules not closely adapted to this changing sensitivity and activity of the immune response may, on one hand, subject the recipient to unnecessary toxicity and, on the other, fail to attack the immune response sufficiently during its most vulnerable period. It is therefore of some importance to establish the principles on which optimum dose-schedules may be based."

Nevertheless, separation of mitochondrial amine oxidases has not so far been reported to my knowledge."

https://openalex.org/W2044951215,"An analytical technique to measure very low concentrations of radioisotopes in sea water was developed. Manganese dioxide was found to be an effective and easily filterable scavenger for most of the radioisotopes in reactor coolant water. After scavenging with MnO/sub 2/, a scintillation counter was used for determination of radioactivity. (M.C.G.)"
https://openalex.org/W1990635026,"WE have previously reported that the level of cysta-thionase (‘soluble’ cysteine desulphurase) of rat liver is increased when L-methionine is injected in male rats maintained on a commercial diet1. We have recently shown that a similar increase could be obtained with rats placed on a synthetic diet (diet B) containing 18 per cent casein; furthermore, the level of cystathionase is higher in liver of rats maintained on a synthetic diet (diet C) containing 60 per cent casein, and we have observed that addition of a definite quantity of DL-methionine to diet B increases the enzyme-level2. These results indicate that some correlation could be established between dietary protein and the level of enzyme activity, and suggest that ‘adaptation’ of cystathionase is mediated, at least in part, by the content of methionine in the diet. As the increase in enzyme activity found on varying methionine intakes could be the reflexion of alteration of the content of specific protein in the liver, in the investigation described here we have determined the effect of addition of DL-ethionine (S-ethyl/analogue of methionine) to the diets on the level of hepatic cystathionase."

https://openalex.org/W1996284456,"FROM quantum mechanical calculations on the electronic structure of DNA1–3 a mechanism was proposed for the onset of DNA-duplication3,4. It has been assumed that the mobile π-electrons of the macromolecule, which, according to Eley and Spivey5, cause the semi-conductivity of DNA, can be polarized by the effect of local electrostatic fields present inside the cell. As a result of polarization free electron charges may appear at the end of the DNA double-helix; the repulsion between the charged nucleotide bases at the ends of the molecules may lead to the breaking of the bonds between them and thus induce the unwinding of the double-helix3,5. The unwinding of the helix being, according to the Watson–Crick duplication mechanism6, the starting point of DNA duplication, it seemed reasonable to suppose that the appearance of free charges at the ends of the molecule might induce DNA multiplication. It was therefore decided to examine the behaviour of cell cultures exposed to the effect of strong electrostatic fields4."

https://openalex.org/W2021139967,"Transcortical polarization of one cerebral hemisphere, while producing the well-known changes in the amplitude of the evoked potentials in the ipsilateral cortex, induced opposite behavior of these indicators in the contralateral cortex. With the corpus callosum sectioned, the reciprocal relationship was enhanced. Anesthetic doses of barbiturates not only eliminated reciprocity but made the potentials on both sides react in unison to unilateral polarization. These findings suggest the existence of a negative feedback system between the cerebral cortex and the subcortex and the existence of a ""left-right equalizing"" mechanism carried by pathways in the corpus callosum."
https://openalex.org/W1982477181,THE experiments to be described here suggest that confusion occurs between ipsilateral responses in certain choice-reaction tasks. This finding has apparently not been reported before.

https://openalex.org/W1981658110,"DURING the examination of guanidino compounds in trichloroacetic acid extracts of crustacean muscles, it was observed that treatment of paper chromatograms with alkaline α-naphthol : diacetyl1 sometimes resulted in the appearances of a yellow spot in addition to the pink spots characteristic of guanidine and its mono- and di-N-substituted derivatives. The unknown compound responsible for this yellow spot was present in muscle extracts from the marine Crustacea, Moreton Bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), king prawn (Penaeus plebejus), tiger prawn (Penaeus esculentus), and spiny crayfish (Jasus verreauxi), but was absent from the corresponding extracts from the fresh-water organisms, Murray River crayfish (Euastacus elongatus) and fresh-water crayfish (Cherax albidus). This variation in distribution prompted further investigations, and this communication reports evidence for the identification of the compound as homarine2."

Thirty days later they received allogeneic and xenogeneic skin grafts. Donors of the xenogeneic grafts were rats. The thymectomized mice rejected the grafts of rat skin only slightly later than the controls did; in contrast, the time of retention of allogeneic grafts was significantly longer in the thymectomized mice."

https://openalex.org/W2052526439,"PREVIOUS attempts to change the glycogen concentration in the glycogen body of birds failed1–4 except for a few cases in which it was slightly increased5,6. In the experiments recorded here the effect of tissue homogenates on the polysaccharide of the glycogen body of the chick was examined. Glycogen bodies of chicks 1–4 weeks old were isolated, weighed on a Roller Smith torsion balance and homogenized in glass tissue-grinders. Ringer's solution, or isotonic sodium chloride buffered with 0.01 M phosphate to pH 7.4, was added to the homogenate in the proportion of 1 ml. per mg of tissue. Twenty-four aliquots of 1 ml. were then prepared from the homogenate and were divided into 4 groups of 6 each. Ringer's solution (0.2 ml.) was added to the aliquots of one group and 0.2 ml. of tissue homogenate (containing 20 mg of chick skeletal muscle, liver or brain) to the others. To the samples of the first group, in 2 series of experiments, ATP, DPN+ and glucose-6-phosphate (1 mg. each) were added. Two aliquots of each group were extracted7 for glycogen immediately, two after 4 h and 2 after 24 h of incubation at room temperature (70° F.). Glycogen was assayed colorimetrically by the anthrone method8."

https://openalex.org/W1994608857,"THE partial replacement of sodium chloride in a culture medium for a marine bacterium by sucrose or potassium chloride was recently described1. The non-specific solute requirement was shown to control the rate of growth and under the conditions of experimentation was not concerned with osmotic fragility. Some previous workers found relatively little replacement of sodium salts by other solutes and concluded that the organisms being studied had little or no osmotic requirement2,3. In contrast, the solute requirements of the marine luminescent bacterium Photobacterium fischeri, both for growth and metabolism, were found to be non-specific and were considered to be primarily osmotic4,5. The various findings suggested the existence of species variation with respect to this property among marine bacteria. As a direct approach to a better understanding of this situation, samples of sea-water were plated directly on to media having either sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or sucrose as the principal solute. The purpose was to determine the proportion of cells in a natural inoculum which would allow a partial replacement of sodium chloride in the growth medium."
