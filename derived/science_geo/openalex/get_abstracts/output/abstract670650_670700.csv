https://openalex.org/W3129558828,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 2 million deaths in little over a year. Vaccines are being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbors 9 amino acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light-chain contacts with residue 501. However, widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination was not observed."

IntroductionHumans have tens of thousands of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at birth that collectively sustain lifelong blood production through self-renewal and differentiation. In 2014, 3 independent groups reported a higher-than-expected frequency of genetically variant cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of elderly individuals, reflective of expanded HSC clones (Genovese et al., 2014Genovese G.

Med. 2014; 20: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, referred to as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), occurs increasingly with age such that ∼15% of individuals in their 70s are affected (Genovese et al., 2014Genovese G. Kähler A.K. Handsaker R.E. Lindberg J. Rose S.A. Bakhoum S.F. Chambert K. Mick E. Neale B.M. Fromer M. et al.Clonal hematopoiesis and blood-cancer risk inferred from blood DNA sequence.N. Engl. J.

Proc. 2018; 93: 1122-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Strikingly, CH is associated with a 13-fold increased risk of myeloid hematologic malignancy and an increased risk of all-cause mortality, largely due to cardiovascular disease and stroke (Jaiswal and Libby, 2020Jaiswal S. Libby P. Clonal haematopoiesis: connecting ageing and inflammation in cardiovascular disease.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2020; 17: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Defined as the presence of a clonal population of cells comprising >4% of the PB as identified by a specific variant gene allele (DeZern et al., 2019DeZern A.E. Malcovati L. Ebert B.L. CHIP, CCUS, and Other Acronyms: Definition, Implications, and Impact on Practice.Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. Educ. Book. 2019; 39: 400-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CH represents the acquisition of genetic mutations combined with selective pressures that result in advantages for the overrepresented clone (Bowman et al., 2018Bowman R.L. Busque L. Levine R.L. Clonal Hematopoiesis and Evolution to Hematopoietic Malignancies.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Clarifying the mechanisms by which CH emerges may aid in identifying key interventions for this widespread phenomenon with tremendous public health implications.Mutations in several genes are associated with CH, and the incidence of CH correlates directly with age, reaching ∼50% by the 10th decade (Zink et al., 2017Zink F. Stacey S.N. Norddahl G.L. Frigge M.L. Magnusson O.T. Jonsdottir I. Thorgeirsson T.E. Sigurdsson A. Gudjonsson S.A. Gudmundsson J. et al.Clonal hematopoiesis, with and without candidate driver mutations, is common in the elderly.Blood. 2017; 130: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, genes alone are unlikely to provide a complete explanation for CH. By some estimates, mutations in DNMT3A, the gene most commonly mutated in CH, are nearly universal in individuals by the age of 50 (Young et al., 2016Young A.L. Challen G.A. Birmann B.M. Druley T.E. Clonal haematopoiesis harbouring AML-associated mutations is ubiquitous in healthy adults.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), suggesting that for most people, decades elapse between the acquisition of a CH-associated mutation and CH itself. In addition, many have noted that DNMT3A mutations confer little phenotype on steady-state hematopoiesis (Buscarlet et al., 2017Buscarlet M. Provost S. Zada Y.F. Barhdadi A. Bourgoin V. Lépine G. Mollica L. Szuber N. Dubé M.-P. Busque L. DNMT3A and TET2 dominate clonal hematopoiesis and demonstrate benign phenotypes and different genetic predispositions.Blood. 2017; 130: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); thus, environmental factors likely play a major role in CH emergence. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that CH is associated with smoking and smoking-associated conditions such as chronic lung disease (Zink et al., 2017Zink F. Stacey S.N. Norddahl G.L. Frigge M.L. Magnusson O.T. Jonsdottir I. Thorgeirsson T.E. Sigurdsson A. Gudjonsson S.A. Gudmundsson J. et al.Clonal hematopoiesis, with and without candidate driver mutations, is common in the elderly.Blood. 2017; 130: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Chemotherapy has been shown to promote the expansion of PPM1D mutant clones in treatment-related leukemias (Bolton et al., 2020bBolton K.L. Ptashkin R.N. Gao T. Braunstein L. Devlin S.M. Kelly D.

Similarly, inflammation has been shown to be a driver of Tet2 mutant CH. Microbial signals, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation promote the expansion of Tet2 clones in murine models through their superior resistance to inflammation-mediated toxicity compared to wild-type (WT) cells (Abegunde et al., 2018Abegunde S.O.

A new study indicates that IL-1 exposure can promote the expansion of Cebpa-deficient hematopoietic progenitors (Higa et al., 2020Higa K.C. Goodspeed A. Chavez J.S. Zaberezhnyy V. Rabe J.L. Tenen D.G. Pietras E.M. DeGregori J. Chronic interleukin-1 exposure triggers selective expansion of Cebpa-deficient multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.bioRxiv. 2020; (2020.2003.2025.008250)Google Scholar). Thus, prior studies have identified biological adaptations that allow HSCs with certain mutations to gain selective advantage in specific environmental conditions (King et al., 2020King K.Y. Huang Y. Nakada D. Goodell M.A. Environmental influences on clonal hematopoiesis.Exp. Hematol. 2020; 83: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Despite the fact that mutations in DNMT3A are ∼6 times more common among CH cases than any other gene, specific environmental drivers of DNMT3A mutant CH have not been determined. Given the strong epidemiologic links of CH with age and smoking, and given that age and smoking are both associated with inflammation, we reasoned that inflammation may drive DNMT3A CH.In prior work, we established a murine model of chronic infection by Mycobacterium avium, an intracellular pathogen that induces a sustained interferon gamma (IFNγ)-mediated immune response. We demonstrated that systemic inflammation promotes HSC depletion during chronic infection in these mice (Matatall et al., 2016Matatall K.A. Jeong M. Chen S. Sun D. Chen F. Mo Q. Kimmel M. King K.Y. Chronic Infection Depletes Hematopoietic Stem Cells through Stress-Induced Terminal Differentiation.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 2584-2595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and that many of the HSC responses to systemic M. avium infection can be recapitulated by the administration of IFNγ alone (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C. Goodell M.A. Quiescent haematopoietic stem cells are activated by IFN-γ in response to chronic infection.Nature. 2010; 465: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We found that HSC loss was attributable to a loss of quiescence and self-renewal among HSCs in WT mice, with excessive differentiation and increased susceptibility to secondary stress-induced apoptosis ultimately leading to exhaustion of the HSC reserve (Matatall et al., 2016Matatall K.A. Jeong M. Chen S. Sun D. Chen F. Mo Q. Kimmel M. King K.Y. Chronic Infection Depletes Hematopoietic Stem Cells through Stress-Induced Terminal Differentiation.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 2584-2595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such a loss of self-renewal in favor of differentiation events has long been recognized as a potential avenue for HSC depletion (Holstege et al., 2014Holstege H. Pfeiffer W. Sie D. Hulsman M. Nicholas T.J. Lee C.C. Ross T. Lin J. Miller M.A. Ylstra B. et al.Somatic mutations found in the healthy blood compartment of a 115-yr-old woman demonstrate oligoclonal hematopoiesis.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; Morrison and Kimble, 2006Morrison S.J. Kimble J. Asymmetric and symmetric stem-cell divisions in development and cancer.Nature. 2006; 441: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Since prior studies showed that Dnmt3a−/− HSCs demonstrate defective differentiation and enhanced self-renewal (Challen et al., 2011Challen G.A. Sun D. Jeong M. Luo M. Jelinek J. Berg J.S. Bock C. Vasanthakumar A. Gu H. Xi Y. et al.Dnmt3a is essential for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.Nat. Genet. 2011; 44: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar; Jeong et al., 2018Jeong M. Park H.J. Celik H. Ostrander E.L. Reyes J.M. Guzman A. Rodriguez B. Lei Y. Lee Y. Ding L. et al.Loss of Dnmt3a Immortalizes Hematopoietic Stem Cells In Vivo.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that Dnmt3a-loss-of-function mutations, which make up the majority of human CH-associated mutations (Russler-Germain et al., 2014Russler-Germain D.A. Spencer D.H. Young M.A. Lamprecht T.L. Miller C.A. Fulton R. Meyer M.R. Erdmann-Gilmore P. Townsend R.R. Wilson R.K. Ley T.J.

Huang Y.H. Muise A. Goodell M.A. Reich N.O. Mutations in the DNMT3A DNA methyltransferase in acute myeloid leukemia patients cause both loss and gain of function and differential regulation by protein partners.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 4898-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We next created mosaic mice to model CH by transplanting a mixture of whole bone marrow (WBM) from polyinosine-polycytidine (pIpC)-treated CD45.2 Mx1-Cre+ Dnmt3af/f (“Dnmt3a−/−”) and CD45.1 WT rescue marrow into lethally irradiated CD45.1 WT mice. This approach yields a starting engraftment of ∼10% 45.2 Dnmt3a−/− cells as detected in PB (Figure S1A). Mice transplanted with a mixture of Mx1-Cre− Dnmt3af/f (WT) and CD45.1 WT marrow were used as controls (Figure 1A). Two months after transplantation, engrafted mice were systemically infected with M. avium by intravenous (i.v.) injection. After 16 weeks, 2 months from the start of M. avium infection, we examined BM by flow cytometry (Figure S1B). Of note, we omitted Sca1 from the phenotypic definition of HSCs in these experiments because it has been shown to be nonspecifically upregulated in the setting of infections that induce an IFN response (Baldridge et al., 2011Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Goodell M.A. Inflammatory signals regulate hematopoietic stem cells.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mx1-Cre- control WT HSCs and Dnmt3a−/− HSCs remained at a low frequency in the absence of infection. However, Dnmt3a−/− HSCs expanded significantly in the marrow in the setting of infection (Figure 1B). This increase was evident regardless of whether Dnmt3a−/− HSCs were analyzed as a percentage of WBM or as absolute number, indicating that the relative expansion was not simply a result of depletion of the WT competitor marrow (Figure S1C).To confirm that Dnmt3a was efficiently knocked out in the Mx1-Cre+ Dnmt3af/f donors, CD45.2 HSCs were sorted from the recipient mosaic mice at the time of BM evaluation and colonies were cultivated in liquid media. After 2 weeks of expansion, we genotyped the colonies by PCR and found high efficiency of knockout (KO) in both uninfected and infected mosaic mice (Figure 1C). Thus, the expansion of Dnmt3a−/− HSCs occurred only in the setting of M. avium infection and was not related to a difference in gene deletion frequency.In the experiments described above, a pIpC-dependent IFN response induced Dnmt3a mutation in the donor mice. To test the hypothesis that this inflammatory signaling altered the BM to provide a selective advantage upon subsequent infectious stress, we repeated our experiments using Vav-Cre+ Dnmt3af/f mice as donors. These mice do not require pIpC treatment to induce the deletion within the hematopoietic compartment. Expansion of Dnmt3a−/− HSCs was also seen upon the infection of mosaics created with Vav-Cre+ Dnmt3af/f donors (Figures 1D and S1D), indicating that the expansion effect was not dependent on prior pIpC exposure.We analyzed other BM populations and detected the expansion of Dnmt3a−/− cells among multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (Figure 1E). This finding was similar regardless of the Cre driver used to generate Dnmt3a mutant mice. Notably, we did not see expansion among more downstream populations such as granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, megakaryocyte progenitors, B and T cells, macrophage/monocytes, or granulocytes (Figures S1E–S1L), suggesting a differentiation block in the Dnmt3a mutant population at the level of the MPP.Given that most mutations in DNMT3A in humans are heterozygous, we next tested whether Dnmt3a+/− HSCs expand in our mosaic mouse infection model. Here, we created mosaic mice using WBM from CD45.2 mice with a germline heterozygous Dnmt3a deletion and CD45.1 rescue marrow, or CD45.2 WT mice and CD45.1 rescue marrow as controls (Figure 1F). After 8 weeks of M. avium infection, we were able to detect an expansion of Dnmt3a+/− HSCs in the marrow (Figure 1G). Predictably, the effect size was smaller than that seen for Dnmt3a−/− HSCs.To confirm the observed phenotypic expansion of HSCs, we sorted CD45.2 WBM from mosaic mice at the end of the experiment and performed colony-forming assays in methylcellulose. Colony formation was increased in the infected Dnmt3a−/− mosaics compared to uninfected and WT controls, indicating that there were more functionally defined stem and progenitor cells in the 45.2 compartment of infected Dnmt3a−/− mosaic mice (Figure S1M). The number of colonies observed in methylcellulose culture correlated with the number of phenotypically defined HSCs as determined by flow cytometry (Figure S1N; Pearson correlation coefficient 0.76).To ascertain whether the degree of HSC expansion correlated with the bacterial load during infection, we isolated the spleen and HSCs from 2 Dnmt3a−/− mosaic mice that showed very high levels of Dnmt3a−/− expansion and the spleen and HSCs from 2 Dnmt3a−/− mosaic mice that showed little Dnmt3a−/− expansion. In both cases, no bacterial DNA was detected by PCR in the HSCs themselves, but equally high levels of bacterial DNA were detected in the spleen (Figure S1O). These results indicate that the HSCs are not themselves infected and that the systemic bacterial burden does not account for differences in Dnmt3a−/− expansion.Chronic infection promotes Dnmt3a−/− CH in the PB of miceIn humans, CH is defined by variant allele frequency detectable in PB. To determine whether chronic infection promotes expansion of Dnmt3a−/− clones in the PB, we retained Dnmt3a−/−:WT mosaic mice and monitored the PB over a period of 12 months (Figures 2A and S2A). A potential limitation of this study is that we did not perform the same 12-month analysis of the WT:WT mosaics, which did not show expansion of HSCs at 2 months post-infection. Whereas the percentage of Dnmt3a−/− CD45.2 PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expanded to an insignificant degree in this time frame for naive mice, the percentage increased significantly for infected mosaic mice at both 8 and 12 months post-infection (Figures 2B–2G). In the BM, the percentage of total HSCs that were Dnmt3a−/− reached an average of 82.8% in the infected mosaic mice by 12 months post-infection, compared to 19.5% for the uninfected controls (Figures 2H, 2I, and S2B).Figure 2M. avium infection promotes late Dnmt3a mutant clonal peripheral blood expansionShow full caption(A) WT recipient mice were transplanted with a minor population of “test” Dnmt3afl/fl or Dnmt3a−/− CD45.2 WBM and a major population of CD45.1 WT competitor.

We previously showed that HSCs divide during chronic infection with M. avium, but these divisions are accompanied by a loss of self-renewal and an increase in differentiation, ultimately depleting the HSC compartment (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T.

Prior studies have also demonstrated a defect in post-transplant differentiation by Dnmt3a−/− HSCs (Challen et al., 2011Challen G.A. Sun D. Jeong M. Luo M. Jelinek J. Berg J.S. Bock C.

Genet. 2011; 44: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), but their capacity to respond to inflammatory stress has not been measured. To ascertain whether Dnmt3a-loss of function affects hematologic responses to infection, we infected with M. avium Mx1-Cre Dnmt3af/f mice in which Dnmt3a deletion had been induced by pIpC treatment 4 weeks prior. After 4 weeks of systemic infection, there were few differences in the BM of Dnmt3a−/− mice compared to pIpC-treated Cre− controls. Specifically, neither the number of HSCs nor the apoptosis rate of Dnmt3a−/− HSCs were different compared to either naive or infected control mice (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3B). The increase in cell division upon infection was similar in Dnmt3a−/− HSCs compared to controls (Figure 3C).Figure 3Hematological responses of Dnmt3a−/− mice to infection with M. aviumShow full caption(A–C) WT and Dnmt3a−/− mice were infected with M. avium for 1 month.(A) Percentage of HSCs (KL CD150+ CD48− CD34−) of total WBM. n = 10–20/group; data are representative of 5 independent experiments.

However, we noted that unlike WT mice Dnmt3a−/− mice became anemic upon M. avium infection, possibly indicating impaired adaptive responses in the blood system (Figure 3D).IFNγ exposure confers sensitivity to secondary stress-induced apoptosis, demonstrated by an increased propensity of HSCs from M. avium-infected or IFNγ-treated mice to undergo apoptosis after ex vivo culture for 24 h compared to PBS-treated controls (Matatall et al., 2016Matatall K.A.

In other words, whereas M. avium infection alone is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in HSCs, it does leave HSCs in a vulnerable state in which any additional stress activates apoptosis pathways. Thus, we compared secondary stress-induced apoptosis in HSCs from infected WT and Dnmt3a−/− mice. Whereas secondary stress-induced apoptosis was elevated in both WT and Dnmt3a−/− HSCs after infection, the degree of apoptosis was less in Dnmt3a−/− HSCs (Figure 3E), indicating that loss of DNMT3A partially protects HSCs against this avenue of depletion.We previously used differential equations to model the dynamics of HSCs during chronic infection (Matatall et al., 2016Matatall K.A.

https://openalex.org/W3134844657,"SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalog of functional SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform studies to understand the host-virus interface and nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3137473376,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a ubiquitous membrane protein family and are important drug targets. Their diverse signaling pathways are driven by complex pharmacology arising from a conformational ensemble rarely captured by structural methods. Here, fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F NMR) is used to delineate key functional states of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) complexed with heterotrimeric G protein (Gαsβ1γ2) in a phospholipid membrane milieu. Analysis of A2AR spectra as a function of ligand, G protein, and nucleotide identifies an ensemble represented by inactive states, a G-protein-bound activation intermediate, and distinct nucleotide-free states associated with either partial- or full-agonist-driven activation. The Gβγ subunit is found to be critical in facilitating ligand-dependent allosteric transmission, as shown by 19F NMR, biochemical, and computational studies. The results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding basal signaling, efficacy, precoupling, and allostery in GPCRs."

Here we show that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe (vlPAG/DR) differentially regulate pain-related behaviors in male and female mice through projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We find that activation of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons or vlPAG/DRDA+ terminals in the BNST reduces nociceptive sensitivity during naive and inflammatory pain states in male mice, whereas activation of this pathway in female mice leads to increased locomotion in the presence of salient stimuli. We additionally use slice physiology and genetic editing approaches to demonstrate that vlPAG/DRDA+ projections to the BNST drive sex-specific responses to pain through DA signaling, providing evidence of a novel ascending circuit for pain relief in males and contextual locomotor response in females.

The midbrain plays a well-established role in these pain responses because structures like the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and dorsal raphe (DR) have optimal anatomical positioning to integrate relevant contextual information with fight-or-flight behaviors (Wang and Nakai, 1994Wang Q.P.

Although it remains unclear how vlPAG/DRDA+ regulation of these functions influences behavior, there is evidence of functional specificity of vlPAG/DR neurons based on downstream target regions (Tovote et al., 2016Tovote P.

Previous characterizations of vlPAG/DRDA+ and pain were performed exclusively in male subjects, leaving the function of these neurons undetermined in females. To address this disparity, the present study examines the role of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons in regulating pain responses in male and female mice. We specifically focus on vlPAG/DRDA+ projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) because the BNST is a critical region for allocating emotional value to sensory information and likely plays an important role in pain (Hagiwara et al., 2013Hagiwara H.

Here we used a combination of technical approaches, including chemogenetics, optogenetics, slice physiology, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, to assess how vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons and vlPAG/DRDA+ projections to the BNST affect nociceptive responses and related incentive behaviors. We found that vlPAG/DR neurons drive adaptive anti-nociceptive and locomotor behaviors differently in male and female mice via DA transmission to the BNST, with the context of neuronal activation being a key determinant of behavioral outcomes. These findings establish a critical role of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons in sex-specific expression of pain-related behaviors. Activation of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons reduces pain in male mice (Li et al., 2016Li C.

To probe vlPAG/DRDA+ regulation of pain-related behaviors in both sexes, we first injected an adeno-associated virus carrying Cre-inducible hM3Dq (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry; an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs [DREADD]; Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) or a control virus (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry) in the vlPAG/DR of adult male and female tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre mice (Figure 1A). This DREADD approach enabled systemic administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to promote hM3Dq signaling in vlPAG/DR neurons that express TH, a rate-limiting enzyme for DA biosynthesis (Figure 1B). Chemogenetic activation of these putative vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons was employed during measurement of pain sensitivity (Figure 1B), where the Hargreaves (heat exposure to the hindpaw [6 replicates]; Hargreaves et al., 1988Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J.

Pain. 2014; 10: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) tests were used to determine thermal and mechanical nociceptive sensitivity, respectively. CNO treatment of hM3Dq mice reduced sensitivity to thermal (Figure 1C) and mechanical (Figure 1E) nociception compared with mCherry controls in males but not in females (Figures 1D and 1F). Importantly, CNO-treated mCherry mice exhibited pain thresholds that were analogous to their saline-treated counterparts, suggesting that back-metabolism of CNO is an unlikely contributor to the observed effects in hM3Dq mice (Gomez et al., 2017Gomez J.L. Bonaventura J. Lesniak W. Mathews W.B. Sysa-Shah P. Rodriguez L.A. Ellis R.J. Richie C.T. Harvey B.K. Dannals R.F. et al.Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine.Science. 2017; 357: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These data show that chemogenetic activation of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons contributes to pain sensitivity in a sex-dependent manner, with the anti-nociceptive effects of the dopaminergic subpopulation being limited to male mice. We next investigated the possibility of vlPAG/DRDA+ intervention in pathological pain. Measurements of nociceptive sensitivity were repeated in the same cohort of TH-Cre mice following hindpaw exposure to complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), a model of persistent inflammation, to determine the effect of vlPAG/DRDA+ activation on heightened pain sensitivity. Similar to the effects observed under the naive condition, CNO treatment of hM3Dq mice attenuated CFA-induced hyperalgesia for thermal and mechanical nociception in males (Figures 1G and 1I) but not females (Figures 1H and 1J). vlPAG/DRDA+ anti-nociception was active primarily in the CFA-injected paw, with CNO treatment in male hM3Dq mice rescuing pain thresholds for the ipsilateral paw and having no effect on the contralateral paw (Figures S1A–S1D). Engagement of these neurons did not alter tail flick or avoidance behaviors in either sex (Figures S1E–S1P), in keeping with previous studies that established a specific role of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons in supraspinal modulation of pain (Li et al., 2016Li C. Sugam J.A. Lowery-Gionta E.G. McElligott Z.A. McCall N.M. Lopez A.J. McKlveen J.M. Pleil K.E. Kash T.L.

Consistent with this idea, our results demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of TH neurons in the vlPAG/DR exclusively produces anti-nociception in male mice during naive and persistent inflammatory pain states. Although chemogenetic activation of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons in female subjects did not produce statistically significant changes in pain sensitivity, a variable range of mechanosensitivity thresholds trending toward anti-nociception was observed in the von Frey test (Figure 1F). It is posited that high variations in the pain threshold can reflect differences in hormonal status because fluctuations in testosterone and estrogen levels have been shown to alter DA availability and pain sensitivity (Di Paolo, 1994Di Paolo T. Modulation of brain dopamine transmission by sex steroids.Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 27-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Bradshaw et al., 2000Bradshaw H. Miller J. Ling Q. Malsnee K.

Therefore, it is possible that the functional contributions of vlPAG/DRDA+ neurons were overshadowed in female mice by hormonal influences during our initial testing of pain sensitivity. To address this, we tested a separate cohort of female TH-Cre mice by tracking the effect of vlPAG/DRDA+ activation on nociceptive sensitivity during different phases of the estrous cycle (Figure S2A). CNO treatment in hM3Dq mice resulted in thermal and mechanical nociceptive sensitivity comparable with that of mCherry controls, regardless of hormonal status, suggesting that vlPAG/DRDA+ function is not altered by the estrous cycle (Figures S2B and S2C). Chemogenetic activation of vlPAG/DRDA+ did appear to produce a trend of higher mechanosensitivity thresholds in the von Frey test; however, the mean of variable nociceptive responses was suggestive of an anti-nociceptive effect (Figure S2C; trend for main effect of virus: p = 0.0504). This outcome is reminiscent of the observations during our initial testing of pain sensitivity, indicating that vlPAG/DRDA+ activation in female mice reliably results in variable anti-nociception and that this variability cannot be explained by phase changes in the estrous cycle. To assess whether these differences in DREADD-evoked behavior were due to differences in cell numbers, we next used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) to quantify levels of TH protein and Th mRNA in the vlPAG/DR, respectively, and found no difference in expression between male and female mice (Figures S3A, S3B, S3E, and S3H). Additionally, we quantified DA beta-hydroxylase (DBH) as a marker for norepinephrine (NE) using DBH-EGFP reporter mice for IHC experiments and Dbh mRNA probes in C57BL/6J mice for ISH experiments. Contrary to observations in the vlPAG/DR of rats (Suckow et al., 2013Suckow S.K. Deichsel E.L. Ingram S.L. Morgan M.M. Aicher S.A.

https://openalex.org/W3138460632,"Molecular-based classifications of gastric cancer (GC) were recently proposed, but few of them robustly predict clinical outcomes. While mutation and expression signature of protein-coding genes were used in previous molecular subtyping methods, the noncoding genome in GC remains largely unexplored. Here, we developed the fast long-noncoding RNA analysis (FLORA) method to study RNA sequencing data of GC cases, and prioritized tumor-specific long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by integrating clinical and multi-omic data. We uncovered 1235 tumor-specific lncRNAs, based on which three subtypes were identified. The lncRNA-based subtype 3 (L3) represented a subgroup of intestinal GC with worse survival, characterized by prevalent TP53 mutations, chromatin instability, hypomethylation, and over-expression of oncogenic lncRNAs. In contrast, the lncRNA-based subtype 1 (L1) has the best survival outcome, while LINC01614 expression further segregated a subgroup of L1 cases with worse survival and increased chance of developing distal metastasis. We demonstrated that LINC01614 over-expression is an independent prognostic factor in L1 and network-based functional prediction implicated its relevance to cell migration. Over-expression and CRISPR-Cas9-guided knockout experiments further validated the functions of LINC01614 in promoting GC cell growth and migration. Altogether, we proposed a lncRNA-based molecular subtype of GC that robustly predicts patient survival and validated LINC01614 as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes GC proliferation and migration."

In the last decade, several members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have been described altered in different tumor types. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of their impact on cancer progression, as well as the application of this knowledge to cancer patient management are largely unknown. In this study, we performed targeted sequencing of a cohort of lung cancer patients on genes involved in chromatin structure. In addition, we studied at the protein level the expression of these genes in cancer samples and performed functional experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms linking alterations of chromatin remodeling genes and tumor development. Remarkably, we found that 20% of lung cancer patients show ARID2 protein loss, partially explained by the presence of ARID2 mutations. In addition, we showed that ARID2 deficiency provokes profound chromatin structural changes altering cell transcriptional programs, which bolsters the proliferative and metastatic potential of the cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that ARID2 deficiency impairs DNA repair, enhancing the sensitivity of the cells to DNA-damaging agents. Our findings support that ARID2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer that may be exploited therapeutically."

Furthermore, stereotyped attack displays (e.g., biting, chasing, aggressive arousal) are expressed in most aggressive behaviors (Hashikawa et al., 2018Hashikawa K. Hashikawa Y. Lischinsky J. Lin D. The neural mechanisms of sexually dimorphic aggressive behaviors.Trends Genet. 2018; 34: 755-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Siegel and Victoroff, 2009Siegel A. Victoroff J. Understanding human aggression: New insights from neuroscience.Int. J. Law Psychiatry. 2009; 32: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), implying the involvement of some common pathways for diverse aggressive behaviors. Furthermore, human pathological aggression is characterized by a variety of inappropriate and uncontrollable impulsive attacks (Coccaro, 2012Coccaro E.F. Intermittent explosive disorder as a disorder of impulsive aggression for DSM-5.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2012; 169: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that may break out in the absence of an external threat, implying that some circuits in the brain may encode a general aggressive response. However, whether such synergistic circuits exist in the brain and how they regulate the internal state and behavioral activity patterns that together constitute diverse aggressive behaviors remain unclear. The amygdala is a key node for regulating aggression-related emotional states (McCloskey et al., 2016McCloskey M.S. Phan K.L. Angstadt M. Fettich K.C. Keedy S. Coccaro E.F. Amygdala hyperactivation to angry faces in intermittent explosive disorder.J. Psychiatr. Res. 2016; 79: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Davidson et al., 2000Davidson R.J. Putnam K.M. Larson C.L. Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation—a possible prelude to violence.Science. 2000; 289: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). However, the role of subdivisions of the amygdala in diverse aggressive behaviors and aggressive states remains elusive. The substantia innominata (SI), a sub-region of the basal forebrain, can be divided into the anterior SI (aSI) and the posterior SI (pSI) (Figure S1), which has also been classified as the extended amygdala (Heimer et al., 1997Heimer L. Harlan R.E. Alheid G.F. Garcia M.M. de Olmos J.

Efferent connections of the substantia innominata in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 277: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the SI is also involved in the regulation of motivation and fear behaviors (Yu et al., 2017Yu K. Ahrens S. Zhang X. Schiff H. Ramakrishnan C. Fenno L. Deisseroth K. Zhao F. Luo M.-H. Gong L. et al.The central amygdala controls learning in the lateral amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; Cui et al., 2017Cui Y. Lv G. Jin S. Peng J.

A central amygdala-substantia innominata neural circuitry encodes aversive reinforcement signals.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 1770-1782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the aggression-related emotional state. Using electrophysiological recording and Ca2+ imaging, we found that mouse pSI neurons exhibited graded activities correlating with the biological significance (threatening/attack-provoking or neutral) of the different social-contextual cues and predicting the topography of diverse aggressive behaviors. Optogenetic or pharmacogenetic manipulation of pSI neurons projecting to PAG demonstrated that the pSI-PAG circuit universally controls diverse aggressive behaviors. To explore the role of SI in mouse aggressive behaviors, we first examined the c-Fos expression in the SI and nearby regions induced by inter-male aggression (Figures 1A and S1). The number of c-Fos+ neurons in the pSI under aggressive conditions was ∼3.4-fold greater than that under the control investigating condition, while less of an increase occurred in the aSI, nearby central amygdala (CeA), and globus pallidus (GP) (Figures 1B and 1C). We found that approximately 81% of the aggression-induced c-Fos+ neurons in the pSI were thymus cell antigen 1 positive (Thy1+), and 77% were calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα positive (CaMKIIα+) (Figures 1D and 1E). We then made in vivo electrophysiological recordings of the pSI neuronal activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social behaviors (Figures 1F and 1G). The average firing rate of all the recorded pSI neurons (n = 113) was increased during aggression (Figures 1H–1J), with 39% showing increased activity during an attack (Figure 1H), which was much higher than that during a sniff (Figure 1H). Notably, activity in these aggression-excited pSI neurons started to increase during the sniff preceding an attack (Figures 1K and 1L). The pSI neurons excited with aggression were less activated when sniffing an object (22%; Figure 1M) than when sniffing a male mouse (38%; Figure 1N). Moreover, we found that pSI neurons excited by sniffing a male, a provoking cue for aggression, were activated more in attacks than the excitation when sniffing an object (47% versus 35%; Figures 1O–1R). Interestingly, none of the recorded neurons showed an increased firing rate under all three conditions (Figures 1S and 1T). In summary, we found that pSI neurons are highly active in inter-male aggression, and these neurons may encode the aggression and aggression-provoking cues. To further explore the correlation between the activity in identified subtypes of pSI neurons and aggression, we injected viruses encoding GCaMP6m into the pSI of male Thy1-Cre mice (FVB/N) and used fiber photometry to record Ca2+ signaling in pSIThy1 neurons during various social behaviors (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). Male Thy1-Cre mice exhibited robust aggressive behaviors (mean duration 1.01 ± 0.06 s; Figures S2C and S2D). The activity of pSIThy1 neurons started to increase before an attack (∼−1.2 s, pre-attack), peaked midway through the attack (duration of attacks ∼1.0 s, peak magnitude [ΔF/F] 23.43%) and was sustained for some time after termination of the attack (∼4.8 s, post-attack; Figures S2E–S2H). Remarkably, distinct Ca2+ dynamics of pSIThy1 neurons were found in attacks of different patterns or different episodes of continuous attacks (Figures S2I–S2P). Differential Ca2+ dynamics in the pSIThy1 neurons were also recorded during other types of social behaviors, such as sniffs and rattles, depending on whether these behaviors were followed by attack behavior (Figures 2A and 2B). Ca2+ activity in the pSIThy1 neurons increased more during the sniff/rattle preceding an attack (peak ΔF/F 21.23%/17.37%) than the simple sniff/rattle without an attack (9.90%/7.03%; Figures 2C–2F, 2I, and 2J). Ca2+ levels associated with these sniffs or rattles predicted whether an actual attack would follow (Figures 2G, 2H, 2M, and 2N). When mice threatened male intruders, the pSIThy1 neuronal activity also increased to a high level (17.06%), similar to that in “aggressive” rattles (Figures 2K and 2L). Collectively, pSIThy1 neurons showed a graded increase in Ca2+ activity in various inter-male social behaviors, with the least increase during “non-aggressive” social behaviors such as a simple sniff or rattle, relatively high activity during “aggressive” inter-male social behaviors such as sniff-attack or rattle-attack, and the highest activity in inter-male attacks (Figures 2O and S2). These behaviors in different aggressive states were largely predicted by the associated pSIThy1 neuronal activity (Figures 2P, 2Q, and S2). Next, we investigated whether aggressive behaviors in male Thy1-Cre mice could be evoked by different social-contextual cues (Figure S4A) and how pSIThy1 neurons responded to various cues that may or may not trigger aggression (Figure S4E). We found that various imminent non-social threat cues but not neutral or appetitive stimuli significantly activated the pSIThy1 neurons (Figures S4F–S4I) and moderately evoked aggressive behaviors (Figures S4B–S4D). Moreover, introducing a conspecific into the home cage of a tested male mouse (Figure S4C) frequently evoked aggressive behaviors and immediately induced even higher activity in pSIThy1 neurons than non-threat social cues (Figures S4J–S4N). Interestingly, the introduction of different types of the conspecific evoked differential intensity of pSIThy1 neuronal activity in the order (from weak to strong) female C57 < male C57 < male CD1 < male C57 with a subsequent attack (Figure S4O). We next investigated whether and how Ca2+ activity in pSIThy1 neurons correlates with different types of aggressive behavior (Figure 3A). First, we recorded the neural activity during male-female attacks when Thy1-Cre male mice occasionally attacked female mice (observed in 22.7% of mice; Figure 3B). We found that pSIThy1 neuronal activity was increased during a male-female attack with a time window from −1.7 to 7.5 s (Figure 3C) and peak magnitude similar to that in inter-male attacks (25.62% versus 23.43%; Figures 3D, S2F, and S2G). When introduced to the home cage of male CD-1 mice and attacked by the latter, the Thy1-Cre mice in turn exhibited defensive attacks. Interestingly, the increased neural activity during inter-male defensive attacks (peak ΔF/F 30.23%) was even higher than that during inter-male offensive attacks (Figures 3E–3G). In contrast, although the pSIThy1 neuronal activity was also increased in predatory attacks on crickets, the increase was much less and shorter in sustained time (from −0.2 to 3.3 s) than that in inter-male attacks (Figures 3H–3L). The increased pSIThy1 neuronal activity in pup-directed attacks had a similar magnitude but a longer time window (from −2.1 to 4.8 s) than that in a predatory attack (Figures 3M–3Q). The female aggression in virgin female mice toward a male mouse, although seldom observed and lasting for a shorter time (duration in females versus males 0.42 versus 1.01 s) (Figures 3T, 3V, and S2E), was associated with increased pSIThy1 neuronal activity at a similar amplitude but an even longer time window (from −4.0 to 7.5 s) than with predatory or pup-directed aggression (Figures 3R–3V). The pSIThy1 neuronal Ca2+ properties in cricket-directed, pup-directed, and female social behaviors were used to classify the sniffs, sniffs (attack), and attacks (Figures 3K, 3P, and 3U) and predicted whether an actual attack would follow (Figures S3L–S3AA). Interestingly, the decoding accuracy in the four types of attack and approach (attack) was much higher than those in the four types of approach (Figures S3X and S3Y). Moreover, pSIThy1 neurons in the tested mice showed graded increases in activity in the order (from weak to strong) predatory aggression < pup-directed aggression < female aggression < male offensive aggression < male defensive aggression (Figures S3Z and S3AA). In summary, the perception of various aggression-provoking cues and the topography of aggressive behaviors are critical elements of the magnitude and dynamics of pSIThy1 neuronal activity. We then asked whether the activation of pSIThy1 neurons is sufficient to elicit aggression. hM3Dq-encoding virus-injected male mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to pharmacogenetically activate the pSIThy1 neurons (Figures 4A and 4B ). CNO treatment robustly induced aggressive behaviors in mice (Figures 4C and S5S). Interestingly, no mating behavior was observed (Figure 4C). Using the anterograde transsynaptic tracing approach, we found that ventral lateral/lateral PAG (VL/LPAG), a region involved in the motor control of social behaviors (Behbehani, 1995Behbehani M.M. Functional characteristics of the midbrain periaqueductal gray.Prog. Neurobiol. 1995; 46: 575-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), was densely innervated by pSI neurons (Figures S5A–S5D; also see https://portal.brain-map.org, experiment ID 120281646; Grove, 1988aGrove E.A. Efferent connections of the substantia innominata in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 277: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We further labeled the input neurons to the PAG by injecting a retrograde AAV-Retro-EGFP virus into the VL/LPAG (Figure 4D). A dense infection of upstream neurons was found in the pSI, but none or few in the aSI, GP, or medial amygdala (MeA) (Figures 4D and 4E). Most of the pSI neurons projecting to the PAG (pSI-PAG neurons) were Thy1 positive or CaMKIIα positive (∼87%/77%; Figures S5E–S5H), and chemogenetic activation of the pSI-PAG neurons (Figures S5I–S5O) robustly elicited inter-male aggression, but no mating behavior was observed (Figures S5P–S5R). We next used an optogenetic approach to establish a causal relationship between pSI-PAG neuronal activity and aggressive behaviors with more precise temporal resolution (Figures 4F and S6A–S6C). A socially housed male that exhibited minimal natural inter-male aggression (Figure 4G) immediately attacked a singly housed male (Figures 4H and S6G; Video S1) when pSI-PAG neurons were optogenetically activated (Figures S6D–S6F). Notably, the light-evoked attack was characterized by biting an opponent’s dorsal surface at a mean latency of ∼3 s (Figure 4I), resembling the most violent natural aggressive behavior (Figure S2). Optogenetic activation of pSICaMKIIα neurons (Figures S6P–S6T) or PAG-projecting pSIThy1 neurons (Figure S7) similarly increased male aggression. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/528d10f6-11b2-446a-970c-7fa3295fc025/mmc3.mp4Loading ...

Optogenetic activation of pSI-PAG neurons in a C57 male mouse in its home cage evokes attacks on a singly housed male intruder, related to Figure 4The male mouse (black) transfected with ChR2 in pSI-PAG neurons and implanted with a fiber-optic cable in the pSI was photostimulated during the period indicated by “Light on.”3 Diverse types of aggression may be classified primarily into proactive and affective forms, characterized by hypoarousal and hyperarousal, respectively (Siegel and Victoroff, 2009Siegel A. Victoroff J. Understanding human aggression: New insights from neuroscience.Int. J. Law Psychiatry. 2009; 32: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons modulates arousal (Figures 4J and 4K; Wang et al., 2015Wang L. Chen I.Z. Lin D. Collateral pathways from the ventromedial hypothalamus mediate defensive behaviors.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1344-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of the pSI-PAG neurons resulted in a significant (∼30%) increase in pupil size (Figures 4L and 4M; Video S2), a response that was sustained for >15 s after the stimulation ceased. The eyes were also wider during pSI stimulation (Figure 4N; Video S2). Moreover, pSI-PAG activation caused increases in breathing rate (Figure 4O) and heart rate (Figure 4P), as well as body trembling (Figure 4Q; Video S2). However, the photostimulation of pSI-PAG neurons did not affect the overall level of anxiety (Figures S6I and S6J) or trigger the freezing or flight response (Figures S6K–S6O). In summary, optogenetic activation of pSI-PAG neurons immediately induced robust attacks accompanied by an increased arousal state (Figure 4R), a response consistent with affective aggression (Siegel and Victoroff, 2009Siegel A. Victoroff J. Understanding human aggression: New insights from neuroscience.Int. J. Law Psychiatry. 2009; 32: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/71399e28-fb61-4b55-8131-3052c48811fb/mmc4.mp4Loading ...

Optogenetic activation of pSI-PAG neurons evokes arousal responses, including an enlarged pupil in a head-fixed C57 male mouse, related to Figure 4The male mouse (black) transfected with ChR2 in pSI-PAG neurons and implanted with a fiber-optic cable in the pSI was photostimulated during the period indicated by “Light on.”4 We reasoned that the increased arousal induced by pSI activation might establish a “heightened aggressive arousal” that overcomes the internal and external requirements for evoking multiple types of aggression (Moyer, 1968Moyer K.E. Kinds of aggression and their physiological basis.Commun. Behav. Biol. 1968; 2: 65-87Google Scholar). In the subsequent experiments, we determined whether the photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons induces a variety of aggressive behaviors under various conditions (Figure 5A). Offensive inter-male aggression is expressed distinctly when animals are under different social-contextual conditions and identified aggression-associated circuits are activated (Yang et al., 2017Yang T. Yang C.F. Chizari M.D. Maheswaranathan N. Burke Jr., K.J. Borius M. Inoue S. Chiang M.C. Bender K.J. Ganguli S. Shah N.M.

The neuropeptide Tac2 controls a distributed brain state induced by chronic social isolation stress.Cell. 2018; 173: 1265-1279.e19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons not only facilitated typical territorial inter-male aggression in both singly housed (Figure 5J) and socially housed (Figure 4) resident mice in their home cages but also in a novel cage (Figure 5J) or even when a socially housed male encountered its male cage mate (Figure 5J). Notably, photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons even induced inter-male aggression when the optogenetically activated male mice intruded into the home cage of another mouse (Figure 5J). Under normal conditions, male mice do not attack females (Lin et al., 2011Lin D. Boyle M.P. Dollar P. Lee H. Lein E.S. Perona P. Anderson D.J. Functional identification of an aggression locus in the mouse hypothalamus.Nature. 2011; 470: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Interestingly, photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons reliably induced male aggression against females to an extent similar to attacks against males (Figure 5J). Strikingly, pSI activation in virgin females, which rarely express aggression, immediately initiated attacks against males (Figures 5B and 5C; Video S3) or females (Figure 5J). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/cb07d483-3b8f-453d-b9f1-8dcdc1dd92cc/mmc5.mp4Loading ...

Optogenetic activation of pSI-PAG neurons in a C57 female mouse in its home cage evokes attack on a socially housed male intruder, related to Figure 5The female mouse (black) transfected with ChR2 in pSI-PAG neurons and implanted with a fiber-optic cable in pSI was photostimulated during the period indicated by “Light on.”5 We found that photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons in sexually experienced males evoked aggression toward pups (Figures 5D and 5E), an infanticidal behavior usually committed by adult virgin males but not sexually experienced males (Isogai et al., 2018Isogai Y. Wu Z. Love M.I. Ahn M.H. Bambah-Mukku D. Hua V. Farrell K. Dulac C. Multisensory logic of infant-directed aggression by males.Cell. 2018; 175: 1827-1841.e17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons increased predatory attacks in male mice toward crickets (Figure 5J). Interestingly, photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons also induced object-directed aggression (Figures 5F and 5G): a moving glove evoked a rage-like response in male mice that never occurred in control mice (Lin et al., 2011Lin D. Boyle M.P. Dollar P. Lee H. Lein E.S. Perona P. Anderson D.J. Functional identification of an aggression locus in the mouse hypothalamus.Nature. 2011; 470: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A socially housed male that had been previously socially defeated by a more aggressive CD-1 male for 5 min would flee or freeze without apparent aggression (Blanchard et al., 2003Blanchard R.J. Wall P.M. Blanchard D.C. Problems in the study of rodent aggression.Horm. Behav. 2003; 44: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) when encountering the same CD-1 mouse later in the home cage of that CD-1 mouse (Video S4). Surprisingly, photoactivation of pSI-PAG neurons in the defeated mouse immediately shifted the flight or freeze into a defensive attack toward the aggressive CD-1 male (Figures 5H and 5I; Video S4). No increased mating behavior was observed under the above conditions. Optogenetic or pharmacogenetic activation of pSICaMKIIα/Thy1 neurons similarly increased the rarely observed male or female aggression (Figure S8). Furthermore, photoactivation of the pSI-PAG or pSICaMKIIα neuronal projection terminals in the PAG, but not in the other two downstream target areas related to aggression, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), or VMH (Lin et al., 2011Lin D.

https://openalex.org/W3138351527,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is challenging to treat successfully because targeted therapies do not exist. Instead, systemic therapy is typically restricted to cytotoxic chemotherapy, which fails more often in patients with elevated circulating cholesterol. Liver x receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are homeostatic regulators of cholesterol, and are linked to regulation of broad-affinity xenobiotic transporter activity in non-tumor tissues. We show that LXR ligands confer chemotherapy resistance in TNBC cell lines and xenografts, and that LXRalpha is necessary and sufficient to mediate this resistance. Furthermore, in TNBC patients who had cancer recurrences, LXRalpha and ligands were independent markers of poor prognosis and correlated with P-glycoprotein expression. However, in patients who survived their disease, LXRalpha signaling and P-glycoprotein were decoupled. These data reveal a novel chemotherapy resistance mechanism in this poor prognosis subtype of breast cancer. We conclude that systemic chemotherapy failure in some TNBC patients is caused by co-opting the LXRalpha:P-glycoprotein axis, a pathway highly targetable by therapies that are already used for prevention and treatment of other diseases."

This offers an opportunity to adopt active learning, which increases students’ performance compared to lectures, narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students, and promotes equity and inclusivity, as the basis of STEM education. The COVID-19 global pandemic has forced the higher education sector to transition to an uncharted remote-learning format. This offers an opportunity to adopt active learning, which increases students’ performance compared to lectures, narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students, and promotes equity and inclusivity, as the basis of STEM education. The word “career” etymologically derives from the Latin carrus, which indicates a wheeled vehicle or a wagon. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put the brakes on the careers of millions of people worldwide and disrupted undergraduate and graduate education. Many students and scientists may feel as if the wheels have well and truly come off their scientific careers. With social distancing practices imposed, the higher education sector has been forced to transition toward an uncharted fully remote-learning format. In normal circumstances, the rollout of online university courses would require significant time and resources to develop IT systems, design content, and retrain faculty. Despite the pressing need for a “new norm,” these resources are unlikely to be readily available to all the universities now urgently in need of them. As a consequence, there is a real threat to educational standards. Therefore, the current situation threatens not only to jeopardize students’ learning, but also to exacerbate global educational inequalities. Yet, in a time of uncertainty, new opportunities arise. The pandemic has threatened that stalwart of higher education: the traditional live lecture, often with hundreds of students congregated in a crowded room to passively witness an instructor hold forth on the stage. This lecture format has persisted as the mainstay of undergraduate (college) and graduate education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Naturally, there is much wringing of hands that the pandemic is compromising the education of a whole cohort of students by denying them the benefits of live in-person lectures. Yet, examining published randomized controlled studies, there seem to be no differences in students’ learning outcomes with online lectures compared to the in-person format (Table 1). However, despite the lack of differences in objective outcomes, a disadvantage of online lectures is that students feel less engaged and connected with the teacher and their classmates. In one of the studies, 69% of students randomized to online lectures agreed with the statement: “I feel that being able to interact with the lecturer in person in a classroom setting is a better learning experience than the online format”—despite the online lecture students performing better than live lecture students on a subsequent exam on the course topic (Vaccani et al., 2016Vaccani J.P.

Open table in a new tab Due to space constraints, we were able to include only a limited number of studies in this table. That the transformation of lectures to an online format appears to do no objective harm to students’ learning will undoubtedly provide reassurance for educators in this time of crisis. But rather than replicate the educational modus operandi in an online form, the current situation represents an ideal moment to transform educational delivery by making active learning the basis of STEM education, uprooting the traditional format of lecture-based teaching. The traditional “passive” approach to STEM higher education is embodied in the lecture format, with students listening to experts who impart their knowledge (Figure 1A). In contrast, active learning involves students “doing things and thinking about the things they are doing” (Bonwell and Eison, 1991Bonwell C.C. Eison J.A. Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.1991 ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Reports. ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.1991Google Scholar). In our careers as scientists, there are certain tasks we routinely do, regardless of our specific areas of expertise; for example, condensing analyses in a series of slides, writing an abstract, submitting a travel grant, or reviewing a manuscript. These tasks occupy a large proportion of our work, but explicit training in these activities is rarely offered at universities (Sandrone and Schneider, 2020Sandrone S. Schneider L.D. Active and distance learning in neuroscience education.Neuron. 2020; 106: 895-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These are examples of active learning tasks. Within an active learning session, guided by an expert facilitator, students learn by, for example, “creating” or “applying” something relevant to the aims of the teaching session. Action words like these describe the “cognitive processes” by which students, individually or in groups, engage with knowledge. The full terminology of active learning is described in the revised Bloom’s taxonomy, one of the pillars of this learner-centered approach (Anderson et al., 2001Anderson L.W. Krathwohl D.R. Airasian P.W. Cruikshank K.A. Mayer R.E. Pintrich P.R. Raths J. Wittrock M.C. A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Longman, New York2001Google Scholar). From an andragogical viewpoint, active learning is an old acquaintance, not a new player: a corpus of a hundred active learning tasks has been available since the 1990s (Bonwell and Eison, 1991Bonwell C.C. Eison J.A. Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.1991 ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Reports. ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.1991Google Scholar, Silberman, 1996Silberman M. Active Learning: 101 Strategies To Teach Any Subject. Prentice-Hall, Des Moines1996Google Scholar). But it is only in the last decade that an evidence base for the role of active learning in STEM education has emerged. In this time, active learning has demonstrated several advantages over traditional educational formats for both in-person and online environments. It has shown superior benefits across educational levels in STEM subjects, increasing students’ performance compared to lectures across disciplines, as demonstrated by a meta-analysis of 225 studies comparing active learning with traditional lectures (Freeman et al., 2014Freeman S. Eddy S.L. McDonough M. Smith M.K. Okoroafor N. Jordt H. Wenderoth M.P. Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8410-8415Crossref PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Such active-learning-related performance increases (“learning gain”) were recorded across all course types, course levels, and class sizes, although active learning proved to be especially beneficial in small classes (Freeman et al., 2014Freeman S. Eddy S.L. McDonough M. Smith M.K. Okoroafor N. Jordt H. Wenderoth M.P. Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8410-8415Crossref PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Active learning reduces disparities and narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students in these subjects and can promote equity and inclusivity in higher education (Theobald et al., 2020Theobald E.J. Hill M.J. Tran E. Agrawal S. Arroyo E.N. Behling S. Chambwe N. Cintrón D.L. Cooper J.D. Dunster G. et al.Active learning narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117: 6476-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). More specifically, active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores and passing rates by a magnitude of 33%; while offering benefits to all students, it has a “disproportionately beneficial impact” for individuals from low-income backgrounds and students from underrepresented minorities (Theobald et al., 2020Theobald E.J. Hill M.J. Tran E. Agrawal S. Arroyo E.N. Behling S. Chambwe N. Cintrón D.L. Cooper J.D. Dunster G. et al.Active learning narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117: 6476-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For in-person activities, there is no need to redesign the classroom architecture or add expensive technological devices to successfully implement active learning. In fact, no significant differences in grades have been found for the same course taught in a high-technology-based active learning classroom environment (where computers have been integrated at students’ workstations) versus a low-technology-based one (the traditional model of desks and chairs, but with the instructor employing active learning methods) (Nicol et al., 2018Nicol A.A. Owens S.M. Le Coze S.S. MacIntyre A. Eastwood C. Comparison of high-technology active learning and low-technology active learning classrooms.Active Learning in Higher Education. 2018; 19: 253-265Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Even students’ learning gain does not differ between high- and low-tech active learning environments (Soneral and Wyse, 2017Soneral P.A. Wyse S.A. A SCALE-UP mock-up: comparison of student learning gains in high-and low-tech active-learning environments.CBE Life Sci. Educ. 2017; 16: ar12Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As we have seen for lectures, the evidence suggests that active learning can also be successfully deployed in an online setting, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Even within an online environment, active learning engages students and maximizes their learning (Khan et al., 2017Khan A. Egbue O. Palkie B. Madden J. Active learning: engaging students to maximize learning in an online course.Electronic Journal of E-Learning. 2017; 15: 107-115Google Scholar). The basic technology required for the successful delivery of active learning online is that participants have access to a device with an internet connection supporting two-way video calling. In addition to learning gain, active learning improves learning outcomes by fostering community. In 1991, the anthropologist Jean Lave and the educationalist Etienne Wenger theorized the concept of “community of practice,” where members learn from each other and develop on a personal and professional level by sharing common experiences, practices, and knowledge, a concept that was further explored in subsequent works (Wenger, 1998). Via both in-person and online settings, active learning can promote core community of practice characteristics, such as “becoming” and “belonging” (Wenger, 1998Wenger E. Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity. Cambridge University Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). These characteristics must be fostered during the pandemic to improve students’ learning experience. All these concepts, along with the notion of students’ engagement, are increasingly used in measures of student retention and in attempts to quantify the quality of teaching across universities. These are likely to serve as criteria to direct university funding and play a role in guiding students’ university selection choices. Given the growing importance of such metrics and considering how active learning can favor these aspects, in the midst of uncertainty, the major adoption of active learning might prove to be a competitive advantage for educational institutions for years to come. However, the feelings of students toward learning within an active learning environment are often different from their feelings about the passive learning to which they are accustomed. While still positive, students’ feeling of learning within an active learning format was lower compared to those who learned in a more traditional, passive environment (Deslauriers et al., 2019Deslauriers L. McCarty L.S. Miller K. Callaghan K. Kestin G. Measuring actual learning versus feeling of learning in response to being actively engaged in the classroom.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 19251-19257Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Consequently, while students demonstrably learn more within an active learning setting, they may paradoxically feel like they learn less (Deslauriers et al., 2019Deslauriers L. McCarty L.S. Miller K. Callaghan K. Kestin G. Measuring actual learning versus feeling of learning in response to being actively engaged in the classroom.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 19251-19257Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This misconception is often due to students’ inexperience with the new active learning format and the increased cognitive challenges they experience within this cognitively demanding environment, especially at the beginning of its implementation, as opposed to the perceived “cognitive fluency” of the traditional lecture format (Deslauriers et al., 2019Deslauriers L. McCarty L.S. Miller K. Callaghan K. Kestin G. Measuring actual learning versus feeling of learning in response to being actively engaged in the classroom.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 19251-19257Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, to counteract this, it is crucial to set students’ expectations, explain the relevance of the active learning approach, and contextualize the activities within a broader career-related perspective, tapping into the students’ motivation and engagement. As the course progresses, reminding students of the benefits of active learning might also be helpful. The adoption of active learning does not necessarily mean the abandonment of the traditional lecture format. Instead, active learning encompasses a suite of approaches that can form part of an educational mix, providing flexibility in teaching delivery. There is certainly no one-size-fits-all solution. We provide examples of how active learning approaches can be incorporated into STEM education. Instead of replacing the traditional lecture format, elements of active learning can be incorporated within lectures. To maximize the effectiveness of this approach, it is necessary to rethink the design of lectures. There are many options here, but a basic strategy is to divide a lecture into small units, each delivered didactically, and active learning tasks are included at the boundaries of these units (Figure 1A, right). A rich palette of active learning tasks can be easily incorporated across the restructured lecture. As a bare minimum, repeated periods of audience interaction should be encouraged, such that students can check their understanding over time. This is simple in person and can be implemented easily over voice or video communication. The online environment has also opened up many more diverse opportunities for audience participation of this kind. Software like Mentimeter captures live questions or polling, whereas Panopto allows the insertion of questions into video recordings at specific points so that students can ensure they are comfortable with the material before moving forward. Other options include, either in person or online, quizzes, other polling systems, Q&A sessions, live problem solving with real data, and debates (Bonwell and Eison, 1991Bonwell C.C. Eison J.A. Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.1991 ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Reports. ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.1991Google Scholar). In-person or online synchronous formats allow these kinds of interactions, but it may not be possible to deliver lectures synchronously. Asynchronous viewing denies instructors the possibility of adjusting their teaching on the fly based on their live impressions of the audience’s understanding. But there are advantages of asynchronous delivery. By providing students with online recordings of lectures, those periods of synchronous classroom time, be it online or in person, can be fully devoted to active learning tasks. A range of active learning tasks is possible in both online and in-person settings. Active learning tasks can revolve around case studies, such as students applying the concepts they have learned to novel scenarios or think-pair-share questions (i.e., posing a question for students, allowing them to come up with answers, having them discuss their answers with peers, then discussing with the group at large). Additionally, web-based response questions can be designed for students to wrestle with critical scientific concepts: these can be individually answered via mobile phones or laptops and then discussed by the class at large. In addition to these, in Figure 1B, we offer examples of active learning tasks that can be deployed either online or in person, individually or in groups, providing flexibility for instructors who need to switch formats or are teaching classes where some students are in the classroom and some are remote. Additionally, CourseSource, an open access online journal, provides instructors with materials to incorporate active learning exercises in a wide variety of biological disciplines. Laboratory exercises provide a powerful form of in-person active learning. Yet they can still be delivered within an online environment, with potential to enhance students’ learning experience. Experimental techniques can be demonstrated to students via videos made by the instructors or by using online journals with video demonstrations. These can be paired with short questions that assess students’ understanding of the rationale for major steps in the protocol. There are online platforms, such as LabXchange, where students can perform virtual simulations and even troubleshoot experimental designs to gain practice with fundamental molecular techniques. Primary data can then be shared as if the students collected them by themselves. Students can analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions. While, ideally, they would be gathering data themselves at the bench, the central component of laboratory sessions on data analysis, presentation of results, and drawing of conclusions is preserved—even if access to the laboratory is prevented. Using these skills to address novel scientific questions is key to developing students’ critical thinking and problem-solving acumen. Two of us (W.J.A. and K.M.) carried out a randomized controlled study with a crossover design in an introductory college-level biochemistry course, randomizing students to either live lectures or prerecorded asynchronous online lectures covering identical content (Musunuru et al., 2021Musunuru K. Machanda Z.P. Qiao L. Anderson W.J. Randomized controlled studies comparing traditional lectures versus online modules.bioRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.18.427113Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Consistent with previously published works, no differences were observed in terms of achieved learning outcomes during the semester. Still, students reported a higher engagement level during online lectures than live lectures, and the majority (60%) preferred online lectures to live lectures (Table 1). In addition, outside of the experimental intervention, all students attended weekly small-group sessions in an active-learning format led by one of the instructors. Each session was organized around a patient case intended to illuminate key biochemistry concepts (one example is available at https://bit.ly/Fragile-X-protein-structure-case). Students were split into small groups and discussed the data provided as teams; they also debated the answers to open-ended questions intended to replicate the scientific investigative process, thus engaging in the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy (Figure 1A). The instructor circulated through the room to serve as a sounding board and provided guidance to teams while gauging the level of understanding on the students’ side. In light of the positive feedback received from the students, the same active-learning, small-group, case-based format has since been applied to other courses, covering diverse topics such as human genetics and CRISPR genome editing (examples available at https://bit.ly/CRISPR-genome-editing-case, https://bit.ly/genetic-testing-case, and https://bit.ly/GWAS-cholesterol-gene-case). Even though all the sessions were conducted in person, the materials have been provided in a cost-free online format (Google Forms), suitable for laptops, tablets, and smartphones, to promote ease of accessibility. This package of educational activities was transitioned to a fully online delivery format during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in fall 2020. Prerecorded asynchronous lectures were made available, and the small-group sessions were conducted via an online platform (Zoom) with breakout rooms. Within the virtual breakout rooms, students could work together on the same cases, with the instructor circulating through the rooms, as in the physical classroom. With the course activities working equally well in-person and virtually—with minimal effort needed to pivot between the two formats—we see the use of asynchronous lectures paired with online case-based exercises as a model for instructors to emulate, both while the current pandemic is ongoing and afterward. When the pandemic has resolved, should we all reflexively move back to traditional, largely passive live lectures, or should we view our current circumstances as a golden opportunity to reboot STEM education? In our opinion, reverting to the pre-pandemic status quo would be a disservice to students and educators alike. The advantages of active learning should not be ignored. Compared to the traditional lecture format, an active-learning-powered STEM education offers opportunities to train in an interactive, practical way, concerned with the higher-order cognitive abilities demanded by a subject rather than simply knowledge. Active learning tasks can be applied to any discipline and tailored to different levels of study. Educators looking to reboot their methods can embrace this flexibility by choosing which domain-specific knowledge to focus on and which cognitive processes to target. Educational delivery established in online formats will be more resilient to disruption from a new wave of the coronavirus or new pandemic. And in the midst of a crisis, by adopting active learning, we can improve not only current standards of educational delivery, but also transform educational practice for the long term. There is a universe to be explored beyond the bricks and mortar of our universities. Even at a distance, we can train the next generations of scientists while offering an authentic, real-life, and, hopefully, inspiring learning journey. In the words of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, aviator and author of The Little Prince: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” We can use several metaphors to depict our students’ and our own careers, from a wheeled vehicle to a ship, or the aircraft piloted by the Little Prince. Whatever the vehicle, it is time to turn on the engine.

During their lifespan, cells are exposed to a plethora of cues that control processes such as cell division, differentiation, migration, and death. Often, these cues are presented simultaneously to bind specific cell surface receptors and activate downstream signaling pathways. Despite recent progress, how this wealth of extracellular information is integrated and controlled remains poorly understood. A remarkable example of such integration is represented by the receptor Neogenin (NEO1) and its two ligands, repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) and Netrin-1 (NET1). NEO1 is a single-pass transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (Wilson and Key, 2007Wilson N.H. Key B. Neogenin: one receptor, many functions.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), composed of 4 N-terminal Ig-like domains, followed by 6 fibronectin type III-like domains, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain. It is implicated in inflammation (Fujita and Yamashita, 2017Fujita Y. Yamashita T. The roles of RGMa-neogenin signaling in inflammation and angiogenesis.Inflamm.

To mediate these functions, NEO1 binds structurally and functionally distinct ligands such as RGM and NET1. Interactions between NEO1 and all three members of the GPI-anchored RGM family (RGMA, RGMB/Dragon, RGMC/Hemojuvelin/HFE2) are mediated by FN domains 5 and 6 of NEO1, forming the core of a signal transduction hub for RGM-mediated repulsive guidance through the plasma membrane. Two RGM molecules act as molecular staples to bring together the juxtamembrane regions of two NEO1 receptors into a signaling-competent dimer (Bell et al., 2013Bell C.H. Healey E. van Erp S.

At the cellular level, NET1 and RGMs cause opposing effects via NEO1 (e.g. cell attraction versus repulsion). As both ligands bind to the NEO1 FN domains, their signaling needs to be spatiotemporally controlled. Simultaneous exposure of NEO1 to RGMs and NET1 occurs during neural tube closure, axon guidance, neuron migration, and other processes (Kee et al., 2008Kee N. Wilson N. De Vries M. Bradford D. Key B.

Neogenin interacts with RGMa and netrin-1 to guide axons within the embryonic vertebrate forebrain.Dev. Biol. 2006; 296: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and NET1 and RGMs can functionally interact. For example, RGMA is a repulsive guidance cue for NEO1-positive cortical interneurons migrating out of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) of the ventral forebrain. Interestingly, NET1 expression in the MGE silences the repulsive effects of RGMA-NEO1 signaling (O’Leary et al., 2013O’Leary C. Cole S.J. Langford M. Hewage J. White A. Cooper H.M. RGMa regulates cortical interneuron migration and differentiation.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e81711Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms explaining how both ligands activate NEO1, and how these guidance cues cross-talk to transduce their signals, remain elusive. Here, we determined the structure of an unexpected ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex that forms a defined and stable “trimer-of-trimers” assembly. We show that formation of the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex inhibits both RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and RGMA-NEO1- and NET1-NEO1-mediated neuron migration. Our data demonstrate that NET1 and RGMs can bind simultaneously to NEO1 rather than competing for binding, thereby unveiling an intriguing mode of receptor regulation. The ternary structure acts as a silencing complex, preventing the formation of the signaling-compatible RGM-NEO1 complex as well as NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering, both required for signal transduction. Thus, our work reveals how two ligands with distinct and opposing cellular functions can control their receptor by reciprocal silencing of downstream signaling pathways. This mechanism is likely to apply more generally, as other receptors are also known to bind structurally and functionally distinct ligands. To dissect the molecular mechanisms that control NEO1 signaling via interactions with RGM and NET1, we identified the minimal binding regions for the NET1-NEO1 interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cell surface binding experiments (Figures S1A–S1D). Our data show that the minimal complex is composed of the three membrane proximal FN domains of NEO1 (NEO1FN456) and a NET1 construct lacking the C-terminal NTR domain (NET1ΔNTR) (Figure 1A), in line with previous biochemical studies (Geisbrecht et al., 2003Geisbrecht B.V.

To distinguish between these two options, we carried out in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs) (Söderberg et al., 2006Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). We mutually incubated full-length NEO1 expressing cells with purified NET1ΔNTR and the full-length ectodomain of RGMB (RGMBECD) and observed numerous PLA foci, which can only be generated when NET1 and RGMB come into close proximity (<40nm) (Figures 1B and 1C). The number of foci was diminished when wild type RGMB was replaced with a RGMB mutant (RGMB-A186R [Healey et al., 2015Healey E.G. Bishop B. Elegheert J. Bell C.H. Padilla-Parra S. Siebold C. Repulsive guidance molecule is a structural bridge between neogenin and bone morphogenetic protein.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar]) that cannot efficiently bind to NEO1 (Figures 1B and 1C). This result suggests that NEO1 is specifically required for bridging NET1 and RGMB and that a complex of RGMB, NET1, and NEO1 forms on the cell surface. This scenario describes signaling in “trans,” whereby RGM and NEO1 are expressed in different cells, for example in RGM-mediated axon guidance. We also observed a high number of foci from NET1-RGMB interactions when full-length RGMB (RGMBFL) and NEO1 are co-transfected in the presence of soluble NET1ΔNTR (Figures S1E and S1F). This shows that the ternary complex can also form in “cis,” a situation occurring in hepatocytes or chondrocytes (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang A.S. Yang F. Wang J. Tsukamoto H. Enns C.A.

It remains to be seen what the effect of NET1 in these signaling scenarios is. To understand how NEO1, NET1, and RGMB assemble into a ternary complex, we determined the crystal structure of the minimal ternary NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex, composed of NEO1FN456, NET1ΔNTR and the RGMB NEO1-binding region (RGMBCORE) (Figure 1D; Methods S1; Table S1) to 3.25 Å resolution. Strikingly, this ternary complex is assembled into a 3:3:3 stoichiometry, composed of three 1:1:1 “protomer” complexes arranged around a 3-fold symmetry axis (Figure 1D and Figure 2A). To test whether such a “trimer-of-trimers” arrangement can exist in solution, we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (Figure 2B) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Figure 2C) analyses. Both methods suggest the assembly of a 3:3:3 NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex as the major species. We further interrogated stoichiometry and architecture of the ternary complex using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The ternary complex composed of NEO1FN456, NET1ΔNTR and RGMBECD could be readily formed on SEC (Figures S2A–S2D). The peak fraction contained all three proteins and was further analyzed using SEC-MALS. The experimentally determined molecular weight (MW) (422.7 ± 2.8 kDa) matched the calculated MW of the glycosylated complex (433 kDa) confirming the presence of the 3:3:3 assembly in solution (Figure S2B). We further analyzed the same sample with cryo-EM (Methods S2). Single particle analysis of the NET1-NEO1-RGMB complex revealed their trimeric symmetry (Figure 2D), consistent with the complex determined by crystallography (Figure 2A). We reconstructed a cryo-EM map to 6.0 Å resolution in which the crystallographic 3:3:3 complex could be readily fitted (Figures 2E and 2F). Using a similar SEC-MALS experiment as for RGMB, we could show that the full-length extracellular domains of the other two human RGM family members RGMA and RGMC form ternary complexes with NEO1FN456 and NET1 (Figures S2E–S2H) suggestive of ternary 3:3:3 RGM-NEO1-NET1 architecture. The backbone of the “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex is essentially formed by interactions between NEO1 and NET1. NET1 is an elongated and rigid molecule, making contacts with two neighboring NEO1 molecules in order to bridge individual NEO1-NET1-RGM protomers within the super-complex (Figures 2A and 3A and Figures S3A and S3B). The NET1 LN domain (NET1LN) forms the major interaction site with NEO1, binding to NEO1FN4 (“Interface-1,” Figure 3A, right panel). The combined buried surface area between NET1LN and NEO1FN4 is 686 Å2 and involves predominantly hydrophobic interactions, with NET1 residue F55 in the center. The second interface is formed by the NET1LE3 of the same NET1 molecule and a neighboring NEO1FN5 domain. In contrast to “Interface-1,” this interaction is of a predominantly hydrophilic nature with a buried surface area of 572 Å2 (“Interface-2,” Figure 3A, left panel). Both interfaces are highly conserved amongst NEO1 orthologues (Figures S3A and S3B). The NEO1 FN5 and FN6 domains interact with RGMB, as observed in our previous structural analysis of binary NEO1-RGM complexes, via the high-affinity “site 1” interface (Bell et al., 2013Bell C.H.

We examined the microbiome recovered from placentas in a multi-ethnic maternal pre-pregnant obesity cohort, through an optimized microbiome protocol to enrich low bacterial biomass samples. We found that the microbiomes recovered from the placentas of obese pre-pregnant mothers are less abundant and less diverse when compared to those from mothers of normal pre-pregnancy weight. Microbiome richness also decreases from the maternal side to the fetal side, demonstrating heterogeneity by geolocation within the placenta. In summary, our study shows that the microbiomes recovered from the placentas are associated with pre-pregnancy obesity. IMPORTANCE: Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity may have an impact on both maternal and fetal health. The placenta is an important organ at the interface of the mother and fetus, and supplies nutrients to the fetus. We report that the microbiomes enriched from the placentas of obese pre-pregnant mothers are less abundant and less diverse when compared to those from mothers of normal pre-pregnancy weight.

Here, we report that JDPs can further enhance the targeting competence of Hsp70-bound client proteins during tail-anchored protein (TA) biogenesis. In the guided-entry-of-tail–anchored protein pathway in yeast, nascent TAs are captured by cytosolic Hsp70 and sequentially relayed to downstream chaperones, Sgt2 and Get3, for delivery to the ER. We found that two JDPs, Ydj1 and Sis1, function in parallel to support TA targeting to the ER in vivo. Biochemical analyses showed that, while Ydj1 and Sis1 differ in their ability to assist Hsp70 in TA trapping, both JDPs enhance the transfer of Hsp70-bound TAs to Sgt2. The ability of the JDPs to regulate the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 is essential for enhancing the transfer competence of Hsp70-bound TAs in vitro and for supporting TA insertion in vivo.

The Hsp70 family comprises a central hub of the chaperone network that maintains cellular protein homeostasis and functions in every stage of the protein life cycle, from de novo folding, protein transport, to aggregate remodeling and degradation (1Clerico E.M.

Hsp70 chaperones: Cellular functions and molecular mechanism.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The function of Hsp70s is governed by the ATPase cycle in its nucleotide binding domain (NBD), which is tightly coupled to interactions with cochaperones. In the ATP-bound state, the α-helical lid of the Hsp70 substrate binding domain (SBD) docks against the NBD and is away from the peptide binding site in the SBD, allowing rapid client binding and dissociation (4Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Kinetics of molecular chaperone action.Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Client proteins and a class of cochaperones, termed Hsp40 or J-domain proteins (JDPs), stimulate ATP hydrolysis on Hsp70, converting Hsp70 to the ADP state that binds client proteins with higher affinity and kinetic stability (1Clerico E.M.

Kinetics of molecular chaperone action.Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Studies with peptide substrates suggested that this client trapping is due in part to the closing of the α-helical lid over the peptide binding site in the SBD, although closing appears less pronounced with protein substrates (5Marcinowski M.

Another class of cochaperones, the nucleotide exchange factors, facilitate client dissociation from Hsp70 by accelerating ADP release and, in some cases, directly contacting the Hsp70-SBD to drive client displacement (7Dragovic Z. Broadley S.A. Shomura Y. Bracher A. Hartl F.U.

JDPs have been reported to assist in Hsp70 function via two mechanisms that are mediated by distinct structural and functional domains. All JDPs contain a ∼70 residue J-domain that binds ATP-bound Hsp70 at the NBD–SBD interface and stimulates their ATPase activity. A conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif in the J-domain docks at the interdomain linker of Hsp70 to optimize two networks of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions at the ATPase active site (10Kityk R.

Ren H.-Y. Lee P. Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. The type I Hsp40 zinc finger-like region is required for Hsp70 to capture non-native polypeptides from Ydj1.J. Biol.

Although the role of the JDP/Hsp70 chaperone cycle in protecting and capturing client proteins is well established, whether their coupled chaperone cycle further modulates client conformation to promote folding has been a long-standing question. Recent works begin to address this question, showing that the bacterial JDP/Hsp70 homolog, DnaJ/K, can release luciferase in an altered conformation that folds more rapidly compared with that during spontaneous folding in dilute solution (15Imamoglu R. Balchin D. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Bacterial Hsp70 resolves misfolded states and accelerates productive folding of a multi-domain protein.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the generality of this phenomenon and whether JDPs participate in this client conformational modulation remain to be determined. JDPs are divided into three classes (A, B, and C) based on the location of the J-domain and the presence of a zinc-finger-like region (16Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A.

Class A JDPs, such as Escherichia coli DnaJ and yeast Ydj1, contain an N-terminal J-domain, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich linker, CTDI/CTDII that provide client binding sites, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. Class B JDPs, represented by yeast Sis1, share the same domain organization as Class A JDPs, except that they lack the zinc-finger-like region insertion in the CTD-I of Class A JDPs.

Finally, Xdj1 (Class A) and Djp1 (Class B) are required for the efficient assembly of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (27Opaliński Ł. Song J. Priesnitz C. Wenz L.-S. Oeljeklaus S. Warscheid B. Pfanner N. Becker T.

Biol. 2013; 33: 4083-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), respectively. Despite the abundance of in vivo data, the mechanism by which cytosolic JDPs participate in the biogenesis of membrane and organellar proteins remains unclear. We address this question in the guided entry of tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway, which delivers an essential class of tail-anchored membrane proteins (TAs) harboring hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) to the ER and is highly conserved across eukaryotic organisms. TAs contain a single TMD near the C terminus and mediate diverse cellular processes such as protein translocation across organelle membranes, vesicular trafficking, protein quality control, and apoptosis (29Chio U.S. Cho H. Shan S.-O. Mechanisms of tail-anchored membrane protein targeting and insertion.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 417-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Hegde R.S. Keenan R.J. Tail-anchored membrane protein insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that newly synthesized TAs released from the ribosome are captured by the yeast cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1, which protects hydrophobic TMDs from aggregation in the cytosol and is crucial for maintaining TAs in a translocation-competent state (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ssa1 further initiates a cascade of energetically downhill TA transfer events, first to the downstream cochaperone Sgt2 and then the targeting factor Get3 (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which delivers TAs to the Get1/2 receptor complex at the ER for insertion into the membrane. Although the role of Ssa1 in the GET pathway has been established (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whether and how additional Ssa1 cochaperones participate in TA targeting is unknown. In this work, we show that Ydj1 and Sis1, representing two different classes of JDPs, function redundantly to support the targeting of GET-dependent TAs in vivo. Unexpectedly, biochemical analyses showed that while Ydj1 assists Ssa1 in capturing TAs and preventing TA aggregation, Sis1 does not. On the other hand, both JDPs enhance the subsequent transfer of TA from Ssa1 to Sgt2. A functional J-domain in both JDPs was required to enhance the transfer competence of Ssa1-bound TA and to support efficient TA insertion in vivo. Our results uncover a new role of JDPs in regulating the conformation of Hsp70-bound client proteins to enhance their targeting competence. We first asked whether cytosolic JDPs are involved in the ER targeting of TAs. Because two JDPs, Ydj1 and Sis1, were implicated in the translocation of α factor into the ER and the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins (24Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. YDJ1p facilitates polypeptide translocation across different intracellular membranes by a conserved mechanism.Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Jores T. Lawatscheck J. Beke V. Franz-Wachtel M. Yunoki K. Fitzgerald J.C. Macek B. Endo T. Kalbacher H. Buchner J. Rapaport D. Cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones enable the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 3091-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that they also assist Ssa1 in TA targeting to the ER membrane in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used an established set of isogenic yeast strains in which the expression of YDJ1, SIS1, or both genes are under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter (tet-YDJ1, tet-SIS1, and tet-YDJ1/tet-SIS1; (25Jores T. Lawatscheck J. Beke V. Franz-Wachtel M. Yunoki K. Fitzgerald J.C. Macek B. Endo T. Kalbacher H. Buchner J. Rapaport D. Cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones enable the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 3091-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). We depleted Ydj1 and/or Sis1 in these strains using 4 h of doxycycline treatment (Fig. S1), as described (25Jores T. Lawatscheck J. Beke V. Franz-Wachtel M. Yunoki K. Fitzgerald J.C. Macek B. Endo T. Kalbacher H. Buchner J. Rapaport D. Cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones enable the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 3091-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and carried out pulse-chase assays to measure the insertion kinetics of newly synthesized model substrates into the ER (Fig. 1A). We used BirA fused to the C-terminal TMD of the SNARE protein Bos1 (BirA-Bos1) as the model TA for the GET pathway, because it is strongly dependent on Ssa1 and Get3 for insertion into the ER (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Successful insertion leads to efficient glycosylation of an opsin tag at the C terminus of BirA-Bos1 (Cho and Shan, 2018), providing a quantitative readout for targeting and translocation efficiency. We found that depletion of either Ydj1 or Sis1 did not significantly affect the insertion efficiency of BirA-Bos1 (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas the depletion of both nearly abolished BirA-Bos1 insertion (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possibility that the observed translocation defect of BirA-Bos1 arose from pleiotropic effects in tet-YDJ1/tet-SIS1 cells, such as a reduced cytosolic folding capacity or compromised ER membrane, we tested two control substrates, Bos1-BirA and DHC-αF, whose targeting and translocation are independent of Hsp70 and Get3 (Fig. 1A) (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Bos1-BirA, the Bos1-TMD is upstream of the BirA moiety and near the N terminus of the protein, making it a substrate for the co-translational signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In DHC-αF, the N-terminal signal sequence of prepro-α factor is replaced by the TMD of aminopeptidase B (DAP2) to convert it into an SRP-dependent substrate that uses the co-translational targeting pathway (32Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments showed that depletion of both Ydj1 and Sis1 had only modest effects on the translocation of Bos1-BirA (Fig. 1, E–G) and DHC-αF (Fig. 1, H–J), suggesting that nonspecific folding defects are insufficient to account for the large deleterious effects of the Ydj1/Sis1 depletion on the ER insertion of BirA-Bos1. It has been reported that yeast harbors multiple alternative targeting pathways to mediate post-translational membrane protein targeting to the ER (33Borgese N. Coy-Vergara J. Colombo S.F. Schwappach B. The ways of tails: The GET pathway and more.Protein J. 2019; 38: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, the SRP-independent (SND) pathway mediates the targeting of proteins with an internal TMD (34Aviram N. Ast T. Costa E.A. Arakel E.C. Chuartzman S.G. Jan C.H. Haßdenteufel S. Dudek J. Jung M. Schorr S. Zimmermann R. Schwappach B. Weissman J.S. Schuldiner M. The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2016; 540: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and TAs with low hydrophobicity TMDs are targeted by GET-independent pathways (35Rao M. Okreglak V. Chio U.S. Cho H. Walter P. Shan S.-O. Multiple selection filters ensure accurate tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.Elife. 2016; 5e21301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Shurtleff M.J. Itzhak D.N. Hussmann J.A.

Brodsky J.L. et al.The ER membrane protein complex interacts cotranslationally to enable biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins.Elife. 2018; 7e37018Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To test whether the Hsp70/JDP system functions in these alternative pathways, we used two established substrates, BirA-6AG (35Rao M. Okreglak V. Chio U.S. Cho H. Walter P. Shan S.-O. Multiple selection filters ensure accurate tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.Elife. 2016; 5e21301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Scs2-GFP (34Aviram N. Ast T. Costa E.A. Arakel E.C. Chuartzman S.G. Jan C.H. Haßdenteufel S. Dudek J. Jung M. Schorr S. Zimmermann R. Schwappach B. Weissman J.S. Schuldiner M. The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2016; 540: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2A). BirA-6AG is a GET-independent TA in which multiple hydrophobic residues in the Bos1 TMD are replaced by Ala/Gly to reduce hydrophobicity (Fig. S2B) (35Rao M. Okreglak V. Chio U.S. Cho H. Walter P. Shan S.-O. Multiple selection filters ensure accurate tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.Elife. 2016; 5e21301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Scs2-GFP is an established SND substrate containing an internal TMD (34Aviram N. Ast T. Costa E.A. Arakel E.C. Chuartzman S.G. Jan C.H. Haßdenteufel S. Dudek J. Jung M. Schorr S. Zimmermann R. Schwappach B. Weissman J.S. Schuldiner M. The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2016; 540: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We tested the Ydj1/Sis1-dependence for the translocation of both substrates using the tet-YDJ1/tet-SIS1 cells as above. We also tested the Hsp70-dependence using the established SSA1 (SSA1ssa2Δssa3Δssa4Δ) and ssa1ts (ssa1tsssa2Δssa3Δssa4Δ) strains, in which a temperature-sensitive mutant Ssa1 in ssa1ts is rapidly inactivated within 5 min upon shift to nonpermissive temperature (37Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Functional interaction of cytosolic hsp70 and a DnaJ-related protein, Ydj1p, in protein translocation in vivo.Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). While the ER targeting of both BirA-6AG and Scs2-GFP proteins are independent of Get3 (Fig. S2C), the translocation efficiencies of both substrates were reduced substantially upon transient inactivation of Ssa1 or depletion of Ydj1/Sis1 (Fig. S2, D–G). These results strongly suggest that the cytosolic Hsp70/JDP system, comprised of Ydj1/Sis1 and Ssa1, is involved in the post-translational ER targeting of multiple classes of membrane proteins in yeast. Together, these results show that two cytosolic JDPs, Ydj1 and Sis1, function redundantly to facilitate the post-translational targeting of TAs to the ER in vivo. The strong TA insertion defect upon depletion of both JDPs further indicate that at least one of them is required for the efficient targeting of GET-dependent substrates and that this role cannot be filled by other JDPs. Finally, this JDP/Hsp70 system is also required for the efficient targeting of GET-independent TAs and SND substrates, suggesting that they form a chaperone hub upstream of diverse post-translational membrane protein targeting pathways in yeast. We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Ydj1 and Sis1 facilitate the ER targeting of TAs in biochemical analyses. As Ssa1 is required to capture nascent TAs in the soluble form (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and as JDPs have been suggested to autonomously bind substrates and to assist Hsp70s in substrate trapping (10Kityk R.

As the model TA substrate in vitro, we used a noncleavable, soluble SUMO domain fused to the Bos1 TMD (termed Bos1) (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Rao M. Okreglak V.

Cell. 2010; 40: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Dilution of purified, detergent-solubilized Bos1 into aqueous buffer, which removes detergent micelles, led to rapid aggregation of Bos1 as monitored by the turbidity assay (Fig. 2A, light blue line). Using this assay, we confirmed that ATP-bound Ssa1 effectively prevented Bos1 aggregation (Figs. S3A and S1B, red), as reported (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In comparison, ADP-bound Ssa1 prevented TA aggregation less efficiently (Fig. S3, A and B, green versus red), and apo-Ssa1 was unable to suppress TA aggregation (Fig. S3, A and B, blue). These results show that nucleotide binding is required for Ssa1 to capture TAs in the soluble form, and that ATP-bound Ssa1 is most efficient in TA capture. Ydj1 by itself only prevented Bos1 aggregation at super-stoichiometric concentrations (≥3 μM Ydj1 versus 1.5 μM Bos1; Fig. 2A). In comparison, 0.5 μM Ssa1 prevented the aggregation of ∼50% Bos1 (Fig. 2B, dotted black versus light blue lines), as reported (31Cho H. Shan S.-O. Substrate relay in an Hsp70-cochaperone cascade safeguards tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.EMBO J. 2018; 37e99264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that Ssa1 is a more effective chaperone than Ydj1 for Bos1. In the presence of 0.5 μM Ssa1, addition of substoichiometric amounts of Ydj1 significantly enhanced the solubility of Bos1 (Fig. 2, B and C, red), suggesting that Ydj1 cooperates with Ssa1 to prevent Bos1 aggregation. To better estimate the efficacy of the Ydj1·Ssa1 complex in TA capture, we used a sedimentation-based assay that detects both the soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions of Bos1 (Fig. 2, D and E). In the absence of Ydj1, Ssa1 generated a maximum of 1.5 μM soluble Bos1 at saturating concentrations, and >3 μM Ssa1 was required for saturation (Fig. 2F, black circles). With equ"

The ocean strongly contributes to our well-being but is severely impacted by human activities. Here, I propose seven domains of action to structure our collective efforts toward a scientifically sound, just, and holistic governance of a sustainable ocean. We live on one planet, which hosts one ocean. The ocean is unique; it covers 71% of our planet for more than 95% of its living space and is distributed in interconnected basins modulated by a range of physical oceanographic processes. The ocean is a key piece of our Earth system. Thanks to its abundant phytoplankton, drifting photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria, it produces between 50% and 80% of the planetary oxygen and an estimated 30% of the oxygen we breathe as humans. It also regulates the climate by storing solar radiation, distributing heat and moisture around the globe, and driving weather systems. In addition, it helps buffer climate change by absorbing up to 93% of the excess heat from global warming and more than a quarter of the excess CO2 associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions over the past half century (Laffoley et al., 2020Laffoley D. Baxter J.M. Amon D.J. Claudet J. Hall-Spencer J.M. Grorud-Colvert K. Levin L.A. Reid P.C. Rogers A.D.

Ecosyst. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Life appeared in the ocean 3.7 billion years ago and resulted in far greater evolutionary diversity than on land. Terrestrial species have evolved from marine species, and the most unique taxa are in the oceans, reflected by 39% of phyla being endemic to the ocean whereas none are endemic to land and freshwaters (Costello and Chaudhary, 2017Costello M.J. Chaudhary C. Marine Biodiversity, Biogeography, Deep-Sea Gradients, and Conservation.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: R511-R527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning provide tremendous ecosystem services and benefits to human societies, communities, and individual well-being. In addition to oxygen production and climate regulation, ocean biodiversity supports control of coastal erosion and pollution. Seafood from wild-capture fisheries and mariculture is critical for food security (Costello et al., 2020Costello C. Cao L. Gelcich S. Cisneros-Mata M.Á. Free C.M. Froehlich H.E. Golden C.D. Ishimura G. Maier J. Macadam-Somer I. et al.The future of food from the sea.Nature. 2020; 588: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Many cultures and societies are integrally linked to marine biodiversity and benefit from an ocean in a good environmental state (Ban et al., 2019Ban N.C. Gurney G.G. Marshall N.A. Whitney C.K. Mills M. Gelcich S. Bennett N.J. Meehan M.C. Butler C. Ban S. et al.Well-being outcomes of marine protected areas.Nat. Sustain. 2019; 2: 524-532Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Humans can also derive increased physical and mental health from the ocean (Fleming et al., 2019Fleming L.E. Maycock B. White M.P. Depledge M.H. Fostering human health through ocean sustainability in the 21st century.People and Nat. 2019; 1: 276-283Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, ocean diversity has proven to be a rich source of inspiration for drug discovery, with success rates for marine natural products up to 4 times higher than other naturally derived compounds (Sigwart et al., 2020Sigwart J.D. Blasiak R. Jaspars M. Jouffray J.-B. Tasdemir D. Unlocking the potential of marine biodiscovery.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1039/D0NP00067ACrossref Google Scholar). With up to 30% to 90% of marine species undescribed, depending on the estimates, ocean diversity offers exceptional opportunities for research. Here, I will first show that while science is pushing the frontiers of ocean discoveries, it is also revealing that our human footprint spares no component of the ocean. I will then describe seven domains of action, which I synthesized from the specific recommendations made by recent international efforts, to transform our societies toward a sustainable use of a healthy and productive ocean. Although more than eighty percent of the Ocean seafloor is unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored (we have better maps of the Moon and Mars), the last decades have seen an unprecedented pace of ocean discoveries that push further away from the coasts, dive deeper into the ocean, and observe at smaller organizational scales. The capacity to combine, at global scales, remote sensing data with physicochemical and biological data collected in situ from recent ocean expeditions, such as the Tara Ocean expeditions (Sunagawa et al., 2020Sunagawa S. Acinas S.G. Bork P. Bowler C. Eveillard D. Gorsky G. Guidi L. Iudicone D. Karsenti E. Lombard F. et al.Tara Oceans CoordinatorsTara Oceans: towards global ocean ecosystems biology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 428-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), offers new perspectives to build a more comprehensive knowledge base of global ocean ecosystems biology. Such endeavors expand our knowledge of biodiversity, organismal interactions, ecological drivers of community structure, and genomic proxies for key ecosystem processes, such as the carbon biological pump (Sunagawa et al., 2020Sunagawa S. Acinas S.G. Bork P. Bowler C. Eveillard D. Gorsky G. Guidi L. Iudicone D. Karsenti E. Lombard F. et al.Tara Oceans CoordinatorsTara Oceans: towards global ocean ecosystems biology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 428-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). While the field is still in a data-driven, phenomenological discovery phase, it holds promises to gain a holistic understanding of the biodiversity and processes that govern the ocean. To start addressing the many unresolved questions on ecosystem functioning in the deep ocean, the international scientific community started developing deep-sea observatories in the 1990s. The first observatories were deployed very recently, in the 2010s, and have particular application in studying hydrothermal vents, which were discovered only in the 1970s. Because of these observatories, we are now beginning to understand the functioning of hydrothermal circulation, the key role hydrothermal emissions play in the iron content of the ocean, the decadal temporal stability of communities, and the existence of behavioral biological rhythms at a species level. Recent progress in metagenomics allows us to explore ecosystem diversity and function at new organizational scales in the ocean, such as the microbiome (bacteria, archaea, viruses, and micro-eukaryotes). Efforts are dedicated as well on the pelagic or sediment microbiome or on the organismal external microbiome, which is found to be compositionally distinct from the pelagic microbiome. Such research is expanding rapidly, but scientists can already appreciate the central role microbial processes play in climate change regulation. Concomitantly with pushing the frontiers of scientific discoveries, we are realizing the extent of our human footprint on the ocean, particularly related to climate change. In the last 15 years, six major areas of global concern have been documented (Laffoley et al., 2020Laffoley D. Baxter J.M. Amon D.J. Claudet J. Hall-Spencer J.M. Grorud-Colvert K. Levin L.A. Reid P.C. Rogers A.D. Taylor M.L. et al.Evolving the narrative for protecting a rapidly changing ocean, post-COVID-19.Aquat. Conserv. Mar. Freshw. Ecosyst. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar): accelerating heating of the ocean and associated oxygen loss; sea-level rise and linked loss of coastal natural protection; increasing ocean acidification; alterations to wind regimes and perturbations to major ocean currents and upwelling systems; and changes in patterns of ocean primary production, species distribution, and ecosystems. Those climate change drivers do not act in isolation but interact with other human drivers, leading to cumulative impacts all across the ocean, with no place in the ocean that is not impacted by human activities. While fisheries are themselves impacted by climate change, direct overexploitation of organisms is having the largest relative impact on marine ecosystems (IPBES, 2019IPBESSummary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Unsustainable coastal development is destroying valuable coastal habitat formers, such as mangrove forests or coral reefs, which provide protection against coastal erosion and shelter marine resources that can be harvested. Deforestation and land clearing are increasing terrestrial runoffs and land-based pollution. Microplastics are found in organisms down to the deep sea. Maritime traffic is favoring the spread of non-indigenous species. The ocean economy, or blue economy, is predicted to grow faster than the global economy from 2010 to 2030 (Virdin et al., 2021Virdin J. Vegh T. Jouffray J.-B. Blasiak R. Mason S. Österblom H.

The Blue Acceleration: The Trajectory of Human Expansion into the Ocean.One Earth. 2020; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Progress toward achieving international goals for ocean sustainability is lagging behind, and concerns are rising on how to ensure this blue growth is sustainable and equitable (Bennett et al., 2021Bennett N.J.

The urgent need to identify and implement solutions for sustainable ocean use has led to many international initiatives promoting innovative or underused solutions, from the recognition of traditional or indigenous sustainable practices to the implementation of innovative finance mechanisms. We are now in year one of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, and there is an opportunity to harness science for action and real change in the ocean. Here, I synthesize and structure into seven broad domains of action (Table 1; Figure 1) the recommendations from three recent collective efforts aimed at promoting a scientifically sound, just, and holistic governance for sustainable use of the ocean (Bennett et al., 2021Bennett N.J.

In doing so, I hope to convey the message to policy makers, the private sector, and civil society at large that the evidence and knowledge base to transform our ocean into a paragon of sustainability is already there. What is needed now is action.Table 1Domains of action for a sustainable oceanSourceActionSustainable ocean’s domain of actionBennett et al., 2021Bennett N.J. Blythe J. White C.S. Campero C.

Manage the ocean holistically.Inclusive and holistic governanceNote that the assignment of the actions into domains is not exclusive, and some actions can overlap domains. Open table in a new tab Note that the assignment of the actions into domains is not exclusive, and some actions can overlap domains. One of the most obvious domains of action is to directly improve ocean health. All domains of action shall ultimately improve ocean health, but direct actions should be considered here, such as protecting biodiversity or restoring it where needed. The use of marine protected areas to do so can help to deliver both ecological and social outcomes while reaching a large number of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to the ocean (SDG14) (Reimer et al., 2020Reimer J.M. Devillers R. Claudet J. Benefits and gaps in area-based management tools for the ocean Sustainable Development Goal.Nat. Sustain. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00659-2Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In a rapidly changing world, not only is reducing the existing impacts of human use on species, habitats, and ecosystems important, but avoiding new impacts is also key. This ocean health domain also encompasses actions aimed at mitigating climate change, either by promoting and securing carbon sequestration into the ocean or by directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A second domain of action for a sustainable ocean is to ensure social equity and justice is present in all ocean matters. In particular, care should be given to achieving equitable access to ocean resources and recognizing and protecting the rights of women and indigenous communities. Conservation or development projects need to be designed with a social justice lens to avoid unexpected cultural harm on the most vulnerable communities (Gill et al., 2019Gill D.A. Cheng S.H. Glew L. Aigner E. Bennett N.J. Mascia M.B. Social Synergies, Tradeoffs, and Equity in Marine Conservation Impacts.Annu. Rev. Environ. Resour. 2019; 44: 347-372Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A third domain of action is the identification and investment in sustainable economic opportunities. Investments should target low-emission sectors and create jobs based on a sustainable use of marine ecosystem services, ensuring they fairly benefit local communities. In a (soon-to-be) post-COVID world, such opportunities should be prioritized for economic recovery. The development of innovative ocean finance schemes is a fourth domain of action for a sustainable ocean. Such mechanisms should be linked to climate and conservation finance efforts and help raise capital investments for the necessary expenditures associated with most transformative actions. With incentive payments to private sector market actors, it should be sustainable in the long term. Ensuring a strong scientific integration represents a fifth domain of action. The scientific community has a key role to play as a starting point for developing evidence-based solutions that can promote ocean sustainability. Integration should lie at multiple levels. The integration of disciplines within and across social, natural, and physical sciences should be promoted, as well as the recognition and use of indigenous local knowledge. Observations need to be integrated too, within a globally coordinated and sustained biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic ocean-observing system. Finally, fit-for-purpose science practice aimed at solving sustainability problems needs to be adapted to and integrated with the ecological, economic, and sociocultural contexts, including regulatory frameworks and political realities, in which the sustainability problems to solve lie. Improved ocean literacy and education is the sixth domain of action. It should stimulate new models for ocean action. We should collectively harness a global ocean identity, returning the ocean to the center of our lives, and ensure that that identity is preserved for future generations. Such a change of perspective can help develop new social norms that will in turn create new conditions that incentivize governments, the private sector, and individuals to make necessary changes to their behavior (Claudet et al., 2020Claudet J. Bopp L. Cheung W.W.L.L. Devillers R. Escobar-Briones E. Haugan P. Heymans J.J. Masson-Delmotte V. Matz-Lück N. Miloslavich P. et al.A Roadmap for Using the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development in Support of Science, Policy, and Action.One Earth. 2020; 2: 34-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Inclusive and holistic governance is the last domain of action. Co-produced, adaptive instruments to foster sustainable use of ocean resources at multiple organizational scales are both supported by the six previous domains and provide the enabling conditions for their realizations. Science should play a critical role in informing policies, but effective science-policy interfaces are scant, hindered by complex policy processes and the distinct methods and epistemologies of science and policy. Science should not compete with other forces shaping the policy-making space but instead co-produce evidence with them to ensure recommendations can better be transferred into action (Claudet et al., 2020Claudet J. Bopp L. Cheung W.W.L.L. Devillers R. Escobar-Briones E. Haugan P. Heymans J.J. Masson-Delmotte V. Matz-Lück N. Miloslavich P. et al.A Roadmap for Using the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development in Support of Science, Policy, and Action.One Earth. 2020; 2: 34-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The private sector, a major actor of current unsustainable trajectories of ocean use, is also increasingly recognized as having the capacity to bend these trajectories by taking on the mantle of corporate biosphere stewardship (Virdin et al., 2021Virdin J. Vegh T. Jouffray J.-B. Blasiak R. Mason S. Österblom H. Vermeer D. Wachtmeister H. Werner N. The Ocean 100: Transnational corporations in the ocean economy.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7: eabc8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This can also foster the development of more holistic, multi-sectoral policies. Together with science and the private sector, involving civil society, indigenous and local communities in more inclusive, participatory, and decentralized governance arrangements can induce the behavioral change needed to result in the development and ownership of more sustainable practices. The ocean is unique. It was home of the birth of life on our planet and currently supports vital and valuable services and contributions to human well-being. Preserving the ocean is preserving our way of life. Now that there is no place in the ocean that is not impacted by our activities, we should collectively place it at the center of our lives and action the levers that are already identified to start a new era of a sustainable relationships with our ocean."
https://openalex.org/W3136191194,"Rhodesain is the lysosomal cathepsin L-like cysteine protease of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis. The enzyme is essential for the proliferation and pathogenicity of the parasite as well as its ability to overcome the blood–brain barrier of the host. Lysosomal cathepsins are expressed as zymogens with an inactivating prodomain that is cleaved under acidic conditions. A structure of the uncleaved maturation intermediate from a trypanosomal cathepsin L-like protease is currently not available. We thus established the heterologous expression of T. brucei rhodesiense pro-rhodesain in Escherichia coli and determined its crystal structure. The trypanosomal prodomain differs from nonparasitic pro-cathepsins by a unique, extended α-helix that blocks the active site and whose side-chain interactions resemble those of the antiprotozoal inhibitor K11777. Interdomain dynamics between pro- and core protease domain as observed by photoinduced electron transfer fluorescence correlation spectroscopy increase at low pH, where pro-rhodesain also undergoes autocleavage. Using the crystal structure, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis, we identify a conserved interdomain salt bridge that prevents premature intramolecular cleavage at higher pH values and may thus present a control switch for the observed pH sensitivity of proenzyme cleavage in (trypanosomal) CathL-like proteases.

Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or African Sleeping Sickness is a so-called neglected tropical disease (NTD) as classified by the World Health Organization (www.who.int). HAT is caused by two subspecies of African trypanosomes, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense (1Simarro P.P. Cecchi G. Franco J.R. Paone M. Diarra A. Ruiz-Postigo J.A. Fèvre E.M. Mattioli R.C. Jannin J.G. Estimating and mapping the population at risk of sleeping sickness.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2012; 6: 1-12Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These unicellular, protozoan parasites are transmitted to the host via the bite of a Tse-Tse fly. The disease progresses in two stages. In the early hemolymphatic stage, the parasites are present in the blood and in the lymphatic systems leading to unspecific symptoms such as fever and headache. In the later meningoencephalitic stage, the parasites cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system of the host. At this point, patients suffer from severe neurological symptoms, deregulation of sleep–wake cycles, coma, and ultimately death (2Kennedy P.G.E. Human African trypanosomiasis of the CNS: Current issues and challenges.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The few available treatment options often have severe side effects (3Pépin J. Milord F. The treatment of human African trypanosomiasis.Adv. Parasitol. 1994; 33: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). T. brucei spp. parasites express two main lysosomal cysteine proteases that belong to the papain family, the cathepsin B-like T. brucei cathepsin B (TbCathB) and the cathepsin L-like rhodesain (also called TbCathL, brucipain, or trypanopain). Rhodesain plays an important role in the progression into the second disease stage as it is involved in the crossing of parasites into the central nervous system via the BBB of the host (4Grab D.J. Garcia-Garcia J.C. Nikolskaia O.V. Kim Y.V. Brown A. Pardo C.A. Zhang Y. Becker K.G. Wilson B.A. De A Lima A.P.C. Scharfstein J. Dumler J.S.

Blood-brain barrier traversal by African trypanosomes requires calcium signaling induced by parasite cysteine protease.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 116: 2739-2747Crossref Google Scholar). The expression of TbCathB mRNA varies strongly during the life cycle of the parasite, while rhodesain is constitutively expressed (6Mackey Z.B. O’Brien T.C. Greenbaum D.C. Blank R.B. McKerrow J.H. A cathepsin B-like protease is required for host protein degradation in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48426-48433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In agreement with an important role in parasite survival, proliferation, and pathogenicity, RNAi-based rhodesain knockdown or inhibition of rhodesain but not TbCathB led to diminished parasitic growth and an increased sensibility to lytic factors in human serum (7Alsford S. Currier R.B. Guerra-Assunção J.A. Clark T.G. Horn D.

Parasitol. 2012; 42: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rhodesain is thus generally assumed to be the main lysosomal cysteine protease in trypanosomes and presents a promising antitrypanosomal drug target. In general, proteases are attractive drug targets because the affinities of inhibitors toward active site residues can be tuned and potential inhibitors can easily be identified in high-throughput in vitro assay screenings (9Schirmeister T. Kesselring J. Jung S. Schneider T.H. Weickert A. Becker J. Lee W. Bamberger D. Wich P.R. Distler U. Tenzer S. Johé P. Hellmich U.A. Engels B. Quantum chemical-based protocol for the rational design of covalent inhibitors.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 8332-8335Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, structural similarities to host proteins can lead to problems with off-target effects. Rhodesain shares 46% (60%) sequence identity (similarity) with human cathepsin L (hsCathL). The irreversible, vinylsulfone-based rhodesain inhibitor K11777 (N-methylpiperazine-urea-Phe-homophenylalanine-vinylsulfone-benzene), was shown to prevent T. brucei from overcoming a barrier formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells in an in vitro BBB model (4Grab D.J.

Encouragingly, while K11777 was indeed observed to not be biochemically selective, it was nontoxic to mammals, efficient against related protozoans, and could cure mice from a Trypanosoma cruzi infection (10McKerrow J.H.

Here, we present the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the active site C150A mutant of the uncleaved T. brucei rhodesiense cysteine protease pro-rhodesain under acidic conditions. The rhodesain prodomain shares many structural features with other CathL prodomains, but is unique in the presence of an extended α-helix in its C-terminal end. Using photoinduced electron transfer–fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS) (27Sauer M. Neuweiler H. Probing rapid structural fluctuations of proteins and nucleic acids by single-molecule fluorescence quenching.Fluoresc. Spectrosc. Microsc. 2014; 1076: 371-417Google Scholar), we investigated the interdomain dynamics of the proenzyme. At low pH values, where the protease undergoes autocleavage, the “blocking peptide” region of the prodomain covering the protease active site shows increased dynamics. We further found evidence that pro-rhodesain can be processed both intra- and intermolecularly in a pH-dependent manner and identified a highly conserved interdomain salt bridge that can prevent premature intramolecular cleavage at high pH and may thus act as a “delay switch” for pro-cathepsin autocleavage. Cathepsin-like cysteine proteases are expressed as an inactive proform. pH-dependent cleavage of the prodomain from the globular core protease domain is an important step in the protease maturation process contingent on the correct localization of the protein to the lysosome. For a better understanding of pro-rhodesain inhibition and activation, we determined the crystal structure of T. brucei rhodesiense pro-rhodesain. While rhodesain expression in P. pastoris relies on the secretion of the folded protein (22Caffrey C.R. Hansell E. Lucas K.D. Brinen L.S. Alvarez Hernandez A. Cheng J. Gwaltney S.L. Roush W.R.

Davis C.E. So M. Expression and deletion analysis of the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense cysteine protease in Escherichia coli.Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the folded proenzyme for structural studies, we found both production routes to be ineffective. We thus optimized the purification of mature and pro-rhodesain from E. coli in a manner that circumvents secretion and refolding (see Figs. S1–S4 and Extended Materials and Methods for details). Purified mature rhodesain proteins from P. pastoris and E. coli have similar structural and functional properties as elucidated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 1, A and B), and a fluorescent peptide-cleavage assay using the fluorescent peptide Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (Z-phenylalanine-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) to probe rhodesain activity (see Extended Materials and Methods) (9Schirmeister T.

E. coli can thus be used as a reliable source for the production of active rhodesain for optimal flexibility in biophysical studies. To prevent autocleavage and to stabilize the proenzyme, we introduced a mutation into the active site of the protein, C150A. Pro-rhodesain C150A displays the expected increase in molecular weight during SEC compared with the mature protease as well as an additional small increase in α-helical content in CD spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 1, B and C). We obtained a 2.8 Å crystal structure for T. b. rhodesiense pro-rhodesain at acidic pH (Fig. 2, Table 1, Fig. S5). The proprotease structure contains two parts, the N-terminal prodomain (residues E38 to T123 according to uniprot numbering, ID.: Q95 PM0) and the C-terminal core protease domain (residues A126 to P342). The first 18 amino acids belonging to the prodomain, a short loop between the first two helices (residues 77/78) and residues G124/R125 at the C-terminus of the prodomain, are not resolved. High disorder, in agreement with the crystallographic B factors in the C-terminal prodomain region (Fig. 2, C and D), coincides with the expected intermolecular cleavage site of pro-rhodesain at position T123 or R125 (22Caffrey C.R.

The entire C-terminus of the core protease up to residue P342 as well as the remaining residues of a TEV cleavage site (ENLYFQ), which was used to remove the C-terminal purification tag, could be reliably placed in the electron density. The remainder of the TEV cleavage site mediates crystal contacts to the neighboring protein’s prodomain and may have thus aided crystallization of the construct but does not interfere with the interaction of the prodomain with its corresponding catalytic domain.Table 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for T. brucei rhodesiense pro-rhodesain C150APDB entry7AVMData collection Wavelength1.54179 Space groupH3 Cell parametersa; b; c123.19 Å; 123.19 Å; 53.91 Åα; β; γ90.00°; 90.00°; 120°Resolution range [Å]37.92–2.8 (2.9–2.8)Unique reflections7512 (729)Multiplicity20.6 (19.8)Overall completeness [%]97.23 (92.73)<I/σ(I)>3.63 (at 2.81 Å)Refinement Rwork, Rfree0.255, 0.264 Rmerge0.611 Average B-Factor [Å2]41.2 Protein residues308 No. of solvent molecules38 Ligand atoms6 Total non-H atoms2379 RMSD from ideal geometryBond lengths [Å]0.010Bond angles [°]1.60 RamachandranFavored91.7%Allowed8.3%Outliers0%Numbers in parentheses characterize the highest-resolution shell.

The catalytic core domain follows the typical two-lobed fold of the papain family of cysteine proteases with an α-helical L-domain and a β-sheet containing R-domain. The cleft between these domains harbors the active site triad residues C150 (mutated to alanine in our construct), H287 and N307 (Fig. 2B). In the same position as in papain (PDBs: 9PAP, 3TNX) (29Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B.A. Drenth J. Structure of papain refined at 1.65 Å resolution.J. Mol.

As apparent from the electron density, these residues all form disulfide bridges. The backbone RMSD between our structure of the pro-rhodesain core catalytic domain (PDB: 7AVM, residues 125–342) and the previously determined structure of mature rhodesain (PDB: 2P7U) (25Kerr I.D. Lee J.H. Farady C.J. Marion R. Rickert M. Sajid M. Pandey K.C. Caffrey C.R. Legac J. Hansell E. Mckerrow J.H. Craik C.S. Rosenthal P.J. Brinen L.S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25697-25703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) is 0.39 Å, thus the presence of the prodomain does not affect the structure of the catalytic domain, including the relative side-chain orientations of the residues of the active site catalytic triad (Fig. 2B). The prodomain constitutes about one-third of the protein in immature cathepsin proteases and consists of three helices, H1–H3 (Fig. 2). In pro-rhodesain, the N-terminal helix 1 (H1, residues E38pro -K47pro) is shorter compared with H1 from other crystallized CathL zymogens. The lack of resolution for the first 18 amino acids indicates that this region may be highly flexible and potentially not structured in pro-rhodesain. H1 is connected to the orthogonal helix 2 (H2, residues A55pro-A76pro) via a long loop. H2 then leads into a long third helix (H3, residues E96pro-K113pro). Helix 3 covers the active site and constitutes the main difference between the prodomain of rhodesain and other CathL-like protease prodomains (see below). CathL and CathB proteases both belong to the CA clan and the C1 family of proteases (31Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. MEROPS: The database of proteolytic enzymes, their substrates and inhibitors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and thus share a papain-like fold. Nevertheless, their prodomains differ. For instance, the conserved ER(I/V)FNIN motif is only found in CathL-like precursors within helix 2 of the prodomain and is slightly modified in the trypanosomal CathL proteases (32Karrer K.M. Peiffer S.L. Ditomas M.E. Two distinct gene subfamilies within the family of cysteine protease genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3063-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Here, the ER(A/V)FNAA motif (consensus sequence Ex3Rx2(A/V)(F/W)x2Nx3Ax3A, with x = any amino acid) (Fig. 3, Fig. S6) is involved in the correct folding of the prodomain and mediates intradomain interactions (33Martínez J.

Lett. 1995; 129: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34Mottram J.C. North M.J. Barry J.D. Coombs G.H. A cysteine proteinase cDNA from Trypanosoma brucei predicts an enzyme with an unusual C-terminal extension.FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In most zymogens, H2 is longer than in our pro-rhodesain structure, and we do not observe density for the C-terminal end of this region (residues 77pro–78pro). Together with the elevated B-factor values for the C-terminal end of H2 indicate that this region may be flexible in the prodomain of pro-rhodesain as has been stated for human CathL (35Reif M.M. MacH L. Oostenbrink C. Molecular insight into propeptide-protein interactions in cathepsins L and O.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 8636-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). H2 connects to Helix 3 (H3, residues 96pro–113pro) via a long linker. This linker partially forms a short antiparallel β-sheet (residues 82pro–84pro) with the propeptide binding loop (PBL, residues 271–275, Fig. 3C), a loop extending from the R subdomain of the catalytic core domain. Notably, both the short β-sheet in the H2/H3 linker of the prodomain and the interacting PBL in the protease domain display very low B-values indicating high rigidity (Fig. 2, C and D). In cathepsin prodomains, the β-strand in the H2/H3 linker is typically followed by a GNFD motif with the GxNxFxD (x = any amino acid) consensus sequence, which is required for proper protein folding and autoactivation (36Vernet T. Berti P.J. De Montigny C. Musil R. Tessier D.C. Menard R. Magny M.C. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. Processing of the papain precursor. The ionization state of a conserved amino acid motif within the pro region participates in the regulation of intramolecular processing.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10838-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In pro-rhodesain, this sequence corresponds to the GNFD-like motif G85VT87PF89SD91. Residues in this motif form multiple contacts within both the prodomain and to the core protease domain (Fig. 3D). Our structure may thus provide some insights why the core protease domain’s PBL β-strand harbors a di-glycine motif (G274/G275) that is highly conserved among CathL proteases (Fig. S6) and why this region could be crucial for protease folding (37Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. et al.Structure of human procathepsin L reveals the molecular basis of inhibition by the prosegment.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) as larger amino acid side chains may sterically interfere with the PBL interactions (Fig. 3, C and D). An interaction network involving mostly hydrophobic and aromatic residues positions the remainder of the prodomain H2/H3 linker whose P88pro and F89pro side chains dip into a hydrophobic basket formed by the side chains of F269, M270, W309, and W313 in the R-domain of the core protease (Fig. 3D). In addition, the backbone carbonyl of M270 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of T87pro while its side chain forms a hydrophobic interaction with F97pro in the first turn of H3, the long α-helix covering the entire length of the cleft between the L- and R-domains of the catalytic domain. In all available structures of other cathepsin proenzymes, this region is mainly unstructured (Fig. 4A). This α-helix therefore presents the most notable structural difference between pro-rhodesain and closely related nontrypanosomal proteases. The residues in H3 facing the catalytic domain are involved in numerous, mostly hydrophobic interactions with the catalytic domain, thereby efficiently blocking the rhodesain active site (Fig. 4A). In agreement with structures from multiple CathL proenzymes, the pro-rhodesain H3 helix starts out as a regular α-helix. However, and so far unique to pro-rhodesain, a bulge forms around residues N103pro and G104pro, whose backbone amides are not involved in hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond acceptor group for the amide group of G104pro in the context of a regular α-helix would be the oxygen of the backbone carbonyl of R100Pro. This group, however, is 5.1 Å away from the G104pro amide group, thus precluding formation of a hydrogen bond and instead locally distorting the α-helix in proximity to the active site of the core protease (Fig. 4B). Importantly, this bending of the α-helix enables the guanidino group of R100pro to interact with the side chain of Q144 in the core protease domain. Notably, Q144 is conserved across all CathL proteases while R100pro is conserved in the majority of homologous trypansomal CathL proproteases (Fig. S6). Below the bulge, H3 continues as a regular α-helix up to residue K113pro from where the prodomain leads into the R-domain of the catalytic core domain via a C-terminal 15 amino acid unstructured linker (Figs. 2 and 4B). The electron density in our X-ray structure allows tracing the backbone of the entire H3 α-helix unambiguously for all residues in H3 (E95pro–K113pro) (Fig. S5B). The B-factor values for the two N-terminal helical turns of H3 are among the high"

Using a conditional knockout model that escapes this blockage, we recently described the role of insulin signaling in granulosa cells during the periovulatory window in mice lacking Insr and Igf1r driven by Pgr-Cre. These mice were infertile, exhibiting defects in ovulation, luteinization, steroidogenesis, and early embryo development. Herein, we demonstrate that while these mice exhibit normal uterine receptivity, uterine cell proliferation and decidualization are compromised resulting in complete absence of embryo implantation in uteri lacking both receptors. While the histological organization of double knockout mice appeared normal, the thickness of their endometrium was significantly reduced. This was supported by the reduced proliferation of both epithelial and stromal cells during the preimplantation stages of pregnancy. Expression and localization of the main drivers of uterine proliferation, ESR1 and PGR, was normal in knockouts, suggesting that insulin signaling acts downstream of these two receptors. While AKT/PI3K signaling was unaffected by insulin receptor ablation, activation of p44/42 MAPK was significantly reduced in both single and double knockout uteri at 3.5 dpc. Overall, we conclude that both INSR and IGF1R are necessary for optimal endometrial proliferation and implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3138466320,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a central role in inflammation. The GR activity is also modulated via protein-protein interactions, including binding of 14-3-3 proteins induced by GR phosphorylation. However, the specific phosphorylation sites on the GR that trigger these interactions and their functional consequences are less clear. Hence, we sought to examine this system in more detail. We used phosphorylated GR peptides, biophysical studies, and X-ray crystallography to identify key residues within the ligand-binding domain of the GR, T524 and S617, whose phosphorylation results in binding of the representative 14-3-3 protein 14-3-3ζ. A kinase screen identified misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) as responsible for phosphorylating T524 and Rho-associated protein kinase 1 for phosphorylating S617; cell-based approaches confirmed the importance of both GR phosphosites and MINK1 but not Rho-associated protein kinase 1 alone in inducing GR-14-3-3 binding. Together our results provide molecular-level insight into 14-3-3-mediated regulation of the GR and highlight both MINK1 and the GR-14-3-3 axis as potential targets for future therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3139363495,"The phosphatase cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) regulates cell cycle progression. Increased Cdc25B levels are often detected in cancer cell lines and human cancers and have been implicated in contributing to tumor growth, potentially by providing cancer cells with the ability to bypass checkpoint controls. However, the specific mechanism by which increased Cdc25B impacts tumor progression is not clear. Here we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found that patients with high CDC25B expression had the expected poor survival. However, we also found that high CDC25B expression had a p53-dependent tumor suppressive effect in lung cancer and possibly several other cancer types. Looking in more detail at the tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B, we found that increased Cdc25B expression caused inhibition of cell growth in human normal fibroblasts. This effect was not due to alteration of specific cell cycle stage or inhibition of apoptosis, nor by induction of the DNA damage response. Instead, increased CDC25B expression led cells into senescence. We also found that p53 was required to induce senescence, which might explain the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B. Mechanistically, we found that the Cdc25B phosphatase activity was required to induce senescence. Further analysis also found that Cdc25B stabilized p53 through binding and dephosphorylating p53.

Together, this study identified a tumor-suppressive function of Cdc25B that is mediated through a p53-dependent senescence pathway. Cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) phosphatase is a key player in G2/M cell cycle progression (1Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. The when and wheres of CDC25 phosphatases.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The Cdc25B protein level begins to increase from mid S-phase and peaks during the G2/M phase (2Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. Cytoplasmic accumulation of CDC25B phosphatase in mitosis triggers centrosomal microtubule nucleation in HeLa cells.J.

Centrosomal and cytoplasmic Cdc2/cyclin B1 activation precedes nuclear mitotic events.Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Cdc25B protein level is rapidly decreased by the proteasome pathway after M phase of the cell cycle (2Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.

Cdc25B protein level was also found to be increased after DNA damages such as UV radiation, ionizing radiation, or genotoxic agents. The increased Cdc25B level has a role in recovery from the G2/M checkpoint activated in response to DNA damages (6Bugler B. Quaranta M. Aressy B. Brezak M.C. Prevost G. Ducommun B. Genotoxic-activated G2-M checkpoint exit is dependent on CDC25B phosphatase expression.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Bansal P. Lazo J.S. Induction of Cdc25B regulates cell cycle resumption after genotoxic stress.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3356-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It leads to bypass of genotoxic-induced G2/M checkpoint arrest. In addition to cell cycle deregulation, CDC25B overexpression also has an oncogenic property. It was shown that Cdc25B cooperated with either oncogenic HRAS or Rb inactivation to transform mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro and to form tumors in vivo (8Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. CDC25 phosphatases as potential human oncogenes.Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It was also reported that targeted overexpression of CDC25B in mammary glands of mice induced hyperplasia and promoted proliferation (9Ma Z.Q. Chua S.S. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Induction of mammary gland hyperplasia in transgenic mice over- expressing human cdc25B.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4564-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tumor growth could then be induced with additional challenge by carcinogen (10Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Wang L. Hibshoosh H. Zhang Y.J. Xing W.Q. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in MMTV-Cdc25B transgenic mice.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5159-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, although CDC25B overexpression is not sufficient to induce tumor growth, it impacts positively toward tumorigenesis. CDC25B has been reported to be overexpressed in various cancer cell lines and human cancers (11Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. An additional homolog of the fission yeast cdc25 gene occurs in humans and is highly expressed in some cancer cells.New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 12Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. CDC25 phosphatases in cancer cells: Key players? Good targets?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of how CDC25B expression is increased in cancer cells is still unclear, several lines of evidence showed that it might be related to oncogene activation and/or p53 inactivation. For example, it was shown that CDC25B mRNA level was increased in SV40- or HPV E6 and E7-transformed fibroblasts (11Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. An additional homolog of the fission yeast cdc25 gene occurs in humans and is highly expressed in some cancer cells.New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar). CDC25B was also shown to be a target of both oncogene c-myc and tumor suppressor gene p53 (13Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Cdc25 cell-cycle phosphatase as a target of c-myc.Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 14Dalvai M. Mondesert O. Bourdon J.C. Ducommun B. Dozier C.

Wild-type p53 and p73 negatively regulate expression of proliferation related genes.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With its role in checkpoint control, Cdc25B overexpression might contribute to tumorigenic pathway by rapidly pushing cells into mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA, thus providing cancer cells with the ability to bypass checkpoint control to enhance their proliferation. To reveal the impact of increased Cdc25B in tumorigenesis, we first analyzed the association of CDC25B expression to survival of cancer patients. To our surprise, we found that high CDC25B expression significantly associated with better survival for patients carried wild-type p53 in lung cancer (LUNG) and possibly several other cancer patients. The results suggested that excess Cdc25B has a p53-dependent tumor-suppressive role. To evaluate the cellular effects of increased Cdc25B, we applied normal human fibroblasts in our analysis. We found CDC25B overexpression induced senescence in a p53-dependent manner. The observed phenomenon did not appear to be limited to normal lung fibroblast as skin fibroblast and several cancer cells also showed similar effects. We further showed that Cdc25B stabilized p53 protein through interacting with p53 and dephosphorylated p53. Thus, our results provide evidence to support a role of Cdc25B in senescence induction that is related to tumor suppressing. Overexpressed CDC25B has been reported in various cancer cell lines and human cancers (11Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. An additional homolog of the fission yeast cdc25 gene occurs in humans and is highly expressed in some cancer cells.New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 12Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. CDC25 phosphatases in cancer cells: Key players? Good targets?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To determine the role of increased Cdc25B in tumorigenesis, the association of CDC25B expression determined by RNA-seq analysis to the survival of cancer patients was analyzed. Data set provided by the TCGA program of National Cancer Institute (USA) (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) was applied in the analysis. The Kaplan–Meier plot analyses were conducted using UCSC Xena software (http://xena.ucsc.edu/). The survival for the TCGA Pan-Cancer data set (PANCAN) was first analyzed. Patients were separated into high and low CDC25B-expression groups. The analyses showed that high CDC25B expression associated with poor survivals (Fig. 1A). With the close association between p53 and CDC25B expression, the p53 mutation status was also added to the analysis. We found high CDC25B expression associated with poor survivals regardless of the p53 status (Fig. 1, B and C). The results suggest that high CDC25B expression impacts negatively to the overall survival of cancer patients, consistent with the expected oncogenic role of CDC25B. Next, the impact of CDC25B expression and p53 mutation status on individual cancer types was analyzed. Interestingly, we found that CDC25B expression did not appear to have an impact on the overall survival of lung cancer (LUNG) patients (Fig. 1D). Surprisingly, when lung cancer patients were grouped based on their p53 status, high CDC25B expression significantly associated with better survival in patients carried wild-type p53 (Fig. 1, E and F). High CDC25B expression level also showed better survival probability in thymoma (THYM) patients carried wild-type p53 (Fig. 1, G and H). Moreover, similar association could be observed in several other cancer types, although the statistical analysis did not show significance due to the limited number of patients. For example, a similar trend could be observed for colon and rectal cancer (COADREAD) patients (Fig. S1, A–C). High CDC25B expression levels might also beneficial to the overall survivals of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG) and testicular cancer (TGCT) patients (Fig. S1, D and E). Thus, in addition to the oncogenic function, the analysis identified a p53-dependent tumor-suppressive role of Cdc25B in several cancer types. The mechanism of how increased Cdc25B rendered its tumor-suppressive effect was analyzed. Previous analyses had shown that increased Cdc25B caused diverse and sometimes opposite effects in different cancer cells (16Miyata H. Doki Y. Yamamoto H. Kishi K. Takemoto H. Fujiwara Y. Yasuda T. Yano M. Inoue M. Shiozaki H. Weinstein I.B. Monden M.

To avoid the genetic diversity of cancer cells, human normal lung fibroblast (IMR90) cell was selected in this study. The Cdc25B level in IMR90 cells was low or undetectable using immunoblotting assays (Fig. 2A). Due to the low delivery efficiency of gene into normal fibroblasts, adenoviral expression system was applied to introduce CDC25B into IMR90 cells. Still, high viral titers were required to express detectable Cdc25B (Fig. 2A). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) value equivalent to 60 was chosen for subsequent experiments as this MOI efficiently expressed CDC25B or GFP. The expressed CDC25B was functional as it reduced the Cdk1 phosphorylation at Tyr15 and reduced Cdk1 level (Fig. 2B). Thus, CDC25B was successfully introduced into normal human fibroblast IMR90 cells using the adenoviral delivery system. Proliferation of IMR90 cells was first evaluated by counting the cell numbers after CDC25B overexpression. As shown in Figure 2C, the growth rate of CDC25B-overexpressing cells was decreased, indicating that high Cdc25B level inhibited the proliferation of normal cells. With the role of Cdc25B in cell cycle regulation, the effect of increased Cdc25B on cell cycle progression was analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis showed that excess amount of Cdc25B did not appear to cause a significant change in the distribution of cell cycle phases (Fig. 2D). It was also apparent that the number of sub-G1 cells was not increased upon CDC25B overexpression, suggesting that increased Cdc25B does not cause apoptosis in normal fibroblasts. The morphology of the CDC25B-overexpressing cells appeared to be enlarged and flattened, a phenotype similar to that of senescent cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, the senescence-associated features in CDC25B-overexpressing cells were then assessed (18Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. A biomarker that identifies senescent human cells in culture and in aging skin in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar, 19Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Differentiation between senescence (M1) and crisis (M2) in human fibroblast cultures.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CDC25B-overexpressing cells showed an increase of the SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 2E). The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells was increased from <10% in normal or GFP-expressing cells to ∼25% in CDC25B-overexpressing cells. Consistent with this observation, the proportion of BrdU-positive cells was reduced from ∼25% in normal or GFP-expressing cells to ∼10% in CDC25B-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2F). The growth-inhibitory and senescent phenotypes were not limited to normal lung fibroblast, as human normal skin fibroblast BJ1 also showed growth inhibition and activation of the SA-β-gal activity upon CDC25B overexpression (Fig. 2, G–I). Together, the results show that a senescent program is initiated in response to CDC25B overexpression in normal fibroblasts. It was reported that senescent cells often upregulate enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix and secrete immune modulators and inflammatory cytokines to reinforce senescence in an autocrine and paracrine manner (20Sharpless N.E. Sherr C.J. Forging a signature of in vivo senescence.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) might heighten inflammation through recruitment of inflammatory cells and thus has detrimental effects on the tissue microenvironment through alteration of tissue composition and architecture. Interestingly, the signature SASP components, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, Wnt2, TGF-β1, TGF-β3, serpinB2, and serpinE2, did not appear to be induced in CDC25B-overexpressing cells (Fig. S2). The results suggest that although a senescent program is induced, it is distinctly different from replicative senescence. Cdc25B is a protein phosphatase, to test whether the enzymatic activity is important for senescence, a CDC25B-CR mutant carrying both C487S and R493K (CR) mutations was constructed. It was reported that Cdc25B carrying mutations of these two residues lost its phosphatase activity (21Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. cdc25 is a specific tyrosine phosphatase that directly activates p34cdc2.Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Adenovirus carrying this mutant was generated and introduced into IMR90 cells. As shown in Figure 3A, while the wild-type CDC25B reduced both the phosphorylation and protein level of Cdk1, the CDC25B-CR mutant did not. The Cdc25B phosphatase activity within IMR90 cells was also analyzed. Total cell extracts were prepared from CDC25B-WT- or CDC25B-CR-expressing cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc25B antibody, and then analyzed for the phosphatase activities. As shown in Figure 3B, although the phosphatase activity was increased in CDC25B-WT-expressing cells, no elevation of phosphatase activity was observed in CDC25B-CR-expressing cells. These results indicated that the Cdc25B-CR mutant indeed lost its phosphatase activity. The proliferation and SA-β-gal activity were then analyzed in CDC25B-CR-expressing cells. As shown in Figure 3, C and D, cells expressing the Cdc25B-CR mutant showed moderate growth inhibition and did not show apparent SA-β-gal-inducing activities. The results suggest that the phosphatase activity is important for Cdc25B-mediated senescence. To gain insight into the molecular basis of Cdc25B-induced senescence, the expressions of several senescent mediators were examined using immunoblotting assays. In IMR90 cells, CDC25B overexpression increased both p53 and p21 levels and decreased Rb protein phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). To investigate the involvement of p53 in Cdc25B-induced senescence, we applied RNA interference approach to knock down p53 level using lentiviral delivery system (22Escarpe P. Zayek N. Chin P. Borellini F. Zufferey R. Veres G. Kiermer V. Development of a sensitive assay for detection of replication-competent recombinant lentivirus in large-scale HIV-based vector preparations.Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The IMR90 cells were first transduced with lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting p53 or GFP and then infected with adenovirus-carrying CDC25B. As shown in Figure 4B, the level of p53 was reduced upon shRNA treatments. The growth and SA-β-gal activity of these cells were also analyzed. In p53 knockdown cells, the growth-inhibitory activity of Cdc25B was disappeared and the number of SA-β-gal-positive cells was also decreased (Fig. 4, C and D). The results indicate that p53 is required for Cdc25B-induced senescence. The p53-dependent cellular effect of Cdc25B was also evaluated in cancer cells. Two colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and its isogenic p53-deleted cell, were adopted in our studies (23Bunz F. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Requirement for p53 and p21 to sustain G2 arrest after DNA damage.Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). CDC25B or GFP was introduced into these cells and examined their growth (Fig. 4E). We found that the growth of p53 wild-type cells was inhibited upon CDC25B overexpression, but not in the p53−/− deleted cells (Fig. 4F). We also found that overexpressing CDC25B did not inhibit cell growth in lung cancer H1299 cell that lacks p53 (Fig. 4, G and H). Thus, the observed p53-dependent growth inhibitory effect of Cdc25B is not limited to normal fibroblasts. CDC25B overexpression was reported to cause centrosome overduplication through stabilizing centrin 2 (24Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. CDC25B involvement in the centrosome duplication cycle and in microtubule nucleation.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11557-11564Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Boutros R. Mondesert O. Lorenzo C. Astuti P. McArthur G. Chircop M. Ducommun B. Gabrielli B. CDC25B overexpression stabilises centrin 2 and promotes the formation of excess centriolar foci.PLoS One. 2013; 8e67822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Abnormal centrosome duplication then induces DNA damage response (DDR) (26Mullee L.I. Morrison C.G. Centrosomes in the DNA damage response--the hub outside the centre.Chromosome Res. 2016; 24: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since p53 is a key mediator of DDR, Cdc25B may upregulate p53 through inducing DDR. To test this possibility, the DDR was evaluated in CDC25B expressing cells. Phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX) and several transducers (ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2) were used as criteria for DDR activation. As shown in Fig. S3, CDC25B overexpression did not cause accumulation of γ-H2AX DNA damage foci, nor activated DDR transducers, suggesting that the increased p53 level was not due to DDR induction. Accumulation of p53 could be caused by increasing p53 expression and/or reducing p53 degradation. The expression of p53 at the transcription level was first measured. We found that CDC25B-overexpression did not affect the mRNA level of p53 (Fig. 5A). The effect of Cdc25B on the stability of p53 protein was next analyzed. The p53 is a short-lived protein with a half-life <30 min (Fig. 5B). We found that Cdc25B stabilized p53 by extending its half-life to ∼6.5 h. The stability of p53 was also determined in cells carrying the CDC25B-CR mutant. We found that the Cdc25B-CR mutant did not alter the half-life of p53 protein (Fig. 5B), indicating that the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B is required for p53 stabilization. The protein stability of both wild-type and the Cdc25B-CR mutant was also determined. We found that the stability of these two proteins was similar (Fig. S4), suggesting that failed stabilization of p53 was not due to reduced stability of the Cdc25B-CR mutant protein. Control of p53 stability is mainly regulated by the proteasomal degradation pathway (27Kruse J.P. Gu W. Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Mdm2 (mouse double minute 2) is the primary E3 ligase responsible for p53 degradation. The possibility of Cdc25B in interfering with p53 turnover pathway was tested. We first analyzed the interaction of Cdc25B to p53 and Mdm2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Cdc25B was detected in the immuneprecipitates of both p53 and Mdm2, indicating that Cdc25B interacted with both p53 and Mdm2 (Fig. 5C). Quantification of the immunoprecipitates also showed that Cdc25B did not appear to uncouple the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. Moreover, the Cdc25B-CR mutant levels were reduced in the immunoprecipitates of both p53 and Mdm2, suggesting that the binding of Cdc25B-CR to p53 and Mdm2 was reduced. The result is consistent with an earlier report that the Arg493 residue of Cdc25B is important for substrate recognition (28Sohn J. Parks J.M. Buhrman G. Brown P. Kristjánsdóttir K. Safi A. Edelsbrunner H. Yang W. Rudolph J. Experimental validation of the docking orientation of Cdc25 with its Cdk2-CycA protein substrate.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16563-16573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and implicated that Cdc25B might target p53 directly. Phosphorylation of p53 has a critical role in regulating protein stability (27Kruse J.P. Gu W. Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). To test whether Cdc25B regulates p53 stability through dephosphorylating p53, the phosphorylation status of p53 on several Ser and Thr residues was analyzed. Specifically, Thr18 (29Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Damage-mediated phosphorylation of human p53 threonine 18 through a cascade mediated by a casein 1-like kinase. Effect on Mdm2 binding.J. Biol.

Because Ser15 was reported to be important for Thr18 phosphorylation, the status of Ser15 phosphorylation was also analyzed (29Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Damage-mediated phosphorylation of human p53 threonine 18 through a cascade mediated by a casein 1-like kinase. Effect on Mdm2 binding.J. Biol.

Protein kinase CK1 is a p53-threonine 18 kinase which requires prior phosphorylation of serine 15.FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5D, moderate reduction of p53 phosphorylation was observed on residues S15, T18, T55, and T155 in cells overexpressing CDC25B. In contrast, the CDC25B-CR mutant did not have an impact on p53 phosphorylation. The results indicated that the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B is required for reducing p53 phosphorylation at these residues. Since more than one Ser/Thr residues showed reduced phosphorylation, the results also suggested that Cdc25B did not act on a specific residue. Together, these results provide evidence for the function of Cdc25B in senescence that it binds and dephosphorylates p53, thus stabilizing p53 protein. Accumulation of p53 then activates the senescence pathway. Excess Cdc25B has been implicated in having a function as an oncogene that impacts positively to cancer cell progression during tumorigenesis (8Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. CDC25 phosphatases as potential human oncogenes.Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 12Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. CDC25 phosphatases in cancer cells: Key players? Good targets?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). TCGA database analysis supports the expected role of high CDC25B in tumorigenesis. However, the analysis also revealed that high Cdc25B levels have better survivals in lung and several other cancers, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function of Cdc25B. The finding of senescence induction by increased CDC25B expression provides an explanation to the tumor-suppressive role of Cdc25B. However, this finding did not fully explain the mechanism of how the tumor-suppressive effect was only observed in a subset of cancer types. It has been well recognized that the number of mutations and the mutated genes varies across tumor types. These cancer-type-specific mutations have their specific effect on survivals (36Kandoth C. McLellan M.D. Vandin F. Ye K. Niu B. Lu C. Xie M. Zhang Q. McMichael J.F. Wyczalkowski M.A. Leiserson M.D.M. Miller C.A. Welch J.S. Walter M.J.

Thus, although the reason is still unclear to us, it is likely that more factor is required for this cancer-type-specific tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B. Senescence is g"
https://openalex.org/W3139449276,"The decrease in the regulatory T cells (Tregs) population is highly involved in adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Tregs depend on fatty acids via β-oxidation for immunosuppressive function adapting their antioxidant systems to allow survival to oxidative stress. In this study, we have hypothesized that a dietary supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a powerful antioxidant, would improve immunometabolism when added to the classical strategy of obesity treatment. First, we showed by in vitro experiments that ALA favors the polarization of mice CD4 + T cells toward Tregs. Next, we have carried out a translational study where female obese mice and women were supplemented with ALA or vehicle/placebo (mice: 2.5 gALA/kgfood; 6 weeks; women: 600 mgALA/day, 8 weeks) while following a protocol including regular exercise and a change in diet. Fatty acid oxidation potential and activity of nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) of mouse secondary lymphoid tissues were improved by ALA supplementation. ALA reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and preserved Tregs in VAT in mice. In women, ALA supplementation induced significant metabolic changes of circulating CD4 + T cells including increased oxidative capacity and fatty acid oxidation, ameliorated their redox status, and improved the reduction of visceral fat mass. While appropriate biological markers are still required to be used in clinics to judge the effectiveness of long-term obesity treatment, further studies in female mice and women are needed to determine whether these immunometabolic changes would reduce VAT mass-associated risk for secondary health issues arising from obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3138063798,"The effective clearance of apoptotic cells is an essential step in the resolution of healing wounds. In particular, blood vessel regression during wound resolution produces a significant number of apoptotic endothelial cells (ApoEC) that must be cleared. In considering the fate of ApoEC and the presence of fibroblasts during wound resolution, we hypothesized that fibroblasts might serve as phagocytes involved in endothelial cell removal. The current study investigated whether dermal fibroblasts engulf ApoEC, whether this uptake alters the phenotype of dermal fibroblasts, and the biological molecules involved. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, following ApoEC engulfment, fibroblasts acquired a pro-healing phenotype (increased cell migration, contractility, α-smooth muscle actin expression, and collagen deposition). In addition, fibroblast uptake of ApoEC was shown to be mediated in part by the milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein/integrin αv β5 pathway. Our study demonstrates a novel function of fibroblasts in the clearance of ApoEC and suggests that this capability has significant implications for tissue repair and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3138559953,"Peptide YY (PYY), produced by endocrine L cells in the gut, is known for its critical role in regulating gastrointestinal functions as well as satiety. However, how these processes are integrated with maintaining a healthy gut microbiome composition is unknown. Here, we show that lack of PYY in mice leads to distinct changes in gut microbiome composition that are diet-dependent. While under chow diet only slight differences in gut microbiome composition could be observed, high-fat diet (HFD) aggravated these differences. Specifically an increased abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum with a corresponding decrease of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in Pyy-knockout (KO) mice in response to HFD. Detailed analysis of the Bacteroidetes phylum further revealed that the Alistipes genus belonging to the Rikenellaceae family, the Parabacteroides belonging to the Tannerellaceae family, as well as Muribaculum were increased in Pyy-KO mice. In order to investigate whether these changes are associated with changed markers of gut barrier and immunity, we analyzed the colonic expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as tight junction proteins and mucin 2, and identified increased mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins Cldn2 and Ocel1 in Pyy-KO mice, while pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was not significantly altered. Together these results highlight a critical gene-environment interaction between diet and the gut microbiome and its impact on homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium under conditions of reduced PYY signaling which is commonly seen under obese conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3139299039,"We have recently reported two different methodologies that improve sperm functionality. The first method involved transient exposure to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 , and the second required sperm incubation in the absence of energy nutrients (starvation). Both methods were associated with an initial loss of motility followed by a rescue step involving ionophore removal or addition of energy metabolites, respectively. In this work, we show that starvation is accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ). Additionally, the starved cells acquire a significantly enhanced capacity to undergo a progesterone-induced acrosome reaction. Electrophysiological measurements show that CatSper channel remains active in starvation conditions. However, the increase in [Ca2+ ]i was also observed in sperm from CatSper null mice. Upon starvation, addition of energy nutrients reversed the effects on [Ca2+ ]i and decreased the effect of progesterone on the acrosome reaction to control levels. These data indicate that both methods have common molecular features."

The assembly of numerous carbohydrate processing enzymes into a macromolecular multiprotein structure results from the interaction of enzyme-borne dockerin modules with repeated cohesin modules present in noncatalytic scaffold proteins, termed scaffoldins. Cohesin–dockerin (Coh-Doc) modules are typically classified into different types, depending on structural conformation and cellulosome role. Thus, type I Coh-Doc complexes are usually responsible for enzyme integration into the cellulosome, while type II Coh-Doc complexes tether the cellulosome to the bacterial wall. In contrast to other known cellulosomes, cohesin types from Bacteroides cellulosolvens, a cellulosome-producing bacterium capable of utilizing cellulose and cellobiose as carbon sources, are reversed for all scaffoldins, i.e., the type II cohesins are located on the enzyme-integrating primary scaffoldin, whereas the type I cohesins are located on the anchoring scaffoldins. It has been previously shown that type I B. cellulosolvens interactions possess a dual-binding mode that adds flexibility to scaffoldin assembly.

Recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon is a crucial microbial process, critical to the cycling of carbon between plants, herbivores, and microbes. Bacteroides (Pseudobacteroides) cellulosolvens is a mesophilic, anaerobic bacterium capable of degrading crystalline cellulose (1Giuliano C. Khan A.W. Cellulase and sugar formation by Bacteroides cellulosolvens, a newly isolated cellulolytic anaerobe.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 48: 446-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Giuliano C. Khan A.W.

Similar to other bacteria such as Clostridium (Hungateiclostridium) thermocellum and Acetivibrio (Hungateiclostridium) cellulolyticus, Bacteroides cellulosolvens produces an extracellular multimodular cellulolytic complex—the cellulosome—responsible for the degradation of the plant cell wall (3Ding S.-Y. Bayer E.A. Steiner D. Shoham Y. Lamed R. A scaffoldin of the Bacteroides cellulosolvens cellulosome that contains 11 type II cohesins.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4915-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, B. cellulosolvens has the most intricate cellulosome so far described, conceivably capable of congregating up to 110 carbohydrate-active enzymes in a cell-associated mega-Dalton complex (Fig. 1) (4Zhivin O.

Biofuels. 2017; 10: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cellulosomes are built around a primary noncatalytic protein scaffold, named scaffoldin, bearing reiterated cohesin (Coh) modules that serve as protein–protein interaction targets to dockerin (Doc) modules found in an extensive repertoire of independent Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes). The ability to gather a large number of diverse enzymes into the cellulosome presumably provides these anaerobic microorganisms an important advantage in their competitive ecological niches, through complementary and synergic enzyme cooperation, while also promoting enzyme stability (5Fontes C.M.G.A.

The cellulosome’s Coh-Doc protein:protein interactions constitute the primary driving force for cellulosomal assembly and are among nature’s strongest protein:protein interactions (Ka > 109 M−1). Also, due to a distinctive twofold internal symmetry, Doc modules can potentially bind their cognate Cohs in two different orientations, by rotating 180° with respect to its protein ligand (6Carvalho A.L.

This is known as a dual-binding mode, as opposed to a single-binding mode that occurs when only one of the Doc interfaces supports the formation of the Coh-Doc complex (7Adams J.J.

Biofuels. 2017; 10: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) performed a seminal study on the architecture and functional organization of the most complex cellulosome described so far. Their work has identified 31 different scaffoldins, many of which lack any known cell-surface binding domains, thus supporting an extensive putative cell-free cellulosome system. Besides a novel classification of Coh-Doc pairings, named type R, another striking feature of this cellulosome is a reversal of Coh types found in scaffoldins. Unlike in other species, B. cellulosolvens’primary scaffoldin recruitment of Doc-bearing enzymes is mediated by type II Coh-Doc interactions, while anchoring scaffoldins rely on type I Coh-Doc complexes for cell wall attachment. The primary scaffoldin subunit of B. cellulosolvens, termed ScaA1, like other primary scaffoldin proteins, incorporates a carbohydrate-binding module (family 3 CBM), but is unusually composed of 11 type II Cohs and a C-terminal type I Doc that does not have an associated X module, which is a known type II Coh-Doc interaction stabilizer (3Ding S.-Y. Bayer E.A. Steiner D. Shoham Y. Lamed R. A scaffoldin of the Bacteroides cellulosolvens cellulosome that contains 11 type II cohesins.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4915-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell-surface anchoring of ScaA1 occurs via interaction of its single type I Doc with one of the ten type I Cohs found in the ScaB anchoring scaffoldin. Anchoring to the peptidoglycan-associated polymers from the bacterium cell surface likely results from a noncovalent interaction with ScaB’s S-layer homology (SLH) domain (13Zhao G. Li H. Wamalwa B. Sakka M. Kimura T. Sakka K. Different binding specificities of S-layer homology modules from Clostridium thermocellum AncA, Slp1, and Slp2.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This SLH-mediated interaction is likely aided by an adjacent X module, another B. cellulosolvens peculiarity (4Zhivin O. Dassa B. Moraïs S. Utturkar S.M. Brown S.D. Henrissat B. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Unique organization and unprecedented diversity of the Bacteroides (Pseudobacteroides) cellulosolvens cellulosome system.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2017; 10: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). While the functional implications of the reversed specificity of Coh types in B. cellulosolvens cellulosome architecture remain unclear, the actual structural determinants of specificity of its Coh-Doc type II interactions are also currently unknown. This knowledge gap is relevant considering that, although known cellulosome Coh-Doc structures share a remarkable overall conservation of structural topology, the major determinants for interspecies and intraspecies barriers, as well as for the binding mode, depend on very subtle amino acid residue differences (14Bule P.

The latter report suggested a dual-binding mode for B. cellulosolvens cellulosomal cell anchoring. This presumed plasticity for cell anchoring binding mode is similar to that found on A. cellulolyticus Coh-Doc interactions involving the primary scaffoldin (AcScaA), a unique adaptor scaffoldin (AcScaB) and several anchoring scaffoldins (AcScaC, AcScaD, and AcScaF) (PDB codes 4u3s/4wi0 (8Brás J.L.A.

All of these are in contradiction to the canonical single-binding mode found for cellulosome cell anchoring in C. thermocellum (PDB code 2b59, (17Adams J.J. Pal G. Jia Z. Smith S.P.

A. 2006; 103: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 11th type II Coh structure of BcScaA1 shows an overall fold similarity with several type II Cohs from A. cellulolyticus, namely with AcCohScaB3 (PDB code 4u3s), with a Q-score of 0.79 and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.22 Å over 163 aligned Cα residues. It also bears close homology to the type II CtCohScaF (PDB code 2b59) with a Q-score of 0.77 and rmsd of 1.40 Å against 164 aligned Cα residues. They all share the characteristic α-helical crowning between strands 6 and 7 and the two singular β-flaps that disrupt strands 4 and, particularly, strand 8 where its 12 residues are flanking the type II Coh Doc-binding plateau. The elucidation of B. cellulosolvens cellulosome assembly and the reversal of Coh types found in its scaffoldins hinge upon the availability of type II CohScaA-Doc complex structures to understand the consequences of this unusual arrangement. Here is reported the crystal structure of the type II 11th Coh of the primary scaffoldin of B. cellulosolvens in complex with the Doc module of a glycoside hydrolase of family 48, BcCohScaA111-DocCel48 (PDB code: 2y3n). A detailed binding characterization informed by the structural data has also been carried out, which allowed the identification of the molecular determinants of Coh-Doc interaction and suggested a typical dual-binding mode for cellulosome enzyme assembly, thus agreeing with the common paradigm for a flexible arrangement, as found on C. thermocellum (6Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M.V. Nagy T. Prates J.A.M. Proctor M.R. Smith N. Bayer E.A. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Romão M.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Gilbert H.J. Evidence for a dual binding mode of dockerin modules to cohesins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3089-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In light of this report and considering the putative dual-binding mode for scaffoldin assembly in both B. cellulosolvens and A. cellulolyticus (10Cameron K. Najmudin S. Alves V.D. Bayer E.A. Smith S.P. Bule P. Waller H. Ferreira L.M.A. Gilbert H.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Cell-surface attachment of bacterial multienzyme complexes involves highly dynamic protein-protein anchors.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 13578-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is fair to conclude that the single versus dual-binding mode in Coh-Doc complexes is independent of type classification. It also does not seem to be a matter of enzyme assembly versus cell-anchoring/scaffoldin assembly. Rather, it might be related to the size and complexity that is possible to achieve in a single unit within a cellulosomal system, with larger cellulosomes requiring a higher degree of flexibility for proper assembly and access to substrate. A critical factor to understand the mechanism of cellulosome assembly of B. cellulosolvens is the availability of an X-ray crystal structure of the type II Coh-Doc interaction, central to CAZyme assembly around the primary BcScaA1 scaffoldin. Escherichia coli coexpression strategies for the production and purification of Coh-Doc complexes were thus used to obtain good-quality crystals of highly pure protein complexes of the type II 11th Coh of the primary scaffoldin of B. cellulosolvens (BcCohScaA111), in complex with the Doc module of a glycoside hydrolase of family 48 (DocCel48). A previous study described the structure of this Coh in its unbound form (PDB code: 1tyj (15Noach I. Frolow F. Jakoby H. Rosenheck S. Shimon L.W. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Crystal structure of a type-II cohesin module from the Bacteroides cellulosolvens cellulosome reveals novel and distinctive secondary structural elements.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), and solving its structure in complex with a bound Doc would allow probing structural differences arising from Coh binding to a Doc partner. The chosen Doc module belongs to one of the most abundant cellulosomal CAZymes, GH48 cellobiohydrolase, and was previously reported to bind Cohs from ScaA1 (4Zhivin O. Dassa B. Moraïs S. Utturkar S.M. Brown S.D. Henrissat B. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Unique organization and unprecedented diversity of the Bacteroides (Pseudobacteroides) cellulosolvens cellulosome system.Biotechnol.

Cohesin-dockerin microarray: Diverse specificities between two complementary families of interacting protein modules.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence conservation between the DocCel48’s two dockerin repeats suggests the existence of two cohesin-binding interfaces, thus supporting a dual-binding mode. This implies that two different complex conformations could be present in solution, which would likely compromise protein crystallization due to a lack of unit cell homogeneity. It is well established that residues at relative positions 10 and 11 of each of the two Doc duplicated segments play a key role in Coh recognition and act as specificity determinants (residues #17, #18, #50, and #51 of the construct used in this work) (9Bayer E.A. Belaich J.P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. The cellulosomes: Multienzyme machines for degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Thus, a DocCel48 mutant was designed to force binding through a single interface, promoting homogeneity of the purified protein. The mutations used for the crystallization experiments were designed to replace the putative recognition residues in relative positions 10 and 11 of the C-terminal Doc repeat (Met50 and Ala51) with those of the B. cellulosolvens ScaA type I Doc (Ser-Asp), rather than the commonly applied alanine substitution. These amino acid changes were chosen based on the lack of cross-reaction between type I and type II Coh-Doc complexes. The sequence of the resulting Doc is displayed in Table S2. This strategy allowed us to obtain large yields of highly pure Coh-Doc complexes for crystallization, which led to the production of well-diffracting crystals. A molecular replacement strategy was used to solve the complex’s structure, using the available BcCohScaA111 structure as an input model (PDB code: 1tyj (15Noach I. Frolow F. Jakoby H. Rosenheck S.

Comparing this structure with that of the unbound BcCohScaA111 (1tyj) shows that, globally, the Coh does not undergo significant conformational changes upon binding, as revealed by the low rmsd value (0.66 Å for 166 Cα atoms) between both structures.

Methods Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 from four Atlanta hospitals were included in this observational cohort study and underwent admission testing of MOCHA parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin monomer). Clinical outcomes included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, access line thrombosis, ICU admission, intubation and mortality. Main results Of 276 patients (mean age 59 ± 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American), 45 (16%) had a thrombotic endpoint. Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p&lt;0.05) and ≥ 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2–8.8) as were admission D-dimer ≥ 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5–6.6) and ≥ 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6–7.9). However, only ≥ 2 MOCHA abnormalities were associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7–5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.4). MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. MOCHA with &lt;2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had 89% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for a thrombotic endpoint. Conclusions An admission MOCHA profile is useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients for thrombotic complications and more effective than isolated d-dimer for predicting risk of ICU admission and intubation."

https://openalex.org/W3135989460,"Trypanosoma brucei is a species of unicellular parasite that can cause severe diseases in livestock and humans, including African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease. Adaptation to diverse environments and changes in nutritional conditions is essential for T. brucei to establish an infection when changing hosts or during invasion of different host tissues. One such adaptation is the ability of T. brucei to rapidly switch its energy metabolism from glucose metabolism in the mammalian blood to proline catabolism in the insect stages and vice versa. However, the mechanisms that support the parasite's response to nutrient availability remain unclear. Using RNAseq and qRT-PCR, we investigated the response of T. brucei to amino acid or glucose starvation and found increased mRNA levels of several amino acid transporters, including all genes of the amino acid transporter AAT7-B subgroup. Functional characterization revealed that AAT7-B members are plasma membrane-localized in T. brucei and when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae supported the uptake of proline, alanine, and cysteine, while other amino acids were poorly recognized. All AAT7-B members showed a preference for proline, which is transported with high or low affinity. RNAi-mediated AAT7-B downregulation resulted in a reduction of intracellular proline concentrations and growth arrest under low proline availability in cultured procyclic form parasites.

Amino acids play an important role in the metabolism and life cycle of T. brucei (reviewed in (9Marchese L. Nascimento J. de F. Damasceno F.S. Bringaud F. Michels P.A.M. Silber A.M. The uptake and metabolism of amino acids, and their unique role in the biology of pathogenic trypanosomatids.Pathogens. 2018; 7: 36Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Proline is of particular interest, as proline biosynthesis is absent in T. brucei, making the parasites dependent on proline uptake for protein synthesis (8Bringaud F. Barrett M.P. Zilberstein D. Multiple roles of proline transport and metabolism in trypanosomatids.Front. Biosci. (Landmark Ed.). 2012; 17: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In its insect host, the tsetse fly, the procyclic form of T. brucei lives in the midgut. Later developmental stages are found in the proventriculus and salivary glands (10Roditi I. Lehane M.J. Interactions between trypanosomes and tsetse flies.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In these stages T. brucei has limited access to glucose and instead relies on the degradation of amino acids as carbon and energy sources, among which proline is the most abundant in the insect's hemolymph (11Bursell E.

Proline is used by T. brucei to fuel oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion and is the main source of energy for the insect stages of the parasite (13Mantilla B.S. Marchese L.

The first two enzymes of proline degradation, proline dehydrogenase and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), are essential for the parasite's grown in the absence of glucose in vitro (13Mantilla B.S.

Downstream steps involve a partially active tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the production of pyruvate from malate. Pyruvate can be further oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A and then to acetate, or it can be used as an amino group acceptor and converted to alanine, which has to be exported from the mitochondrion and excreted from the cell (16Coustou V. Biran M. Breton M. Guegan F. Rivière L. Plazolles N. Nolan D. Barrett M.P. Franconi J.-M. Bringaud F. Glucose-induced remodeling of intermediary and energy metabolism in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16342-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alanine is used as an osmolyte in many trypanosomatids, contributing to a large portion of the cellular amino acid pool (21Williamson J. Desowitz R.S. The chemical composition of trypanosomes. I. Protein, amino acid and sugar analysis.Exp. Parasitol. 1961; 11: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and was also shown to be a main excretion product in hypo-osmotic stress responses in Leishmania spp. (22Vieira L.L.

Regulatory volume decrease in Trypanosoma cruzi involves amino acid efflux and changes in intracellular calcium.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because proline degradation is linked to the TCA cycle, it is interesting that TCA cycle intermediates can initiate the differentiation from short stumpy bloodstream forms to procyclic forms (25Brun R. Schönenberger M. Stimulating effect of citrate and cis-Aconitate on the transformation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms to procyclic forms in vitro.Z. Parasitenkd. 1981; 66: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This differentiation can also be triggered by depriving stumpy forms of glucose, which concomitantly induces upregulation of enzymes involved in proline degradation (17Qiu Y. Milanes J.E. Jones J.A. Noorai R.E. Shankar V. Morris J.C. Glucose signaling is important for nutrient adaptation during differentiation of pleomorphic African trypanosomes.mSphere. 2018; 3: 1-18Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, upregulation of proline metabolism as well as an increase in proline uptake and consumption was shown in procyclic culture forms (PCF) shifted from glucose-containing to glucose-free medium (14Lamour N. Riviere L. Coustou V. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. Proline metabolism in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei is down-regulated in the presence of glucose.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11902-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the tsetse fly, T. brucei has to compete for nutrients, including proline, which is used by the insect as energy source for flight muscles (11Bursell E. Aspects of the metabolism of amino acids in the tsetse fly, Glossina (Diptera).J. Insect Physiol. 1963; 9: 439-452Crossref Google Scholar, 26Bursell E. Aspects of the flight metabolism of tsetse flies (Glossina).Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1966; 19: 809-818Crossref Google Scholar). Proline availability undergoes high fluctuations during starvation periods or insect flight (11Bursell E. Aspects of the metabolism of amino acids in the tsetse fly, Glossina (Diptera).J. Insect Physiol. 1963; 9: 439-452Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, in the bloodstream of the mammalian host, nutrients are readily replenished, and a high availability of glucose allows the parasite to utilize this sugar as its main energy and carbon source. T. brucei can not only be found in the bloodstream, but also in the skin (27Capewell P. Cren-Travaillé C. Marchesi F. Johnston P. Clucas C. Benson R.A. Gorman T.-A. Calvo-Alvarez E. Crouzols A.

Cooper A. et al.The skin is a significant but overlooked anatomical reservoir for vector-borne African trypanosomes.Elife. 2016; 5: 1-17Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), adipose tissue (28Tanowitz H.B.

Adipose tissue: A safe haven for parasites?.Trends Parasitol. 2017; 33: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and, during the second stage of parasitemia, in the cerebrospinal fluid (29Mogk S. Boßelmann C.M. Mudogo C.N. Stein J. Wolburg H. Duszenko M. African trypanosomes and brain infection - the unsolved question.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos.

Therefore, T. brucei has to be able to adapt to varying nutritional conditions in the insect and the vertebrate host, both possibly involving the regulation of amino acid transporters. While many amino acid transport activities have been determined using whole trypanosomatids (9Marchese L. Nascimento J. de F. Damasceno F.S. Bringaud F. Michels P.A.M. Silber A.M.

While it was shown that procyclic form T. brucei upregulates proline transport in the absence of glucose (14Lamour N. Riviere L. Coustou V. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F.

In Leishmania the selective proline/alanine transporter LdAAP24 was shown to be essential to fuel the cellular proline pool and be involved in the response to hypotonic stress (23Inbar E. Schlisselberg D. Suter Grotemeyer M. Rentsch D. Zilberstein D. A versatile proline/alanine transporter in the unicellular pathogen Leishmania donovani regulates amino acid homoeostasis and osmotic stress responses.Biochem.

J. 2014; 463: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but its involvement in proline metabolism was not tested. Parasites can respond to amino acid availability. Leishmania donovani can sense a reduction in environmental arginine and reacts by upregulating the high-affinity arginine transporter LdAAP3 in a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent way (37Goldman-Pinkovich A.

High-affinity arginine transporters have been shown to be essential for T. brucei PCF and blood stream form (31Mathieu C. Macêdo J.P. Hürlimann D. Wirdnam C. Haindrich A.C. Suter Grotemeyer M.

This response may reflect the different nutritional environments and amino acid availability within the different host tissues, but also the change in energy metabolism between the mammalian and the insect life-cycle stages. We have looked for amino acid transporters whose transcripts are regulated in response to amino acid starvation, as might be encountered by trypanosomes in the skin tissue or the cerebrospinal fluid in the mammal, upon change of host or during starvation of the tsetse fly. We identified transcripts of amino acid transporters from three loci that were upregulated upon nutrient starvation. Further characterization of three of these genes belonging to the amino acid transporter 7 family (AAT7, (47Jackson A.P. Origins of amino acid transporter loci in trypanosomatid parasites.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) showed that they encode high and low-affinity proline transporters that are essential in T. brucei procyclic form under proline limitation. To test whether amino acid deprivation has an impact on transcript levels of amino acid transporters, we performed transcriptome analyses of T. brucei under different starvation conditions. For this purpose we prepared modified culture media that allowed us to assess the response to amino acid starvation in both procyclic form and bloodstream form (BSF) T. brucei and the response to glucose starvation in PCF. For these experiments we used 29-13 (Lister 427 procyclic form, (48Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar)) cultivated in commercial SDM79 (including 10% FBS) (49Brun R. Schönenberger Cultivation and in vitro cloning or procyclic culture forms of Trypanosoma brucei in a semi-defined medium. Short communication.Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). To start starvation, SDM79 was replaced by different formulations of our home-made starvation medium, SDM79S, which closely resembles the formulation of SDM79, but lacks FBS (for composition see Table 1 and for details Table S1). As a control, fresh commercial SDM79 (+10% FBS) was used. Starvation media contained glucose and all amino acids (SDM79S+AA, i.e., control for lack of FBS), glucose but no amino acids (SDM79S-AA), or lacked glucose, but contained all amino acids and 50 mM N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) to reduce uptake of residual glucose (SDM79S-G). A similar experimental setup was chosen for starvation of bloodstream form NY-SM cells (48Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Cells were first cultured in HMI-11 (containing 10% (v/v) FBS, based on commercial IMDM) (50Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Continuous cultivation of Trypanosoma brucei blood stream forms in a medium containing a low concentration of serum protein without feeder cell layers.J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then incubated either in fresh HMI-11 or starvation medium HMIS (for composition see Tables 1 and S1) containing all amino acids but no FBS (HMIS+AA) or in HMIS containing no amino acids and no FBS (HMIS-AA). After the starvation period, RNA was extracted and submitted for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mapped to the genome of T. brucei Lister 427_2018 (51Müller L.S.M. Cosentino R.O. Förstner K.U. Guizetti J. Wedel C. Kaplan N. Janzen C.J. Arampatzi P. Vogel J. Steinbiss S. Otto T.D. Saliba A.-E. Sebra R.P. Siegel T.N. Genome organization and DNA accessibility control antigenic variation in trypanosomes.Nature. 2018; 563: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RNA-seq resulted in at least 20 million reads per sample and could be mapped with an efficiency of >80% to the reference genome. For comparative transcriptome analysis, reads were mapped to the annotated coding sequences of T. brucei Lister 427_2018, which accounted for 34–47% of all reads, i.e., ≥ nine million reads per sample. Mapped reads per gene were normalized to the total number of mapped reads per sample to obtain RPM (reads per million) values but were not normalized to the length of the transcript. We could identify mapped reads of approximately 14,400 genes, from which we removed all pseudogenes genes and genes with less than 100 mapped reads within the coding region of the gene, leaving around 8200 genes for PCF data and 8600 genes for the BSF data.

https://openalex.org/W3137395380,"Lactate, one of the most common primary metabolites of bacteria and human cells, has been shown to play essential roles in the regulation of inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases. However, whether and how host-derived lactate affects intestinal epithelial homeostasis is still not completely understood. Here, we investigated how L-lactate, mainly produced by host cells, regulates intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) migration to promote intestinal wound healing. Using video microscopy and tracking individual cells, we found that L-lactate enhanced IEC migration in direction persistence and speed. Mechanistically, L-lactate promoted IEC mitochondrial ATP production. The mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin, significantly decreased IEC persistence and speed, which inhibited cell migration induced by L-lactate. Furthermore, administering mice with L-lactate suppressed colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that host-derived L-lactate promotes IEC mitochondrial ATP production to drive cell migration, promoting intestinal wound healing to alleviate intestinal inflammation."

Prototype foamy virus (PFV) integrase (IN) forms a tetramer bound to two viral DNA (vDNA) ends in a complex termed an intasome. PFV IN consists of four domains: the amino terminal extension domain (NED), amino terminal domain (NTD), catalytic core domain (CCD), and carboxyl terminal domain (CTD). The domains of the two inner IN protomers have been visualized, as well as the CCDs of the two outer IN protomers. However, the roles of the amino and carboxyl terminal domains of the PFV intasome outer subunits during integration to a nucleosome target substrate are not clear. We used the well-characterized 601 nucleosome to assay integration activity as well as intasome binding. PFV intasome integration to 601 nucleosomes occurs in clusters at four independent sites. We find that the outer protomer NED and NTD domains have no significant effects on integration efficiency, site selection, or binding. The CTDs of the outer PFV intasome subunits dramatically affect nucleosome binding but have little effect on total integration efficiency. The outer PFV IN CTDs did significantly alter the integration efficiency at one site. Histone tails also significantly affect intasome binding, but have little impact on PFV integration efficiency or site selection.

Following entry to a cell, the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase copies the viral genomic RNA to a linear double-stranded cDNA (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Then retroviral integrase (IN) covalently joins the cDNA 3′ ends to host DNA. The integration reaction is faithfully recapitulated in vitro by complexes assembled from recombinant IN and oligomers mimicking the viral DNA ends (vDNA), termed intasomes (2Maertens G.N. Hare S. Cherepanov P. The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates.Nature. 2010; 468: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The IN of prototype foamy virus (PFV) has four domains: an amino terminal extension domain (NED), an amino terminal domain (NTD), a catalytic core domain (CCD), and a carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) (3Valkov E.

All IN domains of the PFV intasome inner protomers have been visualized, but only the CCDs of the outer protomers have been resolved. In addition to the IN tetramer observed for PFV, retroviral intasomes may also be an octamer of IN, in the cases of mouse mammary tumor virus and Rous sarcoma virus, or a hexadecamer of IN, as seen with Maedi visna virus (6Ballandras-Colas A.

Aihara H. Crystal structure of the Rous sarcoma virus intasome.Nature. 2016; 530: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Central to the higher order multimers is a conserved intasome core (CIC) structurally similar to the PFV IN tetramer (9Engelman A.N. Cherepanov P. Retroviral intasomes arising.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 47: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The CIC suggests that the PFV intasome may serve as a model for intasomes of other retroviruses. The natural target for retroviral integration is eukaryotic chromatin, which consists of DNA packaged into arrays of nucleosomes. A nucleosome is ∼147 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Nucleosome DNA and histones display symmetry around a central dyad (10Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Mononucleosomes may be assembled from recombinant histones and a nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) DNA (11Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Reconstitution of nucleosome core particles from recombinant histones and DNA.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Natural NPS DNAs display rotational and/or translational shifting on the histone octamer particularly under conditions of physiological ionic strength (12Lowary P.T. Widom J. Nucleosome packaging and nucleosome positioning of genomic DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A synthetic NPS termed 601 was selected in vitro to maintain stable positioning over a wide range of ionic strengths, even below physiological conditions, yet has been shown to retain physiologically relevant nucleosome dynamics in vivo (13Lowary P.T.

The NPS DNA sequence is numbered –73 to +73 with the 0 base pair (bp) at the dyad and the distal ends termed entry–exit regions (Fig. 1A). 601 NPS DNA binds tightly to a histone octamer at the dyad while the entry–exit regions may transiently unwrap (15Anderson J.D.

PFV intasomes are also capable of performing one-dimensional diffusion on DNA and search 1.6 kb while in continuous contact with naked linear DNA (24Jones N.D. Lopez Jr., M.A. Hanne J. Peake M.B. Lee J.B. Fishel R. Yoder K.E. Retroviral intasomes search for a target DNA by 1D diffusion which rarely results in integration.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conceivably, PFV intasomes could slide on transiently unwrapped NPS DNA to an integration site by a mechanism similar to other DNA-binding proteins. However, nucleosomes with engineered histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that induce NPS unwrapping had no effect on integration efficiency (20Mackler R.M. Jones N.D. Gardner A.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Howard C.J. Fishel R. Yoder K.E. Nucleosome DNA unwrapping does not affect prototype foamy virus integration efficiency or site selection.PLoS One. 2019; 14e0212764Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This data suggests that intasomes do not integrate to nucleosome-bound DNA by sliding on exposed entry–exit regions. A different model is derived from an elegant structure of the PFV intasome bound to a nucleosome revealing the CTD of an inner IN protomer bound to an H2A tail (5Maskell D.P. Renault L. Serrao E. Lesbats P. Matadeen R. Hare S. Lindemann D. Engelman A.N. Costa A. Cherepanov P.

Other retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) or murine leukemia virus (MLV), use host proteins to tether their integration complexes to nucleosomes by binding IN and histone PTMs (25Sharma A.

PFV intasomes appear able to bind directly to nucleosomes to complete integration into wrapped DNA. Structural studies indicated a strategy to position PFV IN protomers at either the inner or outer intasome subunits by compensatory point mutations (5Maskell D.P. Renault L. Serrao E. Lesbats P. Matadeen R. Hare S. Lindemann D. Engelman A.N. Costa A. Cherepanov P. Structural basis for retroviral integration into nucleosomes.Nature. 2015; 523: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PFV IN(K120E) and PFV IN(D273K) direct IN to the catalytically active inner or inactive outer positions, respectively. Deletion of the NED, NTD, or CTD domains may be engineered at the outer protomers by the IN(D273K) mutation (5Maskell D.P. Renault L. Serrao E. Lesbats P. Matadeen R. Hare S. Lindemann D. Engelman A.N. Costa A. Cherepanov P. Structural basis for retroviral integration into nucleosomes.Nature. 2015; 523: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The IN(D273K) truncation mutants can be assembled with full length (FL) IN(K120E) and vDNA to generate enzymatically active PFV intasomes (5Maskell D.P. Renault L. Serrao E. Lesbats P. Matadeen R.

Rep. 2019; 9: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Biochemical assays revealed that the outer protomer NED, NTD, and CTD domains are not required for catalysis (29Jones N.D. Mackler R.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Baltierra-Jasso L.E. Altman M.P. Senavirathne G. Yoder K.E. Prototype foamy virus intasome aggregation is mediated by outer protein domains and prevented by protocatechuic acid.Sci.

Outer domains of integrase within retroviral intasomes are dispensible for catalysis of DNA integration.Protein Sci. 2016; 25: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the outer protomer CTDs led to increased stability of the PFV intasomes without affecting binding to a supercoiled plasmid target DNA (29Jones N.D. Mackler R.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Baltierra-Jasso L.E. Altman M.P. Senavirathne G. Yoder K.E. Prototype foamy virus intasome aggregation is mediated by outer protein domains and prevented by protocatechuic acid.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Deletion of the amino terminal domains of the outer protomers showed minimal effects on intasome stability. Whether the outer protomer NED, NTD, and CTD domains play any meaningful roles in PFV integration to chromatin is largely unknown. The effects of outer protomer truncation mutations during integration to nucleosomes have not been explored at ionic strength conditions in the physiological range. Here we assembled fluorescently labeled human mononucleosomes as well as PFV intasomes with FL IN, deletion of the IN amino terminal NED and NTD domains (ΔNTD), or deletion of the IN CTD (ΔCTD) at the outer protomers. Integration efficiency was quantified and integration sites were mapped to the 601 nucleosome structure (PDB: 3LZ0, (31Vasudevan D. Chua E.Y. Davey C.A. Crystal structures of nucleosome core particles containing the '601' strong positioning sequence.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 403: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)). PFV intasomes integrate to 601 nucleosomes in four clusters at exposed helices. Deletion of the outer PFV IN domains had minor effects on integration efficiency or site selection. These effects were mostly seen at a single integration cluster and only observed in the presence of 100–150 mM NaCl. To analyze binding of the truncation mutants to nucleosomes, PFV intasome vDNA was biotinylated and examined by streptavidin affinity precipitation. PFV IN(ΔCTD) intasomes displayed significantly less binding to nucleosomes. Nucleosomes were treated with trypsin to evaluate the roles of histone tails on integration efficiency and binding at physiological ionic strength conditions. While removal of histone tails showed significant effects on intasome binding, there were no significant differences in overall integration efficiency. The minor differences of integration efficiencies did not correlate with significant differences in binding, suggesting that PFV intasome binding to a target is not rate determining for catalysis. Purified PFV intasomes are a tetramer of IN and two vDNAs (2Maertens G.N. Hare S. Cherepanov P. The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates.Nature. 2010; 468: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These complexes readily perform integration to target DNA in vitro (3Valkov E. Gupta S.S. Hare S. Helander A. Roversi P. McClure M. Cherepanov P. Functional and structural characterization of the integrase from the prototype foamy virus.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Concerted integration is the covalent joining of each vDNA to target DNA in a reaction termed strand transfer. The two points of joining are separated by 4 bp of target DNA numbered 0–3 (Fig. 1A). Concerted integration to a linear target DNA generates two fragments, each consisting of one vDNA and a fraction of the target DNA. A four-nucleotide single-strand DNA gap is at the junction of vDNA and target DNA. Recombinant mononucleosomes include 147 bp of linear NPS DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The 601 NPS DNA is numbered –73 to +73 with the central base pair numbered 0 (Fig. 1A). Integration products from nucleosome substrates are two linear DNA fragments of vDNA ligated to target DNA. Fluorophore labeling of either the top or bottom strand of the 601 NPS allows identification of the points of joining on each strand (Fig. 1, B and C). Alternatively, intasomes may join only one vDNA to the target generating a Y structure DNA product. These half-site integration products are not likely to be physiologically relevant but may appear during integration in vitro. Integration assays with PFV intasomes have been performed at 37 °C for 30–60 min (2Maertens G.N. Hare S. Cherepanov P. The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates.Nature. 2010; 468: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 30Li M. Lin S. Craigie R. Outer domains of integrase within retroviral intasomes are dispensible for catalysis of DNA integration.Protein Sci. 2016; 25: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our previous kinetic analysis of PFV intasome integration with a supercoiled plasmid target DNA suggested that the reaction was complete by 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of a physiologically relevant salt concentration (29Jones N.D. Mackler R.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Baltierra-Jasso L.E. Altman M.P. Senavirathne G. Yoder K.E. Prototype foamy virus intasome aggregation is mediated by outer protein domains and prevented by protocatechuic acid.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of integration with nucleosome substrates, PFV intasomes were incubated with mononucleosomes reconstituted from recombinant human histone octamer and 601 NPS DNA labeled near one 5′ end with a Cy5 fluorophore (Fig. 2). Due to fluctuations of rotational or translational positioning, naturally occurring NPSs are not suitable substrates for precisely mapping integration sites at physiologically relevant ionic strength (20Mackler R.M. Jones N.D. Gardner A.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Howard C.J. Fishel R. Yoder K.E. Nucleosome DNA unwrapping does not affect prototype foamy virus integration efficiency or site selection.PLoS One. 2019; 14e0212764Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Native PAGE revealed integration products that were shorter and longer than unreacted 601 NPS DNA. Products were readily apparent after 1 min incubation and plateaued at 5 min (Fig. 2). The kinetics of PFV intasome integration to a nucleosome target are consistent with integration to supercoiled plasmid substrate (29Jones N.D. Mackler R.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Baltierra-Jasso L.E. Altman M.P. Senavirathne G. Yoder K.E. Prototype foamy virus intasome aggregation is mediated by outer protein domains and prevented by protocatechuic acid.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These reaction products indicated several integration sites with 601 nucleosomes. However, the single-strand gap at the integration site junction alters the electrophoretic mobility of DNA and precludes precise determination of integration sites (32Guo H. Tullius T.D. Gapped DNA is anisotropically bent.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Mills J.B. Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. Electrophoretic evidence that single-stranded regions of one or more nucleotides dramatically increase the flexibility of DNA.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Evaluation of integration products by native gel electrophoresis shows that the products are largely concerted integration. Half-site integration, where only one vDNA is joined to the target DNA, results in a branched DNA. The apparent mobility of a 147 bp NPS with a 40 bp vDNA branch is >250 bp (5Maskell D.P. Renault L. Serrao E. Lesbats P. Matadeen R. Hare S. Lindemann D. Engelman A.N. Costa A. Cherepanov P. Structural basis for retroviral integration into nucleosomes.Nature. 2015; 523: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Half-site integration products were barely detectable with PFV intasome integration to nucleosomes (Fig. 2A). These products accounted for <1% of the fluorescent signal in any lane indicating that PFV intasomes primarily perform concerted integration to nucleosome targets. PFV intasome integration into nucleosomes was further analyzed by denaturing PAGE to precisely identify the strand breaks in nucleosome DNA. Each strand transfer introduces a single-strand break in the target DNA (Fig. 1). The 601 NPS DNA was fluorescently labeled near the 5′ end of either the top (T-Cy5 NPS) or bottom (B-Cy5 NPS) strand (Fig. 1, B and C). The NPS base pair that is 3′ to the strand scission, where the vDNA is joined, correlates to integration site position 0 (top strand) and position 3 (bottom strand). Denaturing electrophoresis allows visualization of the fluorescently labeled strand and calculation of its length. The lengths of the products indicate sites of integration that may be mapped to the 601 nucleosome crystal structure (31Vasudevan D. Chua E.Y. Davey C.A. Crystal structures of nucleosome core particles containing the '601' strong positioning sequence.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 403: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of PFV intasomes were added to nucleosomes with 601 NPS DNA labeled on either the top or bottom strand (Fig. 3A). Denaturing PAGE revealed that PFV integration occurred in small clusters, as previously reported (20Mackler R.M. Jones N.D. Gardner A.M. Lopez Jr., M.A. Howard C.J. Fishel R. Yoder K.E. Nucleosome DNA unwrapping does not affect prototype foamy virus integration efficiency or site selection.PLoS One. 2019; 14e0212764Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Four clusters of integration sites, each representing ≥2% of the fluorescent signal at the highest concentration of intasome, were observed. Data from lanes with the highest intasome concentration were transformed to signal density plots (Fig. 3B). These densitometric curves show each band as a peak of fluorescence. The four clusters of integration with T-Cy5 nucleosomes are at 601 NPS sites –59, –37, +36, and +47; the four B-Cy5 integration sites are at –56, –34, +39, and +50. The numbering for concerted integration products observed with T-Cy5 and B-Cy5 NPS differs by the 4 bp separation of strand transfer sites (Fig. 1A). For example, a T-Cy5 NPS band indicating a nick 5′ of -36 will correlate with a B-Cy5 NPS nick 5′ of -33. For simplicity, the clusters are hereafter referred to by the major observed integration position 0. As seen with other retroviral integration assays with nucleosomes, PFV integration is disfavored at the dyad region (17Pruss D. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A.P. Human immunodeficiency virus integrase directs integration to sites of severe DNA distortion within the nucleosome core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The T-Cy5 NPS and B-Cy5 NPS density plots were converted from logarithmic to linear scales, overlaid, and shifted to account for the 4 bp difference between strand transfer events on the two strands (Fig. 3C). The overlay of linear-scale electropherograms shows identical integration profiles. Taken together, the identical T-Cy5 and B-Cy5 products in denaturing PAGE and the low frequency of >250 bp products observed in native PAGE confirm that PFV intasome integration to nucleosomes is concerted. Integration efficiency for each cluster was derived from the area under the curve of each peak in the density plots (Fig. 3D). Following least square filtering to remove background signal, the sum of areas under the curve for all fluorescence peaks was determined, including unreacted substrate. The area under the curve for each individual peak was divided by the total fluorescence value to obtain the integration efficiency expressed as percent of signal. The higher-resolution PAGE regions revealed clusters of two to five bands: two bands at –59, five bands at –37, four bands at +36, and two bands at +47 (Fig. 3A). Quantitative analysis revealed a hierarchy of PFV integration preference where the –59 cluster was the least favored and the +47 cluster was the most favored (Fig. 3D). This hierarchy of site preference was the same for both T-Cy5 NPS and B-Cy5 NPS substrates. Mapping the integration clusters to a 601 nucleosome structure (PDB: 3LZ0) revealed that all sites are on exposed DNA helices and are not occluded by the histone octamer or adjacent DNA gyre (31Vasudevan D.

https://openalex.org/W3138019444,"Background This is the first Egyptian nationwide study for derivation of reference intervals (RIs) for 34 major chemistry analytes. It was conducted as a part of the global initiative by the IFCC Committee on Reference Intervals and Decision Limits (C-RIDL) for establishing country-specific RIs based on a harmonized protocol. Methods 691 apparently healthy volunteers aged ≥18 years were recruited from multiple regions in Egypt. Serum specimens were analyzed in two centers. The harmonization and standardization of test results were achieved by measuring value-assigned serum panel provided by C-RIDL. The RIs were calculated by parametric method. Sources of variation of reference values (RVs) were evaluated by multiple regression analysis. The need for partitioning by sex, age, and region was judged primarily by standard deviation ratio (SDR). Results Gender-specific RIs were required for six analytes including total bilirubin (TBil), aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST, ALT). Seven analytes required age-partitioning including glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Regional differences were observed between northern and southern Egypt for direct bilirubin, glucose, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with all their RVs lower in southern Egypt. Compared with other collaborating countries, the features of Egyptian RVs were lower HDL-C and TBil and higher TG and C-reactive protein. In addition, BMI showed weak association with most of nutritional markers. These features were shared with two other Middle Eastern countries: Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Conclusion The standardized RIs established by this study can be used as common Egyptian RI, except for a few analytes that showed regional differences. Despite high prevalence of obesity among Egyptians, their RVs of nutritional markers are less sensitive to increased BMI, compared to other collaborating countries."
https://openalex.org/W3136756663,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) play a pivotal role in cancer metastasis and resistance to therapy. Previously, we compared the phosphoproteomes of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) enriched subpopulation and non-BCSCs sorted from breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and identified a function unknown protein, transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3 (TMCC3) to be a potential enrichment marker for BCSCs. We demonstrated greater expression of TMCC3 in BCSCs than non-BCSCs and higher expression of TMCC3 in metastatic lymph nodes and lungs than in primary tumor of breast cancer PDXs. TMCC3 silencing suppressed mammosphere formation, ALDH activity and cell migration in vitro, along with reduced tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that AKT activation was reduced by TMCC3 silencing, but enhanced by TMCC3 overexpression. We further demonstrated that TMCC3 interacted directly with AKT through its 1-153 a.a. domain by cell-free biochemical assay in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation and interaction domain mapping assays in vivo. Based on domain truncation studies, we showed that the AKT-interacting domain of TMCC3 was essential for TMCC3-induced AKT activation, self-renewal, and metastasis. Clinically, TMCC3 mRNA expression in 202 breast cancer specimens as determined by qRT-PCR assay showed that higher TMCC3 expression correlated with poorer clinical outcome of breast cancer, including early-stage breast cancer. Multivariable analysis identified TMCC3 expression as an independent risk factor for survival. These findings suggest that TMCC3 is crucial for maintenance of BCSCs features through AKT regulation, and TMCC3 expression has independent prognostic significance in breast cancer. Thus, TMCC3 may serve as a new target for therapy directed against CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3136779476,"Acute urinary retention (AUR) is a common urological emergency and affects a significant patient population. The inability to eliminate urine may lead to permanent damage to the bladder's structure and functioning. However, we know little about the underlying molecular sequelae to the urine retention. To closely mirror the potential high pressures that patients with AUR could experience, we catheterized anesthetized female mice via the urethra and filled the bladder by pumping saline (25 µL/min) into the bladder lumen to 50 cm or 80 cm water pressure. A water column with designated height (50 or 80 cm) was then adjusted to maintain constant pressure in the bladder lumen for 30 minutes. Functional and morphological evaluations were performed from 0 to 24 hours after AUR treatment. Mice exhibited incontinence and overactivity with diminished voiding pressure. Significant injury was confirmed which revealed bladders with disrupted urothelial barrier, edematous lamina propria, and distorted muscle bundles. Bladder smooth muscle (BSM) from pressure-treated mice have significantly diminished contraction force, suggesting that bladder voiding dysfunction can be attributed to impaired BSM contractility. Indeed, dysregulation of acetylcholine and purinergic signaling pathways were demonstrated, indicating that reduced efficacy of these pathways contributes to impaired BSM contractility. Finally, altered expression of β1-integrin and extracellular matrix mediated mechanotransduction pathways were detected, suggesting a profound remodeling process. These data demonstrated an easy to perform, quantifiable, and reproducible AUR mouse model, which mimics well the characteristics of human AUR patients, and our data generate new insights into the molecular mechanisms that occur following AUR."
https://openalex.org/W3137173907,"Identity concealment (whether or not a person is open with others about their transgender status) and passing/blending (how much a transgender person can, or chooses to, blend into the binary social environment) have been shown to impact transgender people’s experiences in various ways, but few studies examine these constructs in the lives of non-binary individuals (those whose gender identity does not fall exclusively into the categories of man or woman). This study analyzed the non-binary subset of the nationwide sample from the 2015 United States Transgender Survey (9,769 participants) to examine the effects of blending/passing and identity concealment on distress and victimization. When ethnicity and income were controlled for, low concealers reported higher distress and more victimization experiences than high concealers, and blenders reported more distress and fewer victimization experiences than non-blenders. Not concealing may put non-binary people at higher risk for victimization, but blending into the binary-gendered environment may increase distress through identity erasure.

https://openalex.org/W3136972677,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling promotes cancer progression. In particular, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β is considered crucial to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Here, we report that the EMT-associated cellular responses induced by TGF-β are mediated by distinct signaling pathways that diverge at Smad3. By expressing chimeric Smad1/Smad3 proteins in <i>SMAD3</i> knockout A549 cells, we found that the β4 region in the Smad3 MH1 domain is essential for TGF-β-induced cell motility, but is not essential for other EMT-associated responses including epithelial marker downregulation. TGF-β was previously reported to enhance cell motility by activating Rac1 <i>via</i> phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Intriguingly, TGF-β-dependent signaling mediated by Smad3's β4 region causes the downregulation of multiple mRNAs that encode GTPase activating proteins that target Rac1 (<i>ARHGAP</i>s), thereby attenuating Rac1 inactivation. Therefore, two independent pathways downstream of TGF-β type I receptor contribute cooperatively to sustained Rac1 activation, thereby leading to enhanced cell motility."

Aging alters HSC function, number, and composition and increases risk of hematological malignancies, but how these changes occur in HSCs remains unclear. Signaling via p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38MAPK) has been proposed as a candidate mechanism underlying induction of HSC aging. Here, using genetic models of both chronological and premature aging, we describe a multimodal role for p38α, the major p38MAPK isozyme in hematopoiesis, in HSC aging. We report that p38α regulates differentiation bias and sustains transplantation capacity of HSCs in the early phase of chronological aging. However, p38α decreased HSC transplantation capacity in the late progression phase of chronological aging. Furthermore, codeletion of p38α in mice deficient in ataxia–telangiectasia mutated, a model of premature aging, exacerbated aging-related HSC phenotypes seen in ataxia–telangiectasia mutated single-mutant mice. Overall, these studies provide new insight into multiple functions of p38MAPK, which both promotes and suppresses HSC aging context dependently.

Overall, these studies provide new insight into multiple functions of p38MAPK, which both promotes and suppresses HSC aging context dependently. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit self-renewal capacity and multipotency and maintain entire hematopoietic system throughout an organism's life (1Dzierzak E. Bigas A. Blood development: Hematopoietic stem cell dependence and independence.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HSCs exist in the G0 phase of the cell cycle at steady state. Upon hematological stress, such as radiation, chemotherapy, and infection, HSCs enter the cell cycle to supply hematopoietic cells to meet organismal hematopoietic demands (2Li T. Zhou Z.W. Ju Z.

HSC activation is also seen in bone marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) as treatment for hematopoietic malignancies and in other diseases. Aging induces functional decline in multiple organ systems, including hematopoiesis. Changes in HSC number and capacity occur as hematopoietic cells age: HSC pool size increases, transplantation capacity decreases, differentiation becomes skewed, and clonality is limited (4de Haan G.

Understanding how hematological stress promotes aging-related changes could suggest treatment for aging-related hematological disease or enhance our ability to expand HSCs in vitro without functional decline. Several stress signals, including p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38MAPK) signaling, reportedly function in HSC aging. p38MAPK is a member of the MAPK superfamily and includes four isozymes: the major isozyme p38α (Mapk14), p38β (Mapk11), p38γ (Mapk12), and p38δ (Mapk13). p38MAPK is activated by DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokine release, all induced by stress responses (9Arthur J.S. Ley S.C. Mitogen-activated protein kinases in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 10Ashwell J.D. The many paths to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Activated p38MAPK phosphorylates downstream substrates and activates stress responses including cellular senescence (11Iwasa H. Han J. Ishikawa F. Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 defines the common senescence-signalling pathway.Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In HSCs, BMT or loss of the ataxia–telangiectasia mutated (Atm) gene reportedly activates the p38MAPK/p16Ink4a/Rb axis via ROS induction, decreasing quiescence, and increasing HSC exhaustion (12Baudet A. Karlsson C. Safaee Talkhoncheh M. Galeev R. Magnusson M. Larsson J.

Treatment with antioxidants or p38MAPK inhibitors rescues HSC numbers and function, suggesting that p38MAPK compromises HSC function after stress loading (13Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K.

However, genetic support for how p38MAPK regulates HSCs in vivo is thus far lacking. Using young p38α knockout mice, we previously reported that p38MAPK activates purine metabolism to promote stress-induced proliferation after transplantation or cytokine stimulation. Therefore, p38MAPK is genetically necessary for HSC proliferation under acute stress conditions in young mice (16Karigane D. Kobayashi H. Morikawa T. Ootomo Y. Sakai M. Nagamatsu G. Kubota Y. Goda N. Matsumoto M. Nishimura E.K. Soga T. Otsu K. Suematsu M. Okamoto S. Suda T. et al.p38alpha activates purine metabolism to initiate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cycling in response to stress.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 192-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated effects of p38α loss in models of chronological and premature aging. Relevant to the former, we found that p38α differently modulates HSC function between the early and late progression phases of chronological aging. Moreover, our analysis of effects of p38α loss in Atm-deficient mice, which represent a model of premature aging, indicated that p38α sustains pool size and reconstitution capacity in Atm-deficient HSCs. Based on these genetic analyses, we conclude that p38MAPK is not simply harmful against aging-related stress but functions as a multimodal factor depending on the context of HSC aging in vivo. First, we investigated onset of HSC aging in WT mice to select time points appropriate for analysis of HSC aging in p38αΔ/Δ mice. To do this, we evaluated the number of long-term HSC (LT-HSC) in the BM, along with expression of CD41 and P-selectin (expression of these molecules correlates positively with aging) (17Gekas C. Graf T. CD41 expression marks myeloid-biased adult hematopoietic stem cells and increases with age.Blood. 2013; 121: 4463-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Chambers S.M. Shaw C.A. Gatza C. Fisk C.J. Donehower L.A. Goodell M.A. Aging hematopoietic stem cells decline in function and exhibit epigenetic dysregulation.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5e201Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The number of LT-HSC and expression of CD41 and P-selectin were significantly higher in 1-year-old mice than in 8-week-old mice (Fig. S1, A–C). Moreover, progression of the HSC aging phenotype (including cell numbers and aging markers) in 2-year-old mice was greater than that in 8-week-old and 1-year-old mice (Fig. S1, A–C). These results suggest that HSCs acquire the aging phenotype gradually rather than at a certain time; therefore, we selected both 1- and 2-year-old p38αΔ/Δ mice for analysis of p38MAPK function during the early and late progression phases of HSC aging. To determine p38MAPK function during aging in vivo, we analyzed the effect of conditional loss of p38α, the major isozyme in hematopoietic cells (16Karigane D. Kobayashi H. Morikawa T. Ootomo Y. Sakai M. Nagamatsu G. Kubota Y. Goda N. Matsumoto M. Nishimura E.K. Soga T. Otsu K. Suematsu M. Okamoto S. Suda T. et al.p38alpha activates purine metabolism to initiate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cycling in response to stress.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 192-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in CAG (chicken β-actin promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer)-CreERT2:p38αflox/flox (p38αfl/fl) mice. To investigate the early progression phase of aging (from young to 1 year old), we deleted p38α (p38αΔ/Δ) from 6- to 10-week-old p38αfl/fl mice by i.p. injection of tamoxifen (TAM) and then analyzed hematopoiesis at approximately 1 year of age (50–60 weeks) (Fig. 1A). First, we analyzed steady-state hematopoiesis and found that p38αΔ/Δ mice had significantly fewer B cells than controls; however, the percentage of granulocytes in the peripheral blood (PB) was higher than that in controls (Fig. 1B). Differentiation status in the BM, spleen, and thymus of p38αΔ/Δ mice was, however, normal (Figs. 1C and S1, D and E). Next, we tested the functional capacity of p38αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs by performing serial BMT. Donor-derived PB chimerism in p38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients was almost identical to that observed in recipients of p38α+/+ cells (Fig. 1D), and the differentiation status of donor-derived PB cells did not differ significantly between the groups (Fig. 1E). However, donor-derived BM chimerism was significantly lower in p38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients than in p38α+/+ cell–transplanted recipients (Fig. 1F). After secondary transplantation, we observed significantly lower levels of PB chimerism in the p38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted group than in the p38α+/+ cell–transplanted group (Fig. 1G). Analysis of differentiation status indicated that donor-derived PB cells in p38αΔ/Δ mice showed lower myeloid chimerism and higher T cell chimerism than those in p38α+/+ cell–transplanted recipients (Fig. 1H). Donor-derived BM chimerism was also significantly lower in p38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients than in p38α+/+ cell–transplanted recipients (Fig. 1I). Moreover, after tertiary transplantation, p38αΔ/Δ cells were rarely detected in recipient mice (Fig. 1J). These results suggest that p38MAPK activity maintains HSC repopulation capacity and multipotency after transplantation during the early progression phase of chronological aging. To evaluate the phenotypes associated with the late progression phase of chronological aging, we attempted to generate 2-year-old p38αΔ/Δ mice that had been treated with TAM at around 10 weeks of age. However, this was not possible because the mice did not survive to an age of 2 years (Fig. S2A). Therefore, we injected p38αfl/fl mice aged approximately 1 year (50–60 weeks) with TAM to delete p38α and then analyzed those mice and corresponding controls 1 year later (i.e., at 2 years of age) (Fig. 2A). Deletion of p38α from mice injected with TAM at approximately 1 year of age was confirmed by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed when the p38αΔ/Δ and control mice reached 2 years of age. The results showed that p38α expression in p38αΔ/Δ was up to 70% lower than that in p38α+/+ mice (Fig. S2B). Evaluation of steady-state hematopoiesis in p38αΔ/Δ and control p38α+/+ mice indicated comparable differentiation status and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) numbers in PB, BM, spleen, and thymus (Figs. 2, B and C and S2, C–I). We then tested functional capacity of HSCs from mutant and control mice by performing serial BMT. Donor-derived PB and BM chimerism and differentiation status in primary recipients did not differ significantly between genotypes (Figs. 2, D–F and S2J). By contrast, after secondary BMT, p38αΔ/Δ mice showed comparable differentiation status in PB but higher relative PB chimerism than did the control p38α+/+ cell–transplanted group (Figs. 2, G and H and S2K). Furthermore, p38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted groups showed higher BM chimerism of multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) and a greater degree of differentiation in secondary recipients (Fig. 2I), supporting the idea that p38α deletion improves overall repopulation capacity after transplantation in the later phase of aging. Expression levels of p16Ink4a and p19Arf, tumor suppressors that are reportedly activated in stressed HSCs (13Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. Suda T. Reactive oxygen species act through p38 MAPK to limit the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), did not differ between p38α+/+ and p38αΔ/Δ HSCs at steady state or after secondary BMT (Fig. S2, L and M). These results suggest that p38MAPK activity decreases HSC repopulation capacity after transplantation in the late progression phase of chronological aging. Because the effect of p38α on HSC regulation changes with age, we compared expression of p38MAPK isozymes in LT-HSCs at different time points during aging. We found that expression of p38α did not change with age (Fig. 3A). However, we found that expression of p38γ (Mapk12) and p38δ (Mapk13) was higher in old HSCs than in young and middle-aged HSCs, even though relative expression levels (i.e., compared with that of the internal control gene) were quite low (Fig. S3A). To evaluate changes in p38MAPK gene expression patterns with age, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of young (10 weeks), middle-aged (1 year), and old (2 years) LT-HSCs using transcriptome data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE151333). Gene sets related to p38MAPK downstream pathways were significantly enriched in old HSCs compared with middle-aged HSCs; however, there was no difference between young and middle-aged HSCs (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that p38MAPK signaling increases with age, especially between middle and old age. Next, we investigated potential transcriptional changes related to p38α function during aging. Heat map analysis identified age-related differentially expressed genes (Fig. S3, B and C and Tables S1 and S2). In addition, principal component analysis indicated that HSCs display different transcriptomic landscapes at different time points (Fig. 3C). Transcriptional differences identified by principal component analysis were clearly characterized by principal component 1, which mediates inflammatory responses and cytokine production (Fig. 3D). GSEA also showed that many gene sets, including those related to the MAPK pathway and inflammatory pathways, are enriched in old HSCs compared with middle-aged HSCs (Fig. S3D). Notably, gene sets related to inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon responses, were significantly enriched in old to middle-aged HSCs but not in middle-aged and young HSCs (Figs. 3, E and F and S3E). These findings indicate that aging is not a linear event, and that inflammation is activated to a greater extent in the phase from middle to old age than in the phase from young to middle age. Studies show that p38MAPK triggers production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 upon stress stimulation (19Wagner E.F. Nebreda A.R. Signal integration by JNK and p38 MAPK pathways in cancer development.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 20Cuenda A. Rousseau S. p38 MAP-kinases pathway regulation, function and role in human diseases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1358-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that p38MAPK, especially p38α, is responsible for activating inflammatory signaling in hematopoietic cells in old mice. To address this hypothesis, we performed transcriptome analysis of LT-HSCs collected from 2-year-old p38α+/+ and p38αΔ/Δ mice and examined the effects of p38α on inflammation. For these analyses, experiments with p38αΔ/Δ mice were conducted within the time frame shown in Figure 2A. We found that p38αΔ/Δ HSCs showed significantly lower expression of p38MAPK pathway–related genes than p38α+/+ HSCs (Fig. S3F). Gene sets related to TNF responses, interferon responses, and other inflammatory pathways were downregulated in p38αΔ/Δ HSCs compared with p38α+/+ HSCs (Figs. 3, G and H and S3G). In addition, gene expression of aged HSC markers was significantly downregulated, and that of young HSC markers was significantly upregulated, in p38αΔ/Δ HSCs compared with p38α+/+ HSCs (Fig. 3I and Table S3) (21Wahlestedt M. Norddahl G.L. Sten G. Ugale A. Frisk M.A. Mattsson R. Deierborg T. Sigvardsson M. Bryder D. An epigenetic component of hematopoietic stem cell aging amenable to reprogramming into a young state.Blood. 2013; 121: 4257-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that p38α deficiency alters expression of gene programs associated with HSC aging and inflammation and results in protection of HSC aging during the late progression phase of chronological aging. We next employed a different model to investigate how p38α loss affects HSCs under pathological conditions such as progeria syndrome. The gene Atm is reportedly responsible for ataxia–telangiectasia in humans, and Atm knockout mice show some premature aging-like phenotypes, such as decreased survival and increased expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in some organs (22Nitta E. Yamashita M. Hosokawa K. Xian M. Takubo K. Arai F. Nakada S. Suda T. Telomerase reverse transcriptase protects ATM-deficient hematopoietic stem cells from ROS-induced apoptosis through a telomere-independent mechanism.Blood. 2011; 117: 4169-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether conditional Atm-deficient (CAG-CreERT2) HSCs phenocopy the germ line Atm-deficient HSCs, we focused on DNA repair, as there are reports that germ line Atm loss impairs DNA repair in HSCs (2Li T. Zhou Z.W. Ju Z. Wang Z.Q. DNA damage response in hematopoietic stem cell ageing.Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2016; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K. Nakagata N. Ikeda Y. Mak T.W. Suda T. Regulation of oxidative stress by ATM is required for self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2004; 431: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and analyzed DNA damage accumulation by counting phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX) and tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci in AtmΔ/Δ and WT HSCs 1 week after transplantation. The number of respective γH2AX and 53BP1 foci was significantly increased in AtmΔ/Δ HSCs relative to controls, suggesting that Atm loss impairs DNA repair similarly to the germ line Atm loss (Fig. 4, A–C). Here, to assess p38MAPK function in Atm-deficient mice, we compared phenotypes seen in CAG-CreERT2::Atmflox/flox (Atmfl/fl) and CAG-CreERT2::Atmfl/flp38αfl/fl mice. To do so, we injected TAM into age-matched 6- to 20-week-old mice of both genotypes to delete floxed genes in respective mice, hereafter referred to as AtmΔ/Δ and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ mice, and then analyzed phenotypes at 10 to 25 weeks of age (Fig. 4D). TAM-administered Cre(−)::Atmfl/fl or Atmfl/flp38αfl/fl mice (Atm+/+ or Atm+/+p38α+/+) served as controls. We first focused on steady-state hematopoiesis. Differentiation status in PB and cell number in BM were almost identical in all three genotypes (Figs. 4E and S4A). However, we observed a significant decrease in LT-HSC subsets both in AtmΔ/Δ and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ relative to control mice (Fig. 4F and S4B). Furthermore, relative to controls, frequencies of MPP subsets and short-term HSCs were significantly reduced in AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ mice and more mildly in AtmΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 4F and S4B). Next, we performed serial BMT to assess LT-HSC repopulating ability in these models. Differentiation status was comparable, but donor-derived PB chimerism in AtmΔ/Δ and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients was significantly lower than the control Atm+/+p38α+/+ cell–transplanted group (Figs. 4G and S4C). Donor-derived BM chimerism of AtmΔ/Δ and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients showed trends similar to those in PB cells and did not differ significantly from primary BMT (Fig. 4J). PB trends similar to primary BMT were also seen in secondary and tertiary BMTs (Fig. 4, H and I). Furthermore, we observed lower relative PB and BM chimerism in AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ relative to AtmΔ/Δ cell–transplanted recipients (Fig. 4K). Similarly, donor-derived PB cells showed lower T cell chimerism in AtmΔ/Δ relative to control Atm+/+p38α+/+ cell recipients and much lower T cell chimerism in AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ relative to AtmΔ/Δ (Fig. S4D). These results show that although Atm loss compromises HSC number and function, p38α has a protective function in AtmΔ/Δ mice, resulting in further HSC dysfunction in double knockout. Previous studies report that activation of p38MAPK in HSCs induces HSC defects in AtmΔ/Δ mice by increasing production of ROS and subsequently upregulating p16Ink4a and p19Arf (13Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. Suda T. Reactive oxygen species act through p38 MAPK to limit the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether ROS production and p16Ink4a and p19Arf activation occurred following Atm deletion in vivo in both p38α WT and mutant backgrounds. Flow cytometric and qPCR analyses showed that ROS production and p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression were comparable in AtmΔ/Δ, AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ, and control HSCs (Figs. 5, A and B and S5, A and B). ROS-p16Ink4a/p19Arf signaling reportedly disrupts cell cycle quiescence in HSCs (24Ju Z. Zhang J. Gao Y. Cheng T. Telomere dysfunction and cell cycle checkpoints in hematopoietic stem cell aging.Int. J. Hematol. 2011; 94: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed cell cycle status in AtmΔ/Δ and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ HSCs using Ki67 staining. However, frequencies of Ki67-negative quiescent (G0) cells were unchanged in AtmΔ/Δ and Atm+/+ HSCs (Fig. 5C). By contrast, frequencies of Ki67-negative cells were significantly lower in AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ relative to Atm+/+p38α+/+ cells (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that ROS-p16Ink4/p19Arf signaling is not activated in vivo by Atm deletion in HSCs. Next, to determine whether p38MAPK activation is induced after Atm deficiency, we measured phospholyrated-p38MAPK (pp38MAPK) levels in AtmΔ/Δ LT-HSC and non-HSCs at steady state. Phosflow analysis revealed that pp38MAPK levels were unchanged relative to WT controls in AtmΔ/Δ HSCs and non-HSCs at steady state (Figs. 5E and S5C). A previous study reported that p38α activation in HSPCs occurs immediately after hematological stress and returns to normal levels in a short period (16Karigane D. Kobayashi H. Morikawa T. Ootomo Y. Sakai M. Nagamatsu G. Kubota Y. Goda N. Matsumoto M. Nishimura E.K. Soga T. Otsu K. Suematsu M. Okamoto S. Suda T. et al.p38alpha activates purine metabolism to initiate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cycling in response to stress.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 192-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated pp38MAPK levels in AtmΔ/Δ and Atm+/+ HSPCs at 3 and 7 days after BMT using phosflow. pp38MAPK levels were significantly higher in AtmΔ/Δ LT-HSC at day 3, but no significant difference was observed between two genotypes at 7 days following transplantation (Figs. 5F and S5, C and D). These results suggested that, after conditional deletion of Atm, activation of p38MAPK or ROS-p16Ink4/p19Arf signaling is unchanged in steady state, whereas activation of p38MAPK is increased in Atm-deficient HSCs after transplantation. Finally, to determine how p38α functions in AtmΔ/Δ HSCs, we performed transcriptome analysis of HSCs collected from 11-week control Atm+/+ (WT), AtmΔ/Δ, and AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ mice to identify genes upregulated or downregulated in mutant genotypes (Fig. 5G). Expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses was not enriched in AtmΔ/Δ HSCs (data not shown), although physiologically aged HSCs (2 years old) showed higher expression of genes related to inflammatory responses (Fig. 3, D–F). We confirmed that p38α suppresses transcriptional signatures associated with the inflammatory responses and TNFα responses independent of Atm deficiency (Fig. 5, H and I). Also, p38α deficiency was associated with loss of HSC markers and gain of lineage markers relative to both WT and AtmΔ/Δ HSCs, suggesting that p38α maintains stemness independently of Atm deficiency (Fig. 5, J and K). In addition, loss of p38α upregulated genes involved in the PI3K/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway (compared with expression in WT and AtmΔ/Δ HSCs) (Fig. 5L). Taken together, these findings suggest that p38α promotes inflammation and maintains HSC function independently of Atm deficiency, and that these transcriptional changes support the results of defects in AtmΔ/Δp38αΔ/Δ HSCs (Fig. 4, F–K). Organismal aging is a multifaceted process mediated in part by aging of somatic stem cells. In hematopoiesis, HSC aging is characterized by cellular phenotypes, including increased pool size, defective transplantation capacity, skewing of differentiation, and reduced clonality (4de Haan G.

The molecular basis of these changes in aged HSCs has been investigated in recent years. In terms of cell-autonomous mechanisms, accumulation of DNA damage, telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, epigenetic reprogramming, and loss of cellular polarity are implicated in HSC aging (4de Haan G.

These stochastic recombination events have a direct impact on gene dosage and foster the selection of adaptive traits in response to environmental pressure. We provide here such an example by showing that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene knockout (Δpepck) leads to the selection of a deletion event between two tandemly arranged fumarate reductase (FRDg and FRDm2) genes to produce a chimeric FRDg-m2 gene in the Δpepck∗ cell line. FRDg is expressed in peroxisome-related organelles, named glycosomes, expression of FRDm2 has not been detected to date, and FRDg-m2 is nonfunctional and cytosolic. Re-expression of FRDg significantly impaired growth of the Δpepck∗ cells, but FRD enzyme activity was not required for this negative effect. Instead, glycosomal localization as well as the covalent flavinylation motif of FRD is required to confer growth retardation and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The data suggest that FRDg, similar to Escherichia coli FRD, can generate ROS in a flavin-dependent process by transfer of electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen instead of fumarate when the latter is unavailable, as in the Δpepck background. Hence, growth retardation is interpreted as a consequence of increased production of ROS, and rearrangement of the FRD locus liberates Δpepck∗ cells from this obstacle. Interestingly, intracellular production of ROS has been shown to be required to complete the parasitic cycle in the insect vector, suggesting that FRDg may play a role in this process.

Trypanosomatids, including the human infective Leishmania and Trypanosoma species, present several biological singularities in comparison with classical eukaryotic model organisms. For instance, genes are transcribed constitutively as part of long polycistronic units where the precursor mRNA molecules are matured by coupled trans-splicing and polyadenylation (1Clayton C.E. Gene expression in Kinetoplastids.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2016; 32: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a consequence, gene regulation occurs mostly at the posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels with no control at the level of transcription initiation. Changes in gene copy number can also modulate gene expression and are therefore seen when selective pressure is applied. They usually arise from homologous recombination events between repeated sequences and are particularly common in Leishmania spp (2Ubeda J.M. Raymond F. Mukherjee A. Plourde M. Gingras H. Roy G. Lapointe A. Leprohon P. Papadopoulou B. Corbeil J. Ouellette M. Genome-wide stochastic adaptive DNA amplification at direct and inverted DNA repeats in the parasite Leishmania.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12e1001868Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Leishmania, small repetitive sequences are widespread throughout the genome and recombination events appear stochastically with a frequency in the order of 10−6/10−7 per cell generation. They result either in the production of extrachromosomal DNA sequences or in the deletion of the DNA fragment located between the two recombinogenic repeats. Under selection pressure, such as exposition to drugs, a subpopulation with an advantageous amplicon conferring drug resistance can emerge (3Garvey E.P. Santi D.V.

The genome of Trypanosoma brucei also contains a large number of sequence repeats (773) potentially leading to 1848 genetic recombination events, some of them already experimentally validated (2Ubeda J.M.

We report here the selection of such a stochastic deletion in the genome of T. brucei mutants, which is driven by metabolic constraints. The procyclic form (PCF) of T. brucei has an elaborate energy metabolism based on glucose or proline, depending on carbon source availability (13Lamour N. Riviere L. Coustou V. Coombs G.H.

In the glucose-free environment of its insect host (tsetse fly), the parasite depends on proline for its metabolism (14Coustou V. Biran M. Breton M. Guegan F. Riviere L. Plazolles N. Nolan D.

Two phosphoenolpyruvate-producing enzymes, PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK, EC: 4.1.1.32, Tb927.2.4210) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK, EC 2.7.9.1, Tb927.11.3120) have a redundant function for the essential gluconeogenesis from proline (17Wargnies M.

In glucose-rich conditions, PPDK and PEPCK work in the opposite direction to produce pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively, in addition to ATP. This pathway is also essential to maintain the glycosomal redox balance (18Deramchia K. Morand P. Biran M. Millerioux Y. Mazet M. Wargnies M. Franconi J.M. Bringaud F.

Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles using the same machinery for protein import and harbor the 6 or 7 first glycolytic steps (19Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Spits H. Particle-bound enzymes in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because of the impermeability of the glycosomal membrane to bulky metabolites, such as cofactors and nucleotides, ATP molecules consumed by the first glycolytic steps (steps 1 and 3 in Fig. 1) need to be regenerated in the glycosomes by PPDK and PEPCK (step 14 and 15) (18Deramchia K.

Similarly, NAD+ molecules consumed in the glycosomes during glycolysis (step 6) have to be regenerated within the organelle by the succinic fermentation pathway composed of PEPCK, malate dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.37, Tb927.10.15410, step 16), fumarase (EC: 4.2.1.2, Tb927.10.15410, step 17), and NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (FRDg, EC: 1.3.1.6, Tb927.5.930, step 18) (20Ebikeme C.

Alternatively, the glycosomal redox balance can be maintained by the glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly3P)/dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) shuttle, as observed for the PEPCK null mutant (Δpepck) and illustrated in Figure 1B (20Ebikeme C.

The third gene, located on chromosome 10, codes for the mitochondrial isoform (FRDm1, Tb927.10.3650, step 21) (21Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F.

FRDg is a 120 kDa protein composed of three domains, a N-terminal ApbE (Alternative pyrimidine biosynthesis protein)-like flavin transferase domain (pfam: PF02424), a central FRD domain (superfamily: SSF56425), and a C-terminal cytochrome b5 reductase (Cytb5R) domain (superfamily: SSF63380) (21Besteiro S.

In addition, FRDg has a conserved flavinylation motif at its extreme N terminus, shown to be required for FRD activity in the related organism Leptomonas pyrrhocoris (23Serebryakova M.V.

Catalytically important flavin linked through a phosphoester bond in a eukaryotic fumarate reductase.Biochimie. 2018; 149: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We report here that two independent PEPCK null mutant cell lines express a chimeric nonfunctional FRDg-m2 isoform resulting from homologous recombination within the FRDg/FRDm2 locus. The selective advantage provided by the loss of the FRDg gene in the context of the PEPCK null background depends on the glycosomal localization of FRDg and the presence of the N-terminal putative flavinylation site. We propose that the absence of metabolic flux through the glycosomal succinic fermentation pathway in PEPCK null mutants made the FAD/FMN cofactors of FRDg available to oxygen for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the organelles. In order to study possible changes in gene expression of mutants missing key enzymes involved in the maintenance of the glycosomal redox and ATP/ADP balances, we have compared the total proteomes of the parental, Δppdk (24Coustou V.

The effectiveness of this approach was confirmed by the 41.7–54.0-fold reduction observed for the PPDK and/or PEPCK peptide counts in the four mutant cell lines analyzed, compared with the parental cell line (see Fig. 2A, for the parental and Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH.i cell lines and the PXD020185 data set on the ProteomeXchange Consortium repository for the other cell lines). Similarly, the GPDH signal was strongly reduced (20.4-fold) in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH.i mutant. This analysis also showed that expressions of FRDg and FRDm2 were 6.9-fold decreased and tenfold increased, respectively, in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH.i cell line, while expression of FRDm1 was not affected (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of the three FRD isoforms remained unaffected in the three other mutant cell lines (PXD020185 data set on the ProteomeXchange Consortium). This FRD expression pattern was confirmed by western blotting using immune sera specific to FRDg (αFRDg) and FRDm2 (αFRDm2), in addition to the αFRD immune serum produced against the conserved FRDg central domain, which is 100% and 71% identical with FRDm2 and FRDm1, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The αFRD antibodies recognized two proteins in both the parental and Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH.i cell lines, including the ∼130 kDa FRDm1 isoform (Fig. 2, D and E). As previously reported, the second isoform expressed in the parental cell line (∼120 kDa) was recognized by the αFRDg, while no signal corresponding to FRDm2 was detected using αFRDm2 (24Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. ATP generation in the Trypanosoma brucei procyclic form: Cytosolic substrate level phosphorylation is essential, but not oxidative phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ∼115 kDa protein expressed in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH.i cell line was recognized by αFRDm2, but not αFRDg. This suggests that the mutant cell line switched from FRDg to FRDm2 expression, although the apparent size of the detected FRDm2 isoform was higher than the theoretical one (∼115 versus 94.8 kDa). Coomassie staining, western blotting (Fig. 2E), and proteomic analyses (Fig. 2A) of purified glycosomal fractions confirmed the glycosomal localization of FRDg expressed in the parental cell line. In contrast, none of the FRD isoforms were detectable by western blot in the glycosomal fractions of the mutant cell line, which is consistent with the proteomic analyses. To determine whether the mutually exclusive expression of FRDg and FRDm2 was related to genomic rearrangement inside the FRDg/FRDm2 locus, a Southern blot analysis was conducted using as probe the conserved FRDg/FRDm2 central domain, which hybridizes with the FRDm1 gene (""1"" in Fig. 3A) but gives a much stronger signal for the FRDg and FRDm2 genes (""g"" and ""2"" in Fig. 3A). The restriction pattern obtained with the NcoI-, PvuII-, NdeI-, and XhoI-digested parental genomic DNA (Fig. 3A) was consistent with the restriction map of the FRDm1 (Fig. 3B) and FRDg/FRDm2 (Fig. 3C) loci deduced from the T. brucei TriTrypDB database (strain 927). Although the FRDm1 locus was identical in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH genome, the pattern observed for the FRDg/FRDm2 locus differed markedly (Fig. 3A). For instance, the 6.4 kb PvuII-fragment containing the two FRD genes in the parental genome was converted into a 2.3 kb PvuII-fragment in the mutant genome, suggesting that 4.1 kb had been deleted from the FRDg/FRDm2 locus. Analysis of the three other restriction profiles led to the same conclusion. The size of the deleted DNA fragment (4.1 kb) was consistent with the size of the theoretical DNA fragment (4074 bp) resulting from homologous recombination between the central 1450 bp FRD domains, which are 100% identical in the FRDg and FRDm2 genes. In conclusion, these data showed that a recombination event occurred between the FRDg and FRDm2 genes in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH mutant to generate a FRDg-m2 chimeric gene coding for a FRD chimeric protein slightly smaller than FRDg (theoretical molecular weights: 120.6 versus 123.5 kDa, respectively). This DNA rearrangement event was present on both alleles of the locus, since the wild-type FRDg and FRDm2-amplified DNA fragments (Fig. 3C) and the endogenous FRDg protein (Fig. 2D) were not detectable in the mutant cell line. To further study this DNA rearrangement event, we used PCR with primer pairs designed for amplification of the central FRD domain of the FRDg (g5 and g3 primers), FRDm2 (m5 and m3 primers), and FRDg-m2 (g5 and m3 primers) genes (see Fig. 4A). As expected, the FRDg- and FRDm2-specific DNA fragments were amplified from the parental EATRO1125.T7T cell line but not from the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH genomic DNA (Fig. 4, B and C), confirming the loss of the wild-type FRDg/FRDm2 locus in the mutant cell population. Also in agreement with the Southern blot data, the FRDg-m2-specific fragment was amplified from the mutant genomic DNA. Interestingly, however, the FRDg-m2-specific fragment was also very weakly PCR-amplified from the parental EATRO1125.T7T cell line, which suggests that the recombination event stochastically occurred in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, a 1.5 kb PCR product was obtained using parental DNA and the g3 and m5 primers; we suggest that the template was a circularized version of the deleted fragment (Fig. 4, A–C). No corresponding PCR product was detected in the mutant cell line, suggesting that the circularized deleted DNA fragment was not replicated and thus diluted during cell division to become undetectable. The same PCR analysis conducted on genomic DNA samples showed that the rearrangement event occurred in other strains of T. brucei (Trypanosoma equiperdum, T. b. brucei, and T. b. rhodesiense) (Fig. 4B). We took advantage of the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell line being homozygous for the FRDg-m2 recombinant locus to calculate the allele frequency of FRDg-m2 in the EATRO1125.T7T parental cell line. We compared the FRDg-m2 copy number in the two lines by semiquantitative PCR using different amounts of genomic DNA and the g5-m3 primer pair. Primers specific for a control gene (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Tb927.9.8720) were used for normalization (Fig. 5A). The results showed that the FRDg-m2 gene copy number is 3700-times higher in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH homogeneous cell line relative to the heterogeneous parental population (Fig. 5B), indicating that at the time of analysis one in 1850 cells in the parental population had a hemizygous recombined allele. This estimation is at best an upper limit since we cannot exclude PCR artifacts due to premature termination of the PCR product in the conserved region of one isoform followed by priming on the other isoform. Altogether, this analysis suggested that the generation of the FRDg-m2 chimeric gene occurs at low frequency by homologous recombination in the T. brucei genome, but was specifically selected in the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell line. Analysis of the Δpepck mutant obtained and frozen in 2008 (20Ebikeme C. Hubert J. Biran M. Gouspillou G. Morand P. Plazolles N. Guegan F. Diolez P. Franconi J.M. Portais J.C. Bringaud F.

It is noteworthy that this Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell line was not derived from the Δpepck cell line (see Fig. 4E). Indeed, the Δpepck and the parental cells showed the same PCR profile, while the Δpepck∗ cells maintained for a long term in in vitro culture showed a pattern similar to the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell line. Therefore, selection of the recombinant allele occurred independently in a second mutant cell line (Fig. 4C). However, the selection process was probably less stringent or more recent in the PEPCK null background compared with the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH background, as illustrated by the presence of the wild-type locus in the Δpepck∗ population (g5-g3 and m5-m3 primer pairs in Fig. 4C), even after months of growth. As expected from the PCR analysis, the FRDg-m2 chimeric isoform was expressed in the Δpepck∗ cell line, but not detectable by western blotting in the Δpepck cells (Fig. 4D). It is noteworthy that proteomics analysis performed on the Δpepck cell line before long-term cultivation showed an intermediate profile of FRD isoform expression between the parental and the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell lines (PXD020185 data set on the ProteomeXchange Consortium). These data strongly suggest selection for the FRDg-m2 recombinant locus when PEPCK is missing (Fig. 4E). The glycosomal localization of FRDg was confirmed by a digitonin cell fractionation experiment. Western blot analysis of the supernatant fractions confirmed that as expected, the FRDg isoform was released together with the PPDK and PEPCK glycosomal markers (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the FRDg-m2 chimeric isoform expressed in the Δpepck∗ cell line was released at lower digitonin concentrations (0.03 mg versus 0.14 mg of digitonin per mg of protein) together with the enolase cytosolic marker (Fig. 6A). The cytosolic location of the FRDg-m2 chimeric isoform expressed in the Δpepck∗ cell line was confirmed by a western blot analysis of glycosomal and cytosolic fractions prepared by differential centrifugation after silicon carbide cell homogenization (Fig. 6B). The NADH-dependent FRD (NADH-FRD) activity was determined in the glycosomal and cytosolic fractions of the original EATRO1125.T7T and the Δpepck∗ cell lines. As expected, NADH-FRD activity was detected in the glycosomal fraction of cells expressing FRDg (EATRO1125.T7T), but not in the glycosomes of the Δpepck∗ cell line (Fig. 6B). The low level of NADH-FRD activity detected in the cytosolic fraction of the EATRO1125.T7T cell line, compared with the glycosomal fraction (2.3%), was presumably due to the lysis of a few glycosomes during the grinding step. The absence of NADH-FRD activity in the cytosolic fraction of the Δpepck∗ cell line demonstrates that the chimeric FRDg-m2 isoform is inactive (Fig. 6B). These data highlight the role of the Cytb5R domain in the NADH-FRD activity, since only this domain differs between the active FRDg and inactive FRDg-m2 isoforms. Selection of the FRDg-m2 recombinant locus in the Δpepck∗ and Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell lines implied that either expression of the FRDg-m2 isoform in the cytosol or abolition of FRDg expression in the glycosomes provided a selective advantage to both mutant cell lines. To determine which of these two hypotheses is correct, tetracycline-inducible ectopic expression of FRDg and RNAi-mediated downregulation of FRDg-m2 were performed in the Δpepck∗ cell line (Δpepck∗/OEFRDg and Δpepck∗/RNAiFRDg-m2, respectively) (Fig. 7A). These experiments could not be conducted with the Δppdk/Δpepck/RNAiGPDH cell line, because all five available selectable markers had already been used. The glycosomal localization of the recombinant FRDg in the Δpepck∗/OEFRDg.i line was confirmed by western blotting and enzymatic activity assay of glycosomal fractions (Fig. 6B). The doubling time of the Δpepck∗/RNAiFRDg-m2 cell population was identical in the absence (.ni) or the presence (.i) of tetracycline, indicating that expression of the FRDg-m2 chimera was well tolerated by the Δpepck∗ mutant. In contrast, induction of FR"
https://openalex.org/W3136575306,"An aberrant accumulation of nuclear β-catenin is closely associated with the augmentation of cancer malignancy. In this work, we report that several microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) such as vinblastine, taxol, and C12 (combretastatin-2-aminoimidazole analog) inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We showed that the inhibition of microtubule dynamics by MTAs decreased the level of β-catenin by increasing Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli levels and reducing the level of dishevelled. Furthermore, MTAs strongly reduced the localization of β-catenin in the nucleus. The reduction in the level of nuclear β-catenin was neither due to the degradation of β-catenin in the nucleus nor due to an increase in the export of nuclear β-catenin from the nucleus. A motor protein kinesin-2 was found to assist the nuclear transportation of β-catenin. Interestingly, Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonist treatment synergized with MTAs and the activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonized with the MTAs. C12 potently suppressed the growth of 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced OSCC in the tongue of C57 black 6 mice and also abrogated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the tumor. Our results provide evidence that the decrease in Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an important antitumor effect of MTAs and the combined use of MTAs with Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonists could be a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy."

Measuring scientific success has traditionally involved numbers and statistics. However, due to an increasingly uncertain world, more than ever we need to measure the effect that science has on real-world scenarios. We asked researchers to share their points of view on what scientific impact means to them and how impact matters beyond the numbers. What does “scientific impact” mean to me? When I was a graduate student in the mid-1990s, I measured it by peer-reviewed journal articles, talks, and citations. But “impact” has since come to mean something quite different to me. When my co-authors and I published our original “hockey stick” article in 1998, presenting the now-iconic curve demonstrating the unprecedented planetary warming we have caused over the past century, I soon found myself in an unrecognizable realm—one where facts, logic, and reason no longer prevailed. The “hockey stick” was inconvenient to fossil fuel interests because it laid bare the threat of human-caused climate change and our continued addiction to fossil fuels. So, they—and their abettors—did their best to discredit it, through right-wing media outlets, hostile congressional hearings, investigations by fossil fuel-friendly politicians, and threats against my livelihood and life (I recount the details in The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars). In the process of defending myself and my work, I have ultimately become a public figure and spend much of my time now communicating the science of climate change and its implications to the public and policymakers through speaking engagements, op-eds and commentaries, and numerous media interviews. While it is not quite the career path I originally signed up for, I’ve come to embrace this opportunity to inform the larger conversation about the greatest challenge we face as a civilization. This is how I now define my scientific impact. Reflecting on scientific impact has led me to the realization that my appreciation of “impact” has almost come full circle since I first heard the term as an undergraduate, though my thoughts on the subject have definitely developed! As a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed microbiology student, I thought all the work we did could and should have impact, particularly for improving human health. What I did not appreciate until later, however, was that in some cases this may takes years, or even decades, but without fundamental blue-sky research we cannot make great leaps. The SAR-CoV-2 pandemic provides a terrible but perfect example of basic science underpinning the incredible and rapid advances in studying, tracking, and developing new vaccines against the virus. At the beginning of my independent career, I initially found having to write grant impact statements a mundane task, as I only wanted to write and do the “science.” Quickly though, I realized that understanding where the proposal could lead is a central component of scientific work, and an early appreciation of this may lead to more impactful work. I also now appreciate that impact can take many forms, for example, by bringing a microbiome therapy to the clinic; by creating a company, based on the basic science, that has economic and employment impact; through training and mentoring team members; and even by inspiring the next generation of scientists through effective communication and public engagement. All of these “impacts” have helped me to appreciate what is possible. This may be the most important decade of our generation—we have but 10 years to not only halt climate change but also to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Consequently, 2021 is an important year to review conservation progress and develop the 2030 Kunming Biodiversity Targets. Technology has revolutionized our capacity to track threats to biodiversity on land, but the oceans remain vast and inscrutable. Our understanding of marine biodiversity is often biased toward either the most charismatic species or those we have killed and eaten. We have fisheries assessments for only around 350 species, and fisheries catches are often crudely identified. Data from fisheries, and other sources, are used to derive IUCN Red List Assessments (http://www.iucnredlist.org) that distill the natural history, threats, conservation actions, and extinction risk of each species. These hard-won Red List Assessments provide the scientific basis for conservation priority setting and fisheries management. Repeated assessments can track the decline or recovery of species, forming the foundation for the Red List Index used by nations to track their progress toward the 2030 targets. One of the three lineages of fishes—sharks and rays—has now been assessed twice, in 2008 and 2020. Through these assessments, we may finally have the data to lift the lid on the oceans. However, because it is people that drive change, real-world impact will come from forging a consensus in the community about each species’ status. The conservation community, through their knowledge and actions, will shape the very future of life on earth and in our oceans."
