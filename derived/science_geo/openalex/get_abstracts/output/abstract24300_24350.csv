https://openalex.org/W2100025521,"The Viviparous-1 (Vp1) gene of maize is specifically required for expression of the maturation program in seed development. We show that Vp1 encodes a 73,335 dalton protein with no detectable homology to known proteins. An acidic transcriptional activation sequence was identified by fusion to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Expression of VP1 in maize protoplasts resulted in strong activation (greater than 130-fold) of a reporter gene fused to the promoter of a presumptive target gene. The acidic domain in VP1 was essential for transactivation and could be functionally replaced by the activator sequence of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein. Our results indicate that VP1 is a novel transcription factor possibly involved in potentiation of a seed-specific hormone response."

https://openalex.org/W1656991593,"Occupancy of integrin receptors induces conformational changes in the receptor, resulting in exposure of novel interactive sites termed ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS). We report here that Fab fragments of certain antibodies against LIBS on integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) block platelet aggregation. Thus, certain LIBS or the regions surrounding them may participate in events required for platelet aggregation. In addition, certain anti-alpha IIb beta 3 LIBS Fab fragments stimulated platelet aggregation. This was due to induction of fg binding to alpha IIb beta 3, apparently by shifting a conformational equilibrium between a resting and an activated state of alpha IIb beta 3. Some of the activating anti-LIBS Fab fragments also induced high affinity fibronectin binding to alpha IIb beta 3, whereas others did not. Thus, changes in the conformation of this integrin modulate both the specificity and affinity of ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2044578185,"Human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and has also been suggested to be involved in other diseases such as chronic arthritis or myelopathy. To elucidate pathological roles of the virus in disease, transgenic mice were produced that carry the HTLV-I genome. At 2 to 3 months of age, many of the mice developed chronic arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial and periarticular inflammation with articular erosion caused by invasion of granulation tissues were marked. These observations suggest a possibility that HTLV-I is one of the etiologic agents of chronic arthritis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1973981488,"Animals process sensory information according to specific computational rules and, subsequently, form representations of their environments that form the basis for decisions and choices. The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2042157210,"A novel activity (USA) stimulated activator-dependent transcription in a reconstituted system in conjunction with natural TFIID, resulting in 10- to 50-fold levels of induction by regulatory factors. USA mediated a modest induction by USF in conjunction with either recombinant human TFIID, intact yeast TFIID, or the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal portion of yeast TFIID. Upon further purification, USA was resolved into two components that had opposite effects on core promoter activity and that in combination potentiated activator function. Gel mobility shift experiments indicated physical interactions between the inhibitory activity and TFIID, suggesting that the additional components (cofactors) associate with the preinitiation complex both to reduce promoter activity in the absence and to increase promoter activity in the presence of transcriptional activators."
https://openalex.org/W2039596527,"Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1975515226,"The murine paired box gene Pax-1 has been associated with the mouse developmental mutant undulated (un), which exhibits malformations in the vertebral column. In un mice, a point mutation leading to a Gly-Ser exchange in a conserved part of the paired domain of Pax-1 is present. Here we show that Pax-1 encodes a DNA-binding protein with transcriptional activating properties. The DNA-binding specificity of the Pax-1 protein has been extensively analyzed in gel shift assays, and in conjunction with binding interference experiments, a DNA-binding core motif was defined. Comparison of the DNA-binding properties of wild-type and un Pax-1 proteins demonstrates that the Gly-Ser replacement at position 15 within the paired domain dramatically decreases the DNA-binding affinity of the un Pax-1 protein and alters its DNA-binding specificity. These results decipher the molecular basis of the un mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1500574791,"The oxidation of amino acids by Fenton reagent (H2O2 + Fe(II] leads mainly to the formation of NH+4, alpha-ketoacids, CO2, oximes, and aldehydes or carboxylic acids containing one less carbon atom. Oxidation is almost completely dependent on the presence of bicarbonate ion and is stimulated by iron chelators at levels which are substoichiometric with respect to the iron concentration but is inhibited at higher concentrations. The stimulatory effect of chelators is not due merely to solubilization of catalytically inactive polymeric forms of Fe(OH)3 nor to the conversion of Fe(II) to complexes incapable of scavenging hydroxyl radicals. The results suggest that an iron chelate and another as yet unidentified form of iron are both required for maximal rates of amino acid oxidation. The metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of amino acids is likely a caged process, since the oxidation is not inhibited by hydroxyl radical scavengers, and the relative rates of oxidation of various amino acids by the Fenton system as well as the distribution of products formed (especially products of aromatic amino acids) are significantly different from those reported for amino acid oxidation by ionizing radiation. Several iron-binding proteins, peptides, and hemoglobin degradation products can replace Fe(II) or Fe(III) in the bicarbonate-dependent oxidation of amino acids. In view of their ability to sequester metal ions and their susceptibility to oxidation by H2O2 in the presence of physiological concentrations of bicarbonate, amino acids may serve an important role in antioxidant defense against tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2090944800,"Specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be sequestered within distinct cellular locations, but little is known about how this is accomplished. The participation of the three major cellular filaments in the localization of actin mRNA was studied in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Movement of actin mRNA to the cell periphery and maintenance of that regionalization required intact microfilaments (composed of actin) but not microtubules or intermediate filaments. The results presented here suggest that actin-binding proteins may participate in mRNA sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1594827149,"Staphylococcal alpha-toxin was radiolabeled to high specific radioactivity (1,500-3,000 Ci/mmol) under retention of its hemolytic activity. Binding studies with susceptible rabbit erythrocytes and highly resistant human erythrocytes revealed that binding of alpha-toxin to target cells can occur via two different mechanisms. Binding of alpha-toxin to rabbit erythrocytes initially involves specific binding sites and occurs at low concentrations, with half-maximal binding at 1-2 nM. In contrast, toxin binding to human erythrocytes is absorptive and nonspecific, in this case, significant binding as well as hemolysis occur only at alpha-toxin concentrations exceeding 1 microM. Autoradiographic analyses of membrane-associated alpha-toxin from either cell species proved that hemolysis was inevitably associated with the formation of toxin hexamers. Our data indicate that the high susceptibility of certain target cells toward alpha-toxin is caused by the presence of specific binding sites. However, membrane damage of both susceptible and nonsusceptible target cells occurs via a common mechanism involving toxin oligomerization and pore formation."
https://openalex.org/W2026315289,"Using functional and adhesion assays, we have studied the ability of 30 human CD4 mutants to interact with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and also with gp120 from human immunodeficiency virus. The mutants cover the four domains (D1-D4) of CD4 and include several single-site substitutions. Analysis of the results, in the context of the CD4 crystal structure, shows that mutations that affect the interaction with class II MHC molecules are located on three exposed loops from CD4 domains 1 and 2. The specifically implicated residues, 19, 89, and 165, are separated from one another by 9 Å, 24 Å, and 24 Å on one face of the CD4 molecule. Moreover, the class 11 binding site does not include residues 43 to 49 of the CD4 molecule, a region on an opposite face known to be involved in the binding of gp120."
https://openalex.org/W2045916077,"Orderly progression through the somatic cell division cycle is accompanied by phase-specific transcription of a variety of different genes. During S phase, transcription of mammalian histone H2B genes requires a specific promoter element and its cognate transcription factor Oct1 (OTF1). A possible mechanism for regulating histone H2B transcription during the cell cycle is direct modulation of Oct1 activity by phase-specific posttranslational modifications. Analysis of Oct1 during progression through the cell cycle revealed a complex temporal program of phosphorylation. A p34cdc2-related protein kinase that is active during mitosis may be responsible for one mitotic phosphorylation of Oct1. However, the temporally controlled appearance of Oct1 phosphopeptides suggests the involvement of multiple kinases and phosphatases. These results support the idea that cell cycle-regulated transcription factors may be direct substrates for phase-specific regulatory enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1515025709,"We have recently identified and characterized a chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase in human heart (human heart chymase) that is the most catalytically efficient enzyme described, thus far, for the cleavage of angiotensin I to yield angiotensin II and the dipeptide His-Leu. Compared to other chymases, this enzyme also has an unusually high degree of specificity for the substrate angiotensin I. We report here the molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene and cDNA encoding human heart chymase, and determination of its entire deduced amino acid sequence. These data indicate that human heart chymase is highly homologous to other members of the chymase subfamily of chymotrypsin-like proteinases and, most likely, all evolved from a common ancestral gene. Potential regulatory elements found in the 5'-untranslated region of other chymases are also found in the human heart chymase gene. However, this gene lacks mast cell-specific sequences found in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the rat chymase II gene. In addition, human heart chymase contains clusters of unique amino acid sequences located at key positions likely involved in substrate binding, which may contribute to its high substrate specificity. These contrasting features of the human heart chymase gene and cDNA, and the potential determinants of its primary structure that underlie its unique functional characteristics are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1493531388,"Receptor-linked activation of phospholipase D has been demonstrated recently in a variety of intact cell types including granulocytes, but little is known about the enzyme, its cofactor requirements, and regulation. Using [3H]alkyllysophosphatidylcholine to prelable an endogenous phosphatidylcholine substrate pool in conjunction with transphosphatidylation using ethanol to generate labeled phosphatidylethanol, we demonstrated a novel phospholipase D activity in neutrophil subcellular fractions. Guanosine 5‘-O-3-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activated both phosphatidic acid generation and transphosphatidylation. Activity using both activators required the presence of not only plasma membrane but also cytosol, and proteolytic and thermal inactivation demonstrated the requirement for protein factors in both fractions. Using both stimuli, activity increased with increasing cytosol concentration. Product formation was approximately linear for about 10 min with PMA and 30 min with GTP gamma S, and both activators resulted in the total hydrolysis of up to 10% of the labeled phosphatidylcholine. The activity using both activators showed similar broad neutral pH optima, and both required the presence of micromolar levels of calcium, which by itself failed to activate at concentrations up to 1 mM. At low micromolar concentrations of nucleotides, activation was specific for guanine nucleotides and showed a specificity of GTP gamma S greater than guanyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate greater than GTP, with no effect of GDP and GMP or adenine nucleotides, consistent with the participation of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. PMA activation was dependent on the presence of ATP, in particular when dialyzed cytosol was used, and was inhibited by about 50% by staurosporine, supporting a role for protein kinase C. However, purified protein kinase C failed to substitute for cytosol, implicating an additional cytosolic factor(s) in this response. These results indicate that the granulocytic phospholipase D pathway is a complex system that is regulated by at least two activation pathways, each comprised of components in two subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1606057223,"Activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol actyltransferase (ACAT) in macrophages by lipoproteins is a key event in atheroma foam cell formation. To help elucidate the mechanisms whereby lipoproteins stimulate ACAT, the early cellular events of lipoprotein-induced ACAT stimulation were studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages. As a function of increasing lipoprotein-cholesterol influx to the cell during the first few hours of incubation, ACAT activity was markedly stimulated by beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) and acetyl-low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) only after lipoprotein-cholesterol influx reached a threshold level of approximately 25% above the basal cell cholesterol content. In contrast, LDL stimulated ACAT only minimally at this level of lipoprotein-cholesterol influx. In further experiments, the source of ACAT cholesterol substrate during the initial stimulation of ACAT was shown to be a mixture of cellular (approximately 75%) and lipoprotein-cholesterol (approximately 25%) in proportions that approximated the proportions of originally cellular and lipoprotein-cholesterol in the cell. Thus, lipoprotein-cholesterol rapidly mixed with most or all of cellular cholesterol before ACAT esterification. Additional studies showed that LDL caused significant efflux of cellular cholesterol, thus providing at least a partial explanation for the relatively weak ACAT stimulatory potential of LDL. To support this idea, LDL that was modified to decrease its ability to induce net cellular cholesterol efflux stimulated ACAT 2-fold greater than control LDL when matched for lysosomal LDL-cholesterol influx. Moreover, when the effective efflux potentials of beta-VLDL and acetyl-LDL were increased, ACAT stimulation was markedly decreased despite unchanged lipoprotein-cholesterol influx. Thus, macrophage ACAT is stimulated not directly by the influx of newly hydrolyzed lipoprotein-cholesterol but rather by net expansion of cellular cholesterol pools to a particular threshold level. This scheme has potentially important implications regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of foam cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W1527624089,"In sea urchin eggs an enzymatic metabolite of beta-NAD+, called cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), is as potent and powerful a releaser of sequestered intracellular Ca2+ as is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The enzyme that synthesizes cADPR is present in several vertebrate animal tissues, but the Ca(2+)-releasing activity of cADPR has not been described in mammalian cells. We report here that incubation of beta-NAD+ with cell-free extracts of several rat tissues (including pituitary gland) generates a product which releases intracellular Ca2+ stores in permeabilized rat pituitary GH4C1 cells. This product has the biological characteristics of cADPR (it acts after depletion of the IP3 stores and after blockade of the IP3 receptor by heparin). The response is mimicked, in a concentration-dependent manner, by authentic cADPR and is desensitized by prior incubation with cADPR. We conclude that cADPR is not only synthesized by certain mammalian cells but also acts in such cells to release compartmentalized intracellular Ca2+ by a mechanism that differs from that used by IP3. Therefore, cADPR may serve, in addition to IP3, as a second messenger for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600541692,"Trans-Caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase is involved in the reinforcement of the plant cell wall under conditions that trigger the disease resistance response (Pakusch, A.-E., Kneusel, R.E., and Matern, U. (1989) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 271, 488-494). Partial amino acid sequences of the enzyme from cultured parsley cells that had been treated with a crude elicitor were identified (Pakusch, A.-E., Matern, U., and Schiltz, E. (1991) Plant Physiol. 95, 137-143), and corresponding degenerated oligonucleotides of 29- and 30-nucleotide length were synthesized. Northern hybridizations with these probes revealed one specific RNA band, and the amount of this RNA appeared to be transiently induced upon elicitation of the cells. De novo enzyme synthesis was confirmed by Western blotting experiments using a specific antiserum. The time course of induction closely followed the pattern observed for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and suggested the operational coordination of the methyltransferase with the general phenylpropanoid pathway in vivo. Full size cDNA of 1.258 kilobases was isolated in lambda gt11, sequenced and found to contain a remarkably long 5'-untranslated leader sequence followed by an open reading frame that codes for a 241-residue polypeptide representing the 27-kDa subunit of the native, dimeric parsley enzyme. Almost no homology was found to protein sequences filed in data banks. Southern hybridization with genomic DNA suggested that only one or two copies of the respective gene(s) are present in the parsley genome. Caffeoyl-CoA-specific methyltransferase activity was demonstrated in taxonomically widely diverse plants such as Dianthus caryophyllus (Caryophyllaceae), Carthamus tinctorius (Asteraceae) or Daucus carota, and Ammi majus (Apiaceae) where it is commonly induced by elicitor treatment. In Northern blots with RNA from Ammi or Daucus, parsley cDNA hybridized specifically to one band comparable in size to the parsley RNA, whereas Dianthus and Carthamus appear to code for slightly larger RNAs (roughly 1.45 and 1.3 kilobases, respectively). Slot-blot hybridizations revealed in all instances the rapid and transient increase of mRNA levels in response to elicitation. This emphasizes the integral role of the enzyme in disease resistance expression in plants far beyond parsley and also illustrates a new physiological context for the induction of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase."

https://openalex.org/W1485551176,"Using an overlay technique, we previously showed that the Gram-negative periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum binds to a glycoprotein of Mr 89,000 (Prakobphol, A., Murray, P., and Fischer, S.J. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 164, 5-11) in the parotid saliva of some individuals. We now show that deglycosylation of the purified glycoprotein results in loss of receptor activity. Amino acid analysis of the protein core showed predominantly proline, glycine, and glutamic acid/glutamine, a characteristic of proline-rich glycoproteins (PRG). The amino terminus contained repeating sequences of Ser-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro-Glu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro- Gln-Gly that had significant compositional and sequence homology to that encoded by exon 3 of the PRB3 gene. We analyzed the PRG oligosaccharides by a combination of mass spectrometry techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Twenty-seven highly fucosylated structures were identified. The most abundant was as follows (where Fuc is fucose). (formula; see text) To understand the structural basis of F. nucleatum binding, we screened glycolipids and neoglycolipids carrying carbohydrate structures related to those of the PRG for receptor activity; components with unsubstituted terminal lactosamine residues best supported adherence. Neoglycolipids constructed from PRG oligosaccharides were also receptors. Treatment with beta-galactosidase, but not alpha-fucosidase, abolished binding, suggesting that unsubstituted lactosamine units, including the 6-antenna of the major oligosaccharide, mediate F. nucleatum adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1559486106,"Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA dehydratase) catalyzes the second step of tetrapyrrole synthesis leading to the formation of heme and chlorophyll in higher plant cells. Antibodies elicited against spinach leaf ALA dehydratase were used to immunoscreen lambda gt11 cDNA libraries constructed from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaf poly(A)+ RNAs. A set of overlapping cDNAs was characterized that encode the pea enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence of the pea ALA dehydratase is similar to those reported for other eukaryotic and prokaryotic ALA dehydratases. The pea enzyme has an active site domain centered on lysine that is highly conserved in comparison to other known ALA dehydratases. Consistent with the previously reported requirement of Mg2+ for catalytic activity by plant ALA dehydratases, the pea enzyme lacks the characteristic Zn(2+)-binding domain present in other eukaryotic ALA dehydratases, but contains a distinctive metal ligand-binding domain based upon aspartate. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that ALA dehydratase mRNA is present in leaves, stems, and to a lesser extent in roots. Steady state levels of mRNA encoding ALA dehydratase exhibit little or no change during light-induced greening."
https://openalex.org/W1564575603,"L1210 murine leukemic cells grown under conditions of continuous low folate concentrations acquire increased levels of a high affinity/low capacity folate-binding protein (FBP). Using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the human FBP, we have cloned and sequenced two murine FBP cDNAs isolated from a library constructed using a L1210 subline adapted for growth on low levels of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The encoding proteins, designated FBP1 and FBP2, have predicted Mr values of 29,415 and 28,821, respectively. These proteins share significant sequence identity with each other (70%) and with the deduced sequences of the human- and bovine-encoded FBPs (68-79%). Southern blot analysis of the low folate-adapted cell line revealed that, while neither of the two FBP-encoding genes was amplified, the FBP1 genomic locus had undergone rearrangement. On Northern blot analysis, this rearrangement was reflected in the enhanced expression (greater than 100-fold) of a FBP1-specific transcript which was 200 nucleotides shorter than the corresponding L1210 parental transcript. The increased expression of this transcript coincided with the increased expression of a membrane protein (Mr = 38,000) which could be affinity-labeled with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]folate. Accordingly, the FBP1 transcript appears to encode the high affinity/low capacity FBP. Compared to parental L1210 cells, expression of the FBP2-encoding transcript was unchanged in this cell line and, while the exact nature of the protein is unclear, FBP2 may represent a fetal form of the FBP."
https://openalex.org/W1507204430,"The sterol binding specificity of rat recombinant liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) was characterized with [3H]cholesterol and a fluorescent sterol analog dehydroergosterol. Ligand binding analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and activation of microsomal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity showed that L-FABP-bound sterols. 1) Lipidex-1000 assay showed a dissociation constant Kd = 0.78 +/- 0.18 microM and stoichiometry of 0.47 +/- 0.16 mol/mol for [3H]cholesterol binding to L-PABP. 2) With [3H]cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine liposomes, the cholesterol binding parameters for L-FABP were Kd = 1.53 +/- 0.28 microM and stoichiometry 0.83 +/- 0.07 mol/mol. 3) L-FABP interaction with dehydroergosterol altered the fluorescence intensity and polarization of dehydroergosterol. Dehydroergosterol bound to L-FABP with Kd = 0.37 microM and a stoichiometry of 0.83 mol/mol. 4) Cholesterol and dehydroergosterol decreased L-FABP tyrosine lifetime. Dehydroergosterol binding produced sensitized emission of bound dehydroergosterol with longer lifetime.5) L-FABP bound two cis-parinaric acid molecules/molecule of protein. Cholesterol displaced one of these bound cis-parinaric acids. 6) L-FABP enhanced acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, these assays indicated that I-FABP did not bind sterols. Thus, L-FABP appears able to bind 1 mol of cholesterol/mol of L-FABP, the L-FABP sterol binding site is equivalent to one of the two fatty acid binding sites, and L-FABP stimulates acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase by transfer of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1529149604,"Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that 17-beta estradiol (E2) can directly stimulate the transcription rate of the rat luteinizing hormone beta (LH beta) gene and that an upstream portion of the LH beta gene between -2.0 and -0.6 kilobases could confer an E2-stimulated response to a reporter gene in transient expression assays. To localize the LH beta estrogen response element (ERE) by biological function, portions of the 5'-flanking region of the LH beta gene or synthetic oligonucleotides were inserted in expression vectors next to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Constructs were transfected into GH3 cells, and transfected cells were treated for 48 h with E2. E2 stimulation of activity (2-4-fold) occurred with constructs containing the 15-base pair palindromic sequence (GGACACCATCTGTCC), found at bases -1173 to -1159 relative to the transcriptional start site in the LH beta gene. A construct containing a synthetic oligonucleotide of this putative LH beta ERE was stimulated 1.7-3-fold by E2, while a construct containing two copies of the sequence was stimulated to a slightly higher level (2.5-4.0-fold). An oligonucleotide in which the palindrome was mutated failed to confer E2 stimulation, and mutation of the palindromic region within the upstream region of the LH beta gene also eliminated the E2 response. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen could not elicit a response, nor could dehydrotestosterone or dexamethasone; however, thyroid hormone treatment resulted in a 2-2.5-fold stimulation. The 15-base pair LH beta gene palindrome was found to bind estrogen receptor (ER) complex directly by gel retardation experiments. Labeled LH beta ERE DNA formed three complexes with proteins from immature rat uterine extract. Two of these were associated with ER complexes, as determined by the comigration of [3H] estradiol bound to ER with these complexes, and by the ability of anti-ER antibody to associate with these complexes. The affinity of the LH beta ERE for ER was calculated by Scatchard analysis to be 2.2-5.0 nM, an approximately 5-10-fold lower affinity than for the ERE in the vitellogenin A2 gene region. The mutated ERE, which had no biological activity, could not compete effectively for binding to ER. ER which was heat-transformed at 30 degrees C had a similar affinity (2-5 nM) for the ERE as ER occupied with E2 (2-4 nM), while ER occupied by estrone had a lower affinity (9 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2076301087,"Catalytic antibody technology has been used to explore the contribution of medium effects to the overall rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. An antibody generated against a derivative of 2-acetamido-1,5-napthalenedisulfonate efficiently catalyzes the decarboxylation of 5-nitro-3-carboxybenzisoxazole. This unimolecular reaction is not susceptible to general acid-base catalysis but is highly sensitive to microenvironment; thus, it provides a simple chemical model for biologically important decarboxylations. The 10(4)-fold rate acceleration observed for the antibody reflects the kinetic advantage of the low-dielectric environment of the binding pocket acting to destabilize the substrate by desolvation and to stabilize the charge-delocalized transition state through dispersion interactions. These results are pertinent to an understanding of solvent effects in enzymic reactions in general and suggest approaches for developing antibody catalysts for numerous other reactions that involve large changes in charge distribution as the reaction coordinate is traversed."
https://openalex.org/W1594516651,"The 33- and 23-kDa proteins of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex are synthesized in the cytosol and targeted into the thylakoid lumen by bipartite presequences. In this report, we describe conditions for the efficient import of each of these proteins by isolated pea thylakoids. Import of the 33-kDa protein requires both light and stromal extract. The probable function of the stromal extract is to provide stromal processing peptidase to remove the first envelope transit signal of the presequence. Import of the 23-kDa protein is also driven by light, but stromal extract is not required for import; furthermore, efficient import is still observed if the precursor is modified to completely block cleavage by residual stromal processing peptidase activity. The intermediate form of the 23-kDa protein, which is generated by incubation of the precursor protein with stromal processing peptidase, is also efficiently imported. The results indicate that the thylakoidal protein transport system can import both the precursor and intermediate forms of the 23-kDa protein, but probably only the intermediate form of the 33-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1522849088,"The biosynthesis of alpha-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors is catalyzed by the sequential action of peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL). The two enzymes are part of a bifunctional, integral membrane protein precursor, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). The major forms of PAM mRNA in the adult rat atrium differ by the presence or absence of optional exon A, a 315-nucleotide segment separating the PHM and PAL domains. Using antipeptide antibodies specific to the PHM, exon A, PAL, and cytoplasmic domains of rat PAM, carbonate-washed atrial membranes were found to contain proteins corresponding to rPAM-1 and rPAM-2. Digestion of atrial membranes with a variety of endoproteinases released PHM and PAL catalytic activities. Dose-response curves indicated that both catalytic activities were extremely resistant to inactivation by trypsin. Endoproteolytic digestion of atrial membranes with trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thermolysin, or endoproteinase Lys-C generated a 35-kDa PHM fragment. Digestion with trypsin, elastase, thermolysin, or endoproteinase Lys-C generated a 42-kDa PAL fragment. In contrast to the stability exhibited by the PHM and PAL domains, the cytoplasmic domain of PAM was destroyed by most of the enzymes; only digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C generated a stable fragment. Digestion with endoproteinase Arg-C removed the carboxyl-terminal tail from PAM but failed to release the PHM or PAL domains from the membranes. The PHM fragments generated by some of the endoproteinases showed a tendency to adhere to the membranes. Thus the bifunctional PAM protein consists of independent catalytic domains separated from each other and from the putative transmembrane domain by flexible regions accessible to attack by a wide variety of endoproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1577563846,"Binding and proximity relationships of fatty acids with recombinant rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) were studied with absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Protein aromatic amino acids were examined in the absence and presence of bound fatty acid. Second derivative absorbance spectroscopy of the apo- and holoproteins suggested that fatty acid binding altered the conformation of L-FABP, but not of I-FABP. Fatty acid binding also blocked the accessibility of L-FABP tyrosine and I-FABP tryptophan to Stern-Volmer quenching by acrylamide, indicating that these amino acids were present in the fatty acid-binding pocket. Forster energy transfer from I-FABP tryptophan to bound cis-parinaric acid resulted in quenching of tryptophan lifetime and appearance of sensitized lifetime of bound cis-parinaric acid. The calculated donor-acceptor distances were 16.9 +/- 0.6 and 19.2 +/- 0.3 A for I-FABP and L-FABP, respectively. Absorbance spectral shifts and ratios of fluorescence excitation maxima indicated that the parinaric acid microenvironment in the fatty acid-binding site of I-FABP was much less polar than that of L-FABP. Parinaric acids displayed similar rotational correlation time and limiting anisotropy when bound to I-FABP and to L-FABP. These results are consistent with a close proximity of bound fatty acids to the tyrosine and tryptophan residues and with immobilization of the polyene fatty acids in the fatty acid-binding site(s) of L-FABP and I-FABP. The two proteins differ in that only L-FABP has two fatty acid-binding sites and appears to undergo significant conformational change upon fatty acid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1560685236,"The proteinase meprin-A is a disulfide-linked tetramer of 90-kDa glycoprotein subunits. It is expressed at high levels in kidney brush border membranes of random bred and certain inbred strains of mice. Some mouse strains (e.g. C3H/He) do not express meprin-A subunits, but do produce a similar but less well characterized metalloendopeptidase, meprin-B. In the present study, meprin-B was purified from C3H/He mouse kidneys to electrophoretic homogeneity, and the relationship between it and meprin-A was investigated. The papain-solubilized form of meprin-B was similar to meprin-A in amino acid composition, molecular mass, secondary, and quaternary structure. However, immunoblots indicated that the enzymes have some common and some distinct epitopes. Lectin blots indicated both enzymes have high mannose and/or complex biantennary oligosaccharides, but there are differences in the complex-type glycosylation. Peptide maps and sequencing of cyanogen-bromide fragments of the enzymes revealed some different amino acid sequences. Thermal inactivation studies indicated that meprin-B was much less stable than meprin-A; the half-life for inactivation at 58 degrees C for meprin-A was 50 min, whereas for meprin-B it was less than 3 min. Both enzymes hydrolyzed azocasein and insulin B chain, but limited proteolysis of the enzymes with trypsin activated meprin-B 5-20-fold, whereas meprin-A was activated 2-fold at most. Analysis of hydrolysis products of the oxidized insulin B chain revealed some common and some distinct sites of cleavage. Bradykinin was a good substrate for meprin-A, while it was not hydrolyzed by meprin-B. A synthetic peptide, YLVC(SO3-)GERG, derived from insulin B chain was hydrolyzed faster by meprin-B than meprin-A, and neither enzyme was activated by trypsin treatment against this substrate. Taken together, the data indicate that the two metalloendopeptidases have many similarities but are distinct enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1513405860,"The carbon monoxide complex of ascorbate-reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared, fluorescence, and x-ray absorption spectroscopies. CO has previously been shown to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to O2, and binds to only one of the two copper atoms/active site (Blackburn, N. J., Pettingill, T. M., Seagraves, K. S., and Shigeta, R. T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15383-15386). Thus, it acts as an excellent probe of the O2-binding site. A single C-O infrared absorption band is observed at 2089 cm-1, shifting by 46 cm-1 to lower energy on substitution with either 13C16O or 12C18O. The 13C isotope shift is reversed to the position expected for 12CO upon vacuum flushing with 12CO gas, indicating that formation of the CO adduct is a fully reversible process. Binding of the substrate tyramine does not eliminate the infrared peak but causes a 3-cm-1 shift to lower energy. On the other hand, binding of a bifunctional inhibitor which cross-links the substrate and O2-binding site does eliminate the CO peak. These data, in conjunction with the competitive nature of CO binding with respect to O2, identify the CO-binding site as the O2-binding site, and place it in close proximity to the substrate-binding site. CO-dopamine beta-hydroxylase exhibits no luminescence in the visible region, suggesting a structure different from carbonmonoxy hemocyanin, and in all probability mononuclear. Analysis of extended x-ray absorption spectroscopy data is most consistent with an average coordination per Cu of 2-3 histidines, 0.5 CO, and 0.5 S atoms as ligands, and absorption edge comparisons indicates pseudo-4 coordination as the most likely geometry at each Cu(I) center. The results can be interpreted by a model involving inequivalent 4-coordination at each Cu(I) center in the CO adduct with CuAHis3S...CuBHis2CO-X as the coordination most consistent with all of the data."
https://openalex.org/W1501412546,"The Asn-linked oligosaccharides on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin (LH) and thyrotropin terminate with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-2 Man alpha-. Using a chemically synthesized trisaccharide GalNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-O(CH2)8COOCH3 (GGnM-MCO), we have developed a sensitive assay for the sulfotransferase responsible for the 4-O-sulfation of the terminal beta-D-GalNAc. GGnM-MCO is incubated with a bovine pituitary membrane extract and [35S]3‘-phosphoadenosine 5‘-phosphosulfate ([35S]PAPS). The sulfated product [35S]SGGnM-MCO is separated from [35S]PAPS, PAPS degradation products and endogenous sulfated products by a two-step procedure utilizing an Ecteola cellulose column and a Sep-Pak (C18) cartridge. Characterization of the [35S]SGGnM-MCO produced in the assay indicates that sulfate is incorporated exclusively on the 4-position of GalNAc. Linear incorporation of sulfate into GGnM-MCO can be maintained for greater than 10 h. GGnM-4-sulfotransferase has a pH optimum of 7.2, requires the presence of a reducing agent, and is stimulated by, but does not require, divalent cations. Initial velocity studies indicate an apparent Km (Henri-Michaelis-Menten equilibrium constant) for PAPS of 4 microM and for GGnM-MCO of 9 microM. Incorporation of sulfate into the trisaccharide is stimulated 3-fold by the presence of basic proteins including deglycosylated LH. The stimulation by deglycosylated LH suggests that the protein component of glycoproteins that bear oligosaccharides terminating with GalNAc-GlcNAc-Man- may modulate GGnM-4-sulfotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1524543446,"The mechanism by which the drugs phenobarbital and 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide induce levels of chicken cytochrome P-450 (CYP) mRNAs has been investigated in primary hepatocyte cultures from 17-day-old chick embryos. It has been demonstrated that three CYP mRNAs of 3.5, 2.5, and 2.2 kilobases (kb) are strongly induced by phenobarbital in primary hepatocytes, as found previously in chick embryo liver in ovo (Hansen, A. J., Elferink, L. A., and May, B. K. (1989) DNA (NY) 8, 179-191), and that, at least for the 3.5-kb mRNA, this is predominantly a result of enhanced transcription of the corresponding gene, CYP2H1. Transient transfection assays were carried out in primary cultures using constructs containing different lengths of CYP2H1 gene 5'-flanking sequence fused to the reporter chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene. These experiments established that cis-acting elements located in the first 0.5 kb of the CYP2H1 gene 5'-flanking region direct high basal expression of the CAT gene, but do not mediate phenobarbital inducibility. When constructs containing more than 1.1 kb of CYP2H1 gene 5'-flanking sequence were examined, phenobarbital induction of CAT expression was observed, and a drug-responsive domain between positions -5.9 and -1.1 kb was identified. This domain has the properties of an enhancer, since it is able to confer phenobarbital responsiveness to the enhancerless SV40 promoter when tested in either orientation or at different distances from the promoter. The enhancer domain also responds to 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide, but whether the action of the two drugs is mediated by a single nuclear receptor interacting with common DNA elements in the domain remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1625593584,"Mouse embryos at the two-cell stage are able to recover from an alkaline load. We found that this recovery is mediated by sodium-independent bicarbonate/chloride exchange: intracellular pH (pHi) recovery from alkaline load is inhibited by the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonic acid, lack of bicarbonate, or lack of chloride. The dependence of the pHi recovery on extracellular chloride concentration exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, uptake of chloride is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by extracellular bicarbonate. The Km for external chloride was found to be about 3 mM, with a Ki for external bicarbonate of about 2 mM. The exchanger is active above approximately pH 7.15. These results demonstrate that mouse embryos at the two-cell stage possess a sodium-independent bicarbonate/chloride exchange mechanism that is similar to that found in other mammalian cells. This bicarbonate/chloride exchanger appears to be the sole pHi-regulatory mechanism in the two-cell stage mouse embryo, since our previous results have shown that there are apparently no specific mechanisms active in these cells for relieving acid loads."

The enzymatically formed bicyclic carotenes were trans configured, so the overall reaction consists of two individual processes, isomerization and cyclization. The two reactions were experimentally distinguished by use of the inhibitor [2-(p-chlorophenylthio)triethylammonium chloride. NADPH, the essential cofactor for the overall reaction, originates from the plastid glycolytic pathway. It is shown that NADPH exhibits its function at the stage of isomerization and is also able to promote reduction of the prolycopene substrate in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1522645863,"The occurrence of protochlorophyllide b and protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester in green plants is described. The chemical structure of protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester was established by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopic analysis, and chemical derivatization coupled to electronic spectroscopic analysis. The macrocycles of protochlorophyll(ide) b are identical to those of conventional protochlorophyll(ide) except for the presence of a formyl group instead of a methyl group at position 3 of the macrocycles. They differ from chlorophyll(ide) b by the presence of an oxidized double bond at positions 7 and 8 of the macrocycles. The trivial name protochlorophyll(ide) b is proposed to differentiate these two tetrapyrroles from conventional protochlorophyll(ide), which in turn will be referred to as protochlorophyll(ide) a. Protochlorophyll(ide) b appears to be widely distributed in green plants. Its molar extinction coefficients in 80% acetone and diethyl ether are reported. The impact of this discovery on the heterogeneity of the chlorophyll a and b biosynthetic pathways is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1502595232,"The human DNA binding factor GRF-1, which associates with the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (hGR gene), is a repressor of glucocorticoid receptor transcription. The GRF-1 cDNA was cloned using polyclonal antibodies against the purified protein. The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA sequences show the presence of three sequence motifs characteristic of a zinc finger and one motif suggestive of a leucine zipper in which 1 cysteine is found instead of all leucines. The GRF-1 expressed in COS-1 cells has a molecular weight of 95,000 and enhances the homologous down-regulation of wild-type hGR gene expression. Biochemical analysis suggests that GRF-1 interaction is sequence specific and that transcriptional efficacy of GRF-1 is regulated through its interaction with specific sequence motif, namely 5‘-GAAGGAGGTAGCGAGAAAAGAAACTG-GAGAAACTCGGT.GG-3‘. The GRF-1 mRNA is 6.5 kilobases long in rat liver and human MCF-7 cells, and its level is regulated by glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W1490339549,"The effect of N-acetylimidazole, a mild acetylating reagent, on the catalytic activities and subunit structure of the bovine pituitary multicatalytic proteinase complex (MPC) was studied. The trypsin-like activity (cleavage of Cbz-D-Ala-Leu-Arg-2-naphthylamide) and the peptidylglutamyl-peptide bond hydrolyzing (PGP) activity (cleavage of Cbz-Leu-Leu-Glu-2-naphthylamide) of MPC were rapidly inactivated by N-acetylimidazole, whereas the chymotrypsin-like activity (cleavage of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroanilide) was inactivated slowly. However, the hydrolysis of casein was markedly stimulated. Hydrolysis of casein by the acetylated enzyme generated a stable intermediate (21 kDa) which could be further degraded by native MPC. Treatment of acetylated MPC with hydroxylamine reversed the changes in trypsin-like and caseinolytic activities but did not restore the PGP activity. N-Acetylimidazole did not dissociate MPC but altered its migration on nondissociating gels presumably by acetylation of epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues. Hydroxylamine did not alter the gel electrophoretic appearance of the acetylated enzyme. These results indicate that acetylation of thiol or tyrosyl groups changes the trypsin-like and caseinolytic activities, and that amino group acetylation inhibits the PGP activity. Degradation of casein by MPC appears to be a sequential process with initial cleavage catalyzed by a component distinct from the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGP activities. The latter three components likely participate in the secondary proteolysis of the generated intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1530885495,"Proteolipid protein (PLP), the major protein of central nervous system myelin, contains approximately 2 mol of covalently bound fatty acids. In this study, the in vivo turnover rate of the acyl chains bound to PLP was determined in 40-day-old rats after a single intracranial injection of [3H]palmitic acid. The apparent half-life of total fatty acids bound to PLP was approximately 7 days. After correction for acyl chain interconversion, the half-life of palmitate bound to PLP was only 3 days. This turnover rate is much more rapid than that of the protein moiety calculated under the same experimental conditions (t1/2 = 1 month). Additional evidence for the dynamic metabolism of acyl groups was provided by experiments in brain tissue slices which showed that acylation of PLP occurs in adult animals as well as during active myelination. Acylation of endogenous PLP in purified myelin and its subfractions was also studied during rat brain development using either [3H]palmitoyl-CoA or [3H]palmitic acid plus ATP and CoA. Labeling of endogenous PLP with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA was observed as early as 10 days postnatal and continued at the same rate throughout development. When [3H]palmitic acid was used as precursor in the presence of both ATP and CoA, esterification of myelin PLP occurred rapidly in adult animals, indicating that both nonacylated PLP and acyl-CoA ligase are present in myelin. Finally, pulse-chase experiments in a cell-free system showed that PLP-bound fatty acids turn over with a half-life shorter than 10 min. These observations are consistent with the concept that acylation of myelin PLP is a dynamic process involved mainly in myelin maintenance and function."
https://openalex.org/W1484935965,"Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to study the functional role of the COOH-terminal region in recombinant maize aldolase. A single mutation was created in each of the last nine amino acids of the COOH terminus and characterized kinetically. Point mutations in the COOH-terminal region were found to influence both the rate of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1-phosphate cleavage. Catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, was not affected by the mutations within experimental error consistent with this region of the COOH terminus modulating product release. Concentrations of the carbanion-enamine enzyme intermediate complex produced upon substrate cleavage increased with the severity of the point mutation. A condensation assay was developed to directly measure fructose 1,6-bisphosphate synthesized by aldolases in the presence of high triose phosphate concentrations. The maximal rate of aldol condensation of triose phosphates, D-glyceralehyde-3-P and dihydroxyacetone-P, was affected by the point mutations to the same extent as the maximal rate of substrate cleavage. Interpretation of the data is consistent with point mutations in the COOH terminus predominantly affecting the proton exchange with the dihydroxyacetone-P enzymatic complex at the carbanion-enamine step and that this step is probably rate-limiting in the catalytic mechanism of recombinant maize aldolase. The role of the COOH-terminal region in aldolases is thus consistent with a sequence dependent modulation of catalytic activity."

The cuttlefish protein T, which consists of two structural variants phosphorylated at different degrees, is the first invertebrate spermatid-specific protein to be fully characterized and sequenced. The primary structures of these two variants were established from sequence analysis and mass spectrometric data of the proteins and their fragments. T1 and T2 are two highly related proteins of 78 and 77 residues, respectively, which differ only by four conservative substitutions, two inversions Ser in equilibrium with Arg, and the deletion of 1 residue of arginine in variant T2. The asymmetrical distribution of the hydrophobic and basic residues determines two well defined domains: an amino-terminal domain (residues 1-21) devoid of arginine and aromatic residues and containing all the aliphatic hydrophobic residues and a highly basic carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 22-77 or 78) that contains 77% of arginine, all the tyrosine residues, and most of the phosphorylated serine residues present in the protein. The complete structural identity of the basic carboxyl-terminal domain of spermatidal proteins T1 and T2 with the protamine variants Sp1 and Sp2 isolated from cuttlefish spermatozoa strongly suggests that T1 and T2 could be precursors of Sp1 and Sp2, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2120811336,"The steady-state and rapid kinetic properties of xanthine oxidase containing a series of FAD analogs of varying reduction potential have been investigated. From steady-state analysis, Vmax is found to exhibit a sigmoidal dependence on the flavin midpoint potential in the homologous series. This dependence is accurately described by a model in which the rate of catalysis is attenuated by the amount of partially reduced enzyme generated during turnover possessing an unfavorable distribution of reducing equivalents among the several redox-active centers of the protein. The model assumes that reducing equivalents equilibrate among these centers rapidly compared to the limiting rates for the reductive and oxidative half-reactions. This assumption is borne out by a quantitative analysis of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions of the several enzyme forms investigated in detail. It is demonstrated in these studies that xanthine oxidase containing low potential flavin derivatives such as 1-deaza, 6-hydroxy, or 8-hydroxy FAD exhibits low turnover not because of inherently slow rates of reduction by xanthine or oxidation by molecular oxygen, but because in partially reduced enzyme generated in the course of turnover reducing equivalents are distributed within the enzyme in such a way that the enzyme can participate in neither the reductive nor oxidative half-reactions. These results provide confirmation of the operation of a thermodynamic control mechanism in a simple electron-transferring system."

https://openalex.org/W1514556519,"Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is initially synthesized as a larger precursor that requires post-translational processing to produce the biologically active hexatriacontapeptide. These steps include tryptic cleavage at paired basic residues, their subsequent removal by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme, and formation of a carboxyl-terminal amide moiety via the action of peptidyl-glycyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase. To examine these reactions further, we utilized the pZIPneo(SVX) retroviral vector to express a cDNA clone encoding human PP in several cell lines including a fibroblast line (psi-2), two endocrine cell lines known to produce amidated peptides (AtT-20 and PC12), and two lines that do not ordinarily produce amidated peptides (RIN5-f and GH3). Transfected psi-2 cells produced an unprocessed precursor of PP that appeared to be secreted constitutively with little remaining in intracellular stores. No post-translational processing of the PP precursor was evident in these cells. By contrast, all 4 endocrine-derived cell lines, regardless of the nature of their endogenous products, were capable of expressing fully processed and carboxyl-terminally amidated PP. Moreover, these lines had the ability to store the processed products. Our results support the notion that post-translational processing of peptide hormone precursors requires storage in secretory granules that contain the appropriate processing enzymes. Furthermore, enzymes such as peptidyl-glycyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase that are required for processing peptides may be a common feature of endocrine-derived cells regardless of the requirement for their activity to process endogenous products."
https://openalex.org/W1535681839,"beta very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) interact with mouse peritoneal macrophages via specific receptors leading to pronounced stimulation of cholesterol esterification. The present study has defined an alternative pathway for the processing of beta-VLDL in alveolar macrophages from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Macrophages from either New Zealand (NZ) or WHHL rabbits degraded 125I-beta-VLDL to an equivalent extent. Degradation was competed to a similar extent in both cell types by either excess unlabeled beta-VLDL or low density lipoprotein, indicative of a specific receptor involvement. Accumulation of intracellular degradation products of beta-VLDL labeled with the residualizing label, dilactitol-125I-tyramine, was similar in both cell types demonstrating that degradation was not due to secreted proteolytic enzymes. beta-VLDL promoted the incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl-[3H]oleate and increased the cellular mass of cholesterol in NZ macrophages. In contrast, beta-VLDL did not augment cholesteryl-[3H]oleate deposition in WHHL macrophages. This lack of cholesterol esterification occurred despite equivalent acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in microsomal fractions of both cell types, and similar augmentations in cholesteryl-[3H]oleate during incubation with phospholipase C-treated LDL. Incubation of WHHL macrophages with beta-VLDL increased cellular cholesterol mass, although the response was attenuated compared to NZ cells. To determine whether these disparities in cholesterol esterification were related to the catabolic fate of beta-VLDL-derived cholesterol esters, [3H]cholesteryl oleate was exchanged into the core of beta-VLDL and incubated with macrophages in medium containing [14C]oleate. NZ macrophages accumulated both [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl-[14C]oleate after 5 h, indicating hydrolysis and re-esterification of cholesterol esters. In contrast, WHHL macrophages only accumulated [3H]cholesterol esters, suggesting uptake of cholesterol esters without subsequent hydrolysis. These data demonstrate that WHHL macrophages possess a pathway for the intracellular processing of beta-VLDL that permits internalization of the particle without stimulation of cholesterol esterification."
https://openalex.org/W1515691727,"The effects of cationic polyamino acids on insulin binding to soluble insulin receptor preparations were studied. Incubation of partially or fully purified receptor preparations with polylysine (pLys) increased by several-fold the amount of [125I]insulin that remained associated with the receptor, as determined both by precipitation of receptor-insulin complexes by polyethylene glycol or by separation of the complexes from the free hormone by gel filtration. This elevation in the amount of bound insulin resulted from increased number of insulin binding sites, and could not be attributed to an increased affinity of the receptors to insulin. In fact, pLys reduced 2-3-fold the affinity of insulin binding to its receptor as determined by equilibrium binding studies, and by monitoring the rate of exchange of bound [125I]insulin with unlabeled hormone. pLys induced specific interactions between insulin and its native receptor since other basic compounds such as histone, spermidine, polymixin B, compound 48/80, lysine, and arginine failed to reproduce its effects. pLys did not interact with the free ligand, nor did it promote interactions between insulin and denatured receptor forms. Furthermore, pLys did not induce binding of insulin to other proteins present in the partially purified receptor preparations. The effects of pLys were time and dose-dependent and were proportional to the pLys chain length. The longer the chain, the greater was the effect. Enhanced insulin binding and receptor beta-subunit autophosphorylation (in the presence of insulin) exhibited a similar dependency on the chain length of pLys. pLys effects on insulin binding were associated with formation of large protein aggregates that remained trapped at the top of Sephacryl S-300 columns. These aggregates contained substantial amounts of receptor-insulin complexes. Our results suggest that pLys induces formation of receptor clusters that create de novo insulin binding sites among adjacent receptor tetramers. Alternatively, formation of receptor aggregates might facilitate insulin binding to a soluble receptor subfraction that otherwise fails to bind the hormone."
