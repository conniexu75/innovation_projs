https://openalex.org/W1977345325,EARLY attempts to isolate an endotoxin from Pasteurella pestis by most classical methods have failed. Recently Davies1 isolated a lipopolysaccharide containing a heptose and phospholipid by extraction in hot phenol water. Cocking et al.2 produced a similar toxin by the use of ultra-sound and purification by column chromatography. These workers also reported briefly on the pathology produced by their toxins.

https://openalex.org/W1987798560,"THE lachrymal gland in mammals has acinar tissue leading to ducts lined with columnar epithelium showing no regional differentiation. The Na/K ratio of an established secretion shows no alteration in relation to variation in secretory rates, nor is there other evidence of sodium absorption from the acinar secretion associated with exchange for other ions1. There are no records of experiments on the effect of mineralocorticoids on the sodium–potassium relation of lachrymal secretion. In view of the fact that sheep were available with graded sodium depletion, and therefore proportional aldosterone secretion rate2, saliva and tears were collected for sodium and potassium assay."

https://openalex.org/W1973283359,"Cameron and Staveley1 found that the echinococcus cyst fluid contains P blood group substance if there are scolices present in the cysts. When the echinococcus cyst fluid is used as an antigen, excellent anti-P1 sera are produced in goats2. In rabbits the production of P1 antibodies can also be stimulated, but not by application of the cyst fluid alone3. We have explored another source of antigen, Lumbricus terrestris4. Sodium chloride extracts, both cooked and uncooked, contain a fairly large amount of P1 substance together with H substance and B blood group substance. Some of the extracts inhibited also anti-A, but never anti-M, anti-N, or anti-D. The long-lasting immunity of man against Ascaris gave rise to the idea that the P1 cold antibodies which are ‘genuinely’ present in the sera of P2 group people could have developed following antigenic stimulation by Ascaris lumbricoides or other nemathelminthes. We therefore studied sodium chloride extracts from Ascaris suum and observed a high content of substance inhibiting anti-P1 sera as well as A and H substances. By means of sodium chloride extracts from Lumbricus, P2 erythrocytes pretreated with tannin can be transformed into P1 erythrocytes. The extract can be cooked and we have been using it for the immunization of goats. The detailed quantitative relations will be referred to elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2035397113,"IN 1959 Dr, G. Haas, of the Department of Zoology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was sent some fossil animal bones which had been turned up by a bulldozer levelling a field near Tell Ubeidiya in the Jordan Valley near Lake Tiberias. In this material, Dr. Haas identified bones of extinct mammalia and “a human incisor and two small fragments of a hominid calvarium of very great thickness”1."

https://openalex.org/W2094194663,"IN a communication under this heading, Lüning1 has suggested a routine procedure by which potentially mutagenic drugs can be screened in tests on Drosophila. He uses developmental delay as the type of somatic damage that is likely to be correlated with whatever genetical damage has occurred. I wish to point out that in the only instance in which, to my knowledge, the effects of the same mutagen on developmental delay and mutation frequency were investigated, the correlation between them was clearly and strikingly negative. When larvae are raised on food to which formaldehyde at a low concentration has been added, high mutation frequencies are obtained so long as development proceeds at the normal speed. Any condition that delays development of the treated larvae—be this shortage of food, poor quality of food, supplementary harmful treatments, or even a more than optimal concentration of formaldehyde—concomitantly decreases mutation frequency2. For this particular mutagen, therefore, developmental delay would be a highly misleading guide to mutagenicity. It is, of course, possible that formaldehyde is exceptional in this respect, and that Lüning's test might be more reliable for other chemicals. Before this can be assumed, however, it will be necessary to establish experimentally for at least one member of the group of chemicals to be screened that its mutagenic action is positively correlated with its delaying action on development."
