https://openalex.org/W1499775870,"Phospholamban is a regulatory protein in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum that is phosphorylated by cAMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activities. In this report, we present the partial amino acid sequence of canine cardiac phospholamban and the identification of the sites phosphorylated by these two protein kinases. Gas-phase protein sequencing was used to identify 20 NH2-terminal residues. Overlap peptides produced by trypsin or papain digestion extended the sequence 16 residues to give the following primary structure: Ser-Ala-Ile-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ile-Glu-Met-Pro-Gln-Gln-Ala- Arg-Gln-Asn-Leu-Gln-Asn-Leu-Phe-Ile-Asn-Phe-(Cys)-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ile-(Cys)- Leu-Leu-Leu-Ile-. Phospholamban phosphorylated by either cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was cleaved with trypsin, and the major phosphorylated peptide (comprising greater than 70% of the incorporated 32P label) was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The identical sequence was revealed for the radioactive peptide obtained from phospholamban phosphorylated by either kinase: Arg-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ile-Glu-Met-Pro-Gln-Gln-. The adjacent residues Ser7 and Thr8 of phospholamban were identified as the unique sites phosphorylated by cAMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, respectively. These results establish that phospholamban is an oligomer of small, identical polypeptide chains. A hydrophilic, cytoplasmically oriented NH2-terminal domain on each monomer contains the unique, adjacent residues phosphorylated by cAMP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activities. Analysis by hydropathic profiling and secondary structure prediction suggests that phospholamban monomers also contain a hydrophobic domain, which could form amphipathic helices sufficiently long to traverse the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. A model of phospholamban as a pentamer is presented in which the amphipathic alpha-helix of each monomer is a subunit of the pentameric membrane-anchored domain, which is comprised of an exterior hydrophobic surface and an interior hydrophilic region containing polar side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1499495082,"Nonenzymatic glycosylation of albumin in vivo occurs at multiple sites. Glucose gets attached to Lys-199, Lys-281, Lys-439, and Lys-525 as well as to some other lysine residues. The principal glycosylated site is Lys-525. Approximately 33% of the overall glycosylation occurs at this site. This site specificity is remarkable and is postulated to be a consequence of local catalysis of the nonenzymatic glycosylation reaction. It appears that positively charged amino groups in the protein catalyze the Amadori rearrangement at specific sites. The principal glycosylated site, Lys-525, lies in a Lys-Lys sequence; other glycosylated sites lie in a Lys-Lys, Lys-His, and Lys-His-Lys sequence or are near disulfide bridges, which are likely to place amino groups of more remote parts of the protein closer to these sites. The occurrence of nonenzymatic glycosylation at most of the identified sites in albumin from diabetic patients is explained by the concept of local acid-base catalysis of the Amadori rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1511815713,"Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is present at high levels in fetal and early neonatal rat plasma, and decreases profoundly following birth. In the present study, the levels of IGF-II RNA in different rat tissues at different ages were determined by hybridization to a rat IGF-II cDNA probe. IGF-II RNA was present in 11 of 13 fetal or neonatal tissues examined: at higher levels in muscle, skin, lung, liver, intestine, and thymus; at lower levels in brain stem, heart, cerebral cortex, kidney, and hypothalamus; and undetectable in spleen and pancreas (although the latter RNA was partially degraded). In each tissue, Northern blot hybridization revealed the presence of six IGF-II RNAs: 6, 4, 3.8, 2.2, 1.7, and 1.2 kilobase pairs, consistent with results previously observed in the BRL-3A rat liver cell line and attributed to alternative RNA processing. Although differences in the relative abundance of these RNAs were observed in different tissues, the same size species occurred in all tissues with the 4-kilobase pair RNA the most abundant species. RNAs from the different tissues were examined at six developmental ages (days 16 and 21 of gestation; days 2, 11, 22, and 75 after birth) by hybridization to slot blots and Northern blots. In lung, thymus, kidney, and brain stem, IGF-II RNA was expressed at higher levels in the fetus than after birth, whereas in muscle, skin, liver, heart, and intestine, the high fetal levels of IGF-II RNA continued through day 11 or day 22 after birth. IGF-II RNA persisted into adulthood in cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. Although the significance of these tissue-specific differences in the developmental regulation of the expression of IGF-II RNA remains to be established, they exhibit intriguing temporal correlations with major maturational events in some tissues such as lung and muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1496679328,"Extraction of stage 22-23 chick embryo limb buds that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate yielded heparan sulfate proteoglycan, small chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (designated PG-M). PG-M constituted over 60% of the total macromolecular [35S]sulfates. It was larger in hydrodynamic size, richer in protein, and contained fewer chondroitin sulfate chains as compared to the predominant proteoglycan (PG-H, Mr congruent to 1.5 X 10(6)) of chick embryo cartilage. The chondroitin sulfate chains were notable for their large size (Mr greater than or equal to 60,000) and high content of nonsulfated chondroitin units (about 20% of the total hexosamine). Hexosamine-containing chains corresponding in size to N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides were also present. The core protein was rich in serine, glutamic acid (glutamine), and glycine which together comprised about 38% of the total amino acids. Following chondroitinase AC II (or ABC) digestion, core molecules were obtained which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis as a doublet of bands with approximately Mr = 550,000 (major) and 500,000, respectively. The Mr = 550,000 core glycoprotein was structurally different from the core glycoprotein (Mr congruent to 400,000) of PG-H, as ascertained by tryptic peptide mapping and immunochemical criteria. Immunofluorescent localization of PG-M showed that the intensity of PG-M staining progressively became higher in the core mesenchyme region than in the peripheral loose mesenchyme, closely following the condensation of mesenchymal cells. Since the cell condensation process has been shown to begin with the increase of fibronectin and type I collagen concentration, the similar change in PG-M distribution suggests that PG-M plays an important role in the cell condensation process by means of its interaction with fibronectin and type I collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1584902893,"The surface coat of Trypanosoma brucei is composed of 10(7) molecules of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Each VSG molecule is tethered to the cell membrane by a glycolipid moiety which contains 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylinositol (Ferguson, M. A. J., Low, M. G., and Cross, G. A. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14547-14555). Following cell lysis, an endogenous phospholipase C cleaves dimyristoyl glycerol from the glycolipid, releasing soluble VSG. We have purified this enzyme, which we designate VSG lipase, by detergent extraction, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, hydrophobic chromatography, and cation exchange chromatography. It is purified 2600-fold and is virtually homogeneous. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the apparent molecular mass is 37 kDa. In solutions containing the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), the Stokes radius (2.6 nm), S20,w (3.7 S), and v (0.77 cm3/g) of VSG lipase suggest a molecular mass for the native enzyme of about 47 kDa, part of which may be due to bound CHAPS. Therefore, it is probably monomeric. VSG lipase does not require Ca2+; it is stimulated by chelating agents or dithiothreitol, and it is inhibited by some sulfhydryl reagents. The purified enzyme appears to be highly specific. Under the conditions of our assay, it cleaves the VSG glycolipid, a biosynthetic precursor of the VSG glycolipid, and, to a much lesser extent, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylinositol. There was no apparent cleavage of other myristate-containing lipids of trypanosomes or 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W2138841151,"We have determined the complete sequence of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 cDNA. It is 14.1 kilobases in length and codes for a 4563-amino acid protein, including a 27-amino acid signal peptide and a 4536-amino acid mature protein. Further, we identified 2366 residues of apoB-100 by direct sequence analysis of apoB-100 tryptic peptides. The mature peptide is characterized by high hydrophobicity (0.916 kcal/residue) and predicted beta-sheet content (21%). Dot matrix analysis revealed the presence of many long internal repeats in apoB-100. The mature peptide contains 25 cysteine residues, 12 of which are in the N-terminal 500 residues. Twenty potential N-linked glycosylation sites were identified, of which 13 were proven to be glycosylated, and 4 were found not to be glycosylated by direct analysis of tryptic peptides. Our findings on apoB structure provide a basis for future experimentation on the role of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1974686680,"We report nucleotide sequences of cDNAs for the nuclear genes encoding chloroplast (GapA and GapB) and cytosolic (GapC) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDH) from N. tabacum. Comparison of nucleotide sequences indicates that the GapA and GapB genes evolved following duplication of an ancestral gene about 450 million years ago. However, the divergence of GapA/B and GapC occurred much earlier in evolution than the divergence of GapC and GAPDH genes of animals and fungi, suggesting that chloroplast and cytosolic GAPDHs evolved from different lineages. Comparison of amino acid sequences shows that the chloroplast GAPDHs are related to GAPDHs found in thermophilic bacteria, while the cytosolic GAPDH is related to the GAPDH found in mesophilic prokaryotes. These results strongly support the symbiotic origin of chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1519059617,"Two proteins of Mr = 58,000 and 59,000, respectively, were purified from 4 M guanidinium chloride extracts of articular cartilage by dissociative CsCl-density gradient centrifugation followed by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200 and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The two proteins differ in ionic properties and only the one with Mr = 59,000 bound to the ion exchanger. Although the two proteins showed dissimilar peptide patterns after proteolysis, their amino acid composition was similar, with very high contents of leucine and aspartic acid/asparagine. The two proteins showed no cross-reactivity in radioimmunoassays. By use of these assays, the proteins were demonstrated in extracts of most connective tissues, with high contents of about 0.1% of tissue wet weight determined in several types of cartilage. Among the non-cartilage connective tissues, tendon and sclera had the highest contents of the proteins, i.e. about 0.1% of the tissue wet weight. Bone extracts, on the other hand, contained insignificant amounts of the proteins. Only the Mr = 59,000 protein was detected in serum, its concentration being about 33 micrograms/l. Both proteins were shown to be localized in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, predominantly in the territorial matrix, by using indirect immunofluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1482082412,"There is an inverse relationship between cellular proliferation and smooth muscle alpha-isoactin expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Owens, G.K., Loeb, A., Gordon, D., and Thompson, M.M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 343-352). In the present studies, changes in isoactin expression were studied during developmental growth of rat aortic SMCs (ages 1-180 days) to better understand interrelationships between growth and cytodifferentiation in these cells in vivo. Actin expression (i.e. content and synthesis) was evaluated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and using isoactin-specific antibodies. The major actin present in cells from newborn rats was nonmuscle beta-actin (56% of total actin), whereas cells from adult animals contained principally smooth muscle alpha-actin (Sm-alpha-actin) (76% of total actin). Increases in Sm-alpha-actin content with increasing age were due, in part, to an increase in Sm-alpha-actin synthesis. However, in SMCs from 90- and 180-day-old rats, the fractional content of Sm-alpha-actin exceeded its fractional synthesis at a time when total Sm-alpha-actin content was increasing. This suggests that Sm-alpha-actin turns over more slowly in mature animals. Decreases in the frequency of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis with age could not account for increases in Sm-alpha-actin expression with age. However, combined immunocytological and [3H]thymidine autoradiographic studies demonstrated that nearly 50% of the medial derived cells from newborn rat aortas did not show detectable staining with a monoclonal antibody to smooth muscle-specific isoactins, and the replicative frequency was much higher in these cells than in cells that contained Sm-alpha-isoactins. Taken together, the results of the present studies and previous studies in cultured SMCs support the hypothesis that cessation of proliferation during development is associated with the induction of Sm-alpha-actin expression, but that factors other than cellular growth state play an important role in determining the level of Sm-alpha-actin expression in fully differentiated SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W1494849181,"Although the steps involved in biosynthesis and secretion of the neuropeptide vasopressin (AVP) have been extensively studied, the factors which regulate AVP gene expression remain unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the dynamics of AVP mRNA accumulation in response to a strong stimulus for AVP release, i.e. during salt imbibition and the ensuing period of rehydration. AVP mRNA levels were determined in terms of absolute amounts by a novel quantitative densitometric hybridization assay, using in vitro synthesized sense-strand RNA as a quantitative standard and complementary anti-sense RNA as a specific probe. The template used for RNA transcription consisted of a 196-base pair genomic DNA fragment corresponding to exon C of the rat AVP gene. Determination of basal hypothalamic AVP mRNA levels yielded 12.5 +/- 2.7 fmol/hypothalamus. Salt imbibition, which induced a 6% rise in blood osmolality and an 82% loss of pituitary AVP, resulted in a 3-fold increase of AVP mRNA to 35 +/- 5 fmol/hypothalamus. Following rehydration, plasma osmolality returned to control levels by day 2, pituitary AVP by day 6, and hypothalamic AVP by day 14. By contrast, AVP mRNA levels remained significantly elevated throughout the 30-day rehydration period. Furthermore, pituitary AVP reached a level of 177% of control by day 14 of rehydration. These data show that osmotic stimulation results in a long-lasting elevation of hypothalamic AVP mRNA; during rehydration, these elevated mRNA levels direct AVP biosynthesis at a rate which surpasses secretory demands; AVP mRNA accumulation does not appear to be directly regulated by either pituitary or hypothalamic AVP. Therefore, either an unusually long half-life of greater than or equal to 7 days must be assumed for AVP mRNA or, alternatively, a continued stimulation of AVP gene transcription must occur, even in the absence of a secretory stimulus and following complete repletion of cellular AVP stores."

https://openalex.org/W1540879137,"The inter- and intrasubunit disulfide bridges for the 11 S form of acetylcholinesterase isolated from Torpedo californica have been identified. Localized within the basal lamina of the synapse, the dimensionally asymmetric forms of acetylcholinesterase contain either two (13 S) or three (17 S) sets of catalytic subunits linked to collagenous and noncollagenous structural subunits. Limited proteolysis of these molecules yields a tetramer of catalytic subunits that sediments at 11 S. Each catalytic subunit contains 8 cysteine residues which were identified following tryptic digestion of the reduced, 14C-carboxymethylated protein. The tryptic peptides were purified by gel filtration followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then sequenced. The disulfide bonding profile was determined by treating the native, nonreduced 11 S form of acetylcholinesterase with a fluorescent, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, monobromobimane, prior to tryptic digestion. Peptides again were resolved by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. One fluorescent cysteine-containing peptide was identified, indicating that a single sulfhydryl residue, Cys231, was present in its reduced form. Three pairs of disulfide-bonded peptides were identified. These were localized in the polypeptide chain based on the cDNA-deduced sequence of the protein and were identified as Cys67-Cys94, Cys254-Cys265, and Cys402-Cys521. Hence, three loops are found in the secondary structure. Cys572, located in the carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide, was disulfide-bonded to an identical peptide and most likely forms an intersubunit cross-link. Since the 6 cysteine residues in acetylcholinesterase that are involved in intrachain disulfide bonds are conserved in the sequence of the homologous protein thyroglobulin, it is likely that both proteins share a common folding pattern in their respective tertiary structures. Cys231 and the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue Cys572 are not conserved in thyroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1549461809,"A soluble radioreceptor assay has been developed to characterize thrombin receptor activities of the human platelet membrane. 125I-Thrombin was added to platelet membranes solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and thrombin bound to platelet receptors was separated from free thrombin by precipitation with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in the presence of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein as carrier. Both high affinity binding (Ki, 0.09 nM; R1, 0.30 pmol/mg protein) and moderate affinity binding (K2, 38 nM; R2, 72 pmol/mg protein) were detected in the detergent-solubilized membrane preparations and these binding parameters were in excellent agreement with values previously determined using intact platelets (Harmon, J. T., and Jamieson, G. A. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 58-64). Using the soluble radioreceptor assay, both high and moderate affinity binding was detected in highly purified preparations of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and glycocalicin, and the binding isotherms were identical with those of the crude detergent-solubilized membrane preparation. Treatment of detergent-solubilized membranes with increasing concentrations of a monospecific polyclonal antibody to glycocalicin resulted in the stepwise depletion of GPIb and concomitant reductions of thrombin binding activity. These results demonstrate that both high and moderate affinity binding of thrombin to platelets is completely expressed in the glycocalicin portion of GPIb."
https://openalex.org/W2008165954,"RNA from T4-infected cells yielded multiple end-labeled species when incubated with α-32P-GTP under self-splicing conditions. One of these corresponds to the previously identified intron from the td gene of T4, while others appear to represent additional group I introns in T4. Two loci distinct from the td gene were found to hybridize to a mixed α-32P-GTP-labeled T4 RNA probe. These mapped in or near the unlinked genes nrdB and nrdC. A fragment from the nrdB region that contains the intron has been cloned and shown to generate characteristic group I splice products with RNA synthesized in vivo and in vitro. Multiple introns, and the prospect that these occur within several genes in the same metabolic pathway, suggest a possible regulatory role for splicing in T4."
https://openalex.org/W1485679638,"Hormonally regulated proteinaceous material secreted in hamster vaginal discharge is detected via the vomeronasal organ and elicits copulatory behavior in males. The major soluble protein in estrous vaginal discharge has been isolated, characterized by molecular weight and amino acid content, and shown to have substantial aphrodisiac activity. The aphrodisiac activity of the purified protein is abolished by heating or proteolysis, and the native protein retains the activity after procedures for removing possible ligands such as volatile odorants, steroids, and peptides. This evidence that the protein is a reproductive pheromone indicates that the mammalian vomeronasal organ can mediate sensory detection of behaviorally relevant macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1536577597,"A superoxide-forming oxidase from activated human neutrophil membranes was solubilized by two slightly different methods, then purified by dye-affinity chromatography. Kinetic studies of the purified preparations gave Vmax values of 5-10 mumol of O-2/min/mg of protein, and Km values for NADH and NADPH that were in reasonable agreement with values determined previously using particulate and crude solubilized preparations of the respiratory burst oxidase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed prominent bands at 67, 48, and 32 kDa, together with some minor contaminants, whereas gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions gave a single major band that when eluted and re-electrophoresed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed bands at 67, 48, 32 kDa. We believe that all three bands represent oxidase components. The flavin content of the purified enzyme was 20.4 +/- 2.0 S.E. pmol of FAD/microgram of protein, whereas heme averaged 0.1 +/- 0.02 pmol/microgram and ubiquinone could not be detected. Assuming that the enzyme is composed of one 67-kDa subunit, one 48-kDa subunit, and one 32-kDa subunit (i.e. that its molecular mass is approximately 150 kDa), it can be calculated to have a turnover number of 700-1500 min-1, in agreement with a value reported previously for oxidase in a particulate O-2-forming system (Cross, A. R., Parkinson, J. F., and Jones, O. T. G. (1985) Biochem. J. 226, 881-884), and to contain the following quantities of redox carriers (mol/mol): FAD, 3.0; heme, 0.015; ubiquinone, less than 0.06. It remains to be determined whether this preparation represents the complete respiratory burst oxidase or is only the pyridine nucleotide dehydrogenating component of a more complex enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1562800721,"Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from Manduca sexta has a molecular weight of 18,100. Based on its hydrodynamic properties (sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, frictional ratio, intrinsic viscosity) and its behavior during gel permeation chromatography, we concluded that apoLp-III is a prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of about 3. The circular dichroic spectrum of apoLp-III suggests that the protein contains approximately 50% alpha-helix. At the air-water interface, apoLp-III forms a monolayer which is gaseous at surface pressures less than or equal to 1 dyne/cm. The isotherm of this phase yields an excluded molecular area of 3800 A2/molecule (23 A2/amino acid). At a surface pressure of 22.1 dynes/cm, the monolayer undergoes a phase transition reminiscent of a first-order phase transition of pure lipids. The monolayer can be compressed in this surface pressure range to an area per molecule of 480 A2 (2.9 A2/amino acid). Since a globular protein of molecular weight 18,100 could occupy an area of only about 2000 A2 when bound to a surface, it is suggested that in the expanded state, apoLp-III must unfold on the surface, whereas in the compressed state, the molecule is oriented with its minor axis parallel to the water surface. ApoLp-III binds with high affinity (Kd = 1.9 X 10(-7)M) to both phosphatidylcholine- and diacylglycerol-coated polystyrene beads. All of these results are consistent with the proposal that apoLp-III plays a key role in increasing the capacity of the insect lipoprotein, lipophorin, to transport diacylglycerol by stabilizing the increment of lipid-water interface that results from diacylglycerol uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1572699553,"Apoferritin catalyzes the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). Ferroxidase activity is assayed and characterized by coupling the oxidation with the binding of Fe(III) to transferrin. The initial rate of Fe(II) oxidation is dependent on apoferritin and initial Fe(II) concentration but independent of transferrin concentration. The ferroxidase activity is inhibited by Zn(II). Ferritins with varying loads of iron have the same ferroxidase activity level. It is suggested that the described oxidation process represents the initial step of iron deposition in apoferritin. Since transferrin can intercept Fe(III) before it is deposited in apoferritin, active sites for Fe(II) oxidation must be on or near the surface of apoferritin. This finding is contrary to the current view of apoferritin-catalyzed oxidation of Fe(II) which places active sites in the channels to the core or inside the central core."
https://openalex.org/W1574038640,"Specific assays, based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography, were used to quantify the conversion of retinol and retinal into retinoic acid by the pig kidney cell line LLC-PK1. Retinoic acid synthesis was linear for 2-4 h as well as with graded amounts of either substrate to at least 50 microM. Retinoic acid concentrations increased through 6-8 h, but decreased thereafter because of substrate depletion (t1/2 of retinol = 13 h) and product metabolism (1/2 = 2.3 h). Retinoic acid metabolism was accelerated by treating cells with 100 nM retinoic acid for 10 h (t1/2 = 1.7 h) and was inhibited by the antimycotic imidazole ketoconazole. Feedback inhibition was not indicated since retinoic acid up to 100 nM did not inhibit its own synthesis. Retinol dehydrogenation was rate-limiting. The reduction and dehydrogenation of retinal were 4-8-fold and 30-60-fold faster, respectively. Greater than 95% of retinol was converted into metabolites other than retinoic acid, whereas the major metabolite of retinal was retinoic acid. The synthetic retinoid 13-cis-N-ethylretinamide inhibited retinoic acid synthesis, but 4-hydroxylphenylretinamide did not. 4'-(9-Acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide, an inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase, and ethanol did not inhibit retinoic acid synthesis. 4-Methylpyrazole was a weak inhibitor: disulfiram was a potent inhibitor. These data indicate that retinol dehydrogenase is a sulfhydryl group-dependent enzyme, distinct from ethanol dehydrogenase. Homogenates of LLC-PK1 cells converted retinol into retinoic acid and retinyl palmitate and hydrolyzed retinyl palmitate. This report suggests that substrate availability, relative to enzyme activity/amount, is a primary determinant of the rate of retinoic acid synthesis, identifies inhibitors of retinoic acid synthesis, and places retinoic acid synthesis into perspective with several other known pathways of retinoid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1588828021,"The mechanism of the Cu-Zn-containing superoxide dismutase (SD) was studied using a stopped-flow spectrophotometric system capable of forming aqueous solutions of O2- having initial concentrations up to approximately 5 mM. By lowering the temperature to 5.5 degrees C, we were able to observe saturation of the enzyme. At 5.5 degrees C and pH 9.3, the Michaelis-Menten parameters extracted from the kinetic traces were turnover number (TN) approximately 1 X 10(6) s-1, Km approximately 3.5 X 10(-3) M. Under our conditions, the average rate at which O-2 binds to the active site, TN/Km is 0.26 X 10(9) M-1 s-1. TN was decreased in the presence of D2O, and a solvent isotope effect of TNH/TND approximately 3.6 was measured while TN/Km was essentially unaffected by D2O. TN was increased by the presence of the general acid, ND4+. These observations, by analogy to earlier work with Fe X SD from Escherichia coli (Bull, C., and Fee, J. A. (1985) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107, 3295-3304), suggest that H2O serves to donate the protons required to form product H2O2. Values of Km and TN for the zinc-deficient enzyme were found to be approximately a factor of 2 less than those obtained for the holoenzyme under identical experimental conditions, whereas TN/Km was largely unchanged. The imidazolate bridge is thus not essential for catalytically competent extraction of a proton from the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1522094092,"The guinea pig temporalis muscle is sexually dimorphic, classified histochemically as a fast-red muscle in the female, but as a fast-white muscle in the adult male. Since this sexual difference in metabolic properties is related to plasma testosterone levels, we asked if testosterone also affected the contractile protein isoforms. In the newborn guinea pig, both male and female temporalis muscles contained a fast-red isoform of the myosin heavy chain and approximately equal amounts of alpha- and beta-tropomyosins. At puberty, the male began to replace the fast-red isoform with a fast-white isoform of the heavy chain and by 120 days the muscle contained predominantly the fast-white myosin heavy chain. This transition in myosins in the male was accompanied by a shift to greater than 90% alpha-tropomyosin. No changes in myosins or tropomyosins were observed in the female. The changes in the male could be reversed by castration and could be mimicked in the female by the injection of testosterone. Although these same myosins and tropomyosins could be detected in other fast-twitch muscles, postpartum transitions in contractile protein isoforms in those muscles were testosterone-insensitive, and no sexual dimorphism of these proteins was seen in other muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1487882441,"It is shown that barley (Hordeum vulgare), a dark monovinyl/light divinyl plant species, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) a dark divinyl/light divinyl plant species synthesize monovinyl and divinyl protochlorophyllide in darkness from monovinyl and divinyl protoporphyrin IX via two distinct monovinyl and divinyl monocarboxylic chlorophyll biosynthetic routes. Evidence for the operation of monovinyl monocarboxylic biosynthetic routes consisted (a) in demonstrating the conversion of delta-aminolevulinic acid to monovinyl protoporphyrin and to monovinyl Mg-protoporphyrins, and (b) in demonstrating the conversion of these tetrapyrroles to monovinyl protochlorophyllide by both isolated barley and cucumber etiochloroplasts. Likewise, evidence for the operation of divinyl monocarboxylic chlorophyll biosynthetic routes consisted (a) in demonstrating the biosynthesis of divinyl protoporphyrin and divinyl Mg-protoporphyrins from delta-aminolevulinic acid, and (b) in demonstrating the conversion of the latter tetrapyrroles to divinyl protochlorophyllide. Finally, it was shown that the divinyl tetrapyrrole substrates were metabolized differently by barley and cucumber. For example, divinyl protoporphyrin, divinyl Mg-protoporphyrin, and divinyl Mg-protoporphyrin monoester were converted predominantly to monovinyl protochlorophyllide and to smaller amounts of divinyl protochlorophyllide by barley etiochloroplasts. In contrast, cucumber etiochloroplasts converted the above substrates predominantly to divinyl protochlorophyllide, although smaller amounts of monovinyl protochlorophyllide were also formed. Furthermore, it was shown that monovinyl protochlorophyllide was not formed from divinyl protochlorophyllide either in barley or in cucumber etiochloroplasts. These metabolic differences are explained by the presence of strong biosynthetic interconnections between the divinyl and monovinyl monocarboxylic routes, prior to divinyl protochlorophyllide formation, in barley but not in cucumber."

The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was 75,000 by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and the isoelectric point was at pH 8.0. The enzyme was maximally active at pH 4.5 and was unstable at increasing temperatures. Intracellular pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase cleaved both terminal and internal gamma-glutamate linkages. In contrast, brush-border pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of only terminal gamma-glutamate linkages. The intracellular enzyme showed greatest affinity for the complete folic acid molecule with longer glutamate chains. Subcellular fractionation studies showed the intracellular enzyme was localized in lysosomes. These data show that the properties of human jejunal intracellular pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase are distinct from those of the brush-border enzyme but are similar to the properties of intracellular pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase described in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1606418264,"Sea urchin eggs contain a small molecular weight heat-stable factor that confers cyanide-resistant NAD(P)H-O2 oxidoreductase activity on ovoperoxidase (Turner, E., Somers, C. E., and Shapiro, B. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13163-13171), the enzyme responsible for cross-linking the extracellular protein coat (fertilization membrane) of the egg. Here we report the isolation of the active cofactor and its identification by ultraviolet, NMR, and mass spectroscopy as a new sulfur-containing amino acid derivative, 1-methyl-alpha N,alpha N-dimethyl-4-thiohistidine, or ovothiol. Ovothiol reacts slowly with atmospheric oxygen or rapidly with micromolar concentrations of H2O2 to form ovothiol disulfide, which is inactive as a cofactor for the ovoperoxidase NAD(P)H oxidase. Reduced active ovothiol is regenerated by treatment with disulfide reductants and shows significant differences in its ultraviolet and NMR spectra from oxidized ovothiol. The oxidoreductase activity of the ovoperoxidase/ovothiol system is similar to that previously characterized with crude cofactor preparations; it is greatly enhanced by Mn2+ and is relatively insensitive to CN-, compared to the peroxidase activity of ovoperoxidase. The ovothiol content of eggs is estimated as 1.8 pmol/egg or an intracellular concentration of 6.8 mM. This concentration exceeds the amount of reductant needed for the CN-(-)insensitive oxygen consumption following fertilization and used in the production of H2O2 for fertilization membrane cross-linking. Whether ovothiol is involved in the cross-linking reaction, protects the egg from damage from H2O2, or has another role in development remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1806544363,"This study was undertaken to further establish the nature of the low molecular weight metal-binding proteins in rat testes. In all cases, control testes were compared to livers of zinc-treated rats, which are known to contain high concentrations of metallothionein. Gel filtration of testicular and hepatic cytosol revealed a major zinc- and/or cadmium-binding protein in the low molecular weight range in both tissues. This protein could be partially purified from either source by a combination of heat treatment and sequential acetone precipitation. When such partially purified preparations were further fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography using a linear gradient of 25%-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, two major forms with similar retention times were seen in each tissue. The utility of this high performance liquid chromatography system for separating isoforms of metallothionein was verified by separation of commercially available purified rabbit hepatic metallothionein into a total of five separate forms. Amino acid analysis of the two proteins derived from rat liver was consistent with the known amino acid composition of metallothionein. However, the two testicular forms separated by high performance liquid chromatography were notably different in amino acid composition from metallothionein, with a distinctly lower content of cysteine. These results indicate that the major low molecular weight cadmium/zinc-binding proteins in rat testes are not metallothioneins."
https://openalex.org/W1664950994,"The intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching which accompanies the heparin-accelerated inhibition of thrombin (T) by antithrombin III (AT) was resolved into a heparin-independent component associated with formation of the product T-AT complex and a component associated with an AT conformational change linked to heparin dissociation. To determine whether dissociation of heparin from the product T-AT complex limits the rate at which heparin can turn over catalytically, the kinetics of protein fluorescence quenching during the reaction of thrombin with AT X heparin complex (AT X H) were investigated by stopped-flow fluorimetry under pseudo-first order conditions ([AT X H]o much greater than [T]o). Both fluorescence components were quenched in a single exponential reaction with a hyperbolic dependence of the first order rate constant (kobs) on [AT X H]o. An indistinguishable hyperbolic dependence of kobs on [AT X H]o was measured by displacement of p-aminobenzamidine from the T active site, with both signals extrapolating to a limiting rate constant of 5 s-1. These results indicate that heparin dissociation occurs concomitant with T-AT complex formation at the limiting 5 s-1 rate constant. In reasonable agreement with this value, a kcat of 2.3 s-1 was determined for heparin turnover at catalytic concentrations. We conclude that formation of the T-AT complex is the primary rate-limiting step in heparin catalytic turnover and that this reaction is accompanied by a change in conformation of the AT component resulting in facile heparin dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1603127472,"We have used the technique of density labeling of proteins by biosynthetic incorporation of 2H, 13C, 15N (dense) amino acids to study the synthesis and degradation rates of the progesterone receptor in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. In cells grown in the absence of progestin, sucrose gradient shift analyses reveal that it takes 17 h for the normal density progesterone receptor levels to be reduced to half the initial value, whereas in the presence of 10 nM of the synthetic progestin [3H]R5020, the receptor turns over more rapidly, such that the normal density R5020-occupied progesterone receptor complexes are reduced to half in 12 h. The accelerated progesterone receptor turnover in the presence of [3H]R5020 reflects increased turnover rates of both the A (Mr-85,000) and B (Mr-115,000) subunits, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analyses of dense and light receptors photoaffinity labeled with [3H]R5020. In both control and progestin-exposed cells, the time course of progesterone receptor turnover shows a lag of approximately 6 h after dense (15N, 13C, 2H) amino acid exposure, before dense hormone binding receptor species are seen and before normal density progestin binding activity starts decreasing. Since our evaluations of progesterone receptor depend upon its binding of radiolabeled ligand ([3H]R5020), this lag in the density shift kinetics would be consistent with the presence of a non-hormone binding biosynthetic precursor, from which the hormone-binding form of progesterone receptor is derived. A kinetic model is used to analyze the lag-decay profiles and to determine the rate constants for progesterone receptor synthesis, activation to the hormone-binding form, and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1583303443,"Chicken liver fatty acid synthase is rapidly inactivated and cross-linked at pH 7.2 and 8.0 by incubation with low concentrations of common biological disulfides including glutathione disulfide, coenzyme A disulfide, and glutathione-coenzyme A-mixed disulfide. Glutathione disulfide inactivation of the enzyme is accompanied by the oxidation of a total of 4-5 enzyme thiols per monomer. Only one glutathione equivalent is incorporated per monomer as a protein-mixed disulfide, and its rate of incorporation is significantly slower than the rate of inactivation. The formation of protein-SS-protein disulfides results in significant cross-linking of enzyme subunits. The inactive enzyme is rapidly and completely reactivated, and the cross-linking is completely reversed by incubation of the enzyme with thiols (10-20 mM) including dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, and glutathione. In a glutathione redox buffer (GSH + GSSG), disulfide bond formation comes to equilibrium. The enzyme activity at equilibrium is dependent both on the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide and on the total glutathione concentration. The equilibrium constant for the redox equilibration of fatty acid synthase in a glutathione redox buffer is 15 mM (Ered + GSSG in equilibrium Eox + 2GSH). The formation of at least one protein-protein disulfide per monomer dominates the redox properties of the enzyme while the formation of one protein-mixed disulfide with glutathione (Kmixed = 0.45) has little effect on activity. The oxidation equilibrium constant suggests that there would be no significant cycling between the reduced and the oxidized enzyme in response to likely physiological variations in the hepatic glutathione status. The possibility that changes in the concentration of cellular glutathione may act as a mechanism for metabolic control of other enzymes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561514817,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been purified from homogenates of Ascaris suum muscle strips to apparent homogeneity as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification is a three-step procedure which yields pure enzyme in milligram quantities with good yield. The subunit molecular weight of the Ascaris enzyme is between 75,000 and 80,000. The native molecular weight is 83,000 as determined by gel filtration. The kinetic constants for substrates of the carboxylation reaction were determined and compared to those measured for the avian liver enzyme. From kinetic studies it appears likely that two separate roles for divalent metal ions exist in the catalytic process. Studies conducted with Mn2+ or with micromolar concentrations of Mn2+, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ suggest that Mn2+ but not Mg2+ binds directly to and activates the enzyme while either Mn2+ or Mg2+ may bind to the nucleotide resulting in the metal-nucleotide complex. The metal-nucleotide is the active form of the substrate for the reaction. In the presence of Mg2+, an increase in the Mn2+ concentration results in a decrease in the Km for P-enolpyruvate suggesting a direct role for Mn2+ stimulation and regulation of activity. The concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+ in Ascaris muscle strips were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and support the proposed hypothesis of a specific Mn2+ activation of the enzyme. The nucleotides ATP and ITP act as competitive inhibitors against GTP with KI values of 0.50 and 0.75 mM, respectively. ITP is a competitive inhibitor against both IDP and P-enolpyruvate, suggesting overlapping binding sites for the two substrates on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1504598037,"We report the determination of the complete DNA sequence for c beta 3, a chicken beta-tubulin gene which we show to be the dominant beta-tubulin expressed in testis. Like all previously studied vertebrate beta-tubulin genes, the gene is divided into four exon sequences interrupted by three intervening sequences (located between amino acids 19 and 20, within codon 56, and within codon 93). Analysis of the program of expression of this gene indicates that it encodes the dominant chicken testis beta-tubulin, although it is also expressed at lower levels in a wide variety of cell and tissue types. Comparison of the predicted polypeptide sequence for c beta 3 with four other available chicken beta-tubulin genes confirms our earlier suggestion that within an otherwise conserved framework, sequences within two variable region domains serve to define specific beta-tubulin polypeptide isotypes. The data indicate that the c beta 3 gene encodes a unique beta-tubulin isotype which diverges from the dominant neuronal beta-tubulin isotype in 18 of 445 residues (4%). Although the protein coding regions of the c beta 3 gene are highly homologous to the chicken c beta 1, c beta 2, c beta 4, and c beta 5 genes previously reported by us, no significant sequence homology with these previously analyzed genes is discernible in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated region sequences, in the intervening sequences, or in the presumptive transcriptional promoter sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1559461130,"Enzymes from Salvia officinalis and Tanacetum vulgare leaf epidermis catalyze the conversion of the acyclic precursor geranyl pyrophosphate to the cyclic monoterpenes (+)- and (-)-bornyl pyrophosphate, respectively. The antipodal cyclizations are considered to proceed by the initial isomerization of the substrate to the respective bound tertiary allylic intermediates (-)-(3R)- and (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate. [(3R)-8,9-14C,(3RS)-1E-3H] Linalyl pyrophosphate (3H:14C = 5.22) was tested as a substrate with the cyclases from both sources to determine the configuration of the cyclizing intermediate. This substrate yielded (-)-bornyl pyrophosphate with 3H:14C ratio greater than 31, indicating specific utilization of (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate as predicted. With the (+)-bornyl pyrophosphate cyclase, the 3H:14C ratio of the product was about 4.16, indicating a preference for the (-)-(3R)-enantiomer, but the ability also to utilize (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate. (3R)- and (3S)-[1Z-3H]Linalyl pyrophosphate were separately compared to the achiral precursors [1-3H] geranyl pyrophosphate and [1-3H]neryl pyrophosphate (cis-isomer) as substrates for the cyclizations. All functional precursors afforded optically pure (-)-(1S,4S)-bornyl pyrophosphate with the T. vulgare-derived cyclase (as determined by chromatographic separation of diastereomeric ketals of the derived ketone camphor), and (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate was the preferred substrate. With the (+)-bornyl pyrophosphate cyclase from S. officinalis, geranyl, neryl, and (-)-(3R)-linalyl pyrophosphates gave the expected (+)-(1R,4R)-stereoisomer as the sole product, and (-)-(3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate was the preferred substrate. However, (3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate yielded (-)-(1S,4S)-bornyl pyrophosphate, albeit at lower rates, indicating the ability of this enzyme to catalyze the anomalous enantiomeric cyclization."
https://openalex.org/W1574147401,"Rapid destabilization of FSH receptor after solubilization by detergents is a serious problem complicating its purification and further study. We have developed a procedure for the solubilization of stable and functional FSH receptors with Triton X-100. The new protocol selectively utilizes pure lighter membranes isolated from bovine calf testes by preparative sucrose density gradient centrifugation as the source of receptor. The conditions of detergent solubilization were optimized to reduce the required ratio of Triton X-100 to membrane protein to a minimum. In addition, during detergent extraction the membranes were treated with petroleum ether to remove interfering neutral lipids, thus facilitating solubilization of FSH receptors by the detergent. FSH receptors so obtained appeared to be soluble by criteria such as failure to sediment at 145,000 X g after 90 min, passage through 0.22-micron Millipore filters, and retardation upon chromatography on Sepharose 6B column. Approximately 86% of receptors originally present in the light membranes were recovered after solubilization, with a 24-fold increase in specific activity. The detergent-soluble fraction has several interesting properties not previously reported. It contains only high affinity receptors for FSH (Ka = 1.02 X 10(10) M-1), which are stable in the absence of glycerol for 4 days at 1 degree C or 6 months at -80 degrees C. Luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin receptor activity usually associated with detergent-solubilized extracts of testes is low due to incomplete solubility of these receptors under the conditions utilized for solubilization of FSH receptors. Of particular interest is the ability of the receptor in the detergent extract to respond to added FSH with stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. Adenylate cyclase activity also responds to F- stimulation and the detergent extract retains full guanosine 5'-imidotriphosphate-binding activity. This suggests that under the extraction conditions employed, a high proportion of soluble receptors are associated with related components of the adenylate cyclase system. Our data are consistent with the notion that the solubilized hormone-binding sites represent the physiologically relevant and functional receptors originally present in the light membrane fraction of calf testis. The availability of this detergent-soluble, stable and functional receptor fraction in larger amounts (2.2 g of protein from each batch of 11.5 kg bovine calf testes) than heretofore possible should facilitate further studies on FSH receptor purification and its mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1531124972,"The conversion of the blood coagulation zymogen prothrombin to thrombin is associated with the production of several cleavage intermediates and products. In contrast to earlier studies of prothrombin cleavage in chemically defined systems, the current investigation examines the fragmentation of human prothrombin in normal plasma. Radiolabeled prothrombin was added to platelet-poor relipidated normal human plasma, and clotting was initiated with the addition of Ca(II) and kaolin. Analysis of the radiolabeled prothrombin cleavage products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol identified a heretofore unobserved product of prothrombin activation with an apparent molecular weight of 45,000. This product was identified as fragment 1 X 2 X 3, the NH2-terminal 286 amino acids of prothrombin. The product was isolated from a prothrombin digest by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-prothrombin:Ca(II) antibodies and by preparative gel electrophoresis. Its amino-terminal sequence is identical to that of prothrombin. Digestion of this product with either Factor Xa or thrombin yields, at a minimum, fragment 1 X 2 and fragment 1. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the products obtained by digestion with Factor Xa of the unknown activation product indicated 3 amino acid residues at each cycle consistent with the presence of fragment 1, fragment 2, and fragment 3. To unambiguously identify the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the product, its factor Xa digestion products were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Edman degradation of one peptide revealed the complete sequence of fragment 3. On this basis, we identify the Mr 45,000 polypeptide as fragment 1 X 2 X 3 and indicate that it is a prominent product of prothrombin conversion to thrombin when activation occurs in plasma."

Difluoromethyl diaminopimelate 1 does not irreversibly inactivate or strongly competitively inhibit either enzyme. Lanthionine sulfoxides (2ab, 2c, and 2d) are good competitive inhibitors (about 50% inhibition at 1 mM) of both decarboxylases. The meso and LL-isomers of lanthionine sulfone (3ab and 3c) and lanthionine (6ab and 6c) are weaker competitive inhibitors (about 50% inhibition at 10-20 mM). The corresponding DD-isomers (3d and 6d) are less effective. The N-modified analogs are the most potent competitive inhibitors. The inhibition constant (Ki) values for B. sphaericus and wheat germ decarboxylases with N-hydroxydiaminopimelate 4 (mixture of isomers) are 0.91 and 0.71 mM, respectively; for the N-aminodiaminopimelate 5 (mixture of isomers) the Ki values are 0.10 and 0.084 mM, respectively. These N-modified analogs do not effectively inhibit L-lysine decarboxylase. None of the compounds showed any time-dependent inactivation of the decarboxylases, in contrast to behavior of other pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes with analogous substrate derivatives. Possible mechanisms of inhibition are discussed. In preliminary tests for antibiotic activity 4 and 5 both gave 75% growth inhibition of Bacillus megaterium at 20 micrograms/ml in defined media. Other analogs (1----3) showed essentially no antibacterial activity."
https://openalex.org/W1620799981,"To determine if activation of the glucocorticoid receptor involves covalent charge modification of the steroid-binding protein, unactivated and activated IM-9 cell glucocorticoid receptors were examined by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As previously reported (Smith, A. C., and Harmon, J. M. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 4946-4951), two-dimensional electrophoresis of immunopurified, [3H]dexamethasone mesylate-labeled, steroid-binding protein from unactivated receptors resolves two 92-kDa isoforms (pI congruent to 5.7 and 6.0-6.5). After activation, the apparent pI of neither isoform was altered, indicating that there had been no covalent charge modification of the steroid-binding protein. Thus, the physicochemical changes observed after activation of the steroid receptor cannot be explained by dephosphorylation or other models which involve covalent charge modification of the steroid-binding protein. This conclusion was consistent with the observation that treatment of immunopurified, affinity-labeled receptors with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase did not alter the apparent pI values or distribution of the steroid-binding protein isoforms. However, chromatography of activated steroid-receptor complexes on DNA-cellulose revealed that only the more basic of the two steroid-binding protein isoforms bound to DNA. Therefore, the charge heterogeneity of the steroid-binding protein may be important in regulating the ability of the steroid-binding protein to interact with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1894071140,"The entropy and enthalpy changes which contribute to the thermodynamics of the B to Z transition were determined for three recombinant plasmids containing a (dC-dG)16 tract and for a plasmid containing a pair of (dT-dG)20 regions. For each base pair which adopts a left-handed conformation in the plasmids with (dC-dG)16 sequences, the delta HBZ and delta SBZ are -2.1 kcal/mol bp and -8.8 cal/K-mol bp, respectively. In the plasmid containing the (dT-dG)20 tracts, however, the delta HBZ and delta SBZ values are 0.58 kcal/mol bp and -0.76 cal/K-mol bp, respectively. Also, these determinations show that for each B-Z junction that forms in the plasmids containing the (dC-dG), the enthalpy and entropy changes are 24 kcal/mol junction and 65 cal/K-mol junction, whereas for the (dT-dG) plasmid, the enthalpy and entropy changes are -1.8 kcal/mol junction and -22 cal/K-mol junction, respectively. Those values for the enthalpy and entropy changes for the formation of a BZ junction in (dC-dG) and (dT-dG) plasmids suggest that the properties and possibly the structures of the junctions are different. Calculations using the enthalpy and entropy changes determined in this study reveal that the B to Z transition in plasmids containing (dC-dG) blocks are more temperature-dependent than the transitions in plasmids with (dT-dG) blocks. Surprisingly, at temperatures above 60 degrees C, calculations indicate that the B to Z transitions in (dT-dG) plasmids should be energetically favored over that transition in (dC-dG) plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W1485421662,"Hemoglobin I was isolated from nodules formed on the roots of Parasponia andersonii inoculated with Rhizobium strain CP 283. The rate of oxygen dissociation from Parasponia hemoglobin increases about 12-fold between pH 4 and 7, with apparent pK 6.4, to reach a limiting value of 14.8s-1. The optical spectrum of oxyhemoglobin in the visible region is also dependent on pH with pK near 6.4. The rate constant for oxygen combination with Parasponia hemoglobin increases about 7-8-fold between pH 4 and 7, with apparent pK 5.37, to reach a value of 1.67 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 at pH 7. The optical spectrum of deoxyhemoglobin in the visible region and the rate constant for carbon monoxide combination are also dependent on pH with apparent pK 5.65 and 5.75, respectively. The rate constant for carbon monoxide dissociation is independent of pH. The oxygen affinity of Parasponia hemoglobin, P50 = 0.049 torr at 20 degrees C, calculated from the kinetic constants at pH 7, is very great. At alkaline pH there is a prominent geminate reaction with oxygen and nitric oxide, with both subnanosecond and tens of nanosecond components. These reactions disappear at acid pH, with pK 6.4, and the effective quantum yield is reduced. In general, the reactions of Parasponia hemoglobin with oxygen and carbon monoxide resemble those of soybean leghemoglobin. In each, great oxygen affinity is achieved by unusually rapid oxygen combination together with a moderate rate of oxygen dissociation. We suggest that protonation of a heme-linked group with pK near 6.4 controls many properties of Parasponia oxyhemoglobin, and protonation of a group with pK near 5.5 controls many properties of Parasponia deoxyhemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1487006495,"5'-p-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) inactivates rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase exhibiting characteristics of an active site-directed reagent. The inactivation is not associated with the covalent binding of the reagent, but is correlated with the loss of 2 sulfhydryl groups/enzyme subunit (Takata, Y., and Fujioka, M. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4357-4362). Treatment of the FSBA-inactivated enzyme with iodoacetate in the absence of reducing agent and then with [14C] iodoacetate after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol yielded the enzyme containing approximately 2 mol of radiolabeled S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of subunit. Analysis of tryptic peptides showed that the radioactivity was associated with 2 carboxymethylcysteine-containing peptides whose amino acid sequences were: Trp-Ser-Ser-Cys(Cm)-Asn-Ile-Phe-Ser-Thr-Gln-Asp-His-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ile- Ala-Lys and Gly-Glu-Thr-Asp-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-Trp-Cys(Cm)-Ile-Glu-Gln-Thr-Leu-His-Phe- Lys, respectively. These results indicate that the inactivation of S-adenosylhomocysteinase by FSBA is the consequence of formation of a disulfide between two specific cysteine residues on each of the four identical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1523477175,"The low frequency resonance Raman spectra of photodissociated carbon monoxymyoglobin at cryogenic temperatures (4-77 K) differ from those of deoxymyoglobin. Intensity differences occur in several low frequency porphyrin modes, and intensity and frequency differences occur in the iron-histidine stretching mode. This mode appears at about 225 cm-1 in deoxymyoglobin. At the lowest temperature studied, approximately 4 K, the frequency of the iron-histidine stretching mode in the photoproduct is approximately 233 cm-1, and the intensity is very low. When the temperature of the photoproduct is increased, the intensity of the mode increases, but its frequency is unchanged. The differences between the photoproduct and the deoxy preparation persist to 77 K, the highest temperature studied, and are independent of whether samples are frozen in phosphate buffer or a 50:50 ethylene glycol/phosphate buffer mixture. It is proposed that the frequency of the iron-histidine stretching mode is governed by the tilt angle of the histidine with respect to the normal to the heme plane, and the intensity of the mode is governed by the overlap between the sigma orbital of the iron-histidine bond and the pi orbital of the porphyrin macrocycle. This model can account for differences between the resonance Raman spectra of the photoproduct and the deoxy preparations of both hemoglobin and myoglobin. Furthermore, by considering the F-helix motions in going from 6-coordinate to 5-coordinate hemoglobin and myoglobin, the heme relaxation of these proteins at room temperature with 10-ns pulses can be explained. Based on the findings reported here, low temperature relaxation pathways for both hemoglobin and myoglobin are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1495493181,"Abstract The Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) contains a binding site for aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonists that is distinct from the binding site for agonists and competitive antagonists. To characterize the location and function of this allosteric antagonist site, an alkylating analog of meproadifen has been synthesized, 2-(chloroethylmethylamino)-ethyl-2, 2-diphenylpentanoate HCl (meproadifen mustard). Reaction of [3H]meproadifen mustard with AChR-rich membrane suspensions resulted in specific incorporation of label predominantly into the AChR alpha-subunit with minor incorporation into the beta-subunit. Specific labeling required the presence of high concentration of agonist and was inhibited by reversible noncompetitive antagonists including proadifen, meproadifen, perhydrohistrionicotoxin (HTX), and tetracaine when present at concentrations consistent with the binding affinity of these compounds for the allosteric antagonist site. No specific alkylation of the AChR alpha-subunit was detected in the absence of agonist, or in the presence of the partial agonist phenyltrimethylammonium or the competitive antagonists, d-tubocurarine, gallamine triethiodide, or decamethonium. Reaction with 35 microM meproadifen mustard for 70 min in the presence of carbamylcholine produced no alteration in the concentration of [3H]ACh-binding sites, but decreased by 38 +/- 4% the number of allosteric antagonist sites as measured by [3H]HTX binding. This decrease was not observed when the alkylation reaction was blocked by the presence of HTX. These results lead us to conclude that meproadifen mustard alkylates the allosteric antagonist site in the Torpedo AChR and that part of that site is associated with the AChR alpha-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1607301385,"A new Ca2+-binding protein, called CaVP, has been detected in muscle of the cephalochordate amphioxus and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The Mr 18,000 protein (pI = 4.9) binds 2 Ca2+ atoms in a noncooperative way with an intrinsic binding constant of 8.2 X 10(6) M-1. Ca2+, but not Mg2+, induces a 10% increase in alpha-helical content in the metal-free protein. CaVP does not interact with chlorpromazine, but forms a Ca2+-dependent complex with melittin. In situ, CaVP forms a high affinity Ca2+-dependent complex with an Mr 36,000 protein present in muscle extracts of amphioxus. This complex has been purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and the target protein further purified after dissociation of the complex in the presence of Ca2+-chelating agents and 6 M urea. The nearly pure Mr 36,000 protein also forms a Ca2+-dependent complex with calmodulin which, however, is less stable during electrophoresis than the CaVP-Mr 36,000 protein complex. Amphioxus CaVP does not substitute for calmodulin in a specific enzyme assay nor for troponin C in restoring Ca2+ sensitivity to skinned muscle fibers. Its polyclonal antibody does not cross-react with the latter two activators. No immunological cross-reacting counterpart of CaVP was found in organs of fish and rat. Its relative abundance in amphioxus muscle indicates that CaVP must underlie an important new limb of Ca2+ regulation in this particular muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1505814097,"[2-14C]Acetone was infused into rats that were fed or fasted. Each was infused with either a trace quantity of acetone or a large quantity that resulted in a blood concentration of acetone of at least 4 mM. The distribution of 14C in the carbons of glucose from each rat was determined. Two of the rats were given acetone in their drinking water and one was diabetic. Whether a rat was chronically exposed to acetone, fed or fasted, normal or diabetic, if given the trace dose, over 80% of the 14C in the glucose it formed was in carbons 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the glucose. If a rat was given the large dose, about 50% was in carbons 3 and 4. Thus, the major determinant of the pathways followed by acetone when it is metabolized is its concentration and not the prior dietary state of the animal or its previous exposure to acetone. Incorporation into carbons 1, 2, 5, and 6 occurs in the conversion of the carbons of [2-14C]lactate into glucose, whereas incorporation into carbons 3 and 4 occurs in the conversion of the carbons of [1-14C]acetate into glucose. Therefore, at high acetone concentration, the pathway that has been proposed for acetone's metabolism via acetate predominates, and via acetate there can be no net synthesis of glucose from acetone. When rats were given cyanamide and then the large dose of acetone, 74% of the 14C in the glucose they formed was in carbons 3 and 4 of the glucoses. Thus, the relative contribution of the pathway to lactate, or its metabolic equivalent, that has been proposed appears to be lessened by the administration of an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor."

As these derivatives were inactive, we could determine the dissociation constants (Ks values) for the binding of beta-1,4-linked n-mer, a hexasaccharide of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, to [Gln35]lysozyme and [Asn52] lysozyme. The values of Ks at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C were 1.6 X 10(-5) M for [Gln35]lysozyme and 2.7 X 10(-5) M for [Asn52]lysozyme. These values are similar to that for native lysozyme. The results are direct proof for the involvements of Glu35 and Asp52 in the catalytic action of lysozyme. A method for ammonolysis of ester groups in proteins in liquid ammonia is described and will be useful for amidation of carboxyl groups of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1511233897,"Histidine residues that influence the chelate-mediated removal of iron from transferrin have been investigated. Diferric human serum transferrin was chemically modified to various extents using ethoxyformic anhydride, a reagent for histidines. A kinetic analysis of the modification reaction revealed the presence of a fast reacting pool of 9 +/- .8 histidine residues and a slow reacting pool of 5.8 +/- .6 residues. There are 18 histidine residues in transferrin. The rates of modification of the two pools differed by a factor of 5. The pyrophosphate-mediated removal of iron from the two binding sites of native and partially modified transferrins was studied at pH 6.9 using desferrioximine B as a terminal iron acceptor. Under these conditions, the rate of iron removal from the NH2-terminal site was about six times faster than from the COOH-terminal site. Both rates were significantly reduced, i.e. by a factor of approximately 6-8, upon complete ethoxyformylation of all reactive histidines on the protein. The kinetic data of partially modified transferrins were analyzed by the Tsou Chen-Lu statistical method; the results are consistent with the hypothesis that modification of a single uncoordinated histidine in each of the two iron binding domains stabilizes the protein kinetically against loss of iron. The dependence of the iron removal reaction on pH is consistent with such an interpretation. The putative histidines, although not ligands, may be close to the metal in both binding sites, thus influencing the rate of iron removal by pyrophosphate. These histidines belong to the pool of rapidly modified residues and thus are readily accessible to solvent and chelators."
https://openalex.org/W1529854028,"This paper describes a new method for solubilization and partial purification of a Na+-dependent phlorizin receptor from dog kidney proximal convoluted tubule. Selective solubilization is carried out with 0.1% Na+-deoxycholate followed by complete solubilization with 0.5% deoxycholate. The 100,000 X g supernatant of the deoxycholate extract is then subjected to a combination of chromatofocusing and gel exclusion chromatography. Purification is monitored by a new column assay which permits detection of the Na+-dependent high affinity phlorizin receptor in solubilized preparations. Na+-dependent phlorizin binding exhibits the same characteristics on the column assay as in intact brush border vesicles. Binding is temperature-dependent, inhibited by proteolytic agents, Na+-dependent, and inhibited by excess cold phlorizin and D-glucose but not L-glucose. Quantitation of specific binding at different stages of the isolation procedure indicates a final purification of approximately 80-140-fold compared to intact brush border membrane fragments. Enrichment of specific phlorizin binding is paralleled by enrichment of a 61-66-kDa polypeptide on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is postulated that this polypeptide contains both the Na and the sugar specific binding site and represents a subunit of the intact Na+-dependent glucose transporter from dog kidney proximal tubule brush border membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1489502165,"DL-threo-beta-Fluoroaspartate is a substrate for the two enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis that use aspartate, namely 4-(N-succino)-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (SAICAR) synthetase and adenylosuccinate synthetase. With both enzymes, Vmax with threo-beta-fluoroaspartate is about 50% of that observed with aspartate. The products of the two enzyme reactions, threo-beta-fluoro-SAICAR and threo-beta-fluoroadenylosuccinate, are inhibitors of adenylosuccinate lyase purified from rat skeletal muscle. In 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the KI values for threo-beta-fluoro-SAICAR are 5 and 3 microM and for threo-beta-fluoroadenylosuccinate are 3 and 1 microM, in the SAICAR and adenylosuccinate cleavage reactions, respectively. In 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.4, the KI values for threo-beta-fluoro-SAICAR are approximately 0.14 and 0.03 microM and for threo-beta-fluoroadenylosuccinate are approximately 0.05 and 0.015 microM, in the same two reactions, respectively. These KI values are one-half to one-hundredth of the Km values for SAICAR and adenylosuccinate, the two substrates of adenylosuccinate lyase. After an 8-h incubation with 45 microM threo-beta-fluoroaspartate, H4 cells contain 200-300 microM threo-beta-fluoro-SAICAR and 60-90 microM threo-beta-fluoroadenylosuccinate. These concentrations of fluoro analogs are sufficient to substantially inhibit adenylosuccinate lyase and hence the de novo synthesis of purines in H4 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555735959,"The present study examines the effect of the acetylenic thioester dec-2-ynoyl-CoA (delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA) on the microsomal fatty acid chain elongation pathway in rat liver. When the individual reactions of the elongation system were measured in the presence of delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA, the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity was markedly inhibited (Ki = 2.5 microM), whereas the activities of the condensing enzyme, the beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, and the beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrase were not affected. The absence of inhibition of total microsomal fatty acid elongation was attributed to the significant accumulation of the intermediates, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA and trans-2-enoyl-CoA, without formation of the saturated elongated product, indicating that the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase-catalyzed reaction was the only site affected by the inhibitor. The nature of the inhibition was noncompetitive. In contrast to the delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA, delta 3 10 identical to 1-CoA did not inhibit trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity, suggesting that the mode of inhibition was not via formation of the 2,3-allene derivative. Based on the observation (a) that p-chloromercuribenzoate markedly inhibits reductase activity, (b) that dithiothreitol protects the enzyme against inactivation by delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA, (c) of the spectral manifestation of the interaction between thiol reagents and delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA depicting an absorbance peak similar to that of the beta-ketoacyl thioester-Mg2+ enolate complex, (d) of a similar absorbance spectrum formed by the interaction between delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA and liver microsomes, and (e) of the absence of formation of a similar spectrum by delta 3 10 identical to 1-CoA, trans-2-10:1-CoA, or delta 2 10 identical to 1 free acid with liver microsomes, we propose that delta 2 10 identical to 1-CoA inactivates trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase by covalently binding to a critical sulfhydryl group at or in close proximity to the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1575016346,"We examined the synthesis of proteins in rat myocardium after starvation. Rates of total protein synthesis in myofibrillar and nonmyofibrillar fractions of myocardium of starved animals were reduced similarly (to 70-80% of the rates in hearts of fed animals, p less than 0.002), but rates of synthesis of some individual proteins were affected discoordinately. Radiolabeled proteins from atrial and ventricular explants, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that starvation for 2 days reduced the rate of cardiac actin synthesis to 26-38% of control levels, while the rate of myosin heavy chain synthesis in the same hearts was only moderately reduced (74-80% of control levels). This starvation-induced reduction in actin synthesis could be accounted for at least in part by disproportionately decreased levels of actin mRNA in starved hearts, as revealed by Northern blot hybridization and by in vitro translation analysis. The dramatic decrease in cardiac actin synthesis was rapidly reversible, and actin synthesis returned to normal after a single day of refeeding. The selective reduction of actin synthesis after starvation was specific for the heart: rates of myosin heavy chain and actin synthesis in skeletal muscles (soleus and extensor digitorum longus) were coordinately reduced in response to starvation. To our knowledge, this is the first example of such dramatic discoordinate regulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to a physiological stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1493602208,"Since mixtures of lipids alone are known to elicit membrane fusion without participation of fusion proteins, the role of viral lipids in the so-called virus-induced hemolysis and cell fusion has been investigated, using as a model the fowl plague virus (influenza A/FPV/Rostock/H7N1). The experiments were planned in a way that allowed quantitative modification of viral lipids without changing envelope glycoproteins. Under the conditions employed, cholesterol oxidase of Nocardia erythropolis and phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus were shown to completely modify their substrates in the virus without altering virus-associated hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities. It was found with such enzyme treatment that virus-induced hemolysis and cell fusion are greatly influenced by cholesterol and phospholipids of the envelope. It became clear, that hemolysis and fusion are differently dependent on the nature of lipid components even though mediated by the same viral glycoproteins."
