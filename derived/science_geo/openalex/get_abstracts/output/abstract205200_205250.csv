In a number of the mice the procedure resulted in failure of pregnancy from the first mating and a new mating within 3–6 days. Control experiments showed that the same effect was produced by dosage with inert material or even without any treatment other than the introduction of a strange male at 24 hr. after mating. 20 out of 49 females behaved in this way, a far greater proportion than could be attributed to the expected incidence of anovular cycles. Only about 8 per cent of young females, as used, return to œstrus within 4–5 days if removed from the male after their first mating, or copulate again at this time if they are left with the male. Moreover, among the suspect females there was a failure of the pseudo-pregnancy which might have been due to poor stud males. Experiments were therefore undertaken to explore this effect."

Observed volumes of flow are sufficiently large to make it clear that the rectal gland can remove from the blood relatively large amounts of sodium chloride, and presumably this is its function."
https://openalex.org/W1967529738,Pregnancy is blocked in a high proportion of recently mated female mice exposed to strange males. This reaction is virtually abolished by the prior removal of the olfactory bulbs of the female. The smell of the strange male appears to be the primary stimulus in the exteroceptive block to pregnancy in mice.

This procedure has broad applications in the fields of teratology and cancer chemotherapy, and in the investigation of fetal-maternal physiology."

https://openalex.org/W2002771765,"The ""clock-controlled"" endogenous sporulation rhythm in the fungusPilobolus sphaerosporus has been investigated as part of a comparative study aimed at elucidating characteristic common features of circadian ((1)) rhythms. Pilobolus was chosen for inclusion in this study because of its demonstrated rhythm and sensitivity to light, and because it is a relatively simple plant. It has been shown that a single, high-intensity, 1/2000 second light flash will completely reset (shift the phase of) a rhythm persisting in continuous dim red light at constant temperature, and that one or more transient cycles occur before the phase shift is complete. The significance of these results is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2126117568,"The amidine carbon atom (C-Z) of L-histidine is known to be an efficient metabolic precursor of single carbon units. Following the administration of n-histidine-2-Cr4, the radioactivity has been found in CO2 and urea, in carbons 2 and 8 of purines, in the hydroxymethyl group of serine, and in choline, and creatine (l-4). The major pathway of histidine degradation which involves deamination to urocanic acid and finally, cleavage of the ring to formiminoglutamic acid (5-7) has been assumed to be the sole means of liberation of this carbon atom for “1 carbon metabolism.” The liberation of the single carbon unit can be accomplished by transfer of the formimino group to tetrahydrofolic acid. The formimino moiety is ultimately transformed into the formyl group of Nr”-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (8, 9). Folic acid or vitamin Bit-deficient rats excrete large amounts of formiminoglutamic acid in the urine (10, 11). In the more recent study (ll), the basal diet employed was limiting in the sulfur amino acids (9% casein). The addition of excess methionine to the diet, in the absence of either folic acid or vitamin Br2, significantly reduces urinary formiminoglutamic acid (11). The studies reported in this paper were prompted by this finding and were designed to clarify the nature of this effect. These studies show that radioactive COz (derived from carbon 2 of histidine) is greatly increased following the administration of excess methionine to the deficient animal. Furthermore, the evidence presented is consistent with the view that methionine does not divert histidine metabolism from the urocanic acid pathway, but exerts its influence at the level of formiminoglutamic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2087328079,"IT has generally been held that the formation of new hair follicles from the epidermis does not occur after the adult complement has been established. Evidence to the contrary was published by Ribbert1 as early as 1904, and more recent work in this field has confirmed that new hair follicles can in fact develop from adult epidermis2–5. This phenomenon has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the sheep and the present observations, describing the formation of new wool follicles in adult animals, were made by chance during the examination of unsuccessful homografts."

https://openalex.org/W2092510101,"Periplaneta americana, like many other animals, can maintain a 24-hr. rhythm of locomotor activity when in constant conditions of light and temperature. A secretion produced by the neurosecretory cells in the sub-œsophageal ganglion has been shown to act as a controlling factor in the regulation of the phases of this rhythm1. Chilling cockroaches at 3° C. for some hours causes the phases of the activity rhythm to be retarded, in relation to solar time, by the number of hours for which the temperature is lowered. A method has now been devised whereby the temperature of the neurosecretory cells of the sub-æsophageal ganglion can be maintained at 3° C., while the rest of the body remains at room temperature. Neurosecretion apparently ceases at 3° C., and the phases of the neurosecretory cycle are retarded by the number of hours for which the cells have been chilled."
