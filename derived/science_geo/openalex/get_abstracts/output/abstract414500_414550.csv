https://openalex.org/W1968478384,"An increasing fraction of today social interactions occur using online social media as communication channels. Recent worldwide events, such as social movements in Spain or revolts in the Middle East, highlight their capacity to boost people coordination. Online networks display in general a rich internal structure where users can choose among different types and intensity of interactions. Despite of this, there are still open questions regarding the social value of online interactions. For example, the existence of users with millions of online friends sheds doubts on the relevance of these relations. In this work, we focus on Twitter, one of the most popular online social networks, and find that the network formed by the basic type of connections is organized in groups. The activity of the users conforms to the landscape determined by such groups. Furthermore, Twitter's distinction between different types of interactions allows us to establish a parallelism between online and offline social networks: personal interactions are more likely to occur on internal links to the groups (the weakness of strong ties), events transmitting new information go preferentially through links connecting different groups (the strength of weak ties) or even more through links connecting to users belonging to several groups that act as brokers (the strength of intermediary ties)."
https://openalex.org/W1976731741,"Multiple DNA methylation changes in the cancer methylome are associated with the acquisition of drug resistance; however it remains uncertain how many represent critical DNA methylation drivers of chemoresistance. Using isogenic, cisplatin-sensitive/resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and inducing resensitizaton with demethylating agents, we aimed to identify consistent methylation and expression changes associated with chemoresistance. Using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling across 27 578 CpG sites, we identified loci at 4092 genes becoming hypermethylated in chemoresistant A2780/cp70 compared with the parental-sensitive A2780 cell line. Hypermethylation at gene promoter regions is often associated with transcriptional silencing; however, expression of only 245 of these hypermethylated genes becomes downregulated in A2780/cp70 as measured by microarray expression profiling. Treatment of A2780/cp70 with the demethylating agent 2-deoxy-5'-azacytidine induces resensitization to cisplatin and re-expression of 41 of the downregulated genes. A total of 13/41 genes were consistently hypermethylated in further independent cisplatin-resistant A2780 cell derivatives. CpG sites at 9 of the 13 genes (ARHGDIB, ARMCX2, COL1A, FLNA, FLNC, MEST, MLH1, NTS and PSMB9) acquired methylation in ovarian tumours at relapse following chemotherapy or chemoresistant cell lines derived at the time of patient relapse. Furthermore, 5/13 genes (ARMCX2, COL1A1, MDK, MEST and MLH1) acquired methylation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer-sustaining (side population) cells. MLH1 has a direct role in conferring cisplatin sensitivity when reintroduced into cells in vitro. This combined genomics approach has identified further potential key drivers of chemoresistance whose expression is silenced by DNA methylation that should be further evaluated as clinical biomarkers of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2064994601,"DHHC proteins catalyze the reversible S-acylation of proteins at cysteine residues, a modification important for regulating protein localization, stability, and activity. However, little is known about the kinetic mechanism of DHHC proteins. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fluorescent peptide-based assay for protein S-acylation activity was developed to characterize mammalian DHHC2 and DHHC3. Time courses and substrate saturation curves allowed the determination of V(max) and K(m) values for both the peptide N-myristoylated-GCG and palmitoyl-coenzyme A. DHHC proteins acylate themselves upon incubation with palmitoyl-CoA, which is hypothesized to reflect a transient acyl enzyme transfer intermediate. Single turnover assays with DHHC2 and DHHC3 demonstrated that a radiolabeled acyl group on the enzyme transferred to the protein substrate, consistent with a two-step ping-pong mechanism. Enzyme autoacylation and acyltransfer to substrate displayed the same acyl-CoA specificities, further supporting a two-step mechanism. Interestingly, DHHC2 efficiently transferred acyl chains 14 carbons and longer, whereas DHHC3 activity was greatly reduced by acyl-CoAs with chain lengths longer than 16 carbons. The rate and extent of autoacylation of DHHC3, as well as the rate of acyl chain transfer to protein substrate, were reduced with stearoyl-CoA when compared with palmitoyl-CoA. This is the first observation of lipid substrate specificity among DHHC proteins and may account for the differential S-acylation of proteins observed in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968137793,"Evidence is lacking for direct pathogenicity of human anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) antibodies in development of systemic vasculitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, Wegener's granulomatosis). Progress in study of these antibodies in rodents has been hampered by lack of PR3 expression on murine neutrophils, and by different Fc-receptor affinities for IgG across species. Therefore, we tested whether human anti-PR3 antibodies can induce acute vasculitis in mice with a human immune system. Chimeric mice were generated by injecting human haematopoietic stem cells into irradiated NOD-scid-IL2Rγ−/− mice. Matched chimera mice were treated with human IgG from patients with: anti-PR3 positive renal and lung vasculitis; patients with non-vasculitic renal disease; or healthy controls. Six-days later, 39% of anti-PR3 treated mice had haematuria, compared with none of controls. There was punctate bleeding on the surface of lungs of anti-PR3 treated animals, with histological evidence of vasculitis and haemorrhage. Anti-PR3 treated mice had mild pauci-immune proliferative glomerulonephritis, with infiltration of human and mouse leukocytes. In 3 mice (17%) more severe glomerular injury was present. There were no glomerular changes in controls. Human IgG from patients with anti-PR3 autoantibodies is therefore pathogenic. This model of anti-PR3 antibody-mediated vasculitis may be useful in dissecting mechanisms of microvascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2018581823,"Background Filoviruses, including Ebola virus, are unusual in being filamentous animal viruses. Structural data on the arrangement, stoichiometry and organisation of the component molecules of filoviruses has until now been lacking, partially due to the need to work under level 4 biological containment. The present study provides unique insights into the structure of this deadly pathogen. Methodology and Principal Findings We have investigated the structure of Ebola virus using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, and single particle image processing. Here we report the three-dimensional structure and architecture of Ebola virus and establish that multiple copies of the RNA genome can be packaged to produce polyploid virus particles, through an extreme degree of length polymorphism. We show that the helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid containing RNA and nucleoprotein is stabilized by an outer layer of VP24-VP35 bridges. Elucidation of the structure of the membrane-associated glycoprotein in its native state indicates that the putative receptor-binding site is occluded within the molecule, while a major neutralizing epitope is exposed on its surface proximal to the viral envelope. The matrix protein VP40 forms a regular lattice within the envelope, although its contacts with the nucleocapsid are irregular. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate a modular organization in Ebola virus that accommodates a well-ordered, symmetrical nucleocapsid within a flexible, tubular membrane envelope."
https://openalex.org/W2040705238,"There is limited empirical research on the underlying gender inequity norms shaping gender-based violence, power, and HIV risks in sub-Saharan Africa, or how risk pathways may differ for men and women. This study is among the first to directly evaluate the adherence to gender inequity norms and epidemiological relationships with violence and sexual risks for HIV infection.Data were derived from population-based cross-sectional samples recruited through two-stage probability sampling from the 5 highest HIV prevalence districts in Botswana and all districts in Swaziland (2004-5). Based on evidence of established risk factors for HIV infection, we aimed 1) to estimate the mean adherence to gender inequity norms for both men and women; and 2) to model the independent effects of higher adherence to gender inequity norms on a) male sexual dominance (male-controlled sexual decision making and rape (forced sex)); b) sexual risk practices (multiple/concurrent sex partners, transactional sex, unprotected sex with non-primary partner, intergenerational sex).A total of 2049 individuals were included, n = 1255 from Botswana and n = 796 from Swaziland. In separate multivariate logistic regression analyses, higher gender inequity norms scores remained independently associated with increased male-controlled sexual decision making power (AORmen = 1.90, 95%CI:1.09-2.35; AORwomen = 2.05, 95%CI:1.32-2.49), perpetration of rape (AORmen = 2.19 95%CI:1.22-3.51), unprotected sex with a non-primary partner (AORmen = 1.90, 95%CI:1.14-2.31), intergenerational sex (AORwomen = 1.36, 95%CI:1.08-1.79), and multiple/concurrent sex partners (AORmen = 1.42, 95%CI:1.10-1.93).These findings support the critical evidence-based need for gender-transformative HIV prevention efforts including legislation of women's rights in two of the most HIV affected countries in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2095040923,"As part of our ongoing efforts to sequence and map the watermelon (Citrullus spp.) genome, we have constructed a high density genetic linkage map. The map positioned 234 watermelon genome sequence scaffolds (an average size of 1.41 Mb) that cover about 330 Mb and account for 93.5% of the 353 Mb of the assembled genomic sequences of the elite Chinese watermelon line 97103 (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus). The genetic map was constructed using an F8 population of 103 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The RILs are derived from a cross between the line 97103 and the United States Plant Introduction (PI) 296341-FR (C. lanatus var. citroides) that contains resistance to fusarium wilt (races 0, 1, and 2). The genetic map consists of eleven linkage groups that include 698 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 219 insertion-deletion (InDel) and 36 structure variation (SV) markers and spans ∼800 cM with a mean marker interval of 0.8 cM. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with 11 BACs that produced chromosome-specifc signals, we have depicted watermelon chromosomes that correspond to the eleven linkage groups constructed in this study. The high resolution genetic map developed here should be a useful platform for the assembly of the watermelon genome, for the development of sequence-based markers used in breeding programs, and for the identification of genes associated with important agricultural traits."
https://openalex.org/W1975197117,"Recent studies indicate that trophy hunting is impacting negatively on some lion populations, notably in Tanzania. In 2004 there was a proposal to list lions on CITES Appendix I and in 2011 animal-welfare groups petitioned the United States government to list lions as endangered under their Endangered Species Act. Such listings would likely curtail the trophy hunting of lions by limiting the import of lion trophies. Concurrent efforts are underway to encourage the European Union to ban lion trophy imports. We assessed the significance of lions to the financial viability of trophy hunting across five countries to help determine the financial impact and advisability of the proposed trade restrictions. Lion hunts attract the highest mean prices (US$24,000–US$71,000) of all trophy species. Lions generate 5–17% of gross trophy hunting income on national levels, the proportional significance highest in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. If lion hunting was effectively precluded, trophy hunting could potentially become financially unviable across at least 59,538 km2 that could result in a concomitant loss of habitat. However, the loss of lion hunting could have other potentially broader negative impacts including reduction of competitiveness of wildlife-based land uses relative to ecologically unfavourable alternatives. Restrictions on lion hunting may also reduce tolerance for the species among communities where local people benefit from trophy hunting, and may reduce funds available for anti-poaching. If lion off-takes were reduced to recommended maximums (0.5/1000 km2), the loss of viability and reduction in profitability would be much lower than if lion hunting was stopped altogether (7,005 km2). We recommend that interventions focus on reducing off-takes to sustainable levels, implementing age-based regulations and improving governance of trophy hunting. Such measures could ensure sustainability, while retaining incentives for the conservation of lions and their habitat from hunting."
https://openalex.org/W1982225414,"Human basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an enigmatic and aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets for BLBC, because current treatment modalities are limited and not effective. The forkhead box transcription factor FOXC1 has recently been identified as a critical functional biomarker for BLBC. However, how it orchestrates BLBC cells was not clear. Here we show that FOXC1 activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in BLBC cells by increasing p65/RelA protein stability. High NF-κB activity has been associated with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, particularly BLBC. The effect of FOXC1 on p65/RelA protein stability is mediated by increased expression of Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. FOXC1 requires NF-κB for its regulation of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Notably, FOXC1 overexpression renders breast cancer cells more susceptible to pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB. These results suggest that BLBC cells may rely on FOXC1-driven NF-κB signaling. Interventions of this pathway may provide modalities for the treatment of BLBC."
https://openalex.org/W2087138776,"Over the last million years, human language has emerged and evolved as a fundamental instrument of social communication and semiotic representation. People use language in part to convey emotional information, leading to the central and contingent questions: (1) What is the emotional spectrum of natural language? and (2) Are natural languages neutrally, positively, or negatively biased? Here, we report that the human-perceived positivity of over 10,000 of the most frequently used English words exhibits a clear positive bias. More deeply, we characterize and quantify distributions of word positivity for four large and distinct corpora, demonstrating that their form is broadly invariant with respect to frequency of word use."
https://openalex.org/W2076741738,"Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling can be activated rapidly by 17β-estradiol (E(2)) via nontraditional signaling in ERα-positive MCF7 and ERα-negative HCC38 breast cancer cells and is associated with tumorigenicity. Additionally, E(2) has been shown to elicit anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells counteracting pro-apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutics. Supporting evidence suggests the existence of a membrane-associated ER that differs from the traditional receptors, ERα and ERβ. Our aim was to identify the ER responsible for rapid PKC activation and to evaluate downstream effects, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were used to determine the presence of ER splice variants in multiple cell lines. E(2) effects on PKC activity were measured with and without ER-blocking antibodies. Cell proliferation was determined by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, (MTT) whereas apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL. Quantitative RT-PCR and sandwich ELISA were used to determine the effects on metastatic factors. The role of membrane-dependent signaling in cancer cell invasiveness was examined using an in vitro assay. The results indicate the presence of an ERα splice variant, ERα36, in ERα-positive MCF7 and ERα-negative HCC38 breast cancer cells, which localized to plasma membranes and rapidly activated PKC in response to E(2), leading to deleterious effects such as enhancement of proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and enhancement of metastatic factors. These findings propose ERα36 as a novel target for the development of therapies that can prevent progression of breast cancer in the primary tumor as well as during metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2017171025,"Here, we use DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing data, at six cut-off levels (85–100%), of all bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria to assess composition in the rhizosphere of nursery plants and nursery-raised transplants, native plants and bulk sediment in a mangrove habitat. When comparing compositional data based on DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing at different cut-off levels, all revealed highly significant differences in composition among microhabitats. Procrustes superimposition revealed that ordination results using cut-off levels from 85–100% and DGGE fingerprint data were highly congruent with the standard 97% cut-off level. The various approaches revealed a primary gradient in composition from nursery to mangrove samples. The affinity between the nursery and transplants was greatest when using Betaproteobacteria followed by Alphaproteobacteria data. There was a distinct secondary gradient in composition from transplants to bulk sediment with native plants intermediate, which was most prevalent using all bacteria at intermediate cut-off levels (92–97%). Our results show that PCR-DGGE provides a robust and cost effective exploratory approach and is effective in distinguishing among a priori defined groups."
https://openalex.org/W1982843262,"Epithelial cells (ECs) lining the airways provide a protective barrier between the external environment and the internal host milieu. These same airway epithelia express receptors that respond to danger signals and initiate repair programs. Because the sialylation state of a receptor can influence its function and is dictated in part by sialidase activity, we asked whether airway epithelia express catalytically active sialidase(s). Human primary small airway and A549 ECs expressed NEU1 sialidase at the mRNA and protein levels, and NEU1 accounted for >70% of EC sialidase activity. Blotting with Maackia amurensis and peanut agglutinin lectins established epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC1 as in vivo substrates for NEU1. NEU1 associated with EGFR and MUC1, and NEU1-EGFR association was regulated by EGF stimulation. NEU1 overexpression diminished EGF-stimulated EGFR Tyr-1068 autophosphorylation by up to 44% but enhanced MUC1-dependent Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion by 1.6–1.7-fold and flagellin-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by 1.7–1.9-fold. In contrast, NEU1 depletion increased EGFR activation (1.5-fold) and diminished MUC1-mediated bacterial adhesion (38–56%) and signaling (73%). These data indicate for the first time that human airway epithelia express catalytically active NEU1 sialidase that regulates EGFR- and MUC1-dependent signaling and bacterial adhesion.

The EC surface is armed with numerous receptors and adhesion molecules that recognize and respond to host mediators, inflammatory cells, and exogenous danger signals. A complex veneer of highly sialylated structures contribute to the airway epithelial barrier. In eukaryotic cells, glycoproteins and glycolipids expressed on the surface contain oligosaccharide chains whose outermost positions are terminated with N-acetylneuraminic acid (2.Varki A.

Sialic acids as regulators of molecular and cellular interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The sialic acid (SA) family of >50 closely related but structurally diverse nine-carbon monosaccharides with their terminal location and negative charge are strategically positioned to influence intermolecular and cell-cell interactions through steric hindrance and/or electrostatic repulsion. These highly electronegative, hydrophilic residues influence protein tertiary conformation and bioactivity and can protect them against proteolysis. The human respiratory EC surface is decorated with both α-2,3-linked and α-2,6-linked SAs (4.Gagneux P. Cheriyan M. Hurtado-Ziola N. van der Linden E.C. Anderson D. McClure H. Varki A. Varki N.M.

Roles of epidermal growth factor receptor activation in epithelial cell repair and mucin production in airway epithelium.Thorax. 2004; 59: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). EGFR is itself sialylated (6.Yoon S.J. Nakayama K. Hikita T. Handa K. Hakomori S.I. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase is modulated by GM3 interaction with N-linked GlcNAc termini of the receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Similarly, mucin-1 (MUC1) is a heavily sialylated membrane-bound glycoprotein that influences a diverse range of functions, including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, cell motility, and host cell-pathogen interactions (9.Hattrup C.L. Gendler S.J. Structure and function of the cell surface (tethered) mucins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 431-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).

In addition to MUC1, airway epithelia also express other sialylated surface molecules that serve as recognition motifs for pathogenic viruses and bacteria and their toxins (13.Imberty A. Varrot A. Microbial recognition of human cell surface glycoconjugates.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).

NEU1 is localized to lysosomes and is only active in association with cathepsin A and β-galactosidase. NEU2 is found in the cytosol, NEU3 is associated with the plasma membrane, and NEU4 is located in mitochondria.

Although the expression and function of mammalian sialidases have been documented in selected tissues and species, whether human respiratory epithelia express one or more sialidases is unknown. In these studies, we have established that human airway ECs express sialidase catalytic activity, much of which can be ascribed to NEU1. Furthermore, we have established two important receptors expressed in airway epithelia, EGFR and MUC1, as in vivo substrates for NEU1 and that NEU1 regulates the responsiveness of these two receptors to their respective ligands as well as epithelial adhesiveness to bacteria.

For each assay, serial dilutions of known concentrations of pure N-acetylneuraminic acid were measured, and a standard curve was generated. The SA concentration in each sample was interpolated from the standard curve using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The background concentration of SA spontaneously released from the simultaneous cell-free ganglioside control was subtracted from each value. Total cellular RNA was extracted from SAECs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA purity was established with the 260/280 nm absorption ratio (>1.90). Total RNA (1.0 μg) was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) for 15 min and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and poly(T) primer (Promega).

In other experiments, blots were probed with mouse anti-human MUC1 antibody followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. To confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2.0% SDS; washed with TBS-T; reprobed with mouse anti-Physarum β-tubulin antibody followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody; and developed with ECL reagents. To regulate NEU1 and NEU3 expression in SAECs and A549 cells, recombinant adenovirus (Ad) encoding FLAG-tagged human NEU1 (Ad-NEU1) and HA-tagged human NEU3 (Ad-NEU3) were generated as described for Ad encoding other gene products (22.Hyun S.W. Anglin I.E. Liu A. Yang S. Sorkin J.D. Lillehoj E. Tonks N.K. Passaniti A. Goldblum S.E. Diverse injurious stimuli reduce protein tyrosine phosphatase-μ expression and enhance epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in human airway epithelia.Exp. Lung Res. 2011; 37: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The full-length human NEU1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_000434.3) and NEU3 (GenBank accession number NM_006656.5) sequences were synthesized by Primm Biotech (Cambridge, MA) after which the 3× FLAG tag and HA tag sequences were inserted prior to the stop codon at the 3′-end of the NEU1 and NEU3 sequences, respectively. The recombinant Ad-NEU1 and Ad-NEU3 were generated using the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, each was subcloned into the pShuttle-IREs-hrGFP-1 shuttle vector using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Each resultant shuttle plasmid was linearized by PmeI digestion and, with the Ad backbone plasmid (pAdEasy-1, Qbiogene/MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), was used to co-transform electrocompetent E. coli BJ5183 cells to produce recombinant plasmids. As a negative control, an Ad-Null plasmid was generated using pAdEasy-1 and pShuttle-IREs-hrGFP-1 in the absence of an insert. Recombinant plasmids were selected for kanamycin resistance and screened for recombination by PacI digestion. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform XL10-Gold cells, and bacterial lysates were passed through Maxiprep columns (Qiagen) for plasmid purification. Ad-NEU1 and Ad-NEU3 each were linearized with PacI digestion and transfected in the presence of Lipofectamine into AD-293 cells. After 7–10 days, cells were scraped off flasks with a rubber policeman and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and virus was harvested in the supernatants for presentation to fresh AD-293 cells and titration in a plaque-forming assay. SAECs and A549 cells were transiently infected with packaged Ad-NEU1 or Ad-NEU3 at increasing multiplicities of infection and after 24 h were lysed, and the lysates were processed for FLAG or HA immunoblotting. SAECs and A549 cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes designed to specifically target NEU1, NEU3, or MUC1 or irrelevant control siRNA duplexes not corresponding to any known sequence in the human genome as described (27.Achyuthan K.E. Achyuthan A.M. Comparative enzymology, biochemistry and pathophysiology of human exo-α-sialidases (neuraminidases).Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 129: 29-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For transfection, 5.0 × 105 ECs were centrifuged (200 × g for 10 min), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Amaxa Nucleofactor solution (Lonza) with 2.7 μg of siRNA duplexes. The EC-siRNA mixture was transferred to an Amaxa-certified cuvette and subjected to programmed electroporation (program X-001). The transfected cells were cultured for 24–72 h after which they were lysed, and the lysates were processed for NEU1 and MUC1 immunoblotting. In other experiments, A549 cells were transiently infected with packaged Ad-NEU1 or Ad-Null vector control, each at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. After 48 h, NEU1-targeting or control siRNAs were introduced into A549 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged NEU1. To exclude off-target effects, A549 cells overexpressing HA-tagged NEU3 were transfected with NEU1-targeting, NEU3-targeting, or control siRNAs. After 24–72 h, the transfected cells were lysed and processed for immunoblotting with mouse anti-FLAG or rabbit anti-HA antibody. To confirm equivalent protein loading, blots were stripped and reprobed for β-tubulin. These siRNA-transfected epithelia were studied for sialidase activity, lectin blotting, EGFR or ERK1/2 activation, and bacterial adhesion. A549 cells were cultured overnight in 8-well glass chamber slides (Nunc/Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 22 °C, washed, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in HEPES buffer for 10 min at 4 °C, blocked with 1% donkey serum for 30 min, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NEU1 antibody (1:500 dilution in 1.0% donkey serum). The slides were washed and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. After mounting with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), the immunostained ECs were analyzed and photographed using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope fitted with a 60×, numerical aperture 1.4 objective and standard excitation/emission filters for detection of DAPI and Cy3. Images were cropped and assembled into panels with Adobe Photoshop 4.0. A549 cells were processed for isolation of lysosomes using the Lysosome Isolation kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Lysosomal proteins were resolved on 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and processed for immunoblotting with anti-NEU1 and anti-LAMP1 antibodies. A549 cells were infected with increasing multiplicities of infection (m.o.i. = 3, 10, 30, and 100) of Ad encoding FLAG-tagged NEU1 and cultured for 48 h. In selected experiments, cells infected with Ad-NEU1 (m.o.i. = 100) were transfected with either NEU1-targeting or control siRNAs. In still other experiments, Ad-infected cells (m.o.i. = 100) were incubated for 15 min with EGF (100 ng/ml) or medium alone. The cells were solubilized with a low stringency lysis buffer as described (28.Angelini D.J. Hyun S.W. Grigoryev D.N. Garg P. Gong P. Singh I.S. Passaniti A. Hasday J.D. Goldblum S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1989725239,"The extracellular matrix microenvironment regulates cell phenotype and function. One mechanism by which this is achieved is the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by specific matrix molecules. Here, we demonstrate that the provisional matrix protein, fibronectin (FN), activates fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-1 (FGFR1) independent of FGF ligand in liver endothelial cells. FN activation of FGFR1 requires β1 integrin, as evidenced by neutralizing antibody and siRNA-based studies. Complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches identify that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is required for FN transactivation of FGFR1. Whereas FGF ligand-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 preferentially activates ERK, FN-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 preferentially activates AKT, indicating differential downstream signaling of FGFR1 in response to alternate stimuli. Mutation analysis of known tyrosine residues of FGFR1 reveals that tyrosine 653/654 and 766 residues are required for FN-FGFR1 activation of AKT and chemotaxis. Thus, our study mechanistically dissects a new signaling pathway by which FN achieves endothelial cell chemotaxis, demonstrates how differential phosphorylation profiles of FGFR1 can achieve alternate downstream signals, and, more broadly, highlights the diversity of mechanisms by which the extracellular matrix microenvironment regulates cell behavior through transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1996144099,"Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 has an important role in autophagy. The human LC3 gene family has five members, LC3A (variant-1: v1 and -2: v2), LC3B, LC3B2 and LC3C. Although a form of LC3B modified by phosphatidylethanolamine (form-II) is localized in autophagosomes, it is not clear whether other LC3 proteins also function in autophagy. Here, we examined the association between autophagy and human LC3 proteins during starvation- or p53-induced autophagy in Saos-2 cells. In an analysis of the intracellular distribution of each LC3 protein fused with GFP, GFP-LC3Av1 was frequently localized in autophagosomes with a punctate pattern, similar to GFP-LC3B. Further, endogenous LC3Av1 generated form-II and mostly localized in LC3B-positive autophagosomes during the induced autophagy. Interestingly, LC3Av1, not LC3B, was frequently inactivated at the transcriptional level in various human cancer cell lines (111/244 cell lines, 45.5%) and its inactivation was due to aberrant DNA methylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines and primary tumors. Restoration of LC3Av1 expression in KYSE170 cells, an LC3Av1-inactivated ESCC cell line, showed the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that LC3Av1, not only LC3B, functions in autophagy and further, LC3Av1 may be crucial in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087499056,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, and their dysregulation has been reported to affect the development and progression of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in the plethora of dysregulated miRNAs, it is largely unknown which of them have a causative role in the hepatocarcinogenic process. In the present study, we first aimed to determine changes in the expression profile of miRNAs in human HCCs and to compare them with liver tumors generated in a rat model of chemically induced HCC. We found that members of the miR-100 family (miR-100, miR-99a) were downregulated in human HCCs; a similar downregulation was also observed in rat HCCs. Their reduction was paralleled by an increased expression of polo like kinase 1 (PLK1), a target of these miRNAs. The introduction of miR-100 in HCC cells impaired their growth ability and their capability to form colonies in soft agar. Next, we aimed at investigating, in the same animal model, if dysregulation of miR-100 and PLK1 is an early or late event along the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis. The obtained results showed that miR-100 downregulation (i) is already evident in very early preneoplastic lesions generated 9 weeks after carcinogenic treatment; (ii) is also observed in adenomas and early HCCs; and (iii) is not simply a marker of proliferating hepatocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first work unveiling the role of a miRNA family along HCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2025480988,"Formin-mediated elongation of actin filaments proceeds via association of Formin Homology 2 (FH2) domain dimers with the barbed end of the filament, allowing subunit addition while remaining processively attached to the end. The flexible Formin Homology 1 (FH1) domain, located directly N-terminal to the FH2 domain, contains one or more stretches of polyproline that bind the actin-binding protein profilin. Diffusion of FH1 domains brings associated profilin-actin complexes into contact with the FH2-bound barbed end of the filament, thereby enabling direct transfer of actin. We investigated how the organization of the FH1 domain of budding yeast formin Bni1p determines the rates of profilin-actin transfer onto the end of the filament. Each FH1 domain transfers actin to the barbed end independently of the other and structural evidence suggests a preference for actin delivery from each FH1 domain to the closest long-pitch helix of the filament. The transfer reaction is diffusion-limited and influenced by the affinities of the FH1 polyproline tracks for profilin. Position-specific sequence variations optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated polymerization by binding profilin weakly near the FH2 domain and binding profilin more strongly farther away. FH1 domains of many other formins follow this organizational trend. This particular sequence architecture may optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2101125536,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) comprise a group of disorders characterized by multistage progression from cytopenias to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They display exaggerated apoptosis in early stages, but lose this behavior during evolution to AML. The molecular basis for loss of apoptosis is unknown. To investigate this critical event, we analyzed phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′kinase signaling, implicated as a critical pathway of cell survival control in epithelial and hematological malignancies. PI 3′kinase activates Akt through its production of 3′ phosphoinositides. In turn, the phosphoinositides are dephosphorylated by two lipid phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP-1, in myeloid cells. We studied primary MDS-enriched bone marrow cells and bone marrow sections by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR for components of the SHIP/PTEN/PI 3′kinase signaling circuit. We reported constitutively activated Akt, variable levels of PTEN and uniformly decreased SHIP-1 expression in MDS progenitor cells. Overexpression of SHIP-1, but not the phosphatase-deficient form, inhibited myeloid leukemic growth. Levels of microRNA (miR)-210 and miR-155 transcripts, which target SHIP-1, were increased in CD34+ MDS cells compared with their normal counterparts. Direct binding of miR-210 to the 3′ untranslated region of SHIP-1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of a myeloid cell line with miR-210 resulted in loss of SHIP-1 protein expression. These data suggest that miR-155 and miR-210/SHIP-1/Akt pathways could serve as clinical biomarkers for disease progression, and that miR-155 and miR-210 might serve as novel therapeutic targets in MDS."
https://openalex.org/W2113550921,"Vibrio fischeri exists in a symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, where the squid provides a home for the bacteria, and the bacteria in turn provide camouflage that helps protect the squid from night-time predators. Like other gram-negative organisms, V. fischeri expresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on its cell surface. The structure of the O-antigen and the core components of the LPS and their possible role in colonization of the squid have not previously been determined. In these studies, an O-antigen ligase mutant, waaL, was utilized to determine the structures of these LPS components and their roles in colonization of the squid. WaaL ligates the O-antigen to the core of the LPS; thus, LPS from waaL mutants lacks O-antigen. Our results show that the V. fischeri waaL mutant has a motility defect, is significantly delayed in colonization, and is unable to compete with the wild-type strain in co-colonization assays. Comparative analyses of the LPS from the wild-type and waaL strains showed that the V. fischeri LPS has a single O-antigen repeat composed of yersiniose, 8-epi-legionaminic acid, and N-acetylfucosamine. In addition, the LPS from the waaL strain showed that the core structure consists of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, glucose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, N-acetylgalactosamine, 8-epi-legionaminic acid, phosphate, and phosphoethanolamine. These studies indicate that the unusual V. fischeri O-antigen sugars play a role in the early phases of bacterial colonization of the squid."

https://openalex.org/W2063569880,"Many reports in different populations have demonstrated linkage of the 10q24-q26 region to schizophrenia, thus encouraging further analysis of this locus for detection of specific schizophrenia genes. Our group previously reported linkage of the 10q24-q26 region to schizophrenia in a unique, homogeneous sample of Arab-Israeli families with multiple schizophrenia-affected individuals, under a dominant model of inheritance. To further explore this candidate region and identify specific susceptibility variants within it, we performed re-analysis of the 10q24-26 genotype data, taken from our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Alkelai et al, 2011). We analyzed 2089 SNPs in an extended sample of 57 Arab Israeli families (189 genotyped individuals), under the dominant model of inheritance, which best fits this locus according to previously performed MOD score analysis. We found significant association with schizophrenia of the TCF7L2 gene intronic SNP, rs12573128, (p = 7.01×10⁻⁶) and of the nearby intergenic SNP, rs1033772, (p = 6.59×10⁻⁶) which is positioned between TCF7L2 and HABP2. TCF7L2 is one of the best confirmed susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes (T2D) among different ethnic groups, has a role in pancreatic beta cell function and may contribute to the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2D. These preliminary results independently support previous findings regarding a possible role of TCF7L2 in susceptibility to schizophrenia, and strengthen the importance of integrating linkage analysis models of inheritance while performing association analyses in regions of interest. Further validation studies in additional populations are required."
https://openalex.org/W2105329463,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with airway remodeling, including hyperplasia of airway epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells, and goblet cell differentiation. We wished to address the potential role of histamine, a key biogenic amine involved in allergic reactions, in airway remodeling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. Here, we demonstrate that histamine releases 2 EGFR ligands, amphiregulin and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), from airway epithelial cells. Amphiregulin and HB-EGF were expressed in airway epithelium of patients with asthma. Histamine up-regulated their mRNA expression (amphiregulin 3.2-fold, P<0.001; HB-EGF 2.3-fold, P<0.05) and triggered their release (amphiregulin EC(50) 0.50 μM, 31.2 ± 2.7 pg/ml with 10 μM histamine, P<0.01; HB-EGF EC(50) 0.54 μM, 78.5 ± 1.8 pg/ml with 10 μM histamine, P<0.001) compared to vehicle control (amphiregulin 19.3 ± 0.9 pg/ml; HB-EGF 60.2 ± 1.0 pg/ml), in airway epithelial cells. Histamine increased EGFR phosphorylation (2.1-fold by Western blot analysis) and induced goblet cell differentiation (CLCA1 up-regulation by real-time qPCR) in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. Moreover, amphiregulin and HB-EGF caused proliferation and migration of both NHBE cells and human airway smooth muscle cells. These results suggest that histamine may induce airway remodeling via the epithelial-derived EGFR ligands amphiregulin and HB-EGF."

In this study we identified four NF-κB target genes that are modulated by TIP60. We also found that TIP60 interacts with the NF-κB RelA/p65 subunit and increases its transcriptional activity through protein-protein interaction. Although TIP60 binds with RelA/p65 using its histone acetyltransferase domain, TIP60 does not directly acetylate RelA/p65. However, TIP60 maintained acetylated Lys-310 RelA/p65 levels in the TNF-α-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, TIP60 was primarily recruited to the IL-6, IL-8, C-IAP1, and XIAP promoters in TNF-α stimulation followed by acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Chromatin remodeling by TIP60 involved the sequential recruitment of acetyl-Lys-310 RelA/p65 to its target gene promoters. Furthermore, we showed that up-regulated TIP60 expression was correlated with acetyl-Lys-310 RelA/p65 expressions in hepatocarcinoma tissues. Taken together these results suggest that TIP60 is involved in the NF-κB pathway through protein interaction with RelA/p65 and that it modulates the transcriptional activity of RelA/p65 in NF-κB-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2060233067,"We present a new method for inferring hidden Markov models from noisy time sequences without the necessity of assuming a model architecture, thus allowing for the detection of degenerate states. This is based on the statistical prediction techniques developed by Crutchfield et al., and generates so called causal state models, equivalent to hidden Markov models. This method is applicable to any continuous data which clusters around discrete values and exhibits multiple transitions between these values such as tethered particle motion data or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectra. The algorithms developed have been shown to perform well on simulated data, demonstrating the ability to recover the model used to generate the data under high noise, sparse data conditions and the ability to infer the existence of degenerate states. They have also been applied to new experimental FRET data of Holliday Junction dynamics, extracting the expected two state model and providing values for the transition rates in good agreement with previous results and with results obtained using existing maximum likelihood based methods."

Several studies have shown that SHIP2 (SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate phosphatase) is also involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. Expression of SHIP2 attenuated insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells (13.Wada T. Sasaoka T. Funaki M. Hori H. Murakami S. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Asano T. Ogawa W. Ishihara H. Kobayashi M.

Hori H. Wada T. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Ishihara H. Kobayashi M. SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 2 negatively regulates insulin-induced glycogen synthesis in L6 myotubes.Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SHIP2 knock-out mice have been reported to exhibit increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, whereas they showed normal glucose homeostasis and insulin tolerance (15.Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O. Garcia K. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Glass D.J. Absence of the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 confers resistance to dietary obesity.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated why enhanced phosphorylation of Akt does not affect the glucose uptake in SHIP2 knock-out mice.SKIP (skeletal muscle and kidney enriched inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase) is a PIP3 phosphatase that is abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle. SKIP is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum under basal conditions and is translocated to the membrane ruffles in response to insulin, and SKIP negatively regulates insulin-dependent glucose incorporation (16.Ijuin T. Takenawa T. SKIP negatively regulates insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and membrane ruffle formation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that heterozygous knock-out of SKIP in mice caused increased glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle with increased insulin signaling (17.Ijuin T. Yu Y.E. Mizutani K. Pao A. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Bradley A. Takenawa T. Increased insulin action in SKIP heterozygous knockout mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Based on these studies of PTEN, SHIP2, and SKIP, all of the PIP3 phosphatases are implicated in the regulation of insulin signaling. However, several important findings about the differences between the PIP3 phosphatases have been reported. For example, PTEN, but not SHIP2, predominantly suppressed insulin signaling through the PI 3-kinase pathway by RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (18.Tang X. Powelka A.M. Soriano N.A. Czech M.P. Guilherme A. PTEN, but not SHIP2, suppresses insulin signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In differentiating myoblast cells, SHIP2 affects the steady state levels of PIP3, whereas PTEN moderately regulates the intracellular levels of 3-phosphoinositides and significantly regulates Akt phosphorylation (19.Mandl A. Sarkes D. Carricaburu V. Jung V. Rameh L. Serum withdrawal-induced accumulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase lipids in differentiating 3T3-L6 myoblasts. Distinct roles for Ship2 and PTEN.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8098-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the role of these PIP3 phosphatases in the regulation of insulin signaling in the skeletal muscles remains unknown.In this study, we have compared the relative effects of endogenous SKIP, PTEN, and SHIP2 on insulin signaling in C2C12 myoblast cells by using the RNAi method. We found that the suppression of SKIP markedly increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 exocytosis, and glucose incorporation. Taken together, our results show that SKIP plays the predominant role in the regulation of insulin signaling in C2C12 cells among the PIP3 phosphatases.DISCUSSIONSKIP is one of the phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases that hydrolyzes PIP3 to generate PI(3,4)P2. SKIP is localized to ER in the absence of insulin stimulation; however, in the presence of insulin, SKIP rapidly translocates to the plasma membrane (27.Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Fukami K. Funaki M. Asano T. Takenawa T. Identification and characterization of a novel inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that endogenous SKIP is abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle and that it negatively regulates insulin-dependent membrane ruffle formation and GLUT4 translocation through PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling (17.Ijuin T. Yu Y.E. Mizutani K. Pao A. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Bradley A. Takenawa T. Increased insulin action in SKIP heterozygous knockout mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to PTEN and SHIP2, SKIP is one of the potent regulators of insulin signaling among the PIP3 phosphatases (15.Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O. Garcia K. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Glass D.J. Absence of the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 confers resistance to dietary obesity.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28.Wijesekara N. Konrad D. Eweida M. Jefferies C. Liadis N. Giacca A. Crackower M. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Kahn C.R. Klip A. Woo M. Muscle-specific Pten deletion protects against insulin resistance and diabetes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine which of these phosphatases predominantly regulates insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle, we have compared the effect of SKIP, PTEN, and SHIP2 in insulin signaling by using C2C12 myoblast cells, which simultaneously express all of these.Attenuation of either SKIP or PTEN, but not of SHIP2, was associated with an increase in PIP3 level, indicating that SHIP2 is not implicated in the regulation of insulin signaling in these cells. Silencing of PTEN caused an increase in the basal and insulin-stimulated PIP3 levels; however, the insulin-induced increase was comparable with the control cells. In contrast, insulin-induced PIP3 generation was significantly increased when SKIP was knocked down, implying that SKIP and PTEN hydrolyze PIP3 in different mechanisms. In these experiments, we labeled C2C12 cells with inorganic 32P to measure synthesized phosphoinositides. Therefore, 3-phosphate of newly synthesized PIP3 from PI(4,5)P2 in response to insulin stimulation is efficiently labeled by inorganic 32P in comparison with 4- or 5-phosphate. Although both SKIP and PTEN are PIP3 phosphatases, they have different enzymatic activity. SKIP hydrolyzes 5-phosphate of PIP3, whereas PTEN dephosphorylates 3-phosphate. Therefore, PIP3 levels in insulin-stimulated C2C12 cells might be exaggerated by the silencing of PTEN compared with that of SKIP or SHIP2. Taking these effects into consideration, we conclude that among PIP3 phosphatases examined, SKIP predominantly regulated PIP3 levels in insulin-stimulated cells.To visualize intracellular PIP3 in intact cells, Qdot655-labeled Grp1 PH domain protein was used as a probe. Immunofluorescence by this protein showed the accumulation of PIP3 at the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation for 1 min, demonstrating that this probe specifically recognizes PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of PTEN resulted in the accumulation of PIP3 under basal conditions. After insulin stimulation for 5 min, PIP3 generation at the membrane ruffles could clearly be observed in SKIP-silenced C2C12 cells as well as in control cells. In contrast, silencing of PTEN resulted in the generation of PIP3 throughout the plasma membrane. These results imply that SKIP and PTEN work on spatially different PIP3 pools in a single cell. It is important to note that spatiotemporal regulation of PIP3 is governed by distinct PIP3 phosphatases.PIP3-dependent activation of Akt is necessary for insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake. Both SKIP and PTEN knockdown resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation. Silencing of PTEN expression resulted in enhanced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, but not at Thr-308, in the absence of insulin stimulation. These phosphorylations were mediated by different kinases. The Ser-473 position is phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), which precedes the phosphorylation of the Thr-308 position by PDK1 (4.Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Phosphorylation and regulation of Akt/PKB by the rictor-mTOR complex.Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). A number of reports have shown that growth factors increase mTORC2 activity, albeit through unknown signaling events. PDK1 is localized at the cytosol under basal conditions. In response to insulin stimulation, it is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it binds to PIP3 through the PH domain. In PTEN-silenced cells, we found a slight increase in PIP3 levels under basal conditions, which is enough for the activation of mTORC2. However, the amount is not enough for the activation of PDK1 and the Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308. The study using 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that suppression of PTEN did not affect basal PIP3 and Akt phosphorylation (18.Tang X. Powelka A.M. Soriano N.A. Czech M.P. Guilherme A. PTEN, but not SHIP2, suppresses insulin signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be derived from the residual expression level of PTEN; in their study, ∼50% of PTEN protein was still expressed, whereas we achieved ∼90% suppression of PTEN expression in our study. Attenuation of SKIP protein did not affect basal Akt phosphorylation but did significantly increase insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation. We have previously reported that suppression of SKIP by the specific antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (16.Ijuin T. Takenawa T. SKIP negatively regulates insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and membrane ruffle formation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the other downstream effectors, namely, GSK3β and p70 S6 kinase, was also markedly increased by the silencing of SKIP. These results suggest that SKIP might predominantly regulate insulin signaling in C2C12 cells.Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into the skeletal muscle cells, which requires GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 undergoes exocytosis and is targeted to the plasma membrane. AS160, a Rab-GAP, is one of the downstream effectors of Akt and is necessary for this translocation (29.Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Mîinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of a Rab GTPase-activating protein regulates GLUT4 translocation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). SKIP silencing significantly increased the phosphorylation of AS160, which was unaltered by the attenuation of PTEN. GLUT4 exocytosis in the skeletal muscle cells is dependent on the actin cytoskeletal rearrangement occurring at the membrane ruffles. SKIP is known to accumulate at the membrane ruffles in response to insulin stimulation, and it negatively regulates membrane ruffle formation (27.Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Fukami K. Funaki M. Asano T. Takenawa T. Identification and characterization of a novel inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of C2C12 cells showed the co-localization of SKIP and GLUT4 at the membrane ruffles, suggesting the regulatory role of SKIP in GLUT4 exocytosis. Attenuation of SKIP resulted in a significant increase in the insulin-induced GLUT4 localization to the surface of the plasma membrane, without affecting the basal state. In contrast, silencing of PTEN did not increase the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface. Consistent with these results, insulin-dependent glucose uptake was markedly increased by the attenuation of SKIP but not by the silencing of PTEN.Insulin-dependent GLUT4 exocytosis includes several steps, including recruitment, docking, and/or fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, all of which are dependent on the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. Among these steps, AS160 is implicated in the regulation of recruitment step (30.Sano H. Eguez L. Teruel M.N. Fukuda M. Chuang T.D. Chavez J.A. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E.

Cell. 2004; 15: 4406-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Knockdown of SKIP increased the amount of GLUT4-containing vesicles within the TIRF zone, suggesting that SKIP at least regulates the recruitment step. In contrast, PTEN knockdown increased the amount of cell surface GLUT4 under basal conditions. It was previously reported that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, microinjection of anti-PTEN antibody increased plasma membrane-associated GLUT4, even in the absence of insulin stimulation (10.Nakashima N. Sharma P.M. Imamura T. Bookstein R. Olefsky J.M. The tumor suppressor PTEN negatively regulates insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12889-12895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Taken together, SKIP predominantly regulates insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation, whereas PTEN mainly regulates GLUT4 localization at the plasma membrane under basal conditions. SHIP2 is unlikely to regulate insulin signaling in C2C12 cells.In summary, our results indicate that endogenous SKIP is predominantly involved in the regulation of insulin signaling among PIP3 phosphatases. SKIP, but not PTEN or SHIP2, negatively regulated insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake in C2C12 cells. Therefore, these data indicate that SKIP may serve as a promising pharmaceutical target aimed at the treatment of diabetes.

In four experiments, we show that when a non-expressive face becomes expressive, happiness is detected more rapidly anger. When the change occurs peripheral to the focus of attention, however, dynamic anger is better detected when it appears in the left visual field (LVF), whereas dynamic happiness is better detected in the right visual field (RVF), consistent with hemispheric differences in the processing of approach- and avoidance-relevant stimuli. The central advantage for happiness is nevertheless the more robust effect, persisting even when information of either high or low spatial frequency is eliminated. Indeed, a survey of past research on the visual search for emotional expressions finds better support for a happiness detection advantage, and the explanation may lie in the coevolution of the signal and the receiver."
https://openalex.org/W2023387306,"Juvenile hormone (JH) has been implicated in many developmental processes in holometabolous insects, but its mechanism of signaling remains controversial. We previously found that in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, the nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 is required for activation of the E75A gene by JH. Here, we utilized insect two-hybrid assays to show that FTZ-F1 interacts with two JH receptor candidates, the bHLH-PAS paralogs MET and GCE, in a JH-dependent manner. These interactions are severely reduced when helix 12 of the FTZ-F1 activation function 2 (AF2) is removed, implicating AF2 as an interacting site. Through homology modeling, we found that MET and GCE possess a C-terminal α-helix featuring a conserved motif LIXXL that represents a novel nuclear receptor (NR) box. Docking simulations supported by two-hybrid experiments revealed that FTZ-F1·MET and FTZ-F1·GCE heterodimer formation involves a typical NR box-AF2 interaction but does not require the canonical charge clamp residues of FTZ-F1 and relies primarily on hydrophobic contacts, including a unique interaction with helix 4. Moreover, we identified paralog-specific features, including a secondary interaction site found only in MET. Our findings suggest that a novel NR box enables MET and GCE to interact JH-dependently with the AF2 of FTZ-F1."

Biopsies were obtained from the WT pig liver pre-Tx and at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h post-transplantation. Biopsies of genetically-engineered livers were obtained pre-Tx, 2 h after reperfusion and at necropsy (4–7 days after transplantation). Tissues were examined by light, confocal, and electron microscopy. All major native organs were also examined. The WT pig liver underwent hyperacute rejection. After genetically-engineered pig liver transplantation, hyperacute rejection did not occur. Survival was limited to 4–7 days due to repeated spontaneous bleeding in the liver and native organs (as a result of profound thrombocytopenia) which necessitated euthanasia. At 2 h, graft histology was largely normal. At necropsy, genetically-engineered pig livers showed hemorrhagic necrosis, platelet aggregation, platelet-fibrin thrombi, monocyte/macrophage margination mainly in liver sinusoids, and vascular endothelial cell hypertrophy, confirmed by confocal and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry showed minimal deposition of IgM, and almost absence of IgG, C3, C4d, C5b-9, and of a cellular infiltrate, suggesting that neither antibody- nor cell-mediated rejection played a major role."
https://openalex.org/W2102925129,"Background The forkhead box transcription factor, Foxp3, is master regulator of the development and function of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells that limit autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis. The carboxyl-terminal forkhead (FKH) domain is required for the nuclear localization and DNA binding of Foxp3. We assessed how individual FKH lysines contribute to the functions of Foxp3 in Treg cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that mutation of FKH lysines at position 382 (K17) and at position 393 (K18) impaired Foxp3 DNA binding and inhibited Treg suppressive function in vivo and in vitro. These lysine mutations did not affect the level of expression of Foxp3 but inhibited IL-2 promoter remodeling and had important and differing effects on Treg-associated gene expression. Conclusions/Significance These data point to complex effects of post-translational modifications at individual lysines within the Foxp3 FKH domain that affect Treg function. Modulation of these events using small molecule inhibitors may allow regulation of Foxp3+ Treg function clinically."

We have previously shown that overexpression of FcRn in transgenic mice significantly improves the humoral immune response. Because rabbits are an important source of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, adaptation of our FcRn overexpression technology in this species would bring significant advantages. We cloned the full length cDNA of the rabbit FcRn alpha-chain and found that it is similar to its orthologous analyzed so far. The rabbit FcRn - IgG contact residues are highly conserved, and based on this we predicted pH dependent interaction, which we confirmed by analyzing the pH dependent binding of FcRn to rabbit IgG using yolk sac lysates of rabbit fetuses by Western blot. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected strong FcRn staining in the endodermal cells of the rabbit yolk sac membrane, while the placental trophoblast cells and amnion showed no FcRn staining. Then, using BAC transgenesis we generated transgenic rabbits carrying and overexpressing a 110 kb rabbit genomic fragment encoding the FcRn. These transgenic rabbits – having one extra copy of the FcRn when hemizygous and two extra copies when homozygous - showed improved IgG protection and an augmented humoral immune response when immunized with a variety of different antigens. Our results in these transgenic rabbits demonstrate an increased immune response, similar to what we described in mice, indicating that FcRn overexpression brings significant advantages for the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2091065210,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are a target of antibody-mediated allograft rejection. In vitro, when the HLA class I molecules on the surface of ECs are ligated by anti-HLA class I antibodies, cell proliferation and survival pathways are activated and this is thought to contribute to the development of antibody-mediated rejection. Crosslinking of HLA class I molecules by anti-HLA antibodies also triggers reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which induces the formation of F-actin stress fibers. HLA class I induced stress fiber formation is not well understood.The present study examines the protein composition of the cytoskeleton fraction of ECs treated with HLA class I antibodies and compares it to other agonists known to induce alterations of the cytoskeleton in endothelial cells. Analysis by tandem mass spectrometry revealed unique cytoskeleton proteomes for each treatment group. Using annotation tools a candidate list was created that revealed 12 proteins, which were unique to the HLA class I stimulated group. Eleven of the candidate proteins were phosphoproteins and exploration of their predicted kinases provided clues as to how these proteins may contribute to the understanding of HLA class I induced antibody-mediated rejection. Three of the candidates, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1), Tropomyosin alpha 4-chain (TPM4) and DDX3X, were further characterized by Western blot and found to be associated with the cytoskeleton. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that class I ligation stimulated increased eIF4A1 co-localization with F-actin and paxillin.Colocalization of eIF4A1 with F-actin and paxillin following HLA class I ligation suggests that this candidate protein could be a target for understanding the mechanism(s) of class I mediated antibody-mediated rejection. This proteomic approach for analyzing the cytoskeleton of ECs can be applied to other agonists and various cells types as a method for uncovering novel regulators of cytoskeleton changes."
https://openalex.org/W2086305115,"Retinoblastoma-binding protein 1 (RBBP1), also named AT-rich interaction domain containing 4A (ARID4A), is a tumor and leukemia suppressor involved in epigenetic regulation in leukemia and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes. Although the involvement in epigenetic regulation is proposed to involve its chromobarrel and/or Tudor domains because of their potential binding to methylated histone tails, the structures of these domains and their interactions with methylated histone tails are still uncharacterized. In this work, we first found that RBBP1 contains five domains by bioinformatics analysis. Three of the five domains, i.e. chromobarrel, Tudor, and PWWP domains, are Royal Family domains, which potentially bind to methylated histone tails. We further purified these domains and characterized their interaction with methylated histone tails by NMR titration experiments. Among the three Royal Family domains, only the chromobarrel domain could recognize trimethylated H4K20 (with an affinity of ∼3 mm), as well as recognizing trimethylated H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 (with lower affinities). The affinity could be further enhanced up to 15-fold by the presence of DNA. The structure of the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 determined by NMR spectroscopy has an aromatic cage. Mutagenesis analysis identified four aromatic residues of the cage as the key residues for methylated lysine recognition. Our studies indicate that the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 is responsible for recognizing methylated histone tails in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation, which presents a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanism and relationship between RBBP1-related gene suppression and epigenetic regulation."

In addition to several known Rb cofactors, the screen identified components of the Mediator complex, a large multiprotein coactivator required for RNA polymerase II transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2016619382,"Although rarely acknowledged, our understanding of how competition is modulated by environmental drivers is severely hampered by our dependence on indirect measurements of outcomes, rather than the process of competition. To overcome this, we made direct measurements of plant competition for soil nitrogen (N). Using isotope pool-dilution, we examined the interactive effects of soil resource limitation and climatic severity between two common grassland species. Pool-dilution estimates the uptake of total N over a defined time period, rather than simply the uptake of 15N label, as used in most other tracer experiments. Competitive uptake of N was determined by its available form (NO3− or NH4+). Soil N availability had a greater effect than the climatic conditions (location) under which plants grew. The results did not entirely support either of the main current theories relating the role of competition to environmental conditions. We found no evidence for Tilman's theory that competition for soil nutrients is stronger at low, compared with high nutrient levels and partial support for Grime's theory that competition for soil nutrients is greater under potentially more productive conditions. These results provide novel insights by demonstrating the dynamic nature of plant resource competition."

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulates inflammation and the inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which specifically hydrolyzes cAMP, inhibits TNFα secretion. This study was aimed at investigating the evolution of PDE activity and expression levels during the course of the disease in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice, and to evaluate in these mice the biological and clinical effects of treatments with pentoxifylline, denbufylline and NCS 613 PDE inhibitors. This study reveals that compared to CBA/J control mice, kidney PDE4 activity of MRL/lpr mice increases with the disease progression. Furthermore, it showed that the most potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor NCS 613 is also the most effective molecule in decreasing proteinuria and increasing survival rate of MRL/lpr mice. NCS 613 is a potent inhibitor, which is more selective for the PDE4C subtype (IC₅₀= 1.4 nM) than the other subtypes (PDE4A, IC₅₀= 44 nM; PDE4B, IC₅₀= 48 nM; and PDE4D, IC₅₀= 14 nM). Interestingly, its affinity for the High Affinity Rolipram Binding Site is relatively low (K(i) = 148 nM) in comparison to rolipram (K(i) = 3 nM). Finally, as also observed using MRL/lpr peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), NCS 613 inhibits basal and LPS-induced TNFα secretion from PBLs of lupus patients, suggesting a therapeutic potential of NCS 613 in systemic lupus.

https://openalex.org/W2069724469,"HLA-DM plays an essential role in the peptide loading of classical class II molecules and is present both at the cell surface and in late endosomal peptide-loading compartments. Trafficking of DM within antigen-presenting cells is complex and is, in part, controlled by a tyrosine-based targeting signal present in the cytoplasmic tail of DMβ. Here, we show that DM also undergoes post-translational modification through ubiquitination of a single lysine residue present in the cytoplasmic tail of the α chain, DMα. Ubiquitination of DM by MARCH1 and MARCH9 induced loss of DM molecules from the cell surface by a mechanism that cumulatively involved both direct attachment of ubiquitin chains to DMα and a functional tyrosine-based signal on DMβ. In contrast, MARCH8-induced loss of surface DM was entirely dependent upon the tyrosine signal on DMβ. In the absence of this tyrosine residue, levels of DM remained unchanged irrespective of whether DMα was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. The influence of MARCH8 was indirect and may have resulted from modification of components of the endocytic machinery by ubiquitination."

T3SSs are ring-shaped macromolecular complexes specific for the transport of effector molecules into host cells. It was recently suggested that a cytosolic ring-shaped protein complex delivers effector molecules to the T3SS. However, how transport of effector proteins is regulated is not known. Here, we report the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the whole cytosolic domain of MxiG (MxiG1-126), a major component of the inner T3SS rings in Shigella flexneri. MxiG1-126 folds as an FHA domain, which specifically binds phosphorylated threonines. Indeed, MxiG1-126 binds to Spa33, a cytoplasmic-ring component of Shigella, as revealed in pulldown studies. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed specific interaction of MxiG with a Spa33 peptide only if phosphorylated. In total, 24 copies of the MxiG1-126 crystal structure were fitted into the cryo-EM map of the Shigella T3SS. The phosphoprotein binding site of each MxiG molecule faces the channel of the T3SS, allowing interaction with cytosolic binding partners.

A variety of molecular mechanisms modify CRH-R1 signaling. Previous studies have shown that protein kinases such as PKA mediate cross-talk between signaling pathways via phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues in the third intracellular loop (IC3) of CRH-R1, thereby regulating efficiency of receptor coupling to Gq protein and downstream ERK1/2 signaling (5.Papadopoulou N.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 624-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor kinases also influence CRH-R1 action through amino acid phosphorylation that leads to desensitization and subsequent endocytosis of receptor endocytosis (6.Teli T.

Specific Ser/Thr phosphoacceptor residues have been identified in both the IC3 and the distal segment of the C terminus of CRH-R1 (6.Teli T. Markovic D. Levine M.A. Hillhouse E.W. Grammatopoulos D.K.

Physiol. 2007; 293: R209-R222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the latter domain, especially at position Thr399, appears to be important for β-arrestin2 recruitment and desensitization of cAMP signaling (6.Teli T. Markovic D. Levine M.A. Hillhouse E.W. Grammatopoulos D.K.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 474-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mechanisms leading to desensitization do not affect coupling of CRH-R1 to all classes of G proteins (9.Wietfeld D. Heinrich N. Furkert J. Fechner K. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Berger H.

Receptor conformations that activate Gs and Gq/11 proteins are sensitive to desensitization, whereas Gi proteins are activated by different receptor states that do not promote signaling desensitization. The domains that determine coupling of CRH-R1 coupling to distinct G proteins and downstream signaling pathways are not well understood. Most GPCR dynamic functions such as receptor activation, internalization, desensitization, and resensitization involve key structural determinants present in the cytoplasmic loops and carboxyl tail (10.Gether U.

However, the extensive structural diversity among GPCRs suggests that efficient G protein coupling can be achieved through various unrelated structural motifs. In fact, conformation and charge rather than primary sequence appear to be the major determinants for G protein activation. Past studies have identified the IC3 as a key element that regulates the ability of GPCRs to activate G proteins and trigger intracellular responses (14.Peverelli E. Mantovani G. Calebiro D. Doni A. Bondioni S. Lania A. Beck-Peccoz P. Spada A.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33382-33389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Within IC3, the juxtamembrane regions of IC3 that form cationic α-helical structures (16.Ulfers A.L. McMurry J.L. Kendall D.A. Mierke D.F. Structure of the third intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid 1 receptor.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11344-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) appear to be important for the activation of distinct unrelated G protein subtypes. Moreover, the IC3 appears to be important for G protein-independent signaling of GPCRs; for example the IC3 N-terminal part of CXCR4 is required for JAK2 activation leading to phosphorylation of only one cytoplasmic Tyr residue, present at the C terminus of IC2, which triggers STAT3 activation (17.Ahr B. Denizot M. Robert-Hebmann V. Brelot A. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Identification of the cytoplasmic domains of CXCR4 involved in JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6692-6700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present studies we sought to identify the amino acid residues within IC3 that are critical for CRH-R1 signaling. We therefore introduced tandem and single alanine mutations by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, replacing amino acid cassettes at the juxtamembrane regions of IC3 or specific residues including basic amino acids (Arg292, Lys297, Arg299, Arg310, Lys311, and Lys314), and assessed the ligand binding and signaling characteristics of modified receptors. Our results demonstrate that both N- and C-terminal regions of the IC3 of CRH-R1 as well as basic amino acids possess specific structural elements with distinct contributions in G protein coupling and downstream cAMP production and ERK1/2 activation.

Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred to poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips (for confocal microscopy studies) or to 12-well plates for signaling studies. The experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Receptor expression was verified by confocal microscopy analysis. A series of CRH-R1α mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR using high fidelity Pfu polymerase and mutagenic primers (supplemental Table 1) as described previously (20.McPherson G. A practical computer-based approach to the analysis of radioligand binding experiments.Progr. Biomed. 1983; 17: 107-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The mutagenic CRH-R1 cDNA was cut sequentially with EcoRI and HindIII and then ligated back into the original pcDNA3.1(−). All mutant cDNAs were confirmed by sequence analysis of both strands (Molecular Biology Service, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick). Plasma membrane-rich fractions were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant CRH-R1 as described previously (19.Markovic D. Lehnert H. Levine M.A. Grammatopoulos D.K.

Radioiodinated Tyr0-sauvagine (50 pm to 5 nm) binding to membranes (100 mg) was carried out for 2 h at room temperature, as described previously (19.Markovic D. Lehnert H.

Nonspecific binding was 24 ± 5% of the total added radioactivity. The binding data were analyzed using the EBDA program (20.McPherson G.

ERK1/2 activation in response to 100 nm Ucn1 was determined in transiently transfected HEK293, seeded in 12-well plates to reach 60–70% confluence, as described previously using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Cambridge, UK), (19.Markovic D.

Structural determinants critical for localization and signaling within the seventh transmembrane domain of the type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor: lessons from the receptor variant R1d.Mol.

In some experiments Ucn1-induced cAMP production was determined following pretreatment of cells with either pertussis toxin (PTX) for 12 h, (final concentration, 100 ng/ml) or 20 mm mastoparan for 1 h, or the suramin analog NF023 (250 nm for 2 h). In some experiments, AC activity and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production were assessed using plasma membranes of HEK293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptors as described previously (22.Karteris E. Papadopoulou N. Grammatopoulos D.K. Hillhouse E.W. Expression and signaling characteristics of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors during the implantation phase in the human endometrium.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membrane preparations (25 μg of protein) were incubated in triplicate with Ucn1 (100 nm) at 22 °C in the presence of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 g/liter BSA, 1 mm ATP, ATP regeneration system (7.4 mg/ml creatine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, pH 7.4. The reaction was terminated after 15 min by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m imidazole buffer, pH 7, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Cyclic AMP was measured by ELISA. For the IP3 assay, cell membrane suspensions (40 μg) were incubated with increasing concentrations of Ucn1 followed by the addition of 200 μl of IP3 generation buffer containing 25 mm Tris actetate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 μm GTP. Membranes were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, followed by extraction of inositol phosphates and neutralization. IP3 levels were estimated by a radioreceptor assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on the displacement of [3H]IP3 from calf cerebellum-derived membranes containing the IP3-binding protein. For plasma membrane fractionation, cells were grown in 10-cm Petri dishes, and when 80% confluence was reached, cells were deprived of FCS for 1 h before treatment with 100 nm Ucn1 for 5 min. Membrane protein extracts were prepared using a ProteoExtract Native Membrane Protein Extraction kit (Calbiochem/Merck Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Protein fractions (5 μg) were analyzed by Western blot analysis using CRH-R1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (dilution 1:100). Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences. The relative density of the bands was measured by optical density scanning using the software Scion Image-Beta 3b for Windows (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, plasma membrane fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies specific for CRH-R1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to a final concentration of 1:100 and protein A/G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in PBS, and proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by heating at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer. The resuspended proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Following blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 30 min, membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with Gαi1/2 protein-specific antisera (dilution 1:200). After incubation with the secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, proteins were visualized with ECL. The relative involvement of Gαs and Gαi proteins on AC activation in HEK293 cells, transfected with wild-type or mutant CRH-R1α, was quantified as follows: cAMP responses (measured as Ucn1-induced cAMP -fold increase above basal) in control cells (RT) were considered as responses involving both Gαs + Gαi; cAMP responses in cells pretreated with PTX that inactivated GαI proteins were considered as Gαs-exclusive responses (Rs). The Gαi protein contribution (Ri) was calculated by using the equation: Ri = Rs − RT. The results obtained are presented as the mean ± S.E. of each measurement. Data were tested for homogeneity, and comparison between group means was performed by one- or two-way ANOVA. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. To identify residue(s) in the CRH-R1α N- and C-terminal regions of IC3 involved in receptor signaling, we used a tandem alanine scanning mutagenesis strategy, in which four consecutive amino acid residues were replaced by alanines (Fig. 1). A series of additional mutants was also generated containing single Ala substitutions of residues in the proximal (Arg292-Met295) and distal (Lys311-Lys314) terminal segments, as well as the charged amino acids Lys297, Arg299, Arg310. Mutant and wild-type receptors were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and immunoblotting experiments using a specific CRH-R1/2 Ab demonstrated that levels of expression at the cell membrane were similar (supplemental Fig. 1). Most mutants retained high binding affinity for the radiolabeled agonist 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine (supplemental Table 2), comparable with the wild-type CRH-R1α (data not shown), indicating retention of the normal conformation of the wild-type receptor. However, mutant CRH-R1α(N-4A/C-4A), where both N- and C-juxtamembrane regions of IC3 were substituted to Ala, showed a 5–8-fold increase in IC50 compared with the wild-type receptor (8.79 ± 2.93 versus 1.26 ± 0.76 nm, respectively), indicating reduced ligand binding affinity. Cell membranes expressing wild-type or mutant CRH-R1α receptors exhibited comparable levels of total amount of binding sites (Bmax) available for agonist binding (average 865 ± 60 ranging from 714 ± 36 to 980 ± 135 fmol/mg of protein, respectively, as determined by Scatchard analysis of 125I-Tyr0-sauvagine binding to plasma membranes) (supplemental Table 2). By contrast, the Bmax of overexpressed CRH-R1α(N-4A/C-4A) mutant was also found to be decreased by 15–20% (p < 0.05). Our previous studies (26.Brar B.K. Chen A. Perrin M.H. Vale W. Specificity and regulation of extracellularly regulated kinase1/2 phosphorylation through corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors 1 and 2β by the CRF/urocortin family of peptides.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1718-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although the CRH-R1α can activate multiple classes of G proteins, it is most efficiently coupled to Gαs proteins leading to downstream activation of AC and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels (24.Grammatopoulos D.K. Dai Y. Randeva H.S. Levine M.A. Karteris E. Easton A.J. Hillhouse E.W. A novel spliced variant of the type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor with a deletion in the seventh transmembrane domain present in the human pregnant term myometrium and fetal membranes.Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2189-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The role of the juxtamembrane regions of the IC3 predicted amino acid sequence in Ucn1-induced cAMP production was further investigated in HEK293 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant CRH-R1α. Introduction of tandem Ala mutations in either the Arg292-Met295 or Lys311-Lys314 terminal regions of the IC3 (mutants CRH-R1α(N-4A) and CRH-R1α(C-4A), respectively) significantly increased maximal cAMP production stimulated by Ucn1, by 78 and 87% respectively, compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2a). These mutations did not substantially alter the EC50 values of mutant receptors (supplemental Table 3). However, mutant CRH-R1α(N-4A/C-4A) demonstrated a 90% decrease in cAMP response compared with the wild-type receptor, suggesting that disruption of IC3 secondary structure severely impaired receptor ability to couple to G proteins crucial for AC activation. Interestingly, the N- and C-tandem Ala mutations altered the shape of agonist dose-response curves; although the wild-type receptor exhibited a biphasic pattern of responses where maximum cAMP production at 100 nm Ucn1 was followed by a slightly reduced response at higher agonist concentration (1 mm), mutant receptor responses were characterized by a plateau at the maximum response with no apparent reduction observed at higher Ucn1 concentrations. These changes might reflect alterations (reduction) in inhibitory G protein contribution to AC activation in the mutants compared with the wild-type receptor at high Ucn1 concentrations. To identify specific amino acid residues important for G protein coupling and AC activation, we examined agonist-induced cAMP responses in a series of mutant CRH-R1α receptors that contained single Ala substitutions throughout the N- and C-terminal segments of IC3 as well as other charged amino acids. We found that single Ala substitution of any of the five charged amino acids (Arg292, Lys297, Arg310, Lys311, or Lys314) significantly increased Ucn1-induced maximal cAMP production, without affecting EC50 values of cAMP responses (EC50 (nm) = 4 ± 0.8) (Fig. 2b). Receptor activation of cAMP was increased by 70% over wild-type when Arg292 or Lys311 was replaced by alanine whereas Lys297, Arg310, or Lys314 substitution led only to a 50% increase in cAMP production. A significant increase in cAMP response, albeit to a lesser degree, was also observed when either Lys294 or Met295 was replaced by alanine (25 and 30% increase of wild-type receptor cAMP response, respectively). In contrast, Ala substitution of Arg299 reduced by 20–25% maximum cAMP production, again without affecting EC50 value of cAMP response. Previous studies (4.Grammatopoulos D.K. Randeva H.S.

Hence, we used CRH and Ucn1 to activate CRH-R1α mutants to investigate whether Ala substitutions resulted in agonist-speci"
https://openalex.org/W1969406326,"We show that changes in the nucleotide sequence alter the DNA conformation in the crystal structures of p63 DNA-binding domain (p63DBD) bound to its response element. The conformation of a 22-bp canonical response element containing an AT spacer between the two half-sites is unaltered compared with that containing a TA spacer, exhibiting superhelical trajectory. In contrast, a GC spacers abolishes the DNA superhelical trajectory and exhibits less bent DNA, suggesting that increased GC content accompanies increased double helix rigidity. A 19-bp DNA, representing an AT-rich response element with overlapping half-sites, maintains superhelical trajectory and reveals two interacting p63DBD dimers crossing one another at 120°. p63DBD binding assays to response elements of increasing length complement the structural studies. We propose that DNA deformation may affect promoter activity, that the ability of p63DBD to bind to superhelical DNA suggests that it is capable of binding to nucleosomes, and that overlapping response elements may provide a mechanism to distinguish between p63 and p53 promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2085344467,"Dispersal theory generally predicts kin competition, inbreeding, and temporal variation in habitat quality should select for dispersal, whereas spatial variation in habitat quality should select against dispersal. The effect of predation on the evolution of dispersal is currently not well-known: because predation can be variable in both space and time, it is not clear whether or when predation will promote dispersal within prey. Moreover, the evolution of prey dispersal affects strongly the encounter rate of predator and prey individuals, which greatly determines the ecological dynamics, and in turn changes the selection pressures for prey dispersal, in an eco-evolutionary feedback loop. When taken all together the effect of predation on prey dispersal is rather difficult to predict. We analyze a spatially explicit, individual-based predator-prey model and its mathematical approximation to investigate the evolution of prey dispersal. Competition and predation depend on local, rather than landscape-scale densities, and the spatial pattern of predation corresponds well to that of predators using restricted home ranges (e.g. central-place foragers). Analyses show the balance between the level of competition and predation pressure an individual is expected to experience determines whether prey should disperse or stay close to their parents and siblings, and more predation selects for less prey dispersal. Predators with smaller home ranges also select for less prey dispersal; more prey dispersal is favoured if predators have large home ranges, are very mobile, and/or are evenly distributed across the landscape."

Following a dose of 500 Gy of gamma radiation, the fragmented genomic DNA is gradually reconstructed and the pattern of chromosomal bands is restored in less than 48 hours. Cell growth arrests after irradiation but, while DNA is completely fragmented, RNA maintains its integrity. In this work we compared the transcriptional profiles of irradiated and non-irradiated epimastigotes at different time points after irradiation using microarray. In total, 273 genes were differentially expressed; from these, 160 were up-regulated and 113 down-regulated. We found that genes with predicted functions are the most prevalent in the down-regulated gene category. Translation and protein metabolic processes, as well as generation of precursor of metabolites and energy pathways were affected. In contrast, the up-regulated category was mainly composed of obsolete sequences (which included some genes of the kinetoplast DNA), genes coding for hypothetical proteins, and Retrotransposon Hot Spot genes. Finally, the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, a gene involved in double-strand DNA break repair process, was up-regulated. Our study demonstrated the peculiar response to ionizing radiation, raising questions about how this organism changes its gene expression to manage such a harmful stress."
https://openalex.org/W1971485225,"Echinoderms take many forms of symmetry. Pentameral symmetry is the major form and the other forms are derived from it. However, the ancestors of echinoderms, which originated from Cambrian period, were believed to be bilaterians. Echinoderm larvae are bilateral during their early development. During embryonic development of starfish and sea urchins, the position and the developmental sequence of each arm are fixed, implying an auxological anterior/posterior axis. Starfish also possess the Hox gene cluster, which controls symmetrical development. Overall, echinoderms are thought to have a bilateral developmental mechanism and process. In this article, we focused on adult starfish behaviors to corroborate its bilateral tendency. We weighed their central disk and each arm to measure the position of the center of gravity. We then studied their turning-over behavior, crawling behavior and fleeing behavior statistically to obtain the center of frequency of each behavior. By joining the center of gravity and each center of frequency, we obtained three behavioral symmetric planes. These behavioral bilateral tendencies might be related to the A/P axis during the embryonic development of the starfish. It is very likely that the adult starfish is, to some extent, bilaterian because it displays some bilateral propensity and has a definite behavioral symmetric plane. The remainder of bilateral symmetry may have benefited echinoderms during their evolution from the Cambrian period to the present."

The structures of reaction centers reveal two symmetry-related branches of cofactors (denoted A and B) that are functionally asymmetric; purple bacterial reaction centers use the A pathway exclusively. Previously, site-specific mutagenesis has yielded reaction centers capable of transmembrane charge separation solely via the B branch cofactors, but the best overall electron transfer yields are still low. In an attempt to better realize the architectural and energetic factors that underlie the directionality and yields of electron transfer, sites within the protein-cofactor complex were targeted in a directed molecular evolution strategy that implements streamlined mutagenesis and high throughput spectroscopic screening. The polycistronic approach enables efficient construction and expression of a large number of variants of a heteroligomeric complex that has two intimately regulated subunits with high sequence similarity, common features of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic transmembrane protein assemblies. The strategy has succeeded in the discovery of several mutant reaction centers with increased efficiency of the B pathway; they carry multiple substitutions that have not been explored or linked using traditional approaches. This work expands our understanding of the structure-function relationships that dictate the efficiency of biological energy-conversion reactions, concepts that will aid the design of bio-inspired assemblies capable of both efficient charge separation and charge stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2008056257,"A novel procedure is presented which, by balancing elements and electric charge of biochemical reactions which occur at constant pH and pMg, allows assessing the thermodynamics properties of reaction Δ(r)G'⁰, Δ(r)H'⁰, Δ(r)S'⁰ and the change in binding of hydrogen and magnesium ions of these reactions. This procedure of general applicability avoids the complex calculations required by the use of the Legendre transformed thermodynamic properties of formation Δ(f)G'⁰, Δ(f)H'⁰ and Δ(f)S'⁰ hitherto considered an obligatory prerequisite to deal with the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions. As a consequence, the term ""conditional"" is proposed in substitution of ""Legendre transformed"" to indicate these thermodynamics properties. It is also shown that the thermodynamic potential G is fully adequate to give a criterion of spontaneous chemical change for all biochemical reactions and then that the use of the Legendre transformed G' is unnecessary. The procedure proposed can be applied to any biochemical reaction, making possible to re-unify the two worlds of chemical and biochemical thermodynamics, which so far have been treated separately."
https://openalex.org/W2053841647,"Background In the USA, most HIV-1 infected children are on antiretroviral drug regimens, with many individuals surviving through adolescence and into adulthood. The course of HIV-1 infection in these children is variable, and understudied. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined whether qualitative differences in immune cell subsets could explain a slower disease course in long term survivors with no evidence of immune suppression (LTS-NS; CD4%≥25%) compared to those with severe immune suppression (LTS-SS; CD4%≤15%). Subjects in the LTS-NS group had significantly higher frequencies of naïve (CCR7+CD45RA+) and central memory (CCR7+CD45RA−) CD4+ T cells compared to LTS-SS subjects (p = 0.0005 and <0.0001, respectively). Subjects in the rapid progressing group had significantly higher levels of CD4+ TEMRA (CCR7−CD45RA+) cells compared to slow progressing subjects (p<0.0001). Conclusions/Significance Rapid disease progression in vertical infection is associated with significantly higher levels of CD4+ TEMRA (CCR7−CD45RA+) cells."
