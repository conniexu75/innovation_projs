Direct imaging in three dimensions allowed identification and observation of both nucleation and growth of crystalline regions, providing an experimental measure of properties of the nucleating crystallites. By following their evolution, we identified critical nuclei, determined nucleation rates, and measured the average surface tension of the crystal-liquid interface. The structure of the nuclei was the same as the bulk solid phase, random hexagonal close-packed, and their average shape was rather nonspherical, with rough rather than faceted surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1989756472,"Brief depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells was found to inhibit parallel fiber and climbing fiber EPSCs for tens of seconds. This depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) is accompanied by altered paired-pulse plasticity, suggesting a presynaptic locus. Fluorometric imaging revealed that postsynaptic depolarization also reduces presynaptic calcium influx. The inhibition of both presynaptic calcium influx and EPSCs is eliminated by buffering postsynaptic calcium with BAPTA. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 prevents DSE, and the agonist WIN 55,212-2 occludes DSE. These findings suggest that Purkinje cells release endogenous cannabinoids in response to elevated calcium, thereby inhibiting presynaptic calcium entry and suppressing transmitter release. DSE may provide a way for cells to use their firing rate to dynamically regulate synaptic inputs. Together with previous studies, these findings suggest a widespread role for endogenous cannabinoids in retrograde synaptic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1968083340,"Endogenous cannabinoids are considered to function as diffusible and short-lived modulators that may transmit signals retrogradely from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons. To evaluate this possibility, we have made a paired whole-cell recording from cultured hippocampal neurons with inhibitory synaptic connections. In about 60% of pairs, a cannabinoid agonist greatly reduced the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from presynaptic terminals. In most of such pairs but not in those insensitive to the agonist, depolarization of postsynaptic neurons and the resultant elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents, which is mainly due to reduction of GABA release. This depolarization-induced suppression was completely blocked by selective cannabinoid antagonists. Our results reveal that endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signals from depolarized postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic terminals to cause the reduction of transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2029758788,"We present an analysis of the current foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain over the first 2 months of the spread of the virus. The net transmission potential of the pathogen and the increasing impact of control measures are estimated over the course of the epidemic to date. These results are used to parameterize a mathematical model of disease transmission that captures the differing spatial contact patterns between farms before and after the imposition of movement restrictions. The model is used to make predictions of future incidence and to simulate the impact of additional control strategies. Hastening the slaughter of animals with suspected infection is predicted to slow the epidemic, but more drastic action, such as ""ring"" culling or vaccination around infection foci, is necessary for more rapid control. Culling is predicted to be more effective than vaccination."

Here we report a new role for trehalose in protecting cells against oxygen radicals. Exposure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a mild heat shock (38 °C) or to a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) induced trehalose accumulation and markedly increased the viability of the cells upon exposure to a free radical-generating system (H2O2/iron). When cells were returned to normal growth temperature (28 °C) or MG132 was removed from the medium, the trehalose content and resistance to oxygen radicals decreased rapidly. Furthermore, a mutant unable to synthesize trehalose was much more sensitive to killing by oxygen radicals than wild-type cells. Providing trehalose exogenously enhanced the resistance of mutant cells to H2O2. Exposure of cells to H2O2 caused oxidative damage to amino acids in cellular proteins, and trehalose accumulation was found to reduce such damage. After even brief exposure to H2O2, the trehalose-deficient mutant exhibited a much higher content of oxidatively damaged proteins than wild-type cells. Trehalose accumulation decreased the initial appearance of damaged proteins, presumably by acting as a free radical scavenger.

Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These ROS can damage proteins by causing modifications of amino acid side chains, formation of cross-links between proteins, and fragmentation of the polypeptide backbone (2Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS can modify bases and sugars in DNA, leading to DNA chain breaks (3Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol.

Oxidative damage to cellular components may contribute to the aging process and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and reperfusion injury (1Stadtman E.R.

A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5369) Google Scholar). Moreover, in yeast and bacteria, oxidative damage also contributes to the cell death occurring upon exposure to high temperatures or at stationary phase (6Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A number of biochemical systems have evolved to protect cells against ROS, including enzymes (e.g. catalase and superoxide dismutase) as well as the nonenzymatic protective molecules, glutathione and thioredoxin (5Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5369) Google Scholar, 8Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Exposure of cells to elevated temperatures or to other harsh treatments that damage cell proteins (e.g. hydrogen peroxide or ethanol) induces the heat shock response (9Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response increases the ability of the cells to resist a subsequent exposure to a high and otherwise lethal temperature or toxic agents. This induced tolerance to harsh conditions is generally believed to be caused by the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (10Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). Many HSPs are molecular chaperones that promote the refolding of damaged proteins (11Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 12Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Other HSPs are components of the proteolytic machinery of the cell, which degrade irreversibly damaged proteins (e.g.ATP-dependent proteases in bacteria and ubiquitin in eukaryotic cells) (13Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 14Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Experientia Suppl. ( Basel ). 1996; 77: 57-78PubMed Google Scholar).In bacteria and yeast, the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-1,1-α-d-glucopyranoside) also accumulates to high concentrations during heat shock and stationary phase (15Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Hottiger T. Boller T. Wiemken A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In yeast, the concentration of trehalose can be as high as 500 mm during heat shock (18Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and the accumulation of this disaccharide is important for the associated thermotolerance (19Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the enzymes involved in trehalose biosynthesis reduces the level of thermotolerance induced by exposure to a mild heat shock and at stationary phase (20Hengge-Aronis R. Klein W. Lange R. Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7918-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that treatment of yeast with proteasome inhibitors (e.g. MG132) caused an accumulation of trehalose as well as HSPs and increased thermotolerance (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Upon removal of these inhibitors, thermotolerance fell rapidly together with the trehalose content, whereas the level of HSPs did not decrease. Thus, thermotolerance correlated closely with the trehalose content in the cell but not with the level of HSPs (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Trehalose has been shown to protect proteins against thermal inactivation (18Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and Singer and Lindquist (23Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this sugar reduces protein aggregation and maintains polypeptide chains in a partially folded state, thus facilitating their refolding by cellular chaperones. Although trehalose has not been found thus far in mammals, this sugar has been found to improve the tolerance of mammalian cells to dessication (24Guo N. Puhlev I. Brown D.R. Mansbridge J. Levine F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and cryopreservation (25Eroglu A. Russo M.J. Bieganski R. Fowler A. Cheley S. Bayley H. Toner M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).When yeast or mammalian cells are exposed to a mild heat shock or to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, they also develop increased resistance to lethal doses of hydrogen peroxide (26Wieser R.

Catalase and superoxide dismutase, the synthesis of which increases during heat shock or exposure to oxidants (26Wieser R. Adam G. Wagner A. Schuller C. Marchler G. Ruis H. Krawiec Z. Bilinski T. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), contribute to this enhanced resistance. However, the cellular mechanisms that actually provide protection against ROS are not well defined. Although the possible involvement of trehalose in protection against oxygen radicals has never been studied, two findings led us to hypothesize that it may serve such a role: (i) large amounts of trehalose accumulate in yeast during exposure to oxidants (16Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and (ii) mannitol, a sugar alcohol, is known to be a potent free-radical scavenger (33Takahashi R. Goto S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Li S. Patapoff T.W. Nguyen T.H. Borchardt R.T. J. Pharm. Sci. 1996; 85: 672-868Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether trehalose may play an important role in protecting yeast against oxidative damage. We have tested whether various treatments that stimulate trehalose production or that reduce trehalose content cause concomitant changes in the resistance of the cell to oxygen radicals. In addition, we used a yeast mutant that cannot synthesize trehalose to investigate whether this sugar is in fact responsible for the changes in resistance to oxidants and whether this disaccharide may also reduce oxidative damage to cell proteins.DISCUSSIONTrehalose is found in organisms as diverse as plants, insects, and invertebrates, as well as eukaryotic microorganisms and bacteria, in which it accumulates dramatically during stationary phase, heat shock, and oxidative stress (19Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Trehalose was long believed to function as a carbohydrate reserve; however, subsequent studies showed that this sugar has an important role in protecting cells against thermal damage (21De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 48Elliott B. Haltiwanger R.S. Futcher B. Genetics. 1996; 144: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here a new and distinct function for trehalose in protecting cells against oxygen radicals. We have shown that the ability of cells to withstand the lethal effect of oxygen radicals rises with the increase in their trehalose content upon a mild heat shock or exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, upon termination of these stimuli, trehalose content decreases rapidly to the low levels seen in untreated cells, and the resistance of the cells to the oxidants also falls. Concomitant changes in trehalose content and resistance to oxygen radicals were observed in two strains (W303–1a and ise1) with two different growth media and four different experimental treatments. Although large changes in trehalose level occurred within 10 min after the downshift in temperature, these correlations were observed for short (10 min) or longer (60 min) times of exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Therefore, these findings actually indicate that the initial trehalose content in the cell correlates with its resistance to a subsequent exposure to oxidants. Moreover, by using a trehalose-deficient mutant, we showed that trehalose accumulation is responsible for this increased resistance to oxygen radicals.Although heat shock and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 also stimulate the expression of various HSPs, their production cannot account for the alterations in sensitivity to oxidants shown here. In previous studies, we demonstrated that when the inhibitor MG132 was removed, the level of various HSPs did not decrease, whereas trehalose and thermotolerance fell rapidly (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thermotolerance thus does not correlate with the level of HSPs. In the present experiments, when MG132 was removed or when heat-shocked cells were returned to 30 °C, resistance to oxygen radicals also fell within 30 min to levels close to those of control cells. Further evidence that the level of HSPs does not correlate with sensitivity to H2O2 was the finding that the trehalose-deficient mutant, although able to induce HSPs such as catalase at 35 °C, still required trehalose for the associated increase in resistance to oxidants. Presumably, trehalose functionsin vivo synergistically with the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidases) to protect cells from oxygen radicals.Perhaps the strongest evidence for the protective role of trehalose was that its addition to the medium markedly enhanced the resistance of the cells to oxygen radicals. Most likely, trehalose enhances resistance to oxidative stress by quenching oxygen radicals generated either in the medium by the H2O2/iron mixture or inside cells after entry of H2O2. Enhanced survival was also observed when the sugar alcohol mannitol or the monosaccharide galactose was added to the medium, although trehalose seemed more potent in protecting cells. Both mannitol and galactose have been shown to scavenge hydroxyl radicals in vitro (42Tauber A.I. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 43Litchfield W.J. Wells W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 188: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This protective effect, however, is not a general property of all sugars because another disaccharide, sucrose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-1,2-β-d-fructofuranoside), was not able to protect the cells from H2O2. This difference in enhancing resistance to oxygen radicals is surprising because both are nonreducing disaccharides. It remains to be established whether this difference is caused by a lesser ability of sucrose to quench oxygen radicals or to enter the cells.A role for trehalose in protection against oxidative damage has not been proposed previously in the literature. However, several findings are consistent with such a role. Expression of the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPS2), which catalyzes the second step in trehalose biosynthesis, requires the stress response element-binding protein, YAP1, which controls the expression of other antioxidant proteins including thioredoxin and catalase (49Gounalaki N. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, Godon et al. (32Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) found that TPS2 was among the proteins induced during adaptation to H2O2 in yeast.Defense against oxygen radicals also seems important when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or during stationary phase, two conditions in which trehalose production rises dramatically. In fact, oxygen radicals contribute to the loss of cell viability when yeast are shifted to 50 °C, and both catalase and superoxide dismutase help cells to resist lethal high temperatures (6Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition, in bacteria, oxidative damage to proteins is increased during stationary phase (7Dukan S. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The particular sensitivity of the trehalose-deficient cells to heat shock has been attributed to its role in preventing protein aggregation. However, trehalose may also help cells to survive heat shock by reducing oxidative damage at high temperatures. Similarly, trehalose production may be important in pathogenic microorganisms as a mechanism to enhance resistance to the oxidants generated by phagocytic cells and therefore may contribute to their virulence. A similar role has been proposed for mannitol in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (50Chatuverdi V. Wong B. Newman S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3836-3840PubMed Google Scholar). Mannitol produced by this fungus was shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by human neutrophils during respiratory burst (50Chatuverdi V. Wong B. Newman S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3836-3840PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, when the fungus Alternaria alternata infects a plant, it secretes mannitol presumably to scavenge oxygen radicals produced by the host plant (50Chatuverdi V. Wong B. Newman S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3836-3840PubMed Google Scholar, 51Jennings D.B. Ehrenshaft M. Pharr D.M. Williamson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95 (. J.): 15129-15133WCrossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Trehalose has not been found thus far in mammals, although early studies have not examined cells during heat shock or oxidative stress. It is possible that other polyols might have evolved in mammalian cells to serve a similar protective role. In fact, inositol and sorbitol have been found to accumulate in tissue culture during oxidative stress (52Rego A.C. Duarte E.P. Oliveira C.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and osmotic stress (53Mizisin A.P. Li L. Perello M. Freshwater J.D. Kalichman M.W. Roux L. Calcutt N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 90-97PubMed Google Scholar, 54Mizisin A.P. Li L. Calcutt N.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and therefore it is tempting to speculate that they might also be important in protecting against free radicals.When the trehalose content in the cells is low (e.g. when yeast grow at 28 °C or in the tps1tps2 mutant), cellular proteins are more susceptible to covalent damage by free radicals, as shown here by the increased appearance of carbonyl groups. This ability of trehalose to reduce covalent modifications of proteins by oxidants indicates a new property of this sugar that can not be simply explained by its ability to prevent protein aggregation and to facilitate refolding of damaged polypeptides by chaperones (23Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Many proteins in yeast showed such modifications, and trehalose accumulation seemed to reduce oxidative damage to all these proteins to a similar extent, as would be expected if trehalose functions by scavenging free radicals. By rapidly reacting with ROS, trehalose would prevent their reaction with proteins and other cellular constituents (e.g. DNA, RNA, or lipids). Such an ability to soak up ROS has been demonstrated for mannitol and glycerol, both of which in vitro can reduce oxidative damage to proteins (33Takahashi R. Goto S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Li S. Patapoff T.W. Nguyen T.H. Borchardt R.T. J. Pharm. Sci. 1996; 85: 672-868Google Scholar, 55Davies K.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8227-8234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of trehalose to reduce oxidant-induced modifications of proteins and its capacity to prevent protein aggregation probably involve different chemical mechanisms. However, because oxidantly damaged proteins tend to be denatured and to aggregate, both mechanisms may be important in protecting against oxidative stress.Oxidatively damaged proteins tend to aggregate, presumably because the oxidative modification of critical residues leads to protein unfolding (56Pacifici R.E. Kono Y. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15405-15411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Giulivi C. Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and these abnormal proteins are selectively degraded in cells (55Davies K.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8227-8234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). It is possible that trehalose accumulation may also promote the degradation of these potentially toxic proteins (e.g. by reducing oxidative damage to the proteolytic machinery of the cell or by maintaining the damaged polypeptides in an easily degraded soluble form). Such an effect, however, cannot account for the present findings. The trehalose-deficient cells showed a much greater content of oxidatively damaged proteins even after a very short exposure to H2O2, which indicates that trehalose primarily prevents the initial damage by free radicals rather than facilitating long-term cellular responses such as the selective breakdown of oxidatively damaged proteins. Certain essential proteins may be especially susceptible to damage by oxygen radicals, and the capacity of trehalose to prevent such damage probably contributes to its ability to prevent cell death upon oxidative stress. The present findings also strongly suggest that trehalose should also protect other essential cellular constituents (e.g. DNA or lipids) from damage by oxygen radicals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 especially hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals, are generated in cells through normal metabolic activity, by ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, and by macrophages and neutrophils during phagocytosis (1Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These ROS can damage proteins by causing modifications of amino acid side chains, formation of cross-links between proteins, and fragmentation of the polypeptide backbone (2Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS can modify bases and sugars in DNA, leading to DNA chain breaks (3Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and cause lipid peroxidation in cell membranes (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem.

Oxidative damage to cellular components may contribute to the aging process and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and reperfusion injury (1Stadtman E.R.

A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5369) Google Scholar). Moreover, in yeast and bacteria, oxidative damage also contributes to the cell death occurring upon exposure to high temperatures or at stationary phase (6Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,7Dukan S. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A number of biochemical systems have evolved to protect cells against ROS, including enzymes (e.g. catalase and superoxide dismutase) as well as the nonenzymatic protective molecules, glutathione and thioredoxin (5Ames B.N.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to elevated temperatures or to other harsh treatments that damage cell proteins (e.g. hydrogen peroxide or ethanol) induces the heat shock response (9Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response increases the ability of the cells to resist a subsequent exposure to a high and otherwise lethal temperature or toxic agents. This induced tolerance to harsh conditions is generally believed to be caused by the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (10Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). Many HSPs are molecular chaperones that promote the refolding of damaged proteins (11Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 12Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Other HSPs are components of the proteolytic machinery of the cell, which degrade irreversibly damaged proteins (e.g.ATP-dependent proteases in bacteria and ubiquitin in eukaryotic cells) (13Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 14Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Experientia Suppl. ( Basel ). 1996; 77: 57-78PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria and yeast, the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-1,1-α-d-glucopyranoside) also accumulates to high concentrations during heat shock and stationary phase (15Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Attfield P.V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Hottiger T. Boller T. Wiemken A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In yeast, the concentration of trehalose can be as high as 500 mm during heat shock (18Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and the accumulation of this disaccharide is important for the associated thermotolerance (19Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the enzymes involved in trehalose biosynthesis reduces the level of thermotolerance induced by exposure to a mild heat shock and at stationary phase (20Hengge-Aronis R. Klein W. Lange R. Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7918-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that treatment of yeast with proteasome inhibitors (e.g. MG132) caused an accumulation of trehalose as well as HSPs and increased thermotolerance (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Upon removal of these inhibitors, thermotolerance fell rapidly together with the trehalose content, whereas the level of HSPs did not decrease. Thus, thermotolerance correlated closely with the trehalose content in the cell but not with the level of HSPs (22Lee D.H."
https://openalex.org/W2027543152,"We compared the temporal variability of the heat content of the world ocean, of the global atmosphere, and of components of Earth's cryosphere during the latter half of the 20th century. Each component has increased its heat content (the atmosphere and the ocean) or exhibited melting (the cryosphere). The estimated increase of observed global ocean heat content (over the depth range from 0 to 3000 meters) between the 1950s and 1990s is at least one order of magnitude larger than the increase in heat content of any other component. Simulation results using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model that includes estimates of the radiative effects of observed temporal variations in greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, solar irradiance, and volcanic aerosols over the past century agree with our observation-based estimate of the increase in ocean heat content. The results we present suggest that the observed increase in ocean heat content may largely be due to the increase of anthropogenic gases in Earth's atmosphere."

Exceptional spectral power in climate is recorded at the 406-thousand-year (ky) period eccentricity band over a 3.4-million-year period [20 to 23.4 My ago (Ma)] as well as in the 125- and 95-ky bands over a 1.3-million-year period (21.7 to 23.0 Ma) of suspected low greenhouse gas levels. Moreover, a major transient glaciation at the epoch boundary ( approximately 23 Ma), Mi-1, corresponds with a rare orbital congruence involving obliquity and eccentricity. The anomaly, which consists of low-amplitude variance in obliquity (a node) and a minimum in eccentricity, results in an extended period ( approximately 200 ky) of low seasonality orbits favorable to ice-sheet expansion on Antarctica."

This report demonstrates that, in the whisker representation of rat cortex, precise spike timing of single neurons increases the information transmitted about stimulus location by 44%, compared to that transmitted only by the total number of spikes. Crucial to this code is the timing of the first spike after whisker movement. Complex, single neuron spike patterns play a smaller, synergistic role.

https://openalex.org/W2085145708,"Large-scale increases in the heat content of the world's oceans have been observed to occur over the last 45 years. The horizontal and temporal character of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint."

Two of these proteins, IRF-3 and IRF-7, serve as direct transducers of virus-mediated signaling and play critical roles in the induction of type I interferon genes. We have now shown that another factor, IRF-5, participates in the induction of interferon A (IFNA) and IFNB genes and can replace the requirement for IRF-7 in the induction of IFNA genes. We demonstrate that, despite the functional similarity, IRF-5 possesses unique characteristics and does not have a redundant role. Thus, 1) activation of IRF-5 by phosphorylation is virus-specific, and its in vivo association with the IFNA promoter can be detected only in cells infected with NDV, not Sendai virus, while both viruses activate IRF-3 and IRF-7, and 2) NDV infection of IRF-5-overexpressing cells preferentially induced the IFNA8 subtype, while IFNA1 was primarily induced in IRF-7 expressing cells.

Whitton J.L. Immunity. 2000; 12: 451-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among these, IFNs1 play a unique role because they can both activate immune cells and directly inhibit viral replication. In addition to their role in innate resistance against a large number of viruses, human type I IFNs (IFN α and IFN β) promote differentiation of dendritic cells (2Santini S.M. Lapenta C. Logozzi M. Parlato S. Spada M. Di Pucchio T. Belardelli F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and induce polarization of a peripheral CD4+ subset of T cells to T helper type 1 terminally differentiated effector cells producing high levels of IFNγ. Type I IFNs also protect CD8+ cells from antigen-induced cell death (3Marrack P. Kappler J. Mitchell T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of type I IFNs represents a defense mechanism that bridges innate and T cell-mediated immunity. The type I IFNs are encoded by a single IFNB gene and 13 closely related IFNA genes that are all clustered on human chromosome 9p22 (4Diaz M.O. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 143-149Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although most cells do not constitutively produce type I IFNs, many DNA and RNA viruses have been found to induce IFN α and β production (5Ho M. Interferon and Interferon Inducers. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 29-44Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism that leads to the activation of these IFN genes has not yet been clarified. However, it has been demonstrated that the transcription factors of the IRF family play a critical role in the activation of IFN genes (6Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Overexpression of IRF-3 induces an antiviral state and expression of IFNB in uninfected cells, suggesting that IRF-3 can act as a primary inducer (7Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In human cells, however, expression of IRF-3 is insufficient for the virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes, which also requires IRF-7 (9Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Human IRF-7 is expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, and its expression is stimulated by type I IFNs (12Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Silencing of IRF-7 by methylation of CpG clusters in the promoter was observed in several tumor cell lines (28Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and these cells were unable to express IFNA when infected. Viral infection stimulated expression of IFNA genes only after reconstitution of IRF-7 by ectopic expression (9Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, infected murine fibroblasts from DKO IRF9−/− mice that do not respond to type I IFN treatment do not express IRF-7; nor does viral infection stimulate the expression of IFNA genes (29Sato M. Hata M. Asagiri T. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). One of the remaining questions is what determines the profile of individual IFNA genes expressed upon viral infection. Is the cell type-specific expression profile of IFNA subtypes dependent on the relative levels of IRFs in the cell? Expression of IFNA and B genes in infected primary mouse fibroblasts with homozygous deletion of the IRF-3 gene was inhibited but not completely abolished; however, the subtype profile was altered (8Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Also, the profile of IFNA genes expressed in infected human 2fTGH/IRF-7 cells was modulated when IRF-3 levels were down-regulated by the IRF-3-specific ribozyme (30Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Lowther W.P. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ratio between relative levels of IRF-3 and IRF-7 affects the expression profile of IFNA subtypes. The contribution of other cellular IRFs to the differential expression of IFNA genes is unknown. Analysis of the relative levels of IRFs expressed in precursor dendritic cells, pDC2, that express high levels of IFN α after virus stimulation (31Siegal F.P. Kadowaki N Shodell M. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P.A. Shah K. Ho S. Antonenko S. Liu Y.J. Science. 1999; 284: 1835-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar) has shown that in addition to IRF-3 and IRF-7, other IRFs, such as IRF-5, may be important (32Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P.A. Yeow W.S. Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J. Pitha P.M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11 (abstr.): 33Google Scholar). Since IRF-5 has not been characterized, we have cloned IRF-5 cDNA from an EST cDNA library of dendritic cells and functionally characterized this new protein. Results presented here indicate that IRF-5 can synergize with the virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes and induce expression of these genes in the absence of IRF-7. Furthermore, IRF-5 is the first member of the IRF family that shows differential response to virus, since activation of IRF-5 by phosphorylation and induction of IFNA genes was only detected in NDV-infected and not in Sendai virus-infected cells. The expression profile of IFNA genes in 2fTGH NDV-infected cells expressing IRF-5 or IRF-7 showed distinct differences; in IRF-7-expressing cells, virus preferentially induced IFNA1, but IRF-5-overexpressing cells induced mainly IFNA8. MDBK, HeLa, and Daudi cells were obtained from ATCC, and 2fTGH cells, obtained from G. Stark (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sendai virus was purchased from Specific Pathogen Free Avian Supply (Preston, CT), and NDV was purchased from ATCC (VR-699). Infections were conducted with 640 hemagglutinin units/100-mm plate (80% confluency) for a given time period. 2fTGH cells constitutively expressing IRF-5 (2fTGH/IRF-5) were generated by co-transfection of 2fTGH cells with N-terminal FLAG-tagged IRF-5-expressing plasmid in which IRF-5 cDNA was under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-Tag2B.IRF-5) and pSV2neo (ratio 10:1, respectively), and transfected cells were selected by growth in G418. Single clones were screened for the expression of IRF-5 by Western blot hybridization with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Full-length IRF-5 cDNA containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was identified in an expressed sequence tag cDNA data base from dendritic cells. In addition, full-length IRF-5 was obtained from Daudi cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the following primers: sense, 5′-GCCTTGTTATTGCATGCCAGC; antisense, 5′-TCTGCCATGAACCAGTCCATC. IRF-5 cDNA with the entire open reading frame was cloned into pSVsport and pCMVsport (Life Technologies Inc.) at the SalI–NotI site.

In the transient transfection assay, 2 × 106 2fTGH cells were transfected with a constant amount of DNA (5 μg/60-mm plate, 8 μg/100-mm) by using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). For the CAT and SAP assays, equal amounts (2.5 μg) of reporter plasmid and IRF-expressing plasmid were transfected with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (50–100 ng). The transfected cells were divided 14 h later and infected with Sendai virus or NDV for 16 h. The CAT assay and the SAP assay were performed as previously described (35Dent C.L. Macbride S.J.

The β-galactosidase expression levels were used to normalize the difference in transfection efficiency for both CAT and SAP assays. Double-stranded oligomers corresponding to the IFNA1 and IFNA14 VRE region (base pairs −110 to −53) were synthesized and biotin-labeled at the 5′-end of the antisense strand. Two micrograms of the double-stranded oligomers were incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (200 μl) (Dynal Inc.) for 1 h in TEN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mNaCl), and the unbound DNA was removed by extensive washing with the same buffer. IRFs from the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were bound to DNA on magnetic beads as described previously (28Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Beads were then washed, and the bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. IRFs were identified by Western blot with the respective antibodies as described (9Yeow W.S.

Fourteen hours after transfection, infected cells were divided and seeded in chambered coverglass slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Four hours after infection, cells were examined under fluorescence microscope at a wavelength of 507 nm. All pictures presented were recorded under the same magnification (× 20) and exposure time. The 2fTGH and 2fTGH/IRF-5 cells (3 × 106) were grown for 2 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then left uninfected or were infected with Sendai virus or NDV and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml of32Pi (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2, 4, and 6 h. Samples were collected in lysis buffer (10 mmNonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, protease inhibitor mixture) and left on ice for 30 min. The whole cell extracts (250 μg) were used for immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG antibody, and precipitated proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One microgram of total RNA isolated by the cesium-chloride method was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers in a 30-μl reaction. From this mixture of cDNAs, IFNA, IRF-7, IFNB, and β-actin cDNA were amplified by PCR as previously described (9Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

IRF-5 was amplified with the following primers: sense, 5′-GCCTTGTTATTGCATGCCAGC; antisense, 5′-AGACCAAGCTTTTCAGCCTGG. Individual IFNA subtypes were identified by cloning and subsequent sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragments as described recently (9Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R.

A one-way analysis of variance (from the VassarStats Web site) was used to analyze the significance of observed differences in IFNA subtype expression. Levels of biologically active IFN α in the medium were determined by the antiviral assay (5Ho M. Interferon and Interferon Inducers. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 29-44Google Scholar). 2fTGH and 2fTGH/IRF-5 (2 × 106) cells were transfected with 1 μg of IFNA1SAP or IFNA14SAP. At 16 h post-transfection, cells were infected with Sendai virus or NDV for 6 h, and the proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked by the addition of 11% formaldehyde (0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 1% for 30 min at 37 °C (20Wathelett M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 1: 1359-1368Google Scholar, 37Yu J. Angelin-Duclos C. Greenwood J. Liao J. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125 mglycine. The cell pellets were washed with 5 ml of wash buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) on ice, and lysed by sonication for 10 s. Samples were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl) and cleared with protein A-Sepharose. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of IRF-3 polyclonal or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed and treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml), 0.5% SDS, and proteinase K (500 μg/ml). The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were reverted by heating at 65 °C for 6 h, and the DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA purified by precipitation with 2 m ammonium acetate/ethanol was used as a template for PCR amplification with IFNA-SAP-specific primers (sense, 5′-AAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGT; antisense, 5′-ACAGTGGCGAGGCAGGAATTGATCT) that could amplify both the IFNA1 and IFNA14 VRE. The sequence of IRF-5 cDNA has been deposited in the human NCBI GenBankTM (U51127), but neither the gene nor the protein has been characterized. In order to determine the function of this protein and its possible role in the induction of early inflammatory genes, specifically type I interferon genes, we screened the Human Genome Sciences expressed sequence tag cDNA libraries for homology to IRF-5. The IRF-5 cDNA was identified in a dendritic cell library. By comparing the IRF-5 cDNA sequence obtained from the dendritic cell library with the sequence of human IRF-5 cDNA deposited in GenBankTM, we found that the dendritic IRF-5 cDNA had an internal deletion of 48 nucleotides (positions 583–631). To determine whether the deletion was unique to this cDNA, we also isolated IRF-5 cDNA from B cells (Daudi) and found that the isolated IRF-5 cDNAs contained the identical deletion and encoded a predicted protein of 488 amino acids. Similar to other IRF family members, IRF-5 contains five conserved tryptophan residues in the amino terminus. Examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of IRF-5 revealed several interesting features. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of about 60 kDa that contains two putative nuclear localization signals, one in the N-terminal domain and one in the C-terminal domain. These two nuclear localization signals, unique to IRF-5 and IRF-6, are not present in the other IRFs. In addition, 3′ of the DNA-binding domain, IRF-5 contains a string of eight glutamic acid residues of yet unknown function. The full-length IRF-5 sequence shows close homology to IRF-6 (78%), IRF-7 (59%), IRF-4, IRF-8, and IRF-9 (58%). Analysis of a data base of sequence-tagged sites revealed two independent tags, SHGC-63648 and sWSS3578 (38Touchman J.W. Bouffard G.G. Weintraub L.A. Idol J.R. Wang L. Robbins C.M. Nussbaum J.C. Lovett M. Green E.D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that are overlapped by the IRF-5 coding region. Both tags map between chromosomal markers D7S504 and D7S530, a region corresponding cytogenetically to 7q32. No other IRF family members have been mapped to this genomic region, which is reported to contain a cluster of imprinted genes (39Hayashida S. Yamasaki K. Asada Y. Soeda E. Niikawa N. Kishino T. Genomics. 2000; 66: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whether IRF-5 is imprinted or is associated with any disorders associated with 7q32 remains to be established. To determine in which cells IRF-5 is expressed, we examined the tissue distribution of IRF-5 mRNA and found that constitutive expression was primarily detected in lymphoid tissue and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Low levels were also detected in skeletal muscle and prostate; but no expression of IRF-5 was detected in thymus. In all of the tissues that expressed IRF-5, two transcripts of size 2.4 and 3.4 kilobases were detected (Fig.1 A). By Northern blot, a single IRF-5 transcript was detected in SW480 colorectal cancer, A549 lung carcinoma, and G361 melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1 B). When RT-PCR was used for the detection of IRF-5 transcripts, most cell lines examined revealed low levels of IRF-5 expression that were enhanced by viral infection and IFNα treatment. 2B. J. Barnes and P. M. Pitha, unpublished data. In order to determine the transcription potential of IRF-5, plasmid expressing GAL4/IRF-5 was cotransfected together with GAL4CAT reporter plasmid into 2fTGH cells. As a positive control, GAL4/IRF-1 was co-transfected or GAL4/IRF-2 was used as a negative control, with reporter plasmids. As shown in Fig.2 A, the transactivation potential of IRF-5 was similar to that of IRF-1 in this assay, while the increase by GAL4/IRF-2 was small (3-fold increase). The role of IRF family members in the activation of type I IFN genes has been clearly established. We therefore examined the ability of IRF-5 to transactivate the ISRE-containing promoter as well as type I IFN promoters in a transient expression assay. As shown in Fig.2 B, overexpression of IRF-5 activated (4–5-fold enhancement) the promoter containing four copies of ISRE in infected cells, and the activation was slightly higher in cells infected with NDV than with Sendai virus. This promoter was also activated efficiently by IRF-3 and to a lesser degree by IRF-1 and IRF-7, but activation by these IRFs was slightly more effective in cells infected with Sendai virus than with NDV. Overexpression of IRF-5 also activated a reporter plasmid containing SAP under the regulation of IFNA1 VRE or IFNB VRE (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). Interestingly, significant activation of the IFNA1 promoter (2–3-fold enhancement) by IRF-5 was only observed in NDV infected cells while activation in Sendai virus-infected cells was negligible (less than 2-fold). This difference was not due to the inability of Sendai virus to induce this promoter because, in cells transfected with IRF-1, IRF-3, or IRF-7, activity of the IFNA1 promoter was stimulated both by Sendai virus and NDV. Thus, the higher inducing ability of NDV compared with Sendai virus was seen only in cells transfected with IRF-5. The IFNB VRE was stimulated by IRF-5 to about the same level as by IRF-1 in infected cells (2–3-fold enhancement), while both IRF-3 and IRF-7 were more effective stimulators (5–6-fold enhancement). Although the IFNB promoter was stimulated by IRF-5 more effectively in NDV- than Sendai virus-infected cells, this difference was too small to be significant (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results concur with the previous observation that in a transient transfection assay both NDV and Sendai virus infection synergize with IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the activation of IFNA1 and IFNB promoters. However, the activation of the IFNA1 promoter by IRF-5 seems to be more efficient in cells infected with NDV than with Sendai virus. We have previously shown that IRF-3 stimulates transcription of only the IFNA1 promoter in infected cells, whereas IRF-7 also enhances expression of IFNA2, A4, and A14 VRE (9Yeow W.S. Au W.C.

To determine whether the IRF-5-mediated enhancement is also limited to specific IFNA promoters, we cotransfected the IRF-5 expression plasmid with IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA4"

There are 12 ZIP-encoding genes in humans, and we hypothesize that many of these proteins are zinc transporters. In this study, we addressed the role of one human ZIP gene, hZIP1, in zinc transport. First, we examined 65Zn uptake activity in K562 erythroleukemia cells overexpressing hZIP1. These cells accumulated more zinc than control cells because of increased zinc influx. Moreover, consistent with its role in zinc uptake, hZIP1 protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Our results also demonstrated that hZIP1 is responsible for the endogenous zinc uptake activity in K562 cells. hZIP1 is expressed in untransfected K562 cells, and the increase in mRNA levels found inhZIP1-overexpressing cells correlated with the increased zinc uptake activity. Furthermore, hZIP1-dependent 65Zn uptake was biochemically indistinguishable from the endogenous activity. Finally, inhibition of endogenous hZIP1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides caused a marked decrease in endogenous65Zn uptake activity. The observation that hZIP1 is the major zinc transporter in K562 cells, coupled with its expression in many normal cell types, indicates that hZIP1 plays an important role in zinc uptake in human tissues.

Despite its importance, we knew little until recently about how eukaryotic cells take up zinc from their environment. The molecular insight into zinc uptake came from the identification of zinc transporters in fungi and plants. In yeast, the Zrt1 and Zrt2 proteins are zinc transporters involved in moving zinc from the extracellular medium across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm (1Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In plants, the Arabidopsis IRT1 protein transports iron from the soil into the root and is also capable of zinc, manganese, and cadmium transport (3Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 4Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol.

A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Zrt1, Zrt2, and IRT1 are the founding members of a superfamily of transporters referred to as the ZIP family (for Zrt/IRT-likeproteins) (6Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Other ZIP transporters have also been implicated in zinc uptake, including the Arabidopsisproteins ZIP1, ZIP2, ZIP3, and ZIP4 (7Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The Znt1 protein ofThlaspi caerulescens has been shown to be involved in zinc uptake as well (8Pence N.S. Larsen P.B. Ebbs S.D. Letham D.L. Lasat M.M. Garvin D.F. Eide D. Kochian L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thus, many ZIP proteins are involved in zinc uptake. A notable exception is Zrt3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a ZIP protein that transports stored zinc from the lumen of the vacuole into the cytoplasm (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, ZIP proteins can act in zinc uptake or intracellular zinc transport.Members of the ZIP family are found at all phylogenetic levels, including archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. There are currently ∼85 members reported in the sequence data bases, and these fall into four subfamilies based on their amino acid similarities (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. et al.Biometals. 2001; 30 (in press)Google Scholar). Most members are predicted to have eight transmembrane domains and share a predicted topology where the amino and carboxyl termini are extracytoplasmic. The greatest degree of conservation is found in transmembrane domains IV–VIII. Transmembrane domains IV and V are particularly amphipathic and contain conserved and functionally critical histidine residues flanked by equally important polar or charged amino acids (5Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These residues are thought to line an aqueous cavity in the transporter through which the substrate moves (11Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Notably, ZIP proteins do not contain ATP-binding sites or ATPase domains. Therefore, these proteins must function through either secondary active transport or facilitated diffusion.There are 12 known ZIP members in the human genome, and five members have been found in the mouse (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. et al.Biometals. 2001; 30 (in press)Google Scholar). Three of the human proteins, hZIP1,1 hZIP2, and hZIP3, are very closely related to the fungal and plant proteins known to be zinc uptake transporters. The recent studies of fungal and plant ZIP transporters indicated that the ZIP superfamily plays remarkably conserved roles in metal ion transport and especially zinc uptake. These observations suggested that the mammalian ZIP proteins play similar roles. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the hZIP2 protein in human K562 erythroleukemia cells and showed that hZIP2 localizes to the plasma membrane (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Moreover, hZIP2 expression resulted in a novel zinc uptake activity not found in these cells. Thus, hZIP2 is a metal ion transporter capable of zinc uptake. In this report, we continue our characterization of mammalian ZIP transporters by functional expression of the hZIP1 protein. Our results demonstrate that hZIP1, like hZIP2, is a zinc transporter. We also found that hZIP1 is the endogenous zinc uptake transporter normally found in K562 cells. Given the ubiquitous expression of hZIP1 in human tissues, we propose that hZIP1 is the major zinc transporter for many human cell types.DISCUSSIONIn a recent report, we used functional expression in K562 cells to characterize the biochemical properties of the hZIP2 zinc transporter (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the course of that study, we concluded that hZIP2 is not responsible for the endogenous zinc uptake activity in K562 cells. This conclusion was based on (a) the lack of detectablehZIP2 mRNA in K562 cells and (b) the clear differences in the biochemical properties of the hZIP2 and endogenous zinc transport systems. For example, HCO3− stimulated hZIP2 zinc uptake, but had no such effect on the endogenous system. In this study, we used a similar functional expression approach to demonstrate that, like hZIP2, hZIP1 encodes a zinc transporter. Consistent with our hypothesis, overexpression of hZIP1 in K562 cells led to an increase in zinc uptake activity, and the hZIP1 protein localized exclusively to the plasma membrane.Perhaps of even greater significance is our demonstration that hZIP1 is the endogenous zinc transporter in K562 cells. This conclusion is based on several independent observations. First, we found thathZIP1 is normally expressed in these cells, and a 2-fold increase in mRNA level generated by expression from the CMV promoter correlated closely with a 2-fold increase in zinc uptake activity. Second, the endogenous uptake system and hZIP1 were indistinguishable in a number of different tests. For example, these systems have similar apparent Km values and are sensitive to inhibition by an array of metal ions to almost precisely the same degree. Finally, we found that inhibition of endogenoushZIP1 expression in K562 cells with antisense oligonucleotides also inhibited zinc uptake activity. Although antisense oligonucleotides have been reported to give artifactual results (16Branch A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 45-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), our control experiments indicate that the decrease in expression is not due to toxicity or a general decrease in mRNA levels and requires hZIP1-specific sequences to be effective. It is interesting to note that the mixedhZIP1 antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced uptake activity to 10% of normal levels. These data argue that other zinc transporters, if present in K562 cells, play minor roles in zinc uptake.As an alternative test of the ability of hZIP1 to transport zinc, we expressed the protein in a yeast zrt1 zrt2 mutant that is defective for zinc uptake. Although this approach was successful for the characterization of many plant ZIP proteins (4Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 7Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), hZIP1 expression in yeast failed to complement the zrt1 zrt2mutant, and there was no detectable increase in zinc uptake activity (data not shown). A similar lack of effect was observed when hZIP2 was expressed in yeast (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mammalian members of the family are not functional in the yeast cellular environment. Unlike hZIP2, however, hZIP1-expressing yeast cells did show a zinc-dependent phenotype; those cells were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of high zinc, suggesting that the protein was produced, but perhaps improperly localized in the cell. Although we have not examined this effect of hZIP1 expression in yeast further, the zinc dependence of the phenotype provides additional support to the hypothesis that hZIP1 is a zinc transporter.The similarity of hZIP1 and hZIP2 to IRT1, an Fe2+transporter in Arabidopsis, suggests that the human proteins may also serve as iron transporters. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that iron can inhibit zinc uptake by these proteins. However, we have assayed Fe2+ uptake in cells overexpressing either hZIP1 or hZIP2 and found no effect. 2L. A. Gaither, unpublished observation. These results indicate that the human zinc transporters are not also involved in iron uptake.The mechanism of transport used by ZIP proteins is still unresolved. This is largely because varied results have been obtained when the properties of different transporters have been analyzed. In yeast, for example, both Zrt1 and Zrt2 are dependent on energy for zinc transport (1Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither hZIP1 nor hZIP2 (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) requires ATP for activity. This conclusion is based on the observation that metabolic inhibitors that reduce ATP levels to below 10% of normal levels (data not shown) had no effect on uptake activity of either of these proteins. We determined that zinc uptake by hZIP2 is stimulated by increased HCO3−levels, suggesting that zinc uptake occurs via a Zn2+/HCO3− symport mechanism (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, hZIP1 activity was not affected by HCO3− levels in our experiments here, suggesting that this protein may use a different transport mechanism. Alternatively, sufficient levels of HCO3− may already be present in our standard assay conditions, through equilibration with atmospheric CO2, to saturate the hZIP1 transporter. Thus, it remains unresolved if hZIP1 and hZIP2 use the same or different transport mechanisms.An important unanswered question is what role these proteins play in zinc transport in vivo. hZIP2 expression has been detected only in prostate (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and uterine (20Yamaguchi S. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1995; 62: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) epithelial cells, suggesting that this protein plays a very specialized tissue-specific function. In marked contrast, hZIP1 is expressed in all 24 human tissues we examined. This observation, coupled with our results from K562 cells, suggests that hZIP1 may be the major endogenous zinc uptake transporter in many cells in the body. This conclusion is supported by Costelloet al. (17Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), who previously provided evidence that hZIP1 is responsible for zinc uptake in prostate cells; treatment of those cells with prolactin and testosterone causes an increase in bothhZIP1 mRNA levels and zinc uptake activity. Finally, Lioumi et al. (19Lioumi M. Ferguson C.A. Sharpe P.T. Freeman T. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Heizmann C. Ragoussis J. Genomics. 1999; 62: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) observed expression of hZIP1mRNA in intestinal enterocytes. This location of expression suggests that hZIP1 may be involved in the uptake of dietary zinc from the intestine. It should be noted that hZIP1 was designatedZIRTL (for Zrt/IRTtransporter-like) by these authors. In an earlier report, Costello et al. (17Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) named this genehZIP1, and we have retained that nomenclature here.One paradox that arose from our studies of hZIP1 and hZIP2 is that these transporters have a surprisingly low affinity for their substrate. Both transporters have a Km value of ∼3 μm for free Zn2+ ions. SimilarKm values have been reported for zinc transporters in a large number of mammalian cell types (21Reyes J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C401-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The paradox arises when we consider the free Zn2+ concentration in mammalian serum. Although the total zinc concentration of serum is ∼20 μm, very little metal is present in an unbound form (18Magneson G.R. Puvathingal J.M. Ray W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In serum, ∼75% Zn2+ is bound to albumin, and 20% is bound to α2-macroglobulin. Much of the remaining zinc is complexed with amino acids such as histidine and cysteine. Because of the high chelation capacity of serum, the free Zn2+concentration in serum is calculated to be in the low nanomolar range. Given this extremely low concentration of substrate, it was initially unclear how these transporters could contribute to zinc accumulation by mammalian cells under physiological conditions. The solution to this paradox comes from considering the capacity of these transporters relative to the zinc requirements of the cell. Steady-state cell accumulation of zinc is ∼100 pmol/106 cells (Fig.1 D), which is equivalent to 1 × 108 atoms of zinc/cell. This value is similar to those obtained by others (22Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). With a doubling time of 24 h, the uptake rate required to maintain this level of zinc in growing cells is ∼0.1 pmol/min/106cells, i.e. a value almost identical to the uptake rate observed using complete medium as the assay buffer (Fig. 1 E) and far lower than the rate (11 pmol/min/106 cells) measured in buffer (Fig. 1 C). Thus, our studies demonstrated that the capacity (i.e. Vmax) for zinc uptake is so high relative to the cellular demand for zinc that sufficient levels can be obtained despite the chelation capacity of serum and the apparent low affinity of the transporters.With the characterization of hZIP1 and hZIP2, our understanding of zinc homeostasis in mammalian cells is greatly improving. A second family of zinc transporters has also been identified in mammals. This family is called the CDF (for cation diffusionfacilitator) family, and like the ZIP proteins, members of this group have been implicated in zinc transport in organisms of all phylogenetic levels (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. et al.Biometals. 2001; 30 (in press)Google Scholar, 23Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). One mammalian CDF protein, ZnT-1, is a zinc efflux protein that transports zinc out of the cell (22Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). ZnT-1 may play a role in removing excess zinc from cells and may also serve to transport zinc across the basolateral membrane of the intestinal enterocyte during zinc absorption (24McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4841-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 25McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A second member of the CDF family, ZnT-2, compartmentalizes intracellular zinc in the late endosome of the cell (26Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Kobayashi T. Beuchat M. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This zinc sequestration reduces the toxicity of intracellular zinc. Cellular zinc status is likely to be controlled by regulation of many of these transporters. Expression of both ZnT-1 and ZnT-2 has been shown to be induced in zinc-treated cells (28Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or in animals fed zinc-rich diets (24McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4841-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Liuzzi J.P. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The zinc-responsive transcription factor MTF-1 was found to regulate ZnT-1 (28Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that MTF-1 also regulates ZnT-2 expression. Thus, zinc treatment increases the cell's capacity to both export and sequester excess zinc. It is not yet clear if the uptake transporters are also regulated in response to zinc status. Many ZIP genes in yeast and plants are expressed at higher levels under zinc-limiting conditions (1Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 7Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In yeast, this up-regulation was shown to occur at a transcriptional level and is mediated by the zinc-responsive Zap1 transcription factor (30Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It is therefore intriguing thathZIP1 mRNA levels decrease in prostate-derived PC-3 cells treated with higher than normal levels of zinc (17Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We are currently examining the regulation of hZIP1 andhZIP2 in response to zinc availability to determine if such a mechanism contributes to mammalian zinc homeostasis. Furthermore, the potential roles of the other human ZIP genes remain to be addressed. Zinc is an essential nutrient to all organisms because it is a required catalytic and/or structural cofactor for hundreds of zinc-dependent enzymes and other proteins such as transcription factors. Despite its importance, we knew little until recently about how eukaryotic cells take up zinc from their environment. The molecular insight into zinc uptake came from the identification of zinc transporters in fungi and plants. In yeast, the Zrt1 and Zrt2 proteins are zinc transporters involved in moving zinc from the extracellular medium across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm (1Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In plants, the Arabidopsis IRT1 protein transports iron from the soil into the root and is also capable of zinc, manganese, and cadmium transport (3Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 4Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 5Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Zrt1, Zrt2, and IRT1 are the founding members of a superfamily of transporters referred to as the ZIP family (for Zrt/IRT-likeproteins) (6Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Other ZIP transporters have also been implicated in zinc uptake, including the Arabidopsisproteins ZIP1, ZIP2, ZIP3, and ZIP4 (7Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The Znt1 protein ofThlaspi caerulescens has been shown to be involved in zinc uptake as well (8Pence N.S. Larsen P.B. Ebbs S.D. Letham D.L. Lasat M.M. Garvin D.F. Eide D. Kochian L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thus, many ZIP proteins are involved in zinc uptake. A notable exception is Zrt3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a ZIP protein that transports stored zinc from the lumen of the vacuole into the cytoplasm (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, ZIP proteins can act in zinc uptake or intracellular zinc transport. Members of the ZIP family are found at all phylogenetic levels, including archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. There are currently ∼85 members reported in the sequence data bases, and these fall into four subfamilies based on their amino acid similarities (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. et al.Biometals. 2001; 30 (in press)Google Scholar). Most members are predicted to have eight transmembrane domains and share a predicted topology where the amino and carboxyl termini are extracytoplasmic. The greatest degree of conservation is found in transmembrane domains IV–VIII. Transmembrane domains IV and V are particularly amphipathic and contain conserved and functionally critical histidine residues flanked by equally important polar or charged amino acids (5Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These residues are thought to line an aqueous cavity in the transporter through which the substrate moves (11Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Notably, ZIP proteins do not contain ATP-binding sites or ATPase domains. Therefore, these proteins must function through either secondary active transport or facilitated diffusion. There are 12 known ZIP members in the human genome, and five members have been found in the mouse (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. et al.Biometals. 2001; 30 (in press)Google Scholar). Three of the human proteins, hZIP1,1 hZIP2, and hZIP3, are very closely related to the fungal and plant proteins known to be zinc uptake transporters. The recent studies of fungal and plant ZIP transporters indicated that the ZIP superfamily plays remarkably conserved roles in metal ion transport and especially zinc uptake. These observations suggested that the mammalian ZIP proteins play similar roles. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the hZIP2 protein in human K562 erythroleukemia cells and showed that hZIP2 localizes to the plasma membrane (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Moreover, hZIP2 expression resulted in a novel zinc uptake activity not found in these cells. Thus, hZIP2 is a metal ion transporter capable of zinc uptake. In this report, we continue our characterization of mammalian ZIP transporters by functional expression of the hZIP1 protein. Our results demonstrate that hZIP1, like hZIP2, is a zinc transporter. We also found that hZIP1 is the endogenous zinc uptake transporter normally found in K562 cells. Given the ubiquitous expression of hZIP1 in human tissues, we propose that hZIP1 is the major zinc transporter for many human cell types. DISCUSSIONIn a recent report, we used functional expression in K562 cells to characterize the biochemical properties of the hZIP2 zinc transporter (12Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the course of that study, we concluded that hZIP2 is not responsible for the endogenous zinc uptake activity in K562 cells. This conclusion was based on (a) the lack of detectablehZIP2 mRNA in K562 cells and (b) the clear differences in the biochemical properties of the hZIP2 and endogenous zinc transport systems. For example, HCO3− stimulated hZIP2 zinc uptake, but had no such effect on the endogenous system. In this study, we used a similar functional expression approach to demonstrate that, like hZIP2, hZIP1 encodes a zinc transporter. Consistent with our hypothesis, overexpression of hZIP1 in K562 cells led to an increase in zinc uptake activity, and the hZIP1 protein localized exclusively to the plasma membrane.Perhaps of even greater significance is our demonstration that hZIP1 is the endogenous zinc transporter in K562 cells. This conclusion is based on several independent observations. First, we found thathZIP1 is normally expressed in these cells, and a 2-fold increase in mRNA level generated by expression from the CMV promoter correlated closely with a 2-fold increase in zinc uptake activity. Second, the endogenous uptake system and hZIP1 were indistinguishable in a number of different tests. For example, these systems have similar apparent Km values and are sensitive to inhibition by an array of metal ions to almost precisely the same degree. Finally, we found that inhibition of endogenoushZIP1 expression in K562 cells with antisense oligonucleotides also inhibited zinc uptake activity. Although antisense oligonucleotides have been reported to give artifactual results (16Branch A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 45-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), our control experiments indicate that the decrease in expression is not due to toxicity or a general decrease in mRNA levels and requires hZIP1-specific sequences to be effective. It is interesting to note that the mixedhZIP1 antisense oligonucleotide treatment re"

However, despite the fact that eye movements are critical during normal vision, the influence of eye movements on the structure of receptive fields has never been characterized. Here, we map the receptive fields of macaque area V4 neurons during saccadic eye movements and find that receptive fields are remarkably dynamic. Specifically, before the initiation of a saccadic eye movement, receptive fields shrink and shift towards the saccade target. These spatiotemporal dynamics may enhance information processing of relevant stimuli during the scanning of a visual scene, thereby assisting the selection of saccade targets and accelerating the analysis of the visual scene during free viewing."
https://openalex.org/W2010297085,"The determination of the structure of transient molecules, such as photoexcited states, in disordered media (such as in solution) usually requires methods with high temporal resolution. The transient molecular structure of a reaction intermediate produced by photoexcitation of NiTPP-L2 (NiTPP, nickeltetraphenylporphyrin; L, piperidine) in solution was determined by x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) data obtained on a 14-nanosecond time scale from a third-generation synchrotron source. The XAFS measurements confirm that photoexcitation leads to the rapid removal of both axial ligands to produce a transient square-planar intermediate, NiTPP, with a lifetime of 28 nanoseconds. The transient structure of the photodissociated intermediate is nearly identical to that of the ground state NiTPP, suggesting that the intermediate adopts the same structure as the ground state in a noncoordinating solvent before it recombines with two ligands to form the more stable octahedrally coordinated NiTPP-L2."

Lipid Res. 1973; 11: 1-65Crossref Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms mediating the uptake of HDL by hepatocytes and other cells are poorly understood. Although a number of HDL binding proteins have been identified, none so far has been shown to mediate the uptake or degradation of HDL protein (4Fidge N.H. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol enters the hepatocyte from the basolateral membrane in either LDL, remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, or HDL. HDL, and not LDL, appears to be the major donor of free cholesterol for bile acid production (5Schwartz C.C. Berman M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Halloran L.G. Gregory D.H. Swell L. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 408-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6Portman O.W. Alexander M. O'Malley J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

HDL cholesterol must somehow traverse the hepatocyte from the basolateral membrane (sinusoidal membrane) to reach the apical membrane (bile canalicular membrane) followed by secretion into bile. Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI) is an authentic HDL receptor that is highly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues and mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol, i.e. the uptake of HDL free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester without the concomitant uptake or degradation of HDL protein (8Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Based on studies in non-polarized cells, it is widely believed that SR-BI is a non-endocytic receptor that functions at the plasma membrane, perhaps forming a hydrophobic channel to facilitate entry of cholesteryl ester into the membrane (9Rodrigueza W.V.

Intriguingly, SR-BI has been localized to the bile canaliculus (the apical membrane) in mice and rats (12Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Because hepatocytes primarily use transcytosis to localize membrane proteins to the apical surface (14Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Schell M.J. Maurice M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that SR-BI is endocytosed from the basolateral membrane and traffics to the apical membrane. SR-BI appears to mediate rapid transport of HDL free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester into bile (17Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E. Huszar D. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33398-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), suggesting that SR-BI plays an important role in HDL cholesterol transport across the cell. Recently, we have shown that HDL particles are internalized bynon-polarized hepatocytes and traffic to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC, a transferrin-positive compartment) and that the majority of HDL particles that undergo endocytosis are resecreted in an intact form (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in a process previously termed retroendocytosis (19Kambouris A.M. Roach P.D. Calvert G.D. Nestel P.J.

The goals of the present study were to elucidate the route of HDL protein and cholesterol trafficking in polarized hepatocytes and to evaluate the role of SR-BI in HDL particle uptake and trafficking. Hepatocytes were isolated from 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

Hepatocyte couplets were isolated by following the above protocol except that the time of digestion of the liver was reduced from 18 to 12 min. The identity of the bile canalicular vacuole was verified by staining with filipin as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

Human apoE-free HDL and LDL was isolated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation and radiolabeled with protein and lipid tracers as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

A titration experiment was performed to determine the optimal antibody concentration to inhibit SR-BI activity using CHO cells expressing SR-BI showed that a 1:1000 dilution of immune serum was sufficient to completely reduce HDL association to levels measured in CHO control cells. This concentration equaled ∼10–20 μg/ml protein A-purified IgG. Preimmune serum was without effect at 1:1000. All cells types (freshly isolated hepatocytes, CHO, and MDCK cells) were treated as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -precipitable counts were determined as a measurement of degradation and secretion, respectively. Pulse-chase assays were also performed in the presence of protein A-purified neutralizing anti-SR-BI antibody or protein A-purified preimmune IgG (from the same rabbit used to produce the immune serum) by preincubation of cells at 4 °C for 1 h with 20 μg/ml antibodies followed by the pulse-chase assay as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The values reported for the three components in all pulse-chase studies (i.e. association, resecretion, and degradation) are considered specific, because they were calculated by subtracting nonspecific background levels as measured in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled HDL from total. Selective uptake was measured as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase assays using MDCK cells, 150 μg of HDL/ml was used as the lipid acceptor in the apical chamber of Transwells (Costar). Primary hepatocytes and CHO cells were infected with either an adenovirus harboring the DynK44Agene or a control adenovirus expressing green fluorescence protein (kind gifts of J. E. Pessin) according to a previous study (22Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25450-25457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with either 125I-labeled HDL or LDL having specific activities of ∼500 and 2300 cpm/ng, respectively. Hepatocytes were incubated for 1 h with Alexa 568-labeled human holotransferrin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Immunodetection was then performed using an anti-SR-BI antibody recognizing the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI (Novus Biologicals). Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. 10 mg of doubly labeled HDL (DiI and Alexa 488) was incubated for 1 h with primary hepatocyte couplets at 37 °C, and examined by confocal microscopy as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A separate sample of HDL was double-labeled with the fluorescence cholesterol ester analog BODIPY-CE (Molecular Probes) as previously described (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The protein component of BODIPY-CE-labeled HDL was then labeled with Alexa 568. This double-labeled HDL was incubated with primary hepatocyte couplets as described above and examined using a confocal microscopy. Stable cells expressing murine SR-BI in pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or empty vector as control were made using Transfectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). A pool of more than 300 individual clones were used for experiments. Polarization was carried out by growing cells for 5 days in 12-mm Transwell cell culture inserts (Corning). MDCK cell monolayer integrity was verified by determining the basal-to-apical diffusion of [3H]inulin (1 μCi/ml). Cells used for all experiments had <0.1% diffusion. Measurements of endocytosis of SR-BI in all cells types (freshly isolated hepatocytes, CHO) using a reducible biotin cross-linker was performed according to the original method by Bretscher et al. (23Bretscher M.S. Lutter R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4087-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with modifications by McGwire et al. (24McGwire G.B. Becker R.P. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31632-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All cell types used (freshly isolated hepatocytes and CHO) were first lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. SR-BI was immunoprecipitated overnight using the anti-SR-BI antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI. We previously demonstrated that HDL particles are actively taken up by primary hepatocytes and rapidly resecreted or degraded (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The resecreted HDL was selectively depleted of free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester. To explore the possibility that SR-BI mediates HDL particle uptake and recycling, we used an antibody to the extracellular domain of SR-BI that neutralizes SR-BI selective uptake activity in vitro. Western blot analysis using the neutralizing SR-BI antibody in both primary hepatocytes and SR-BI-transfected CHO cells (25Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) yields a single band at the expected molecular mass of SR-BI (∼82 kDa) (Fig.1D). LowerM r bands seen in hepatocytes were also detected in pre-immune sera (Fig. 1D, PI), indicating specific recognition of SR-BI by immune sera (IM). Small amounts of this antibody were shown to markedly inhibit selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) by SR-BI-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1A). Although not previously appreciated (26Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), we also found extensive uptake and recycling of HDL in CHO cells stably expressing SR-BI (Fig. 1A); the resecreted HDL was largely depleted in CE tracer (by ∼75%, relative to protein), as found previously in hepatocytes (17Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E. Huszar D. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33398-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The anti-SR-BI antibody reduced HDL particle uptake, resecretion, and degradation in SR-BI-transfected CHO cells to the level found in vector control-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1A). In a further characterization of the neutralizing antibody, CHO cells expressing SR-BI were incubated with HDL labeled with both diI as a lipid marker and Alexa-488 as a protein marker and incubated with cells pretreated with either preimmune antibody or the SR-BI-neutralizing antibody. Fig.2A shows that the neutralizing SR-BI antibody (immune) blocked the uptake of both HDL lipid and protein fluorescent markers, thus confirming our findings with radiolabeled HDL. To further substantiate this finding in CHO cells and to test if HDL traffics to the ERC as in hepatocytes (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we examined HDL particle uptake using confocal microscopy in SR-BI-expressing CHO cells. Using a pulse-chase scheme, we found that HDL bound on the cell surface at 4 °C becomes internalized during a subsequent incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2B), a process that was inhibited by the SR-BI-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the majority of HDL protein and transferrin, a known recycling protein, were found to colocalize within the cells seen in internal optical confocal sections (Fig. 2C, yellow color). Similar experiments in control CHO cells showed little uptake of fluorescent HDL (Fig. 2A, vector). These findings indicate that SR-BI is an endocytic receptor that traffics in a similar route as transferrin and mediates uptake and recycling of HDL. During the process of recycling, HDL is selectively depleted of cholesteryl ester. These processes are very similar to HDL uptake and recycling in hepatocytes (17Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E. Huszar D. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33398-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To determine the role of SR-BI in HDL trafficking in hepatocytes, we next carried out similar experiments in primary hepatocytes.Figure 2HDL protein uptake and localization in CHO cells.A, CHO cells expressing SR-BI or vector control were pretreated with either the preimmune or immune IgG (i.e. SR-BI-neutralizing antibody), then incubated with DiI/Alexa 488-labeled HDL (red/green color) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by examination by confocal microscopy. B, pulse-chase of Alexa 568-labeled HDL with CHO cells expressing SR-BI. Cells were incubated with Alexa 568-labeled HDL at 4 °C for 1 h, then washed and chased at 37 °C for 30 min. C, colocalization of Alexa 568-labeled HDL (shown as red) with Alexa 488-labeled transferrin (shown as green) in internal confocal optical sections. The merged image on the far right panel shows colocalization as yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The SR-BI-neutralizing antibody substantially reduced the selective uptake of HDL CE in hepatocytes, as in transfected CHO cells (Fig.1B). The SR-BI-neutralizing antibody markedly reduced (63%,p < 0.001) the resecretion of HDL protein (Fig.2B). Thus, SR-BI plays a major role in selective uptake and resecretion of HDL taken up by hepatocytes. However, in contrast to the CHO cells, the antibody was found to only partially inhibit (18%,p < 0.05) HDL protein uptake by hepatocytes and not to significantly affect HDL protein degradation (Fig. 1B). Thus, a distinct process is responsible for the major part of the uptake of the apoE-free HDL, in a pathway that leads to protein degradation. To further characterize this pathway, and to evaluate a possible role of other lipoprotein uptake pathways, such as the LDL receptor-related protein, proteoglycans, or hepatic lipase, cells were treated with heparinase or RAP. However, these treatments did not inhibit HDL protein uptake (Fig. 1C), indicating that neither proteoglycan nor LDL receptor-related protein is involved in HDL particle uptake. Treatments with heparin, as well as heparitinase and chondroitinase treatments were also without effect on HDL protein uptake (data not shown). Because hepatocytes in vivo are polarized, we used fluorescence confocal microscopy to study HDL uptake in isolated primary hepatocyte couplets. Primary hepatocyte couplets have an intact bile canalicular membrane cordoned off by tight junctions (27Boyer J.L. Travaloni N. Berk P.D. Isolated Rat Hepatocyte Couplets. A Model for the Study of Bile Secretory Function. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion. Raven Press, New York1993: 597-606Google Scholar). In vivo, the canalicular space shared by two hepatocytes is free-flowing to the bile. However, after couplet isolation the bile canalicular space is sealed and is thus described as a bile canalicular vacuole (27Boyer J.L. Travaloni N. Berk P.D. Isolated Rat Hepatocyte Couplets. A Model for the Study of Bile Secretory Function. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion. Raven Press, New York1993: 597-606Google Scholar). HDL was fluorescently labeled both on its protein component and with either a fluorescence non-degradable cholesteryl ester analog (BODIPY-CE) or a fluorescence marker for phospholipid (DiI). These double-labeled HDL particles were incubated with primary hepatocytes couplets for 1 h at 37 °C, then examined by confocal microscopy. Based on the current model of selective uptake, HDL-derived lipid should separate from HDL protein at the plasma membrane (9Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, Fig.3, A and C, shows that both HDL protein and BODIPY-CE colocalized at the plasma membrane, in juxtanuclear regions previously identified as the ERC (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and in a region near the bile canalicular membrane, suggesting that HDL particles (protein and lipid) traverse the hepatocyte from the basolateral membrane to the apical canalicular region via the ERC. To further substantiate this idea, we also examined the fate of HDL-derived phospholipid, a major component of HDL, using the fluorescence phospholipid analog, DiI. A similar localization pattern was found for HDL labeled with DiI (Fig. 3, B andC). Again upon closer examination at increased magnification (Fig. 3B, lower panels), the HDL protein and DiI were concentrated in sub-apical compartments beneath the canalicular vacuole. Together the data indicate that intact HDL particles are moving from the basolateral plasma membrane to the bile canalicular region. The data in Fig. 1 suggest that SR-BI may mediate the trafficking of holo-HDL particles through the endosome system. If this is the case, then SR-BI should be localized to the ERC as previously shown for HDL (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated hepatocyte couplets were pulsed with fluorescently labeled transferrin, fixed,permeabilized, and used to immunolocalize SR-BI. Fig.4A shows that SR-BI is found in three locations: the basolateral plasma membrane, juxtanuclear compartments, and the bile canalicular membrane. SR-BI protein is co-localized with transferrin in juxtanuclear compartments (Fig.4A) indicating that SR-BI is found in the ERC, the same endosomal compartment that HDL enters (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transferrin is found only at low levels near the canalicular membrane (28Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Hemery I. Durand-Schneider A.M. Feldmann G. Vaerman J.P. Maurice M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1215-1227PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of SR-BI is thus consistent with its proposed role in trafficking HDL particles to the ERC and bile canalicular region. To test whether the localization to the ERC and bile canalicular membrane was the result of SR-BI endocytosis from the basolateral plasma membrane, the neutralizing SR-BI antibody was fluorescently labeled and used as a tracer in livingnon-permeabilized hepatocytes. Fig. 4B shows that the anti-SR-BI antibody is internalized and localized in a punctate fashion both to a juxtanuclear compartment and to the bile canalicular membrane. At higher magnification, the antibody appears to be localized to sub-apical compartments, and to the canalicular membrane (Fig.4B, center panel). The fluorescently labeled preimmune IgG showed little uptake in hepatocyte couplets. Taken together, the data indicate that SR-BI undergoes endocytosis and traffics to sub-apical vesicles and the canalicular region in polarized hepatocytes. The results above suggest that SR-BI is an endocytic receptor, mediating cellular uptake of HDL particles. Because SR-BI is widely considered to be a non-endocytic receptor (9Rodrigueza W.V.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to provide further direct evidence that SR-BI undergoes endocytosis. Primary hepatocytes were surface biotinylated with a reducible cross-linker, warmed to 37 °C for the times indicated in Fig.5A, then cooled to inhibit further uptake of biotinylated cell surface proteins. Biotin groups that remained on the cell surface were subsequently removed by reducing the disulfide bond of the cross-linker. Therefore, any SR-BI that is internalized remains biotinylated. Fig. 5A shows a time-dependent increase in protected, internalized SR-BI, indicating that SR-BI does undergo rapid endocytosis from the cell surface (∼3-fold accumulation after 15 min). Fig. 5B shows that SR-BI also rapidly undergoes endocytosis from the plasma membrane of CHO cells. Maximum internalization of SR-BI occurred at 30 min (62% of total biotinylated SR-BI). After 30 min, further endocytosis (+glutathione) and total biotinylated SR-BI levels (−glutathione) were seen to decrease. The latter indicates slow degradation of SR-BI in CHO cells (21% of total biotinylated SR-BI degraded after 60 min). To determine whether the uptake of HDL protein occurs via clathrin pits, primary hepatocytes and CHO-SR-BI cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing the dominant negative dynamin-1 mutant DynK44A, which inhibits the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (30van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Control cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP). Cells were then incubated with protein-labeled HDL under steady-state conditions for 1 h. Cells were also incubated for 1 h with protein-labeled LDL as a positive control for DynK44A activity. It was found that DynK44A was unable to inhibit HDL protein uptake but did inhibit LDL uptake ∼40% in both hepatocytes and CHO-SR-BI cells (Table I). This level of inhibition of LDL uptake is similar to what was reported for uptake of transferrin, another protein that is internalized through clathrin-coated pits (22Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25450-25457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,30van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested whether a dominant negative mutant of caveolin-1, CavKSF, could inhibit HDL protein uptake, because it has been shown to inhibit uptake of SV40 (31Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CavKSF did not inhibit HDL nor LDL protein uptake by CHO-SR-BI cells (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that HDL is endocytosed through a non-clathrin-coated pit pathway, not requiring caveolin-1.Table IEffect of DynK44A expression on HDL and LDL uptakeAdenovirusDynK44AGFPDynK44AGFPng HDL/mg cell proteinng LDL/mg cell proteinHepatocyte101.6 ± 10.590.0 ± 12.326.3 ± 2.11-ap < 0.001 for dynK44Aversus GFP, respectively.42.0 ± 1.9SR-BI CHO251.7 ± 16.6231 ± 2.3167.8 ± 13.81-ap < 0.001 for dynK44Aversus GFP, respectively.268.7 ± 11.01-a p < 0.001 for dynK44Aversus GFP, respectively.

Biochemical studies have not identified the primary physiological function of CRALBP. To resolve this, we generated and characterized mice with a non-functional CRALBP gene (Rlbp1−/− mice). The photosensitivity of Rlbp1−/− mice is normal but rhodopsin regeneration, 11-cis-retinal production, and dark adaptation after illumination are delayed by >10-fold. All-trans-retinyl esters accumulate during the delay indicating that isomerization of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinol is impaired. No evidence of photoreceptor degeneration was observed in animals raised in cyclic light/dark conditions for up to 1 year. Albino Rlbp−/− mice are protected from light damage relative to the wild type. These findings support a role for CRALBP as an acceptor of 11-cis-retinol in the isomerization reaction of the visual cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2164910793,"Examples of multiplication by neurons or neural circuits are scarce, although many computational models use this basic operation. The owl's auditory system computes interaural time (ITD) and level (ILD) differences to create a two-dimensional map of auditory space. Space-specific neurons are selective for combinations of ITD and ILD, which define, respectively, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of their receptive fields. A multiplication of separate postsynaptic potentials tuned to ITD and ILD, rather than an addition, can account for the subthreshold responses of these neurons to ITD-ILD pairs. Other nonlinear processes improve the spatial tuning of the spike output and reduce the fit to the multiplicative model."

It is shown that SCALLOPED, the DNA binding component of the selector protein complex for the Drosophila wing field, binds to and directly regulates the cis-regulatory elements of many individual target genes within the genetic regulatory network controlling wing development. Furthermore, combinations of binding sites for SCALLOPED and transcriptional effectors of signaling pathways are necessary and sufficient to specify wing-specific responses to different signaling pathways. The obligate integration of selector and signaling protein inputs on cis-regulatory DNA may be a general mechanism by which selector proteins control extensive genetic regulatory networks during development."

A third group of proteins, including yeast SAR1 and CIN4, is included in the ARF family although the proteins share only 25–35% sequence identity and have clearly distinct activities in cells (5Roth M.G.

Although ARFs have been purified repeatedly by laboratories using different biochemical assays, no ARL has ever been purified or cloned based on an activity. The lack of ARL activity in ARF assays has led to the conclusion that ARLs have distinct biochemical activities and thus cellular functions, despite their similarity in sequence and structure (15Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P. Kennison J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 2J. C. Amor, X. Zhu, J. Horton, X. Cheng, D. Ringe, and R. A. Kahn, manuscript in preparation. The lack of functional overlap between ARFs and ARLs is evident from the findings that ARLs in yeast cannot rescue the synthetic lethality of thearf1 − arf2 −mutations (12Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), whereas any of the six mammalian ARFs (13Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24441-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ARFs from other organisms (e.g. Drosophila (24Murtagh J.J. Lee F.J. Deak P. Hall L.M. Monaco L. Lee C.M. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6011-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), orGiardia (23Lee F.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24441-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) can suppress the lethality ofarf1 − arf2 − in yeast. Similarly, deletion of the Drosophila arl1 gene causes zygotic lethality despite the presence of the full complement of ARF genes in flies (15Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P. Kennison J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to the many activities and functions assigned to ARFs, none has yet been assigned to any ARL from any species. The number of binding partners for mammalian ARF proteins has increased dramatically in recent years in large part because of the use of two-hybrid screens that have identified seven new ARF effectors: Arfaptin1 (25Kanoh H. Williger B.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5421-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Arfaptin2/POR1 (independently isolated by two groups (25Kanoh H.

The use of carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins and dominant activated ARF mutants has enhanced the ability to select for binding partners that interact preferentially with the activated form of the GTPase (27Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Boman A.L. Zhang C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) and the δ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDEδ (34Linari M. Hanzal-Bayer M. Becker J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), have been cloned based on their GTP-dependent interaction with either ARL2 or ARL3, respectively. To date, however, no clear biological significance has been attributed to these interactions. Role(s) for ARF in Golgi functions were evident when expression of the persistently activated mutant allele [Q71L]ARF1 in cells led to expansion and vesiculation of the Golgi compartment (1Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because ARL1 was reported also to bind Golgi membranes in intact cells, we used the same procedures to test for a functional role of ARL1 at the Golgi. We were surprised by the similarities between effects of activated ARF1 and ARL1 on Golgi morphology, and this led us to reexamine the extent of functional overlap between ARF and ARL proteins. Every experiment reported herein was repeated at least twice and in most cases additional times with essentially the same results. Growth media were prepared, and maintenance of yeast strains was performed as described in Sherman et al.(35Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was performed using the method of Schiestl and Gietz (36Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Plasmids were rescued from yeast as described (37Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar) followed by further purification on Qiagen minipreparation columns. DNA was transformed into E. coli strain DH5α prior to plasmid preparation. Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD) and grown and passaged in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Yeast strains Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3, -112 URA3::GAL→lacZ) and Y187 (MATαgal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3,-112 met- URA3::GAL→lacZ), plasmids pAS2 and pACT2, and the human B cell library in pACT were the gifts of Steven J. Elledge (Baylor University). This system utilizes the GAL4 binding and activation domains and allows for two independent read-outs for a positive interaction in the two-hybrid system: histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase expression (38Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The human fetal brain cDNA library, in pACT2, was purchased fromCLONTECH. Plasmid pBG4D was a gift from Rob Brazas and allowed the expression of proteins fused through their carboxyl termini to the GAL4 binding domain. The open reading frame of each ARL was cloned in-frame into pBG4D via BamHI and NotI sites. Mutations were generated using Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All DNA generated by polymerase chain reaction was sequenced both to confirm the presence of designed mutations and prevent the introduction of others. Screening of human cDNA libraries was performed as described previously (38Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) with the modifications described in Boman et al. (27Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Boman A.L. Zhang C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dominant activating mutations in each human ARL protein were used as bait to screen human fetal brain or B cell libraries in Y190 by selection for growth on selective plates containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). Positives were then assayed for β-galactosidase activity, using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay of Breeden and Lasmyth (39Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Filters were incubated at 30 °C for up to 3 h. A strong interaction was defined as the development of a dark blue color within 15 min; a weak interaction required the full 3 h for development of a pale blue color. Further tests for specificity of interactions included: 1) counterselection for the loss of the ARL plasmid on cycloheximide plates resulted in loss of activity in the β-galactosidase assay; 2) cells carrying each potential positive were mated to unrelated partners (we used CDK2, lamin, and p53, each fused to the GAL4 activation domain) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity; and 3) rescued library plasmids yielded growth on 3-AT plates and β-galactosidase activity after transformation into the original ARL-bearing yeast strain. In most cases, positives were counterscreened against the wild type protein, to help identify those proteins that interacted preferentially with the GTP-bound form of the GTPase.

The open reading frames of SCOCO and the GRIP domain of Golgin-245 (amino acids 2025–2083) were cloned into pET20b (via NdeI and NotI restriction sites) and pET14b (via NdeI and BamHI restriction sites), respectively (Table I). The expression of (His)6-tagged protein was induced for 3 h in mid-log phase BL21(DE3) cells with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with a French pressure cell, and the recombinant protein was purified using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column charged with nickel chloride and developed with a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions that contained (His)6-tagged protein, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged into 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Human ARL2, ARL3, and ARF1 cDNA were all cloned into pET3C via NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (Table I). They were each expressed and purified as described previously (18Clark J. Moore L.

POR1 fused to the maltose-binding protein (a gift from Linda Van Aelst) was purified as described (26Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The GTPγS binding assay was performed at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 10 μm [γ-35S]GTPγS (1,000 cpm/pmol), as described previously (40Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ARL1 GAP activity was assayed by a modification of the method of Randazzo and Kahn (41Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Purified, recombinant human ARF3 and ARF GAP (42Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol.

Direct interaction between human ARL1, 2, or 3 and BART, PDEδ, or HRG4 was assayed by gel overlay, as described in Sharer and Kahn (33Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-solubilized protein lysates were prepared from BL21(DE3) cells containing either the PDEδ open reading frame in pET15b (the gift of Ahmed Zahraoui, Compartimentation et Dynamique Cellulaires, Institut Curie, Paris, France), HRG4 open reading frame in pET14b at NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, or an empty vector control (Table I). 25 μg of total protein was resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel before electrophoretic transfer to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins adsorbed on the filter were renatured in 10 mmMOPS, pH 7.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.25% Tween 20, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% BSA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and incubated with 2 μg of recombinant [Δ17]ARL1-(His)6, ARL2, or ARL3 prebound to 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. The filter was washed three times with binding buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% BSA, 50 μm GTP, 50 μm GDP, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and specific binding was determined by phosphorimage analysis. 10 μm purified recombinant [Δ17]ARL1-(His)6 was loaded with either 100 μm GDP or GTPγS for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml BSA. SCOCO was covalently attached to Affi-Gel 15 beads according to the manufacturer's directions (Bio-Rad). SCOCO beads were washed twice in binding buffer containing 10 μm appropriate nucleotide, just prior to the addition of preloaded [Δ17]ARL1-(His)6. SCOCO beads and [Δ17]ARL1-GDP or -GTPγS were incubated with gentle rocking for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with binding buffer, containing 20 μm appropriate nucleotide and then mixed with an equivalent amount of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and the presence of [Δ17]ARL1-(His)6 was detected using polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against ARL1 (R85722-3). NRK cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% saponin with 10% goat serum, as described in Zhang et al. (1Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized either on an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope or a Bio-Rad 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope coupled to a Zeiss Axioskop. For confocal microscopy, a Z-series of images was collected with 5-μm steps and processed using IMAGE J software from NIH IMAGE. Recombinant SCOCO-(His)6 was purified as described above and used as antigen in rabbits, after conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through both the NH2 terminus (using glutaraldehyde) and the COOH terminus (using carbodiimide). Antibodies were affinity purified by sequential protein G-Sepharose and affinity chromatography. 6.5 mg of untagged, recombinant SCOCO was covalently attached to 1-ml Affi-Gel 15 beads, according to the manufacturer's directions. Serum from rabbit R97679 was enriched for immunoglobulins on a 1-ml protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH, 2.7. The eluted antibodies were exchanged into 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.2, and applied to the Affi-Gel 15-SCOCO column. The column was washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl. Antibodies were eluted with 10 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.4, collecting 1-ml fractions into 100 μl of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 9, to neutralize the glycine buffer. Fractions containing protein were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged for phosphate-buffered saline. COOH-terminal, myc-epitope tagged constructs of ARL1 or [Q71L]ARL1 were subcloned into pSS2-2 for expression in mammalian cells under regulation by the interferon-inducible Mx1 promoter, as described in Zhang et al. (Table I and Ref. 1Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Each of these or the parental vector was cotransfected with pSV2-neo (ATCC), at a 10:1 ratio of DNA, into NRK cells using Fugene 6 (Invitrogen) reagent, following the manufacturer's directions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were split and diluted into medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin disulfate (G418; Sigma). G418-resistant clones were isolated and later cloned by limited dilution. Cell lines carrying stably integrated plasmids directing expression of ARL1-myc or [Q71L]ARL1-myc with no ARL1 5′-untranslated sequence were NRK-HV1–9 and NRK-HV2–20, respectively. Protein expression was induced with 1,000 units/ml α, β-rat interferon (Lee Biomolecular, San Diego) and assayed by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal 9E10 (mouse α-myc) antibodies. When lysates were probed with myc antibodies in immunoblots, we consistently observed the interferon-dependent expression of a doublet in which the upper band corresponded to the predicted size of full-length ARL1 (21 kDa) and a second band migrating as a smaller fragment (≈17 kDa). Human ARL1 is myristoylated at its NH2 terminus (43Lee F.J. Huang C.F., Yu, W.L. Buu L.M. Lin C.Y. Huang M.C. Moss J. Vaug"
https://openalex.org/W2003322831,"We report a method that uses the process of selective withdrawal of one fluid through a second immiscible fluid to coat small particles with polymer films. Fluid is withdrawn through a tube with its orifice slightly above a water-oil interface. Upon increasing the flow rate, there is a transition from a state where only oil is withdrawn to a state where the water, containing the particles to be coated and appropriate prepolymer reagents, is entrained in a thin spout along with the oil. The entrained particles eventually cause the spout interface to break, producing a thin coat of controllable thickness around each particle, which can be subsequently polymerized using chemical reagents, light, or heat. This method allows flexibility in the chemical composition and thickness of the conformal coatings."

To do so the receptors must bind to coactivators that they recruit through transcriptional activation functions, the constitutive AF-1, found in the amino-terminal receptor domain, and the hormone-activated AF-2 in the carboxyl ligand binding domain (LBD) (for review, see Ref. 1Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most important of these coactivators is the p160 family, SRC-1 (N-CoA1), GRIP1 (TIF2/N-CoA2), and ACTR (pCIP/AIB1/RAC3). These bind to the LBD only in the presence of cognate hormone, and their binding is blocked by antagonist ligands. The mechanism of binding is now understood in atomic detail and involves the docking of coactivator nuclear receptor boxes, which have the motif LXXLL with a hydrophobic cleft that forms on the surface of the hormone-bound LBD (2Feng W.

The AF-1 domain of the estrogen, androgen, and perhaps other receptors also contacts the p160s but does so through surfaces outside of the nuclear receptor boxes (7Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McKinerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The p160s are complex proteins with multiple domains (Fig. 1). In addition to the nuclear receptor boxes they have two intrinsic transcriptional activation domains AD1 and AD2, whose activities may be monitored when the coactivators are directly tethered on DNA via fusion to a heterologous DNA binding domain (8Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). AD1, which is essential for transcriptional mediation by p160s, is coextensive with the binding domain for the CBP/p300 family of coactivators. CBP/p300 complexes with the p160s and synergizes in coactivator function (10Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In particular, CBP/p300s contain a potent acetyltransferase activity that can transfer acetate from acetyl-CoA to histones and also to other proteins in the complex on DNA (12Bannister A.J.

AD2 contributes to coactivation by p160s in some circumstances and does so in part by binding CARM1 and other proteins that have histone methyltransferase activity (19Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The coactivators are believed to mediate transcriptional activation by remodeling chromatin through their histone modification activities and also by direct effects on the transcriptional complex. In addition to regulating AF-2, hormones regulate steroid receptors (but not other nuclear receptors) in part by releasing the receptors from inhibitory complexes with heat shock proteins. The activity of steroid receptors is not regulated solely by hormones, however. Growth factors, such as EGF and insulin-like growth factor 1, can have profound and surprising effects on steroid receptors, even in the absence of cognate hormone (for review, see Ref. 20Weigel N.L. Zhang Y. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the most dramatic examples, EGF activates progesterone receptors almost as well as does hormone (21Bai W. Rowan B.G. Allgood V.E. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10457-10463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and will partly activate ER in the absence of hormone and enhance activity in the presence of hormone (22Kato S. Kitamoto T. Masuhiro Y. Yanagisawa J. Oncology. 1998; 55 Suppl. 1: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This later activity has been traced in part to EGF initiation of a cascade through the ERK family of MAP kinases that ultimately phosphorylates the ER at Ser-118 in the AF-1 region (23Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

Parker M.G. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-118 leads to increased AF-1 activity by increasing binding of a p68 RNA helicase that is or becomes bound to CBP. This Ser-118-dependent link of AF-1 to CBP is in addition to the Ser-118-independent link with GRIP1 and thereby CBP (27Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although EGF-mediated phosphorylation of steroid receptors underlies part of EGF enhancement, it cannot underlie all of it. In particular, mutation of Ser-118 to glutamate in the ER AF-1 domain, while blocking phosphorylation, nonetheless preserves EGF enhancement of ER action (25Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Furthermore, careful mutation of sites of phosphorylation in the progesterone receptor again reveals a potent action of EGF in the absence of direct receptor phosphorylation (21Bai W. Rowan B.G. Allgood V.E. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10457-10463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These studies suggest the existence of a pathway of EGF action that targets a nonreceptor protein. We have explored the possibility that this unknown target is one of the p160 coactivators, particularly GRIP1. We present evidence that at least part of the signal from EGF to steroid receptor is conducted through the p160 coactivators. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation as previously described (28Webb P. Lopez G.N. Greene G.L. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Generally transfections included 5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 1.0 μg of Gal-GRIP expression vectors, and 1.0 μg of β-actin-β-galactosidase expression vector for internal control. After electroporation, the cells were treated with vehicle, EGF (25 ng/ml), or TGF-α (15 ng/ml). Luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase values are the means and standard deviations of triplicate treatments from a single experiment, representative of at least three independent experiments. GST-GRIP fragments were expressed in bacteria (HB101) and partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity column. Beads bearing the fusion proteins (1–3 μg of total protein) were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by activated ERK2 according to the instructions of the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The phosphorylated products were extracted from the beads, resolved by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor expression, and subjected to autoradiography. Approximately 8.5 μg of total protein on beads were labeled in a 50-μl final reaction volume, extracted from the beads, and purified by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the radiolabeled proteins. In-gel digestion of the protein with trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was carried out as described previously (29Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The resultant peptides were separated using reversed phase HPLC on a microbore C8 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), and the collected fractions were subjected to scintillation counting. Individual peptides were subjected to covalent Edman degradation on a Sequelon AA membrane (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) with a protein sequencer (model 492; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The anilinothiazolı́noneamino acids were extracted from the filter with neat trifluoroacetic acid and scintillation counted. Radioactive profiles for each sequencing run were compared with theoretical peptide sequences derived from the protein. To construct GalDBD-GRIP1, the GalDBD coding fragment from pGBT9·GRIPFL (32Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was removed withHindIII-EcoRI and ligated toSmaI-EcoRI-cut pBS (Stratagene) giving rise to pBS·Gal4DBD. An EcoRI fragment of GRIP1 (amino acids 5–1462) from pGBT9 vector was then inserted into pBS·Gal4DBD. The entire Gal4 DBD-GRIP1 coding segment was then removed withXbaI-EcoRV and subcloned into theNheI-EcoRV site of commercially available pCMV vector (Stratagene). GalDBD-CBP has been described by Swope et al. (30Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). GST-GRIP1–479, GST-GRIP1–766, GST-GRIP184–766 and GST-GRIP766–1462 vectors for bacterial expression have been described by Webb et al. (7Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P.

The mutants GST-GRIPS736A and GST-GRIPS554A for mammalian expression were generated by polymerase chain reaction from parental vector GST-GRIP184–766 incorporating a mutagenic primer with Pfu polymerase (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). MPK-1 (CL100) expression vector was a gift of D. Stokoe (Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco). MEKK97R expression vector has been described by Mansour et al. (31Mansour S.J.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using mutagenic primer incorporation by polymerase chain reaction as described above. Gal-GRIPS736A and Gal-GRIPS554A are derivatives of Gal-GRIPFL vector and were mutated as indicated above. All the mutants were confirmed by sequencing, and generally, functional assays of two clones were carried out. pGFP-GRIP has green fluorescent protein fused to the amino terminus of GRIP expression vector and was a gift from Yihong Wan (University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center), and pGFP-GRIPS736A was constructed by removing a 1612-nucleotide BstXI-BspEI fragment from pSG5-GRIPS736A and inserting it into theBstXI-BspEI sites of pGFP-GRIP. The point mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The pSG5ER S118A mutant is a derivative of HEO (33Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and is described by Webb et al. (7Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M.

(36Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERE-luc contains the 45-mer estrogen response element from the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 promoter driving expression of the luciferase gene cloned in a pUC vector devoid of the vector AP1 site (35Lopez G. Schaufele F. Webb P. Holloway J.M. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and has been previously described (36Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pΔTAT3-luc reporter has three glucocorticoid response elements from the regulatory region of tyrosine aminotransferase gene placed upstream of the minimal Drosophila distal alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (−33 to +55) driving luciferase expression (37Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 20 million HeLa cells were transfected with 20 μg of GFP-GRIPwt or GFP-GRIPS736A expression vector, incubated overnight at 37 °C, exposed to EGF for 2 h, and harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100), protease inhibitors, and Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). The whole cell extract (50 μg) was resolved by 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies (Convance, Berkeley, CA) or GRIP1 antibodies (Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Golden, CO) followed by the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Signals were visualized by the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transfections cells to be analyzed by microscopy were distributed on cover glass-containing wells, and a duplicate group of cells was treated for regular luciferase activity. Images were collected on a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a 63×, 1.35 numerical aperture oil immersion objective and fluorescein isothiocyanate excitation and emission filters (Chroma Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Digital images were collected using a Xillix CCD camera and integration times from 50 to 150 ms. All the images presented in Fig. 6 were collected at the same integration times and processed identically. A recent report suggests that growth factor stimulation of the transcriptional activation functions of CBP (38Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) requires the domain of CBP that mediates p160 binding (10Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). We thus examined in transfected cells whether the p160 GRIP1 tethered to a reporter gene promoter by fusion to the heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal-GRIP1, Fig. 1) could activate transcription in response to growth factors. EGF and TGF-α had no effect on reporter gene expression in the absence of GRIP1 (Fig.1 A), but these ligands of the EGF receptor each activated transcription 5–10-fold when GRIP1 was bound to the promoter. The GRIP1 response to EGF and TGF-α required the action of the ERK family of MAP kinases because it was abolished by overexpression of the MAP kinase phosphatase CL100, by a dominant negative MEK that specifically prevents activation of ERKs, and by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK activation (Fig. 1, B and C). In control experiments EGF failed to stimulate reporter gene transcription mediated by a Gal4 fusion to the herpesvirus VP16 protein, and as expected, neither PD98059 nor CL100 nor dominant negative MEK was inhibitory (data not shown). Thus GRIP1 contains an EGF-regulated transcriptional activation function, and ERKs are a component of the pathway of activation. To examine whether GRIP1 might serve as a direct substrate for ERKs, we prepared recombinant GRIP1 in Escherichia coli and incubated it with activated ERK2 in vitro. Among fragments that represent the entire protein, two fragments from amino acids 1–766 and 184–766 were strongly phosphorylated by MAP kinase (Fig. 2 A). Fragment 1–479 was unreactive, and fragment 766–1462 was barely reactive. Thus GRIP1 serves as a MAP kinase substrate in vitro, and the major site(s) of phosphorylation lies within amino acids 184–766, most likely between 480 and 766. The precise site of action of ERK MAP kinase was determined by using enzymatic protein digests and Edman analysis of the phosphate-labeled GRIP1-(184–766). Each of these digests yielded a single major labeled peptide on HPLC, and the phosphate label was on the fifth amino acid of the tryptic peptide and the ninth of the V8 peptide (Fig.2 B). Each of these assays predicts that the major site of phosphorylation of GRIP1 is serine 736 (Fig. 2 B), which is an ERK consensus site. To confirm the identity of the site, the phosphorylation reactions were repeated with wild type GRIP1-(184–766) and mutants in which Ser-736 or Ser-554, chosen because it resembles a MAP kinase site, was mutated to alanine. Phosphorylation was diminished on GRIP1 mutated on Ser-736 (Fig. 2 C). The S554A mutant was phosphorylated as efficiently as wild type. In control experiments, JNK1, a MAP kinase with different specificity, phosphorylated all three substrates equally. We concluded that Ser-736 is a major target for phosphorylation of GRIP1 by ERK but not JNK in vitro. To examine the role of Ser-736 in vivo, we repeated our studies of EGF activation of tethered GRIP1 using both wild type and mutants. EGF potentiated transcriptional activation mediated by wild type GRIP1 or the S554A mutant but was consistently weaker on the S736A mutant (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). Despite this diminution of response, the Gal-GRIPS736A mutant was well expressed as detected by Western blots (not shown) and by its ability to serve as “bait” in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). These results indicate that GRIP1 bound directly to the promoter requires Ser-736 for full activation by EGF. We then tested the requirement for Ser-736 when GRIP1 functions as a coactivator for the PR activated by EGF signaling. We used a reporter gene with three response elements from the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter (TAT3-luc), which the PR activates 3-fold in the presence of EGF (Fig. 3 B). Wild type GRIP1 as well as the S554A mutant potentiated PR-mediated transcription of the reporter gene approximately 4-fold after activation with EGF. Both the hormone-liganded and constitutive activity of the PR were potentiated, as is frequently observed for nuclear receptors with overexpressed coactivators (data not shown). The S736A mutant was only half as effective as wild type in potentiating PR action. In control experiments with hormone-activated glucocorticoid receptor, which does not respond to EGF, both wild type and S736A GRIP1 potentiated receptor action to similar extents (data not shown), indicating that the Ser-736 mutant of GRIP1 retains full function in some contexts. S736A GRIP1 was, however, less able than wild type GRIP1 to potentiate progestin-activated PR. Some of this deficit may reflect a role for low level activation of ERK or some other kinase on the inducible functions of GRIP1 on progestin-PR, even in the absence of deliberate EGF stimulation (data not shown). For other potential explanations see Lange et al. (40Lange C.A. Richer J.K. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31308-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus S736A GRIP1 retains full ability to serve as a coactivator in some circumstances but is deficient in EGF-regulated coactivator function on the PR. Estrogen receptor activation of transcription from a reporter gene regulated by a consensus ERE is potentiated by EGF to varying extents depending on cells and culture conditions. We tested the ability of an ER S118A, mutated in the major site of EGF-dependent phosphorylation, for response to EGF with GRIP1. Without elevated GRIP1, EGF had little or no effect on transcriptional activation by ER S118A either in the absence or presence of estrogen (Fig.4 A, E2). With elevated GRIP1, EGF potentiated both unliganded and estrogen-liganded ER S118A action 2-fold. Interestingly, the S736A GRIP1 mutant was unable to support an EGF response. The isolated ER AF-2 function, which can be tested as a fusion of the ER LBD to the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain tethered on a Gal4 response element, does not respond to EGF (Fig. 4 B). The S736A mutant was undiminished in its ability to function as a coactivator for isolated ER AF-2. Thus, S736A retains full coactivator function with the isolated ER LBD but is deficient in coactivator function for full-length ER S118A. As noted above, GRIP1 is also bound to and synergizes with CBP/p300 (10Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Res. 1997; 52: 141-165PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that EGF regulates GRIP1 coactivator activities by affecting the efficiency of this interaction. Indeed, it was recently reported that activated MEK increased the association of CBP and the p160 AIB1 (42Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although expression of activated MEK led to phosphorylation of AIB1 the site(s) was not analyzed. We therefore examined the ability of wild type and S736A GRIP1 to potentiate transcription mediated by CBP. We tethered CBP directly to a promoter by fusion to a heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain. In the absence of overexpressed GRIP1 the CBP domain weakly activates transcription (Fig.5). Coexpression of wild type GRIP1 or the S554A mutant markedly potentiates transcription, which becomes sensitive to further induction by EGF. The S736A mutant of GRIP1 is, however, compromised in its ability to activate tethered CBP, and the EGF response is decreased. To confirm that the defects of the S736A mutant are not due to loss of stability or nuclear localization ability, we fused both wild type and mutant GRIP1 to GFP and monitored GRIP1 expression levels and nuclear localization. Both wild type and Ser-736 were well expressed and both localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6,top panel). Western blots indicated equal expression of wild type and mutant (Fig. 6, middle panel). When fused to GFP wild type GRIP1 had full coactivator action with tethered CBP and EGF, but the S736A mutant was diminished (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Thus the S736A mutation does not affect GRIP1 expression or localization yet has a specific effect on EGF-responsive coactivator function. The observations above indicate that EGF-activated ERK MAP kinase potentiates the transcriptional activation functions of GRIP1. Furthermore, activated ERKs phosphorylate GRIP1 on serine 736 in vitro. Mutation of Ser-736 to alanine substantially reduces the ability of GRIP1 to enhance transcription of the EGF-activated PR and of the estrogen- and EGF-potentiated ER. Because the mutant GRIP1 is fully able to function as a coactivator for the GR and for the isolated ER LBD AF-2, receptors that do not respond to EGF, it appears that the defect of S736A is limited and may indeed be specific for GRIP1 coactivator function with EGF-responsive steroid receptors or other transcription factors. In sum these observations suggest that EGF-activated ERKs increase selected coactivator functions of GRIP1 through a pathway requiring the integrity and most likely the phosphorylation of Ser-736. While this study was in preparation, it was reported that AIB1, another member of the p160 family, contained a transcriptional function that was activated by transfection with constitutive MEK, a potent activator of ERKs (42Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Activation by MEK was independent of the D2 domain of AIB1, suggesting that AD1 was responsible. Indeed fragments of AIB1 that contain AD1 and the nuclear receptor boxes are phosphorylated in MEK-transfected cells, suggesting that the target of MEK activation is in this region and may require AD1 for an output. Interestingly, a deletion of AD1 of GRIP1 compromises the EGF response with ER and PR (data not shown). Activation by MEK was also reported to increase the binding of CBP with AIB1 fragments that contain the AD1 domain. Our studies complement this observation in that we observed an EGF-induced increase in the functional interaction between the p160 binding domain of CBP tethered to DNA by fusion to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and GRIP1. The interaction is compromised by the Ser-736 mutation, suggesting a direct role for this site in the interaction. Sequence comparison of AIB1 and GRIP1 indicates that the Ser-736 residue is not conserved. Therefore mechanistic comparison must await the identification of the MEK-phosphorylated residues in AIB1 and their mutational analysis. The EGF pathway to GRIP1 and thence to transcription factors that recruit GRIP1 may provide a biological means to coordinate EGF effects at many different transcription factors and their target genes. It has been well established that EGF initiates a signal transduction phosphorylation cascade that leads to transcription factors such as Elk-1, ER, and PR. Direct phosphorylation of the transcription factors is required for wild type Elk-1 and ER response to EGF. Nonetheless, there are hints that in the absence of direct phosphorylation, such as when the ER Ser-118 is mutated to glutamate, an EGF response persists. Thus, we suggest that for an EGF-induced signal cascade to be fully effective the cascade may need to target both the transcription factor and the recruited coactivator. This double requirement may prevent random biological noise from activation of the EGF response. We thank Paul Webb, Branka Kovacic, and David Stokoe for plasmids and helpful discussion."

Chromosomal anomalies such as translocations are a common mechanism to introduce genetic changes. Many human sarcomas are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations, which result in the creation of novel fusion genes; these new genes are thought to be critical for tumorigenesis. EWS/FLI is a fusion gene created by the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) found in >85% of all Ewing's sarcomas (1Turc-Carel C. Aurias A. Mugneret F. Lizard S. Sidaner I. Volk C. Thiery J.P.

The resulting fusion protein combines the N terminus of EWS, an RNA-binding protein of unknown function, with the C terminus of the ETS family transcription factor FLI-1 (2Delattre O. Zucman J.

EWS is fused to related transcription factors of the ETS family in the remaining cases of Ewing's sarcoma (3Jeon I.S. Davis J.N. Braun B.S. Sublett J.E. Roussel M.F. Denny C.T. Shapiro D.N.

This consistent combination suggests that both the retained region of EWS, which is capable of transcriptional activation, and the ETS DNA-binding domain of the fusion protein contribute critical functions in the genesis of these tumors.TLS and TAFII-68,EWS-related genes, are also translocated and fused to transcription factor gene partners in human sarcomas (7Crozat A.

Mandahl N. Mitelman F. Aman P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 489-494PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity and cellular transformation functions of EWS/FLI are not completely concordant. Although most of the transformation potential appears to reside in the N-terminal 82 amino acids of EWS, the entire EWS domain is required to provide full transformation efficiency. Interestingly, the region of EWS that contributes most to transactivation by EWS/FLI does not coincide with the domain that confers the most efficient transforming activity (13Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an introduced mutation in EWS/FLI that ablates ETSspecific DNA binding only partly diminishes transformation (14Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting an ETS transcription-independent aspect of transformation. Transcription and post-transcriptional processing are closely coupled processes in vivo (15Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and it is likely that EWS and TLS participate in both transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. TLS has the capacity to alter 5′-splice site selection of the adenoviralE1A gene in certain cell types (16Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol.

Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). EWS interacts with the essential splicing factors SF1 (20Zhang D.P. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and U1C (21Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as well as with CUG-BP, a protein that is involved with the alternative splicing of the APP gene and the human cardiac troponin T gene. The binding of CUG-BP to cardiac troponin T pre-mRNA is thought to disrupt splicing and to contribute to the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy (22Poleev A. Hartmann A. Stamm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EWS and TLS both copurify with the splicing factor PSF (22Poleev A. Hartmann A. Stamm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which is commonly involved in chromosomal translocations found in human papillary renal cell carcinomas (23Clark J.L. Lu Y.-J. Sidhar S.K. Parker C. Gill S. Smedley D. Hamoudi R. Linehan W.M. Shipley J. Cooper C.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Interaction with the splicing factor U1C represses EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation (21Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ability of a splicing factor to influence the transcriptional activity of EWS/FLI suggested that, conversely, EWS/FLI may play a direct role in splicing or have the ability to alter the composition of functional splicing complexes. To address this question, we used an in vivo splicing assay based on the alternative splicing of the adenoviral E1A gene. This assay is a well established method to show the ability of proteins such as hnRNPA1 and SF2 to influence splice site selection. The relative concentrations of these two proteins to one another determine which splice site in theE1A gene is favored. High concentrations of hnRNPA1 relative to SF2 lead to use of distal 5′-sites, whereas higher concentrations of SF2 favor proximal 5′-splice sites (24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Utilization of different 5′-splice sites leads to the subsequent formation of different amounts of alternatively spliced isoforms of E1A. We used this assay to show that although EWS and EWS/FLI have no direct effect on the splicing ofE1A when expressed alone, the tumor-associated EWS/FLI, but not wild-type EWS, can oppose the change in splicing pattern induced by expression of hnRNPA1. The epitope-tagged constructs pCFLAG-EWS and pCFLAG-EWS/FLI were generated as previously described (21Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).FLI-1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from HL-60 cDNA and cloned in-frame into pCFLAG at the EcoRI site.hnRNPA1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from pGA1 (a gift from Dr. Adrian Krainer) (25Caceres J.F.

EWS/FLI point mutation constructs were made by PCR-based strategy (14Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J.

Amino acid numbers for point mutations refer to the FLI-1 sequence. The absence of PCR errors in all plasmids was verified by automated sequence analysis. The clone containing the E1A minigene, pBSV-E1ATFN, was a generous gift from Dr. James Manley and has been previously described (27Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 3 × 106 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates and transfected 16–18 h later. Transfections of only one plasmid contained 12 μg of DNA (pCFLAG vector, pCFLAG-EWS, pCFLAG-EWS/FLI, pCFLAG-FLI-1, or pCFLAG-hnRNPA1) mixed with 32 μl of FuGene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added to cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfections of pCFLAG-hnRNPA1 in combination with another plasmid contained 12 μg of pCFLAG-hnRNPA1 and 6 μg of the additional plasmid mixed with 55 μl of FuGene. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized with 2 ml of trypsin, and resuspended in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following trypsinization, 90% of the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The remaining 10% of the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) used according to the manufacturer's recommendations). Following a brief sonication, lysates were used for Western blotting. RT-PCR detection of E1A isoforms was performed as previously described using [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides E1A569 and E1A1315 (28Yang X. Bani M.R. Lu S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Detection was carried out by autoradiography, and isoforms were quantitated with ImageQuant on a PhosphorImager. The average results of three independent experiments, with two different PCR cycle numbers for each, are shown. A673 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 9 × 105cells were seeded on 100-mm plates and transfected 16–18 h later. Transfections contained 1.6 μg of pBSV-E1ATFN and 16.4 μg of pCFLAG empty vector, pCFLAG-EWS, pCFLAG-EWS/FLI, or pCFLAG-hnRNPA1 mixed with 72 μl of FuGene according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were harvested, and subsequent experiments were performed as described above. Consistent results were obtained for all PCRs in this assay when repeated with differing numbers of PCR cycles and varying amounts of input cDNA template to ensure that all results were within the quantitative range of the assay. Cell extracts were quantitated for total protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and 50 μg of protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Epitope-tagged proteins were detected with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Babco) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Proteins were visualized with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:5000, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. RT-PCR detection of total cellularE1A message was performed on a Model 7700 sequence detector machine (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 10 μl of cDNA synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA (isolated as described above) was mixed with 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 μm probe (6FAM-ACCGAAGAAATGGCCGCCAG-TAMRA, Applied Biosystems), 300 nm final concentration E1A forward primer (ATTATCTGCCACGGAGGTGTT), and 300 nm final concentration E1A reverse primer (TCGATCAGCTGGTCCAAAAG) for a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Samples had dual annealing cycles at 55 and 60 °C for 1 min each, consecutively. Samples underwent 40 rounds of thermocycling. Samples included COS cDNA and mock cDNA synthesized without reverse transcriptase as negative controls; untransfected, A1+vector, A1+EWS, A1+EWS/FLI, A1+FLI-1, A1+EF del54, A1+EF W321R, and A1+EF I347E as experimental 293T cDNAs; and pBSV-E1ATFN plasmid as a positive control. The probe and primers were contained within the common 5′-exon that is included in all spliced isoforms. TaqMan PCR was repeated on duplicate samples using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and probe (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We performed in vivo splicing assays to see if EWS or EWS/FLI could affect 5′-splice site selection of the adenoviralE1A gene. Alternative splicing of E1Apre-mRNA generated three major isoforms (13 S, 12 S, and 9 S) and two minor isoforms (11 S and 10 S) (Fig.1) (25Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Proteins such as hnRNPA1, SF2, and TLS have the ability to generate these isoforms in differing amounts by altering 5′-splice site selection (16Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol.

Alternatively spliced isoforms of E1A are detected by RT-PCR using the primers shown in Fig. 1. 293T cells are human embryonic kidney cells immortalized with the adenoviralE1A gene (29Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3497) Google Scholar) and therefore contain endogenousE1A. To analyze alternative splicing of E1A in 293T cells, we amplified E1A mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig.2 A) and quantitated the relative proportions of the three major isoforms (Fig. 2 B). The endogenous representation of the three major E1A isoforms in these cells comprised 51% of the 13 S isoform, followed by the 12 S isoform at 41% and then the 9 S isoform at only 5% (Fig. 2, A,lane 1; and B). Introduced expression of EWS, EWS/FLI, or FLI-1 did not significantly affect the alternative splicing of E1A (Fig. 2, A, lanes 2 and3; and B) (data not shown). In contrast, overexpression of hnRNPA1 caused increased usage of the distal 5′-splice site, resulting in greatly increased levels of the 9 S isoform and decreased levels of the relative proportion of the 13 S isoform, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 2, A,lane 4; and B). Therefore, we concluded that EWS, EWS/FLI, and FLI-1 did not directly affect E1A splice site selection in these cells, despite expression at levels comparable to hnRNPA1, as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2 C) (data not shown). All PCRs were repeated at differing cycle numbers and with varying amounts of input cDNA to verify that results were reproducible and quantitative.Figure 2EWS and EWS/FLI do not directly alter E1A splice site selection. A, shown is the in vivo alternative splicing of endogenous E1Apre-mRNA in 293T cells. 293T cells were transiently transfected with 12 μg of pCFLAG (lane 1), pCFLAG-EWS (lane 2), pCFLAG-EWS/FLI (lane 3), or pCFLAG-hnRNPA1 (lane 4) expression plasmid. Radiolabeled PCR fragments corresponding to E1A isoforms were resolved on polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. B, the E1A iso- forms were quantified with ImageQuant on a PhosphorImager. The relative percentage of each major isoform is shown: 13 S (gray bars), 12 S (white bars), and 9 S (black bars). Percentages of 13 S, 12 S, and 9 S isoforms shown are the averages of three representative independent experiments with two different PCR cycle numbers for each. Error barsrepresent S.D. values. C, 50 μg of total protein isolated from 293T cell lysates used in A was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography. D, ImageQuant PhosphorImager quantification was carried out in vivo in A673 cells. A673 cells were transiently cotransfected with 1.6 μg of pBSV-E1ATFN and 16.4 μg of pCFLAG vector, pCFLAG-EWS, pCFLAG-EWS/FLI, or pCFLAG-hnRNPA1. The in vivo splicing assay was performed, quantitated, and presented as described for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One potential limitation of this assay was that the low levels of the 9 S isoform in 293T cells could preclude detection of an increase in proximal splice site selection and an associated decrease in the 9 S isoform. Therefore, we repeated the assay in the Ewing's sarcoma cell line A673. These cells were cotransfected with the E1Aminigene and empty vector or EWS, EWS/FLI, orhnRNPA1 expression plasmid, and subsequent results were compared with those seen in 293T cells. In vivo splicing of E1A in this cell background gave increased levels of the 9 S isoform relative to 293T cells. However, overexpression of EWS or EWS/FLI still did not affect splice site selection. As before, expression of hnRNPA1 increased distal splice site selection, resulting in increased levels of the 9 S isoform (Fig. 2 D). Thus, EWS and EWS/FLI do not directly affect alternative splicing of E1A in either cell background. The E1A in vivo splicing assay was used first to demonstrate that the relative concentrations of hnRNPA1 and SF2 to one another determined splice site selection. These relative concentrations were manipulated by experimental overexpression (24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). To detect an effect on splice site selection, the introduced proteins must be expressed at levels higher than the endogenous proteins to increase the relative concentration within the cell. Under our experimental conditions, EWS/FLI was expressed at ∼6-fold higher levels than endogenous EWS/FLI protein in a Ewing's sarcoma cell line, and hnRNPA1 was expressed at 2–3-fold higher levels than endogenous protein in 293T or Ewing's sarcoma cells (data not shown). Because EWS has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with hnRNPA1 (19Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that EWS or EWS/FLI may influence hnRNPA1-dependent splice site selection by changing the composition of splicing complexes. As expected, cotransfection of hnRNPA1 with empty vector gave a distinct increase in the 9 S isoform of E1A as compared with levels in untransfected 293T cells (Fig. 3,A, lanes 1 and 2; and B). Cotransfection of EWS with hnRNPA1 did not change the pattern of isoforms seen with hnRNPA1 and empty vector (Fig. 3, A, lanes 2 and 3; andB). However, the addition of EWS/FLI to the transfection with hnRNPA1 significantly decreased the relative amount of 9 S isoform generated by 25%, with a concomitant increase in the 12 S and 13 S isoforms (Fig. 3, A,lanes 2 and 4; and B). The interference with hnRNPA1-mediated splice site selection was likely to come from the FLI-1 portion of the fusion protein since wild-type EWS did not demonstrate this activity. To confirm this, a plasmid containing the full coding sequence of FLI-1 was cotransfected with hnRNPA1, and the resulting alternative splicing pattern was analyzed. FLI-1 expression at levels similar to EWS/FLI did not affect the E1A splicing pattern (Fig. 3, A,lanes 2 and 5; and B). However, elevated FLI-1 expression opposed the hnRNPA1-dependent effect on E1A differential splicing in the same manner as EWS/FLI, with a dramatic decrease in the 9 S isoform and a compensatory increase in both the 12 S and 13 S isoforms (Fig. 3, A, lanes 2, 4, and 6; and B). The effects seen with EWS/FLI and FLI-1 were not a result of less hnRNPA1 expression in these transfected cells, as Western blot analysis showed that hnRNPA1 levels were consistent in all samples (Fig.3 C). Several EWS/FLI mutant proteins were previously analyzed for their ability to bind DNA and to transform NIH-3T3 cells (14Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The activities of the mutants and the wild-type counterparts are reviewed in TableI. The del54 mutant contains a gross deletion of 54 of the 80 amino acids comprising the ETS domain of EWS/FLI. This deletion ablates DNA-binding activity and should abolish protein-protein interactions or any other processes mediated by the ETS domain. Two point mutations that ablate ETS DNA-binding activity, replacement of tryptophan 321 with arginine (W321R) and replacement of isoleucine 347 with glutamic acid (I347E), were also tested in transformation. Although the del54 and W321R mutant proteins lack transforming activity, I347E retains a somewhat reduced transforming activity. The differential ability of I347E to transform cells may be related to the structural integrity of the ETS domain. Tryptophan 321 is absolutely conserved in all ETS family members, and this substitution may disrupt protein structure. The substitution of I347E, however, occurs naturally in the ETS protein PU.1. Therefore, this change can be accommodated within the structural constraints of the ETS domain. The transforming activity of the I347E mutant demonstrates that a component of EWS/FLI-mediated transformation is independent of ETS DNA binding. For this reason, we looked at the effects of this mutant protein, as well as the del54 and W321R mutant proteins, on the alternative splicing pattern of E1A mediated by hnRNPA1. 293T cells were cotransfected with hnRNPA1 and the various forms of EWS/FLI, and the resulting splicing patterns were analyzed. As expected, cotransfection ofhnRNPA1 and empty vector gave a large increase in the 9 S isoform, with compensatory decreases in the 13 S and 12 S isoforms compared with untransfected cells (Fig.4, A, lanes 1 and2; and B). This effect was opposed by the addition of EWS/FLI (Fig. 4, A, lanes 2 and3; and B). The EWS/FLI del54 mutant protein failed to affect the splicing pattern induced by hnRNPA1, giving the same isoform profile as the addition of empty vector (Fig. 4,A, lanes 2 and 4; and B). The EWS/FLI W321R mutant protein significantly altered this profile (p = 0.02), decreasing the amount of the 9 S isoform by only 12%, whereas the I347E mutant protein more dramatically decreased the 9 S isoform by 25% (p = 0.002) (Fig. 4,A, compare lanes 2, 5, and6; and B). The effect of the I347E mutant on alternative splicing did not differ significantly from that seen with the wild-type EWS/FLI protein. Therefore, there was a correlation between transforming activity and the ability to influence alternative splicing in the absence of DNA-binding activity (Table I). Western blotting confirmed that hnRNPA1 was made at comparable levels in all samples (Fig. 4 C, lower panel) and that EWS/FLI mutants were expressed at least as highly as the wild-type EWS/FLI protein (upper panel). To ensure that changes in splicing were not a secondary effect from changes in the levels ofE1A transcript, we quantitated the levels of E1A using TaqMan real-time PCR. The transfected constructs did not affect levels of E1A transcription (data not shown).Table ITransforming versions of EWS/FLI interfere with hnRNPA1-mediated 5′-splice site selectionProteinDNA bindingTransformationEffect on splice site selectionEWS−−−EWS/FLI+++++++++EWS/FLI del54−−−EWS/FLI W321R−−+EWS/FLI I347E−++++“DNA binding” indicates the capacity to bind to the FLI-1-binding consensus sequence and activate transcription. “Transformation” refers to the capacity of the protein to induce anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3 colonies in soft agar. “Effect on splice site selection” indicates the ability to interfere with the distal 5′-splice site selection favored by hnRNPA1. +++, activity of EWS/FLI; +, diminished activity relative to EWS/FLI; −, no activity.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest that alterations in pre-mRNA splicing may contribute to EWS/FLI-mediated cellular transformation. We used an in vivo splicing assay with the E1A gene to test the hypothesis that EWS or EWS/FLI may have the ability to affect alternative splicing. We showed that although EWS and EWS/FLI do not directly affect the splicing pattern of E1A, the tumor-associated EWS/FLI opposed alternative 5′-splice site selection induced by hnRNPA1. Furthermore, analysis of mutant proteins showed an association between the ability to affect alternative splicing and transforming activity, independent of ETS DNA binding. Thus, the splicing-associated functions of EWS/FLI may contribute to transformation. Although the contribution of aberrant splicing to tumorigenesis remains unclear, abnormal splicing profiles have been associated with tumors. For example, two novel aberrantly spliced transcripts of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 were identified in a large percentage of both primary tumors and colorectal carcinoma cell lines. It is thought that these may confer a selectable growth advantage to cells contributing to the progression of colorectal tumors (30Jang J.H. Shin K.H. Park Y.J. Lee R.J. McKeehan W.L. Park J.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4049-4052PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a spliced variant of vascular endothelial growth factor is associated with greater tumorigenicity and increased angiogenic properties in breast carcinoma cells compared with other isoforms (31Zhang H.T. Scott P.A. Morbidelli L. Peak S. Moore J. Turley H. Harris A.L. Ziche M. Bicknell R. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced forms of the key cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and p53 have also been identified in human tumors and cell lines (32Chow V.T. Quek H.H. Tock E.P. Cancer Lett. 1993; 73: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Hosokawa Y. Gadd M. Smith A.P. Koerner F.C. Schmidt E.V. Arnold A. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are several examples of splicing factor involvement in tumor-derived fusion proteins. DEK, which is fused to CAN in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, associates with serine/arginine-rich splicing proteins in vitro and in vivo. DEK remains bound to exon-product RNA after prior removal of an intron, suggesting a role for DEK in pre-mRNA processing (34McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In papillary renal cell carcinomas, the splicing proteins PSF and p54NRB/NonO are fused to DNA-binding domains from TFE3 (23Clark J.L. Lu Y.-J. Sidhar S.K. Parker C. Gill S. Smedley D. Hamoudi R. Linehan W.M. Shipley J. Cooper C.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Additionally, EWS is fused to WT-1 in chimeric proteins from desmoplastic small round cell tumors (10Ladanyi M. Gerald W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2837-2840PubMed Google Scholar). WT-1 exists as two different isoforms, one of which binds to DNA at specific promoter sequences, whereas the other binds more efficiently with splicing factors (35Davies R.C. Calvio C. Bratt E. Larsson S.H. Lamond A.I. Hastie N.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Studies on the PU.1 protein illustrate a precedent in which the ETS domain regulates both transcription and splicing. Fli-1 andPu.1 are the two genes most frequently targeted by viral integration in Friend virus-induced mouse erythroleukemias (36Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Cell. 1991; 66: 831-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PU.1 interacts with TLS and modulates TLS-mediated splice site selection (17Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PU.1 also interacts with the RNA-binding protein p54NRB and can inhibit splicing of β-globin mRNA. It is thought that PU.1 may disturb gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level through sequestration of important RNA-binding proteins like p54NRB (37Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the ETS domain of PU.1 alone could inhibit splicing (37Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain is critical for mediating such sequestering interactions. Our data support a similar role for EWS/FLI in altering 5′-splice site selection. Interactions between EWS/FLI and hnRNPA1, or other proteins required for hnRNPA1-mediated splice site selection, may alter the composition of the active spliceosome. EWS/FLI was more potent than FLI-1 in its effect on splice selection, perhaps due to the contribution of EWS interactions with splicing factors (20Zhang D.P. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the ETS domain was required to influence splicing. Deletion of the ETS domain ablated the effect, and the point mutation W321R, which is likely to disrupt the structure of the ETS domain, decreased the effect substantially. The diminished activity of EWS/FLI W321R in the splicing assay may reflect a failure to interact with a subset of proteins involved in splice site selection. The EWS/FLI I347E substitution is found in wild-type PU.1 and therefore probably does not greatly alter the structure of the ETS domain. Thus, it is possible that EWS/FLI I347E maintains critical interactions with RNA-binding proteins mediated by this domain and therefore retains the full effect on hnRNPA1-dependent splice site selection. An alternative possibility is that EWS/FLI may alter the composition of the spliceosome by influencing the transcription of other splicing factors. Although it is formally possible that the mutant proteins I347E and W321R retain the ability to bind a variant DNA sequence, they lack the expected ETS DNA-binding activity that is well characterized for proteins containing this modular DNA-binding domain. Therefore, it seems quite unlikely that the I347E mutant would regulate specific transcriptional targets in a manner that produces splicing effects equivalent to those induced by EWS/FLI. Consistent with our findings, EWS/FLI and TLS/ERG, a fusion protein found in acute myeloid leukemia, also interfere with the alternative splicing patterns of E1A mediated by serine/arginine-rich proteins. The RNA-binding regions of TLS and EWS interact with the serine/arginine-rich proteins TASR-1 and TASR-2, perhaps recruiting them to sites of transcription. EWS/FLI and TLS/ERG inhibit splicing mediated by TASR proteins, presumably due to loss of the interaction (18Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike the effect on hnRNPA1-mediated splicing, wild-type FLI-1 does not affect splicing by TASR proteins. Our study illustrates that alterations in splicing can also be mediated by the ETS domain, adding another level of complexity and specificity to the involvement of EWS/FLI in splicing. Altogether, the evidence indicates that EWS/FLI has the ability to influence the splicing process. The domains of the protein required and the precise effect depend on the complement of splicing proteins present and will almost certainly vary with the RNA substrate examined. E1A is an established experimental splicing substrate, but is not a physiological substrate for EWS/FLI in Ewing's sarcoma. New technologies such as intron sequence information system (ISIS), an intron information system used to detect alternative splicing in the human genome (39Croft L. Schandorff S. Clark F. Burrage K. Arctander P. Mattick J.S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 340-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), could help to identify such transcripts in the future. Transcriptional activity contributes substantially to the transforming activity of EWS/FLI, although it is not absolutely required. Identification of relevant target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by EWS/FLI may also provide key substrates to dissect the specific effects of EWS/FLI on splicing. We thank Drs. Sheila Shurtleff and Anami Patel for assistance with the TaqMan PCR assay, Drs. James Manley and Adrian Krainer for plasmids, Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss for anti-hnRNPA1 antibody, and Drs.

We show that a hybrid XRCC2-green fluorescent protein, which was found to be functional by complementation, localizes to the nucleus. We have established a functional link between XRCC2 and RAD51 by looking at damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation in the irs1 cell line. Little or no formation of RAD51 foci occurred in irs1. This effect was specific to the loss of XRCC2 because transfection of the gene into irs1 restored normal levels of focus formation. Surprisingly, XRCC2 genes carrying site-specific mutations in P-loop residues were found to be able to complement the XRCC2-deficient irs1 line for a number of different end points. We conclude that XRCC2 is important in the early stages of homologous recombination in mammalian cells to facilitate RAD51-dependent recombination repair but that it does not make use of ATP binding to promote this function.

In bacteria, the RecA protein has a central role in the recombination process, and in the last decade RecA-like proteins have been discovered in eukaryotes. In particular the RAD51 protein is highly conserved from yeast to humans and has been shown to have similar attributes to RecA (1Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in both RecA and RAD51 cause severe defects in recombination and extreme sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. RecA acts directly in recombination processes in which, in the presence of ATP, it forms a polymer on single-stranded DNA and promotes strand exchange with a homologous sequence (3Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using molecular recombination assays, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human RAD51 proteins have been shown to promote strand exchange similarly, although some of the biochemical properties of RAD51 differ from those of RecA. For example, purified RecA preferentially binds to single-stranded DNA and hydrolyzes ATP at a relatively high rate, whereas the yeast and human RAD51 proteins bind equally to single- and double-stranded DNA and show a much lower rate of ATP hydrolysis (1Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). All members of this family have a highly conserved sequence motif, first described by Walkeret al. (4Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar), that has been linked to ATP binding. The flexible loop of this motif (Walker box A) interacts with the phosphates of ATP and is therefore sometimes called the P-loop. In S. cerevisiae, two further members of the RecA/RAD51family of proteins facilitate homologous recombination in mitotic cells; Rad55p and Rad57p form a heterodimer and stimulate RAD51-mediated recombination (5Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that lack these recombination proteins are also extremely sensitive to agents causing severe forms of damage to DNA, such as double strand breaks and interstrand cross-links (6Game J.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar). These additional recombination proteins also have homologues in somatic mammalian cells, in which five RAD51-like proteins have recently been discovered (XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51L1, RAD51L2, and RAD51L3) (7Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).

The irs1 line, isolated in this laboratory several years ago (11Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), was found to be sensitive to a variety of agents including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, alkylating agents, and especially DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin-C. It also shows spontaneous genetic instability with increased frequencies of mutations (12Thacker J. Ganesh A.N. Stretch A. Benjamin D.M. Zahalsky A.J. Hendrickson E.A. Mutagenesis. 1994; 9: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), chromosomal aberrations (13Tucker J.D. Jones N.J. Allen N.A. Minkler J.L. Thompson L.H. Carrano A.V. Mutat.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the repair of a site-specific double strand break by recombination is severely reduced in irs1 compared with the paternal V79 cells (15Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of two-hybrid interactions involving XRCC2 have led to the speculation of an indirect association with RAD51 through other recombination proteins (16Schild D. Lio Y. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16443-16449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, as yet there is no direct evidence for the involvement of XRCC2 in RAD51-dependent recombination processes. It has been shown that RAD51 can be detected in discrete nuclear foci following DNA damage to mammalian cells (17Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we considered the localization of XRCC2 in mammalian cells and established a functional link between XRCC2 and RAD51 by looking at damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation in the XRCC2-deficient cell line irs1. Additionally, we have created a number of mutations of XRCC2 in the Walker A motif to determine the importance of this site in the functioning of XRCC2. Wild-type V79 and XRCC2-deficient irs1 cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To assay the sensitivity of individual clones to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin-C (MMC)1, cells were respread into 24-well plates at 100–300 cells/well containing graded concentrations of MMC (0–100 nm). After 10–12 days of incubation, the density of cell growth was assessed visually (see TableI). Bacterial cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics; plasmids were propagated in strain DH5α. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiaprep kit (Qiagen); sequencing reactions were performed using a BigDye kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IGrowth of wild-type V79, XRCC2-deficient irs1, and transfected derivatives of irs1 in the presence of mitomycin-CCell lineMMC concentration0 nm3 nm10 nm20 nm50 nm100 nmV79+++++++++++++++++irs1++++−−−−irs1 + XRCC2 wild-type cDNA+++++++++++++++irs1 + XRCC2-GFP+++++++++++++++irs1 + XRCC2 mutant K54R+++++++++++++++irs1 + XRCC2 mutant K54A+++++++++++++++irs1 + XRCC2 mutant ΔG53K54++++++++++++++−irs1 + XRCC2 mutant truncated++++−−−−irs1 + vector++++−−−−For each line transfected with an XRCC2 construct, the combined results of 4–6 G418-resistant clones are shown.

Growth in 24-well plates was judged by eye: +++, cells grew strongly to fill the well; to +, very few cells grew; −, no growth. XRCC2 was amplified from a human cDNA library using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers to incorporate restriction sites for cloning into pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to create an in-frame fusion of theEGFP gene to the 3′-end of XRCC2. Approximately 4 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into irs1 cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 400 V/500 microfarads) in Cytomix buffer (20van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 14 days in 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). G418-resistant clones were tested for MMC resistance using 24-well plates (see above) to demonstrate XRCC2 function. MMC-resistant cells were grown on glass coverslips, and the fusion protein was visualized at 488 nm using a Bio-Rad MRC600 laser scanning confocal microscope. Human XRCC2 cDNA was cloned into pBS as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenic polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) with primers designed to create changes at the highly conserved lysine 54 residue (K54A, K54R, and ΔG53K54). In addition to these mutations, a cDNA with a fortuitous stop codon in the same region was derived from the mutagenic polymerase chain reaction, and this was used as a negative control. Inserts carrying mutations were subcloned into theNheI and BamHI sites of the pIRESneo2 vector (CLONTECH). Plasmid DNA was transfected into irs1 cells (as above), and cells were selected for 14 days in 500 μg/ml G418. Six separate clones for each construct were picked and tested for MMC resistance using the 24-well plate assay (see above). The internal ribosome entry site vector was used to select against integration events that disrupted the XRCC2 gene. In control experiments, ∼85% of G418-resistant clones also expressed theXRCC2 construct (data not shown). Pools of ∼100 G418-resistant clones carrying mutated plasmids were grown in medium containing 100 μg/ml G418 and MMC (0–100 nm) for 10–12 days. Similarly, pooled G418-resistant cells were irradiated with either 0-, 2.5-, 5-, or 10-Gy x-rays and then grown in medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. After 10–12 days, colonies were stained with methylene blue and counted. Metaphases were collected from cells grown in flasks by exposure to colcemid (0.05 μg/ml) for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized and incubated in hypotonic solution (1:1; 0.075m KCl, 0.034 m trisodium citrate) for 8 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 3:1 ethanol:acetic acid and dropped onto slides before staining with Giemsa for analysis. Approximately 100 metaphases/cell type were analyzed for both chromatid and chromosome aberrations. Cells were grown on glass coverslips to subconfluent levels and irradiated with 10-Gy x-rays. After 0–5 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1× SSC and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS/5% normal horse serum. Rabbit anti-hRAD51 antibody (FBE1, a generous gift from S. C. West, Imperial Cancer Research Fund Clare Hall Laboratories) was applied at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS/5% horse serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were treated with anti-rabbit IgG/Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, and then the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade medium. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy at 633 nm, and images were selected at random. Immunofluorescence images were scored blindly by two independent scorers who recorded the number of discrete strongly fluorescing nuclear foci present in each cell. Approximately 50 cells were counted per data point, and data were compared statistically to assess homogeneity using the Mann-Whitney U test. One scorer consistently scored about 30% more foci than the other, but identical trends of increased focus formation with irradiation and with time after irradiation (of cell lines with wild-type XRCC2) were found for each scorer. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105/75-cm2 flask at 16 h before x-irradiation. Cells were then harvested at intervals of up to 7 h, washed three times with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 0.5% RNaseA (Sigma) before the addition of propidium iodide to 50 μg/ml final concentration. Flow cytometric analysis (>10,000 cells/sample) was performed on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson). Cells were grown to subconfluent levels in tissue culture flasks, irradiated with 10-Gy x-rays, and harvested after a further 5 h growth. Cells were resuspended in distilled water and heated for 15 min at 95 °C, and total protein was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The lysate was resuspended in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli/glycerol buffer and treated for a further 5 min at 95 °C. A 20-μg sample was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). RAD51 was detected using the FBE1 antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin, 5% nonfat dried milk. Anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as the secondary antibody (Promega) at a dilution of 1:5000, and bands were visualized using ECL (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Renaissance) according to the manufacturer's protocol) and Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:2000) (Sigma) was used as loading control. The human XRCC2 protein was expressed as a fusion to the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in XRCC2-defective irs1 hamster cells. This construct was tested for functional ability by transfection into the irs1 line and exposure to a range of concentrations of the DNA cross-linking agent MMC. As shown previously (9Cartwright R. Tambini C.E. Simpson P.J. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the expression of the wild-type human XRCC2 gene in irs1 cells gives a good, although not complete, level of complementation of MMC sensitivity (Table I). In the same test, the XRCC2-GFP hybrid gene had no loss of complementing ability when compared with the XRCC2 cDNA (Table I). Although the expression of GFP alone occurred throughout the cell (data not shown), its expression was primarily nuclear when associated with XRCC2 (Fig. 1). To assess the function of XRCC2 specifically in recombination-repair processes, we measured the formation of radiation-induced RAD51 foci in wild-type (V79) and irs1 hamster cells. Cells were irradiated with 10-Gy x-rays, and the numbers of foci were counted at hourly intervals for up to 5 h. In agreement with previous studies (17Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Tashiro S. Kotomura N. Shinohara A. Tanaka K. Ueda K. Kamada N. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li M.J. Maizels N. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a low level of focus formation was seen in unirradiated cells and in cells fixed immediately after irradiation (generally <2 foci/cell; see Fig.2 A). In V79 cells the numbers of foci increased significantly following x-irradiation (Fig.2 A). Although there was some fluctuation in the numbers of foci seen in V79 cells with time following irradiation (Fig.2 B), this variation was not significant over 1–5 h after irradiation (p = 0.8). In the XRCC2-deficient irs1 cells, little focus formation was found (Fig. 2 A), although there is some evidence for a slow accumulation of foci with time. However, this level is on average about 5-fold lower (p= 10−6) than that seen for the XRCC2-proficient V79 cells (Fig. 2 B). It has been shown that RAD51 foci in unirradiated cells form primarily in S-phase (21Tashiro S. Kotomura N. Shinohara A. Tanaka K. Ueda K. Kamada N. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar), raising the question of whether differences in cell cycle distribution may influence the ability to detect foci in irs1 after irradiation. However, cell cycle profiles for irradiated V79 and irs1 cells were very similar with most cells blocked in G2phase at 5 h after a dose of 10 Gy (Fig.3 A). It is also possible that the formation of RAD51 foci is affected by the levels of RAD51 protein in irs1 relative to V79, but we found that RAD51 levels were similar in the two cell lines, both before and after irradiation (Fig.3 B). The stable transfection of the irs1 cells with humanXRCC2 genomic (P1-artificial chromosome) DNA (8Tambini C.E. George A.M. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.C. Scherer S.W. Thacker J. Genomics. 1997; 41: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or cDNA (Table I) gave clonal lines with a good level of correction of DNA-damage sensitivity. These transfected lines were also found to have a restored ability to form RAD51 foci after irradiation (Fig.2 A), whereas RAD51 protein levels were similar to those in irs1 and V79 (Fig. 3 B). This finding implicates theXRCC2 gene specifically in correct focus formation. The time course for the development of foci was apparently slower in theXRCC2-transfected lines than for V79, possibly because the human gene is not as efficient in a hamster cell background (Fig.2 B). To gain further information on the function of XRCC2, we mutated the highly conserved Walker box A (putative ATP binding) motif in several different ways. It has been shown previously that the invariant lysine residue of this motif is critical to the function of RecA or RAD51 proteins (see “Discussion”). Initially therefore we mutated this residue to either a conservative (K54R) or nonconservative (K54A) alternative in XRCC2 as well as deriving a mutant form in which the lysine was deleted along with an adjacent glycine (ΔG53K54) (Fig.4). Negative controls in this experiment were provided by a mutation leading to a stop codon in this region of the XRCC2 sequence and by the cloning vector alone. Each mutant gene was verified by sequencing and was then transfected into irs1 cells to assess the functional complementation. We initially used MMC survival to test the response of the mutated genes because XRCC2-deficient cells show an extreme sensitivity to this DNA-damaging agent. The ability to complement MMC sensitivity was first tested in the simple growth assay from a standard cell inoculum in 24-well plates (see “Experimental Procedures”). As seen in Table I, each of the mutants tested apart from the truncation showed little or no reduction in the ability to complement the MMC sensitivity of irs1 relative to the wild-type cDNA. To check that there was no loss of complementing ability by more stringent procedures, allowing for the cloning efficiency of each transfected cell population, multipoint survival curves were carried out with pooled clones for several of the mutants (Fig.5 A). It is seen that the K54A mutant shows little or no loss of complementing ability compared with the wild-type cDNA, whereas the ΔG53K54 mutant has a small but consistent reduction in this capacity.Figure 5Survival curves for V79, irs1, and irs1 cells transfected with different wild-type and mutant XRCC2cDNAs. A, mitomycin-C (mean and range of 2–3 experiments). B, x-rays (single experiments). wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To generalize our findings with MMC sensitivity, we tested some of the mutant XRCC2 genes for other responses. As expected the differential between wild-type and mutant XRCC2 genes was much less for x-rays than for MMC treatment (11Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and in this case the ΔG53K54 mutant showed no significant difference in sensitivity from the wild-type cDNA (Fig. 5 B). The loss of XRCC2 seriously influences genetic stability even when XRCC2-deficient cells are not exposed to exogenous DNA-damaging agents. We have shown previously that the spontaneous chromosome aberration frequency is high in irs1 cells but is restored to near normal levels in cells transfected with the XRCC2 cDNA (9Cartwright R. Tambini C.E. Simpson P.J. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consistent with the survival data, examination of the chromosomes of irs1 cells transfected with the different mutant forms of XRCC2 showed that the alteration or loss of the conserved glycine and lysine residues of the P-loop did not affect the ability of the gene to confer genetic stability (Table II).Table IIFrequencies of chromosomal aberrations in wild type V79, XRCC2-deficient irs1, and transfected derivatives of irs1Cell typeGapsBreaksExchangesTotal/cell 2-aNumbers in parentheses indicate percent.V79 2-bData from Cartwright et al. 1998 (9).

Open table in a new tab Repeat experiments assessing the damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation are shown in Fig. 6. In this assay, as was found for the mitomycin-C response, the K54A mutation does not show a significant difference from the wild-type cDNA, and the ΔG53K54 mutation shows only a small reduction in focus formation. We have found that the XRCC2 protein is located in the nucleus, which is consistent with a role in DNA metabolism. To test for the involvement of XRCC2 in repair by homologous recombination, as would be predicted from sequence homologies (7Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we measured the requirement for XRCC2 in damage-dependent RAD51-focus formation. RAD51 has been shown to be expressed in a cell cycle-dependent fashion with the majority of expression in S- and G2-phase cells (23Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 24Chen F. Nastasi A. Shen Z. Brenneman M. Crissman H. Chen D.J. Mutat.

Genet. 1996; 251: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies it has been established that some nuclear RAD51 foci will form in the S-phase of untreated somatic cells (21Tashiro S. Kotomura N. Shinohara A. Tanaka K. Ueda K. Kamada N. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar). However, the numbers of foci are substantially increased by treatment with DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, in a time- and dose-dependent manner (17Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 19Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M. Weichselbaum R.R. Shinohara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21482-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although experiments shielding some cells from irradiation (27Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) have suggested that RAD51 protein does not co-localize with sites of radiation damage, more recent studies using microbeams show that focus formation is spatially related to sites of damage in the nucleus of somatic cells (28Tashiro S. Walter J. Shinohara A. Kamada N. Cremer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Additionally, human RAD51 shows co-localization to sites of DNA damage as represented by single-stranded DNA (29Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and histone H2AX phosphorylation (30Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). V79 hamster cells showed extensive focus formation within 1 h of irradiation, and thereafter the number of foci/cell remained approximately constant. Very little RAD51 focus formation occurred in the XRCC2-deficient irs1 cells, although there was some evidence for a small increase with time. This small increase could be attributable to the accumulation of cells in S- and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3 A) because RAD51 is expressed primarily in these phases. In the irs1 cells, the XRCC2 transcript is shortened because of the loss of exon 2, 2C. Tambini and J. Thacker, unpublished data. and this will lead to a frameshift in the sequence, giving a predicted protein of only 33 amino acids (of which 13 are correct, compared with the full-length sequence of 278 amino acids). Therefore, this truncated XRCC2 protein is unlikely to have any normal activity. Additionally, we have shown that the loss of RAD51 focus formation in irs1 is specific to XRCC2 because the ectopic expression of full-length human XRCC2 restored normal levels of foci following irradiation. The XRCC2 protein has few identifiable motifs to give clues on function except for the proposed ATP binding boxes. As noted in the Introduction, the conserved Walker A box (or P-loop) is characteristic of all members of the RecA/RAD51 family. However, we found that the substitution of highly conserved residues in the P-loop has little effect on the ability of XRCC2 to complement a number of end points when introduced into the irs1 line, including survival in response to MMC or x-rays and genetic instability. Even in the case of the ΔG53K54 mutation, which deletes two key residues within the Walker box A motif, there was only a small negative effect relative to wild-type cDNA when measured by mitomycin-C response (Fig.5 A) and focus formation (Fig. 6). We especially targeted the lysine residue in our XRCC2 mutations because this site is conserved in all NTP-binding proteins with the P-loop motif (31Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). In ATPases the conserved lysine is probably important to the conformation of the P-loop and for direct interaction with the β- and γ-phosphates of the bound ATP. Consistent with this degree of conservation, the mutation of this residue in ATP-binding proteins generally compromises function. This is certainly true for Escherichia coli RecA for which even the relatively conservative K72R mutation gives a null phenotype (32Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) although the mutant protein retains the ability to promote homologous pairing of DNA strands (33Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Rad51p altered at this P-loop lysine similarly has a compromised function; the K191A mutation gives a null phenotype, whereas K191R has a partially defective phenotype (34Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In human RAD51, again a conservative mutation of this lysine residue (K133R) gives a protein capable of partially restoring function in chick RAD51-defective cells, whereas the nonconservative K133A mutation cannot restore function (35Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, our finding that such mutations do not lead to a compromise of XRCC2 function is perhaps surprising, although not without precedent. Mutation of the P-loop lysine in the S. cerevisiae RAD51-like protein Rad57p, even to a nonconservative change (K133A), does not affect its function in DNA recombination repair. In contrast Rad55p, the yeast RAD51-like protein, which forms a heterodimer with Rad57p, does require an intact lysine residue in the P-loop motif for function (36Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, similarly to Rad55p/Rad57p, XRCC2 forms a heterodimer with another human RAD51-like protein, RAD51L3, and that RAD51L3 has significant DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (37Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 37: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It seems likely therefore that in both yeast and humans, only one of the partners in RAD51-like protein heterodimers retains the ATP binding requirement. In recent studies there are a number of precedents for this type of “functional asymmetry” in protein complexes that affect repair and recombination processes. For example, the ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease complex in Bacillus subtilis possesses two ATP binding sequences. The mutation of the lysine residue in the AddA subunit drastically affects function, whereas the identical mutation in the AddB subunit has only marginal effects (38Haijema B.J. Noback M. Hesseling A. Kooistra J. Venema G. Meima R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly there is evidence that the partner proteins of heterodimers involved in DNA mismatch repair, such as MSH2 and MSH6, make different contributions to ATPase activity (39Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The equivalent mismatch repair protein in E. coli, MutS, forms homodimers, but even in this case there is evidence from recent crystal structure analysis that the partners do not participate equally in the ATP binding reaction (40Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). This asymmetry may promote conformational changes that assist further reactions such as DNA binding. It will be interesting to see whether other mammalian RAD51-like proteins, some of which are proposed to interact as dimers or in higher-order complexes (16Schild D. Lio Y. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16443-16449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), have a similar functional divergence. Our results with XRCC2 support the evolutionary conservation of function in RAD51-like proteins from yeast to man. For meiotic recombination in yeast, Rad55p and Rad57p are required for RAD51 focus formation (41Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2208-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and purified Rad55p/Rad57p heterodimer has been shown to facilitate the loading of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA coated with replication protein A (5Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The XRCC2/RAD51L3 heterodimer in mammalian cells may act in a similar manner to Rad55p/Rad57p. However, the process is likely to be more complex in mammalian cells, which include several additional RAD51-like proteins (7Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that interact to form heterodimers and possibly larger complexes (5Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 16Schild D. Lio Y. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 37: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins have also been shown to be required for RAD51 focus formation, namely XRCC3 in mammalian cells (19Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M. Weichselbaum R.R. Shinohara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21482-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and RAD51L1 in chick cells (42Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Fukushima T. Morrison C. Albala J.S. Swagemakers S.M. Kanaar R. Thompson L.H. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6476-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Despite their apparent facilitating function, it is clear that the RAD51-like proteins have an important part to play in mammalian development because in the case of XRCC2 (43Deans B. Griffin C.S. Maconochie M. Thacker J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6675-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar),RAD51L1 (44Shu Z. Smith S. Wang L. Rice M.C. Kmiec E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8686-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and RAD51L3 (45Pittman D.L. Schimenti J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2044155445,"Plasmalogens contain a vinyl ether bond linking the sn-1 aliphatic chain to the glycerol backbone of this predominant phospholipid molecular subclass, which is found in many mammalian tissues. The present study demonstrates that the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens is a molecular target of the reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase. Analysis by thin layer chromatography revealed that reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase target the vinyl ether bond of the plasmalogen, lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine), resulting in the production of a neutral lipid. Capillary gas chromatographic analyses demonstrated that the neutral lipid generated from lysoplasmenylcholine was neither hexadecanal nor did it contain masked hexadecanal (i.e. the vinyl ether) because the dimethyl acetal of hexadecanal produced by acid methanolysis derivatization was no longer present. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the myeloperoxidase-generated neutral lipid product was consistent with the production of a 16-carbon fatty aldehyde containing one chlorine atom. Furthermore, proton NMR analysis indicated that this neutral lipid product was a 2-chloro-fatty aldehyde. Additional structural analysis of this neutral lipid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the underivatized product as well as its pentafluorobenzyl oxime-derivative product was consistent with the neutral lipid being 2-chlorohexadecanal. The reactive chlorinating species, hypochlorous acid and chlorine gas, both attacked the vinyl ether bond of lysoplasmenylcholine resulting in the production of 2-chlorohexadecanal. The production of 2-chlorohexadecanal was dependent on the presence of the plasmalogen masked aldehyde (i.e. the vinyl ether) in the substrate because the free fatty aldehyde, hexadecanal, was not converted to 2-chlorohexadecanal by the reactive chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase. Taken together, the present studies demonstrate for the first time the targeting of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by the reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase resulting in the production of novel chlorinated fatty aldehydes.

The activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase during the respiratory burst results in the production of superoxide anions that dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide. Myeloperoxidase, which is released by activated neutrophils, amplifies the oxidizing potential of hydrogen peroxide by using it as a substrate in the presence of physiological concentrations of chloride to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and its conjugate base (ClO−), which are the predominant oxidants produced by activated neutrophils (3Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxic reactions mediated by hypochlorous acid include the chlorination of amines and unsaturated lipids as well as oxidative bleaching of heme groups and iron sulfur centers (4Weiss S.J.

Additionally, hypochlorous acid can react with primary amines to produce another group of chlorinating intermediates, the chloramines (R-NHCl) (9Lampert M.B. Weiss S.J. Blood. 1983; 62: 645-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorine gas has also been shown to be released from activated neutrophils and to contribute to many of the chlorination reactions previously attributed to hypochlorous acid (10Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, phagocytes release an arsenal of reactive chlorinating and oxidizing species, which include HOCl, ClO−, Cl2, and chloramines. Lipids are major targets of the reactive chlorinating species produced by activated phagocytes. For example, the chlorinating agents released by activated neutrophils attack the unsaturated C=C bonds within the aliphatic chains of phospholipids (6Winterbourn C.C. van den Berg J.J. Roitman E. Kuypers F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Formation of chlorohydrins within the aliphatic groups of phospholipids are disruptive to normal membrane fluid molecular dynamics and could represent a major cytotoxic effect of activated neutrophils (11Sepe S.M.

Additionally, reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase chlorinate lipoprotein-associated cholesterol lead to the production of a family of chlorinated cholesterol species including chlorohydrins and dichlorinated products (13Hazen S.L.

Many mammalian tissues are enriched with plasmalogen phospholipid molecular species in their plasma membrane phospholipid pools (14Post J.A. Verkleij A.J. Roelofsen B. Op de Kamp J.A.

Plasmalogens possess a masked aldehyde, vinyl ether linkage between thesn-1 aliphatic chain and the glycerol backbone and may have an important role in both the solvation of transmembrane ion channels and transport proteins (19Zeng Y.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7442-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although plasmalogenase activities have been reported that are responsible for the degradation of the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond, this bond is relatively stable to enzymatic degradation (26Arthur G. Page L. Mock T. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27McMaster C.R. Lu C.Q. Choy P.C. Lipids. 1992; 27: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens may be susceptible to chemical degradation in vivo. For example, the vinyl ether linkage of plasmalogens terminates the propagation of the production of lipid free radicals initiated by reactive oxygen species attacking aliphatic alkenes of phospholipids (28Zoeller R.A. Morand O.H. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11590-11596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Morand O.H. Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11597-11606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmalogens, which are localized in the plasma membranes of mammalian cells (17Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), likely would be highly accessible molecular targets of the membrane-permeable, reactive chlorinating species generated by activated phagocytes. Accordingly, the present study tested the hypothesis that the vinyl ether of the sn-1 aliphatic chain of plasmalogens would be susceptible to chlorination by reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase. The results herein demonstrate for the first time that reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase are reactive with the masked aldehyde, vinyl ether linkage of plasmalogens resulting in the production of lysophospholipids and α-chloro-fatty aldehydes (see Scheme FSI). Furthermore, the production of α-chloro-fatty aldehydes by reactive chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase is specific for the masked aldehyde found in plasmalogens and is not produced from free fatty aldehydes or carboxy ester-linked aliphatic groups found at thesn-2 carbon of the plasmalogen glycerol backbone. Chloride-free sodium hypochlorite was prepared in chlorine-demand free and chloride-free glassware by a modification of a method described previously (13Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Duffin K. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23080-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The concentration of sodium hypochlorite was determined spectrophotometrically (ε292= 350 m−1 cm−1) (31Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Sodium hypochlorite was immediately used for the experiments. Myeloperoxidase was purchased from Calbiochem. Pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine was purchased from Aldrich. Hexadecanoyl chloride was purchased from Nu-Chek Prep. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from either Aldrich, Sigma, or Fisher. The lysoplasmenylcholine molecular species, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC,1was prepared from bovine heart lecithin and purified as described previously (32Han X.L. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasmenylcholine was synthesized by an anhydrous reaction utilizing 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC and hexadecanoyl chloride as precursors with dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst and was purified as described previously (32Han X.L. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Synthetically prepared plasmenylcholine and lysoplasmenylcholine were determined to be greater than 95% pure by thin layer chromatography, straight phase HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC, and capillary gas chromatography of the aliphatic constituents. Lysoplasmenylcholine and 16:0–16:0 plasmenylcholine were quantified by capillary gas chromatography. Incubations were performed in chlorine-demand-free and chloride-free reaction vessels. In a typical assay 200 or 300 nmol of either lysoplasmenylcholine or plasmenylcholine was incubated in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline comprised of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaPO4, 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 4.0–7.0) in the presence or the absence of the indicated amounts of myeloperoxidase, H2O2, chlorine gas, or chloride-free sodium hypochlorite for the indicated intervals at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol, and the reaction products were extracted into chloroform by the method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated by TLC utilizing silica gel 60Å plates (Whatman) and a mobile phase comprised of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1 v/v/v) for the separation of neutral lipids. Alternatively, polar lipid reaction products were separated by TLC utilizing silica gel 60 Å plates (Whatman) and a mobile phase comprised of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (6:8:2:2:1 v/v/v/v/v). The reaction products on TLC plates containing an aldehyde or a masked aldehyde were visualized by charring concentrated sulfuric acid-treated plates. In some cases, reaction products or TLC-purified reaction products were extracted from silica by a modified Bligh and Dyer technique (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). TLC-purified reaction products were then either subjected to inorganic phosphate analysis (34Dittmer J.C. Wells M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 482-530Crossref Scopus (431) Google Scholar) or capillary gas chromatography following their derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine (see below) or methanolic HCl. Acid methanolysis-derivatized products were subjected to capillary gas chromatography utilizing a Supelco SP-2330 column under conditions and detected by FID as described previously (35Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1662-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GC-MS was performed on reaction products or TLC-purified reaction products either directly or following derivatization with acidic methanol or pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine. In brief, derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine was performed by resuspending the reaction products in 100 μl of ethanol followed by the addition of 100 μl of 6 mg/ml pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine in water. The ethanolic-water mixture was vortexed for 5 min at room temperature and allowed to further incubate at room temperature for an additional 25 min. The reaction products were extracted into cyclohexane/diethyl ether (4:1 v/v) and resuspended in 30–100 μl of petroleum ether prior to GC-MS analysis. The samples were analyzed on a DB-1 column (12.5 m, 0.2-mm inner diameter, 0.33-μm methyl silicone film coating; P. J. Cobert, St. Louis, MO) utilizing a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph. The injector temperature and the transfer lines were maintained at 250 °C. The GC oven was maintained at 150 °C for 1 min and increased at a rate of 30 °C/min to 270 °C. The oven temperature was held at 270 °C for an additional 2 min. All spectra were acquired on a Hewlett Packard 5988A mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) and operated in the negative chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. The source temperature was set at 150 °C. The electron energy was 240 eV, and the emission current was 300 μA. The reaction products from the treatment of lysoplasmenylcholine with reactive chlorinating species generated by the myeloperoxidase system were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method, resuspended in methanol/chloroform (2:1 v/v), and injected into a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface (Finnigan, TSQ-7000) at a flow rate of 1 μl/min in the presence of 2 nmol/μl of sodium hydroxide. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed by passage of the mass selected precursor ion from the first quadrupole into the collision cell (typically collision energies were ∼35 eV). Typically, spectra were averaged 3–5 min and processed utilizing ICIS software (Finnigan). Ions were monitored in both the positive and negative ion mode. Structurally informative ions were observed in the negative ion mode. Proton NMR spectrometry and analyses were performed at ambient temperature in CDCl3 using a Varian Unity 300 spectrometer (7.05T). 1H shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane. It was predicted that the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens represents a molecular target of the reactive chlorine species generated by myeloperoxidase that are produced during phagocyte activation. This hypothesis was first tested by incubating lysoplasmenylcholine with myeloperoxidase in phosphate-buffered saline containing hydrogen peroxide. TLC analysis of the reaction products revealed that lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC) was degraded in the presence of myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and phosphate-buffered saline (pH 4.0) (Fig.1, Solvent System 2). Concomitant with lysoplasmenylcholine degradation, a neutral lipid was produced that migrated with an Rf of 0.46 in a solvent system that resolves neutral lipids (Fig. 1, Solvent System 1). This neutral lipid did not co-migrate with either hexadecanal (Rf = 0.57) or fatty acid (Rf = 0.18, 0.19, and 0.20 for palmitic, palmitoleic, and arachidonic acid, respectively) in this TLC system. The degradation of plasmalogens was dependent on the presence of a complete reaction mixture comprised of active myeloperoxidase (thermal treatment ablated plasmalogen degradation), hydrogen peroxide, and sodium chloride (Fig. 1). Additionally, the degradation of plasmalogens by the complete myeloperoxidase reaction mixture occurred at pH 4.0 with little degradation at pH 7.0. Similar studies were performed utilizing the plasmenylcholine molecular species, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-hexadecanoyl-GPC, as the target phospholipid of the reactive chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase. TLC analysis of the reaction products of this reaction demonstrated that plasmenylcholine was degraded (Fig.2, Solvent System 2) concomitant with the production of a neutral lipid that again migrated with an Rf of 0.46 (Fig. 2, Solvent System 1). Similar to lysoplasmenylcholine degradation, the degradation of plasmenylcholine was dependent on the presence of the complete myeloperoxidase system at pH 4.0. Further analyses revealed that the reaction products that were separated by TLC utilizing solvent system 2 also included lysophosphatidylcholine. For these analyses, silica corresponding to the region that lysophosphatidylcholine migrates on the TLC plates was scraped and extracted. The presence of lysophosphatidylcholine in the extract from this silica was confirmed by the presence of phosphate as determined by a Bartlett phosphate assay (Fig. 3) and a palmitic acid residue as determined by the detection of the methyl ester of palmitic acid by capillary GC analysis following acid methanolysis (Fig. 3,inset B). It should be appreciated that the sulfuric acid-charring detection method employed in these TLC analyses detects aldehydes and masked aldehydes but does not readily detect lysophosphatidylcholine. Taken together, these results demonstrate the specificity of the attack of the vinyl ether-linked aliphatic group of plasmalogens by myeloperoxidase-generated reactive chlorinating species.Figure 3Analysis of TLC-purified lysophosphatidylcholine produced by myeloperoxidase treatment of plasmenylcholine. 200 nmol of plasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence of the MPO/HOCl generating reagents including MPO (2.5 units), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaCl (100 mm) in 500 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) at 37 °C for 5 min. The incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and the reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (6:8:2:2:1 v/v/v/v/v) as mobile phase. The reaction products on developed TLC plates were visualized by sulfuric acid treatment and charring (inset A). In parallel studies silica from the developed TLC plate was zonally scraped, as indicated (inset A), and TLC resolved reaction products were analyzed for inorganic phosphate and aliphatic groups (inset B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For capillary GC analysis, the indicated peak (FAME of palmitic acid) had an identical retention time with that of authentic FAME of palmitic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The TLC-purified neutral lipid reaction product from the myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of plasmalogens was further characterized by capillary gas chromatography. Capillary gas chromatography of the acid methanolysis-derivatives of lysoplasmenylcholine treated with reactive chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase resulted in the production of a unique acid methanolysis-derivative product with an Rtvalue of 9.3 min (Fig. 4 B,peak 3). In contrast, the dimethyl acetal of hexadecanal (Rt = 5.6 min; Fig. 4 A, peak 2) was the only acid methanolysis-derivative of untreated lysoplasmenylcholine (i.e. not treated with the myeloperoxidase-generated reactive chlorinating species). Furthermore, acid methanolysis and subsequent capillary gas chromatography of the TLC-purified neutral lipid (e.g. Rf = 0.46 in Fig. 1, Solvent System 1) demonstrated that this lipid gave rise to the acid methanolysis product with anRt of 9.3 min (Fig. 4 C, peak 3). Further studies demonstrated that this product of the myeloperoxidase reaction was only produced from vinyl ether containing lipids (i.e. plasmenylcholine and lysoplasmenylcholine) and was not produced from lysophosphatidylcholine or hexadecanal (Fig.5). This later finding that hexadecanal was not chlorinated by myeloperoxidase-generated reactive chlorinating species, in contrast to plasmalogens, underscores the specificity of the targeting of the masked aldehyde, vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by reactive chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase. The data shown in Fig. 5 also demonstrate the specificity for the attack of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by chemical treatments with the initial product of myeloperoxidase, hypochlorous acid, as well as chlorine gas (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, it is likely that the chemical mediators of plasmalogen degradation generated by the myeloperoxidase reaction are hypochlorous acid and/or chlorine gas.Figure 5Chemical and enzymic treatments of plasmenylcholine, lysoplasmenylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and palmitaldehyde. The indicated lipids (200 nmol) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 20 mm phosphate buffer with either no further additions (A), 1.5 units of myeloperoxidase (with 1 mm H2O2 and 100 mmNaCl) (B), 4.16 mm NaOCl (C), or 4.16 mm Cl2 (D). The reactions were terminated with the addition of methanol. The lipids were extracted and subjected to acid methanolysis, and the acid methanolysis-derivatives were subjected to capillary gas chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peaks 1, 2,3, and 4 are the solvent, the dimethyl acetal of hexadecanal, the fatty acid methyl ester of palmitic acid, and the unknown derivatized reaction product, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of the degradation of plasmalogens by myeloperoxidase-generated reactive chlorinating species was further assessed in reactions that included the inhibitors sodium azide, catalase, and 3-amino triazole. Sodium azide, catalase, and 3-amino triazole inhibited myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of the vinyl ether bond (Fig. 6). Additionally, the specificity of the reaction of the myeloperoxidase-generated reactive chlorine species toward the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens was demonstrated because destruction of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by treatment with hydrochloric acid fumes for 10 min ablated the production of the myeloperoxidase-mediated neutral lipid product (Fig. 6). Because the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrated differential degradation of plasmalogens at pH 4.0 and 7.0, the pH dependence of this reaction was further characterized utilizing lysoplasmenylcholine as the vinyl ether substrate. The breakdown of the vinyl ether linkage by the complete myeloperoxidase chlorinating system was optimal at acidic pH but was significantly active at pH 6.0 with half-maximal activity at pH 5.5 (Fig. 7). Because hypochlorous acid is the initial product of myeloperoxidase and because chlorine gas can be produced from hypochlorous acid at acidic pH (10Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), further experiments were performed to determine whether molar equivalents of NaOCl or chlorine gas could mimic the degradation of lysoplasmenylcholine by the reactive-chlorinating species generated by myeloperoxidase. The data shown in Fig. 8demonstrate that, at neutral pH, NaOCl and chlorine gas degrade plasmalogens resulting in the production of the same neutral lipid produced by the myeloperoxidase reaction toward plasmalogen.Figure 8NaOCl and Cl2 gas treatment of lysoplasmenylcholine. Lysoplasmenylcholine (200 nmol) was incubated 30 s at 37 °C in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with the indicated concentrations of NaOCl or Cl2 gas. The reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol and lipids were extracted. The extracts were derivatized by acid methanolysis in the presence of 1-hexadecanoyl-GPC (internal standard) and subjected to capillary gas chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mass of the product formed was calculated by comparing the integrated areas of the peak derived from plasmalogen degradation (i.e. peak 3 of Fig. 4, Rt ≅ 9.3 min) with that of the internal standard. The values are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initial structural information on the neutral lipid produced from lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reaction was procured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The chloroform extract of the reaction products was subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode, which revealed a negative ion atm/z of 273 as well as another negative ion atm/z 275, which had an intensity one-third that of the ion at m/z 273 (Fig.9 A). The 3:1 ratio of ions atm/z 273 and m/z 275 is indicative that the reaction product contains chlorine because the natural isotopic abundance of 35Cl to 37Cl is 3:1, which results in monochlorinated compounds characteristically demonstrating an isotopic cluster of 3:1 at M− and M− + 2. The negative ion at m/z 273 was subjected to daughter ion analysis, which clearly demonstrated that this compound contained 35Cl (Fig. 9 B). Based on the molecular ions produced by electrospray ionization, it was likely that the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed degradation of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens resulted in the production of a monochlorinated hexadecanal species. The underivatized product of the myeloperoxidase reaction with lysoplasmenylcholine was also subjected to GC-MS with electron impact ionization. A single peak was found at 7.25 min that had an apparent parent ion m/z= 274 with an associated ion approximately one-third the size atm/z = 276 (Fig.10), which was consistent with the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data.Figure 10Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the lysoplasmenylcholine/myeloperoxidase reaction product.Lysoplasmenylcholine (200 nmol) was incubated in the presence of the MPO/HOCl generating system, which includes MPO (0.6 unit), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaCl (100 mm) in 300 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) at 37 °C for 5 min. The incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and the reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TLC-purified material having anRf of 0.5 was dried and resuspended in petroleum ether prior to GC-MS with electron impact ionization as describe under “Experimental Procedures.” The ions and ion fragments (the mass spectrum) of the major peak eluting at 7.25 min are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further structural information of the putative monochlorinated hexadecanal species produced from plasmalogens by reactive chlorinating species was obtained by proton NMR analyses as well as GC-MS analyses. The NMR data shown in Fig. 11demonstrate that the most likely structure of the TLC-purified reaction product is 2-chlorohexadecanal. In particular, the aldehyde proton (Fig. 11, arrowhead e) is split by its sole neighboring proton, the proton on the α-carbon, and there is a downfield shift of the chlorinated methylene that is split by three neighboring protons (Fig. 11, arrowhead d). There is also a shift in the methylene groups neighboring the chlorinated methylene group (Fig. 11,arrowhead c). Because the likely chlorinated reaction product of the myeloperoxidase reaction with plasmalogens contains an aldehyde carbonyl, the carbonyl-reactive derivatization agent, pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine, was used to produce the pentafluorobenzyl oxime of the aldehyde for GC-MS analyses. This derivatization is very useful because of the excellent electron capturing properties of the pentafluorobenzyl group and the characteristic fragmentation patterns that are observed by subjecting pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) oxime-derivatives to capillary gas chromatography with negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. GC-MS analyses on a DB-1 column in the negative ion mode of the PFB oxime-derivative of the reaction product from incubations of lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) with myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and NaCl resulted in the production of two peaks consistent with the production of thesyn- and anti-isomers of the PFB oxime-derivative of 2-chlorohexadecanal (Fig. 12,A and C). The fragmentation pattern of the second peak is shown in Fig. 12 B. The molecular ion (M−) of the PFB oxime of 2-chlorohexadecanal is observed at m/z 469 (Fig. 12 B). Again, monochlorination of this compound was confirmed by identifying the isotopic cluster (M−/M− + 2 of 3:1 atm/z 469 and 471). One of the major fragments atm/z 288 is also monochlorinated, because an ion of one-third the intensity was also observed atm/z 290. It should be recognized that the remaining fragmentation pattern is completely consistent with the structure of the 2-chlorohexadecanal PFB-derivative shown in Fig.12 C. Taken together, these data, in conjunction with that from electrospray ionization mass spectroscopic analyses, demonstrate that 2-chlorohexadecanal is the product of myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of the vinyl ether bond of the plasmalogen, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.Figure 12Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the pentafluorobenzyl oxime-derivative of the lysoplasmenylcholine/myeloperoxidase reaction product.Lysoplasmenylcholine (200 nmol) was incubated in the presence of the MPO/HOCl generating system, which includes MPO (0.6 unit), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaCl (100 mm) in 300 μl of phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) at 37 °C for 5 min.

Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1978: 447-451Google Scholar). The combination of hydrogen peroxide production and the release of myeloperoxidase by the activated neutrophils results in the production of hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the predominant cytotoxic agent produced by the activated neutrophils and is in equilibrium with the production of chlorine gas, which is favored under acidic conditions (10Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both cholesterol and the unsaturated aliphatic groups of phospholipids are targets of these reactive chlorinating species produced by activated neutrophils through the action of myeloperoxidase (13Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Duffin K. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23080-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the present study, the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond has been shown to be a target of the reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase resulting in the release of an α-chloro-fatty aldehyde from the aliphatic chain attached to the sn-1 position of the plasmalogen glycerol backbone (Scheme FSI). Several lines of evidence confirmed that the α-chloro-fatty aldehyde, 2-chlorohexadecanal, was produced from the attack on the vinyl ether bond of the plasmalogen 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC by reactive chlorinating species. First, utilizing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode two molecular ions were observed at the predicted mass (m − 1) of 2-chlorohexadecanal. These ions at m/z 273 andm/z 275 were present at a 3:1 ratio, which is a signature for a monochlorinated compound because of the 3:1 natural abundance of 35Cl and 37Cl, respectively. Additionally, mass-mass analysis of the m/z 273 ion demonstrated the presence of 35Cl atm/z 35. A similar 3:1 ratio was also observed when the underivatized product of myeloperoxidase treatment of lysoplasmenylcholine was subjected to GC-MS analysis utilizing electron impact ionization (m/z = 274 and 276). Second, proton NMR analysis provided additional structural information including the presence of an aldehyde as well as α-chlorination. Finally, derivatization of the neutral lipid with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine followed by GC-MS analysis with negative chemical ionization was consistent with the derivatization of 2-chlorohexadecanal to its pentafluorobenzyl oxime. Taken together, analyses by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, proton NMR, and GC-MS have provided structural information to determine that 2-chlorohexadecanal is produced from myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of the plasmalogen, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC. Myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of plasmalogens also results in the production of lysophospholipids including lysophosphatidylcholine (Scheme FSI). The myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of plasmalogens represents a unique mechanism to generate lysophospholipids that is independent of the action of phospholipases. The production of lysophospholipids with an acyl group at the sn-2 position likely would be short-lived either because of esterification at thesn-1 position utilizing acyl CoA or because of nonenzymic acyl migration of the sn-2 position aliphatic group to thesn-1 position followed by esterification at thesn-2 position utilizing acyl CoA or a fatty acid donated from a phospholipid mediated by the activation of a transacylase (37Venable M.E. Nieto M.L. Schmitt J.D. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18691-18698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The net effect of the acylation of monoacyl lysophospholipid produced from plasmalogen represents a biochemical mechanism for the conversion of plasmalogens to diacyl phospholipids. Alternatively, if appreciable amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine accumulate, it likely could have profound effects on the host cell because multiple physiological functions have been attributed to the production and accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine in cells, including the activation of several protein kinases, the induction of arrhythmias in the heart, and the inhibition of membrane transport proteins (38Sasaki Y.

Plasmalogens are considered to be antioxidants because the vinyl ether bond is susceptible to attack by oxidants but terminates rather than propagates oxidation (28Zoeller R.A. Morand O.H. Raetz C.R.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11597-11606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the present study suggests that plasmalogens might promote the cytotoxic potential of phagocytic cells through a mechanism that involves both the loss of plasma membrane plasmalogens and the production of bioactive lysophospholipids as well as potentially reactive α-chloro-fatty aldehydes (Scheme FSI). Whereas plasmalogens can terminate the cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species, it is possible that they may target the cytotoxicity of the reactive chlorinating species, hypochlorous acid, to the plasma membrane leading to the production of α-chloro-fatty aldehydes that themselves may be cytotoxic. On the other hand, it is possible that plasmalogens may serve as protective agents to the host cell if they effectively quench hypochlorous acid and prevent it from interacting with other targets such as proteins and nucleic acids, which could potentially lead to greater damage to the host cell. Whether plasmalogen degradation in host cell plasma membranes via attack by reactive chorinating species is ultimately deleterious or advantageous to the host cell remains to be resolved."
https://openalex.org/W2050380620,"Abstract We have recently demonstrated that a 37-amino acid peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity via pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive Gi protein. In the present studies, we have used seven different peptide fragments of the cytoplasmic domain of the NPR-C receptor with complete, partial, or no Gi activator sequence to examine their effects on adenylyl cyclase activity. The peptides used were KKYRITIERRNH (peptide 1), RRNHQEESNIGK (peptide 2), HRELREDSIRSH (peptide 3), RRNHQEESNIGKHRELR (peptide 4), QEESNIGK (peptide X), ITIERRNH (peptide Y), and ITIYKKRRNHRE (peptide Z). Peptides 1, 3, and 4 have complete Gi activator sequences, whereas peptides 2 and Y have partial Gi activator sequences with truncated carboxyl or amino terminus, respectively. Peptide X has no structural specificity, whereas peptide Z is the scrambled peptide control for peptide 1. Peptides 1, 3, and 4 inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner with apparentK i between 0.1 and 1 nm; however, peptide 2 inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity with a higherK i of about 10 nm, and peptides X, Y, and Z were unable to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. The maximal inhibitions observed were between 30 and 40%. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by peptides 1–4 was absolutely dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides and was completely attenuated by PT treatment. In addition, the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol, glucagon, and forskolin on adenylyl cyclase activity were inhibited to different degrees by these peptides. These results suggest that the small peptide fragments of the cytoplasmic domain of the NPR-C receptor containing 12 or 17 amino acids were sufficient to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity through a PT-sensitive Gi protein. The peptides having complete structural specificity of Giactivator sequences at both amino and carboxyl termini were more potent to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity as compared with the peptides having a truncated carboxyl terminus, whereas the truncation of the amino-terminal motif completely attenuates adenylyl cyclase inhibition."

In recent years, however, it has become evident that certain cellular polytopic proteins exhibit variations in biogenesis such that two or more distinct topological orientations are generated (3Hedge R.S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have been observed to be expressed in alternate topological forms with the diversity apparently generated at the time of translocation at the ER membrane. Because different orientations seem to serve different functions (6Dunlop J. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,8Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) L envelope protein with its pre-S domain plays vital roles in the viral life cycle by mediating receptor binding during host cell attachment, by performing a matrix-like function in nucleocapsid envelopment, and by exerting various regulatory functions (14Bruss V. Vieluf K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hildt E. Saher G. Bruss V. Hofschneider P.H.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2052-2057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multifunctional nature of L depends on its dual transmembrane topology that is established after the completion of polypeptide synthesis via an as yet uncharacterized mechanism (9Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Ganem D.

Upon biogenesis, L as well as two closely related homologues, the middle (M) and small (S) envelope proteins, are expressed from a single open reading frame of the viral genome by means of three different start codons that are spaced at intervals of 108 (or 119, depending on subtype) and 55 codons. Therefore, the 226-amino acid sequence of S is repeated at the C termini of M and L, which carry the additional pre-S2 domain or pre-S2 and pre-S1 domains, respectively (Fig. 1 A) (17Nassal M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 297-337PubMed Google Scholar). All three proteins are cotranslationally integrated into the ER membrane, likely directed by the action of a signal(anchor) and a stop-transfer sequence encoded within the first and second transmembrane (TM) segments (TM1 and TM2) of their S domains (18Eble B.E. MacRae D.R. Lingappa V.R. Ganem D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Prange R. Nagel R. Streeck R.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5832-5841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two further membrane-spanning segments are predicted in the C-terminal third of the S domain (Fig. 1 B) (20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H. Intervirology. 1995; 38: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Howard C.R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); it has not been established whether these putative TM3 and TM4 segments contain topogenic information. In contrast, the hydrophilic pre-S1 and pre-S2 domains have been shown to lack any signal sequence activity (11Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Ganem D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Eble B.E. Lingappa V.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, M and L are translocated into the ER membrane by the proximal signals of their S domains that also govern cotranslational translocation of the upstream pre-S2 region of M into the ER lumen (Fig. 1 B) (11Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Ganem D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Eble B.E. Lingappa V.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the pre-S2 plus pre-S1 (pre-S) domain of L fails to be translocated and thus faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane in nascent chains. During maturation, approximately half of the L molecules post-translationally translocate the pre-S region into the microsomal vesicle lumen, thereby generating a dual topology that is maintained in the secreted virion envelope (Fig. 1 B) (9Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Ganem D.

By disposing the pre-S domain either at a cytosolic (i.e. inside the virus) or luminal (i.e. outside the virus) location, L seems to serve its topological conflicting functions such as capsid envelopment and receptor binding, respectively. In search for the mechanism(s) leading to this highly unconventional split mixed topology and the cellular factors involved, we previously identified the pre-S1-specific amino acid (aa) sequence 70–94 of L as a bona fide translocation control region, because deletion of this sequence leads to cotranslational pre-S translocation and a uniform topology (23Löffler-Mary H. Werr M Prange R. Virology. 1997; 235: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This sequence specifically mediates the binding of L to the cognate heat shock protein Hsc70 (23Löffler-Mary H. Werr M Prange R. Virology. 1997; 235: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting this chaperone to be responsible for the repression of cotranslational pre-S translocation while simultaneously keeping the trapped pre-S domain in a configuration competent for post-translational reorientation. How the hydrophilic pre-S domain traverses the lipid bilayer is still unknown, but it is postulated to occur through the complexing of HBV-envelope subunits into an aqueous channel (10Guo J.-T Pugh J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H. Intervirology. 1995; 38: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Stirk H.J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2455-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The formation of such a membrane channel has been proposed to depend on dimerization of S, M, and/or L chains concomitant with lateral interactions between their three amphipathic TM1, TM3, and TM4 segments, which pack together thereby shielding their hydrophilic faces from the lipid (20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H. Intervirology. 1995; 38: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Howard C.R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). According to computer modeling, such a channel, if being composed of six TM helices, could reach a diameter of 1.5 nm (20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H.

In this study, we explored structural and compartmental requirements of the post-translational pre-S translocation of L with special regard to the hypothetical HBV-specific channel serving as a potential pre-S conduit. The mammalian expression vector carrying the HBV L gene (pNI2.L) under the transcriptional control of the human metallothionein IIA promoter has been described (12Prange R. Streeck R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For epitope tagging, an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYASL) was fused in frame to the C terminus of L by site-directed mutagenesis using a recombinant M13mp19.HBV bacteriophage and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GTTTTGTTAGGGTTTATAAGCTAGCGTAATCGGTAAATCGTATGGGTAA CATATGTACCCAAAG-3′. Simultaneously, an NdeI restriction site was introduced upstream of the HA tag to enable subsequent cloning steps (in the primer sequence, the HA-specific sequence is underlined, and mismatches caused by the engineered NdeI site are in boldface). The resulting HA-tagged L gene was employed for ectopic protein expression and further plasmid constructions. To sequentially delete TM segments from the C terminus of L, two mutants were constructed by excising a BamHI (nucleotide (nt) position 470, as referred to the HBV genome, subtype ayw)-NdeI (nt 830) fragment, or a BssHII (nt 387)-NdeI (nt 830) fragment from pNI2.L. After appropriate modification of the ends, plasmid DNAs were religated, thereby generating pNI2.LΔTM3/4 and pNI2.LΔTM2/3/4, respectively, that lacked either the last two or three TM segments. For the in-frame deletion of TM1, a StyI (nt 180)-XbaI (nt 249) fragment was removed in mutant LΔTM1. The precise deletion of TM2 (LΔTM2) was achieved by M13 mutagenesis with two antisense oligonucleotides, 5′-GAAGATGATTAATCGCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-TGATAGTCGACAGGTACCAACAAG-3′ (restriction sites are underlined, and mismatches are in boldface), that introduced an AseI (nt 395) and a HincII (nt 450) restriction site at the 5′ and 3′ borders of TM2, respectively, and subsequent removal of the AseI-HincII fragment. Mutant LΔTM1/3/4 was generated by replacing anMscI (nt 2972)-MscI (nt 305) fragment of plasmid pNI2.LΔTM3/4 by the correspondingly fragment of pNI2.LΔTM1. To substitute TM segments by foreign hydrophobic domains, a hybrid protein was constructed that carried the pre-S domain fused to the N-terminal half of the M envelope protein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV). Therefore, an NdeI site was introduced at codon positions 81/82 of the MHV M gene, present in plasmid pTZ19R-M (a generous gift from P. J. M. Rottier), by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the primer 5′-AAATCCAAGATACATATGATTTAGCGC-3′ together with the primer 5′-ACTCTAGAGGATCCCTCGAGGAAATCT-3′, annealing to the 5′-noncoding region of the M gene. The polymerase chain reaction product obtained was then used to replace theXhoI (nt 127)-NdeI (nt 830) fragment of plasmid pNI2.L, generating the construct pNI2.L::MHV that encoded the first 155 aa of L, an 8-residue spacer (SRKSNPNI), and the N-terminal 82 aa of the MHV M protein, followed by the HA tag. To abolish concomitant expression of the HBV M and S envelope proteins from the L open reading frame, their translational start codons (Met109 and Met164) (Fig. 1 A) were changed to threonine residues (pNI2.Lo) as described (25Löffler-Mary H. Dumortier J. Klentsch-Zimmer C. Prange R. Virology. 2000; 270: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequently, most deletion mutants described above were introduced into this Lo background. To produce viral envelope proteins, transient transfection of COS-7 cells by electroporation was used. Two days post-transfection, microsomes were prepared and subjected to the trypsin protection assay essentially as described (12Prange R. Streeck R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted by dounce homogenization, and microsomes were recovered by ultracentrifugation prior to proteolysis with trypsin (25μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After incubation on ice for 60 min, trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 30 μg/ml aprotinin. Each sample was then adjusted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and solubilized for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C, proteins of the supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and washed twice with 5% TCA and once with acetone. TCA precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (Babco), diluted 1:1000 in blotting buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 5% skim milk) and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dianova) (1:5000 dilution in blotting buffer), and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For metabolic labeling, cells were washed 48 h after transfection and starved for 40 min in methionine-free minimal essential medium without fetal calf serum. Cells were pulsed for 10 min with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (1000 Ci/mmol) and either harvested directly or harvested after a chase of 45 min performed by replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1.5 mg/ml unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Microsomes were prepared and subjected to trypsin digestion as described above except the proteins were immunoprecipitated with an L-specific (i.e. pre-S1-specific) polyclonal antiserum (23Löffler-Mary H. Werr M Prange R. Virology. 1997; 235: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics). For protein synthesis in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), the reducing agent was added 5 min before as well as during the pulse (20 min) and during the chase (20 min) labeling at a final concentration of 10 mm. Cells were processed as described above except the phosphate-buffered saline washing buffer and the homogenization buffer were supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block free sulfhydryl groups. Transfected cells were washed twice in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mmtriethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mmsucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) and suspended in the same buffer supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. The cells were homogenized by passing 12 times through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 × g and 4 °C to obtain a postnuclear supernatant. The postnuclear supernatant was separated on nycodenz (Nycomed) step gradients that were formed by the method described by Hammond and Helenius (26Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, a discontinuous gradient of 10, 14.66, 19.33, and 24% nycodenz in 0.75% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA was formed manually and centrifuged for 4 h at 235,000 × g and 15 °C in an SW40 rotor (Beckman). The postnuclear supernatant was then loaded on top of the gradients and centrifuged for 1.5 h as described above. Fifteen fractions were collected from the bottom, and proteins from each fraction were precipitated with TCA prior to immunoblot analysis. The assignments of ER, Golgi, and intermediate compartment (IC) fractions were based on the marker analysis using anti-ID3 (a generous gift from S. Fuller), anti-58K (Sigma), and anti-rab2 (Santa Cruz) for immunoblotting, respectively, whereas the distribution of L was analyzed with anti-HA. Topological analyses have demonstrated previously that the initial topology of the hepadnaviral L envelope protein at the ER membrane contains its entire pre-S domain oriented to the cytosolic side, whereas the mature protein disposes this domain in addition to the luminal side of intracellular membranes (Fig.1 B) (9Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Guo J.-T Pugh J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ostapchuk P.

Schaller H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9434-9441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The topological reorientation of L, i.e. the partial post-translational translocation of its pre-S domain across membranes, can be scored by its protection from exogenously added trypsin in the absence but not presence of nondenaturing detergents. While the pre-S domain of newly synthesized L chains is almost fully sensitive to cleavage with trypsin, it becomes increasingly protected over time, yielding up to 50–80% resistant chains at steady state (9Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Prange R. Streeck R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Swameye I. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9434-9441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The post-translational mode of this translocation event is evidenced further by the absence of N-linked glycosylation of the pre-S domain that carries two modification-competent glycosylation sites (Asn4 and Asn123) (12Prange R. Streeck R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Löffler-Mary H. Werr M Prange R. Virology. 1997; 235: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, partial trypsin protection at steady state and the lack of pre-S-linked N-glycans are convenient markers for post-translational pre-S translocation and are thus used herein. Because of the genetic organization of the HBV envelope open reading frame, L expression is accompanied by the synthesis of S and M, which together assemble the virion envelope (17Nassal M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 297-337PubMed Google Scholar). The complexing of envelope subunits has led to the proposal that post-translational pre-S translocation of L may occur through a channel created from lateral interactions between the amphipathic TM regions in the S domains of M and/or S chains (10Guo J.-T Pugh J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H. Intervirology. 1995; 38: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Howard C.R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Grgacic E.V.L. Kuhn C. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2455-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To examine this hypothesis, we probed whether S and M are required for pre-S translocation. To prevent concomitant M and S synthesis from the L gene, the start codons were inactivated by mutagenesis (designated L only (Lo)), and an HA-epitope tag was engineered into the C terminus of mutant and wild-type (wt) L to enable detection by Western blotting. The topology of the proteins synthesized in transiently transfected COS-7 cells was then determined by trypsin protection assays of microsomes, prepared 2 days post-transfection, and immunoblotting with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.2, L was obtained in nonglycosylated (p39) and single-glycosylated (gp42) forms as a consequence of partial modification at Asn309 in its S domain (lane 1) (17Nassal M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 297-337PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of both the S (p24 and gp27) and the M (gp33 and ggp36) proteins appeared because of the internal initiation of translation (lane 1) (17Nassal M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 297-337PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the M and S forms were absent in cells transfected with mutant Lo (Fig. 2, lane 4), confirming the prevention of their expression. Consistent with previous works (9Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Prange R. Streeck R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), proteolysis with trypsin in the absence of detergent (Nonidet P-40) yielded two fractions of wt L: trypsin-resistant full-length molecules and trypsin-sensitive chains with cleavage occurring at least at a very distal site within pre-S, most likely at Arg156 (Fig. 2,lane 2; see also Fig. 1 A). Therefore, a 25-kDa nonglycosylated (T) and a 28-kDa glycosylated (gT) HA-reactive tryptic fragment were generated that migrated slightly slower than the 24- and 27-kDa forms of S. Upon disruption of the microsomal membranes with detergent, trypsin completely converted L to these two fragments (Fig.2, lane 3), thus demonstrating that trypsin resistance is likely to be a consequence of pre-S translocation to the microsomal vesicle lumen rather than intrinsic protease resistance of the domain itself. Importantly, however, when L was synthesized in the absence of M and S chains, basically the same pattern of protection was obtained, because ∼67% of Lo chains were found to be inaccessible to trypsin unless Nonidet P-40 was present, whereas the remaining chains were cleaved to the gT and T fragments (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). The slightly more intense band obtained for the T fragment is likely to be caused by comigration of trypsin (molecular mass, ∼23.5 kDa) and its unspecific staining in Western blotting. These results demonstrate that L formed its dual topology even when synthesized without S and M chains. Alternatively, we reasoned that L on its own might create a putative pre-S-conducting channel that has been predicted to build up during dimerization and/or oligomerization of envelope chains concomitant with intermolecular covalent disulfide linkage formation (20Berting A. Hahnen J. Kröger M. Gerlich W.H. Intervirology. 1995; 38: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Howard C.R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Huovila A.J. Eder A.M. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether the inhibition of disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized L chains had an effect on pre-S translocation. To this aim, Lo-transfected cells were treated with DTT during metabolic pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine, followed by trypsin protection analysis and immunoprecipitation with a pre-S1-specific antiserum. As shown in Fig.3, Lo molecules, synthesized and matured in the presence of DTT, translocated their pre-S domains to the microsomal lumen as efficiently as Lo polypeptides expressed in untreated cells (lanes 1–6). This is evident from the almost identical degree of trypsin protection in intact microsomes. Under both assay conditions, a significant fraction of Lo chains were resistant to trypsin unless the protecting membranes were destroyed (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 5). Of note, the L-tryptic fragments were undetectable in this experiment, because a pre-S1-specific antiserum was used for immunoprecipitation. Although the above data raised first doubts on the channel hypothesis, it nonetheless seemed possible that noncovalent complexing of L chains, such as ionic interactions between the hydrophilic faces of the TM segments, may enable dimerization and pore formation. Because such interactions are difficult to interrupt in living cells, we employed a mutagenesis approach by constructing a series of mutant L proteins carrying deletions of TM segments (Fig.4 A). According to the channel model, we initially focused on the amphipathic α-helices TM1, TM3, and TM4 and constructed two mutants, LΔTM1 and LoΔTM3/4, devoid of either the first or last two TM segments, respectively. In the latter mutant, flanking residues of the upstream luminal peptide loop including the glycan acceptor Asn309 were also deleted (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with previous reports (18Eble B.E. MacRae D.R. Lingappa V.R. Ganem D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Prange R. Nagel R. Streeck R.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5832-5841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion of TM1 did not affect cotranslational membrane integration as evidenced by the membrane association of mutant LΔTM1 and its partialN-glycosylation at Asn309 (Fig. 4 B,lane 4). Presumably, the stop-transfer segment TM2 substitutes for the loss of the signal(anchor) TM1 (18Eble B.E. MacRae D.R. Lingappa V.R. Ganem D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Prange R. Nagel R. Streeck R.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5832-5841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After trypsin digestion, protease-resistant chains of the 37-kDa nonglycosylated and 40-kDa single-glycosylated forms of mutant LΔTM1 were identified in the absence but not the presence of detergents (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating a partial luminal pre-S location and hence post-translational pre-S translocation."

Although STAT can be activated by different cytokines (i.e. STAT1 is activated by IFNα, IFNγ, IL6, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL10, etc.), studies with knockout mice clearly indicated that their function is well restricted to precise systems. For example, STAT1 is only required for the physiological functions of IFNα and IFNγ (reviewed in Ref. 7Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). STATs are recruited to distinct phosphotyrosines within the receptor complex and then are phosphorylated, probably by Jaks, on the highly conserved C-terminal tyrosines (i.e. tyrosine 701 of Stat1), allowing the SH2 domain of one STAT to interact with the phosphorylated tyrosine on another STAT to form homo- or heterodimers. STAT dimers translocate to the nucleus, where they bind specific DNA elements to activate or inhibit transcription of specific genes (reviewed in Refs. 5Schindler S. Darnell J.J.E. Annu. Rev.

One distinctive feature in the type I IFN system is that STAT2 is pre-associated with IFNαRβL chain (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B.

Activation of STAT2 in response to type I IFNs (IFNα, β, or ω) requires the presence of this constitutive site and one or more of the five proximal tyrosines of the βL chain (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

It is known that activation of STAT1 requires the previous activation of STAT2 (11Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.J. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not been determined whether receptor tyrosines are also required for activation. This is in clear contrast to the activation of STAT1 by IFNγ, which requires docking of STAT1 to a phosphorylated tyrosine on the α chain of the receptor (12Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We have recently reported (13Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O.R. J.

We report here that RACK1 constitutively interacts with non-phosphorylated STAT1 and functions as an adaptor between this factor and the long form of the β subunit of the IFNαR (IFNαRβL). No interaction between RACK1 and other STAT factors was detected. The interaction between IFNαRβL and RACK1 is critical for normal STAT activation and IFN signaling. This is supported by the finding that mutations in the RACK1 binding site of IFNαRβL, which includes the Box 2 motif, impaired IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and the development of the antiviral state.

Polyclonal antibodies against STAT3, STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6 were kindly provided by Drs. Evan Parganas and James Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The anti-Stat1 and -Stat2 sera were kindly provided by Dr. A. Larner (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH). Antiviral assays were performed as previously described (23Cheung S.C. Chattopadhyay S.K.

U-266 or Daudi cells (1 × 107 cells) were treated as indicated and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6 containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and developed using a chemiluminescent detection method (Pierce). The different GST fusion proteins encoding different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNαRβL have been described previously (25Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For mapping of the RACK1 binding site of IFNαRβL, a combination of two or three alanine mutations per construct was introduced in the GSTβL300–375 that contains the minimum region that binds RACK1. GST fusion expression constructs with mutations of the RACK1 site were made by polymerase chain reaction using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A GST fusion protein encoding the full-length RACK1 (GST-RACK1) was produced by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector. GST fusion proteins were produced in BL-21 cells as described previously (25Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Pull-down experiments and immunoblotting were performed using the same procedure described above for immunoprecipitations. STAT1 and RACK1 were produced by a T7 wheat germ in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's procedure. [35S]methionine-labeled STAT1 and RACK1 proteins alone or in combination were incubated with GST-βL overnight, washed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described for immunoprecipitations. Mammalian expression constructs with mutations of the RACK1 site of IFNαRβL (amino acids 302, 304, and 305) were made by polymerase chain reaction using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Constructs were subcloned into the pLXSN retroviral vector and transfected into the ϕ2 packaging cell line, and retrovirus-containing supernatants were used to transduce LpRα cells (L-929 cells stably expressing the human α chain of the receptor; Ref. 25Domanski P.

Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing G-418 (500 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (500 μg/ml), and positive clones were screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using the IFNaRβ1 monoclonal antibody (26Colamonici O.R. Domanski P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10895-10899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that recognizes IFNαRβL. It has been suggested that proteins containing WD repeats may serve as scaffold or adaptor proteins (27Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Because RACK1 interacts with a region of IFNαRβL (amino acids 300–346) (13Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that is required for activation of STATs and the antiviral response (25Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RACK1 could recruit STAT1 to the receptor complex. We first performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-RACK1 monoclonal antibody to test for an interaction between RACK1 and STAT1. Fig. 1 A shows that the anti-RACK1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated STAT1 (upper panel,lane 6) but not STAT3 (lower panel, lane 6) or STAT2 (data not shown) present in unstimulated U266 cell lysates. This interaction is specific, because it cannot be detected by non-immune IgM used as negative control (Fig. 1 A,lane 5). The anti-STAT1 and -STAT3 antibodies also coprecipitated STAT3 and STAT1, respectively, as previously reported (28Stancato L.F. David M. Carter-Su C. Larner A.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4134-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the strong signal for STAT3 detected in anti-STAT1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, lower panel,lane 2) may correspond in part to incomplete stripping of the membrane after STAT1 immunoblotting. This result strongly suggests that STAT1 specifically interacts with RACK1. It should be noticed, however, that we have not consistently been able to coimmunoprecipitate RACK1 using anti-STAT1 antibodies. One possible explanation is that both antibodies recognize epitopes close to the C-terminal part of the protein, where the RACK1 binding site may be located, and therefore disrupt the interaction. To further characterize the RACK1-STAT interactions, a GST fusion protein that encoded the full-length RACK1 protein was used to determine whether other STAT proteins bind RACK1. Fig.1 Bshows that GST-RACK1, but not GST alone, binds to STAT1. However, GST-RACK1 failed to bind STAT2, -3, -4, -5, or -6 (Fig.1,C–F), confirming that the interaction between RACK1 and STAT1 is specific. Interestingly, GST-βL also bound STAT1 present in cell lysates (Fig.1 B). This result differs from our previous observation using STAT1 produced in wheat germ in vitro translation systems, in which no interaction between IFNαRβL and STAT1 was detected (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that a protein such as RACK1 present in cell lysates, but absent in the wheat germ in vitro translation system, may serve as an adapter between IFNαRβL and STAT1 (see below). We reasoned that if RACK1 links STAT1 to IFNαRβL, deletions or mutations in IFNαRβL that decrease RACK1 binding should also decrease the association of STAT1 with the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we performed pull-down experiments using GST fusion proteins containing different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNαRβL. Fig. 2 A,top panel shows that GST fusion proteins encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain (lane 7, GSTβL-wt) and proteins truncated at amino acids 462, 375, and 346 (lanes 3–5), but not at amino acids 265–299 (lane 2), were also able to interact with STAT1. Similarly, a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 300–515 (Fig. 2 A, lane 6, GSTβL300–515) and therefore lacking the first 35 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (265) also interacts with STAT1. The same GST-βL fusion proteins that bound STAT1 also interacted with RACK1 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). This result indicates that the minimal interaction domain for STAT1 corresponds to amino acids 300–346 of IFNαRβL and is identical to the RACK1 binding site (Fig. 2 A, lower panel and Ref.13Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We next performed an alanine scan of this region to further define the RACK1 and STAT1 binding sites. Although no individual mutation completely abolished RACK1 or STAT1 binding to GST-βL, some mutations produced a decrease in binding of STAT1 to IFNαRβL that paralleled the decrease in binding of RACK1 to this receptor chain (Fig.2 B). The most intense reduction in binding was observed when amino acids within the region 302–305 and 314–327 of IFNαRβL (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 6–8) were mutated to alanine. The overlapping in RACK1 and STAT1 binding sites strongly supports the concept that RACK1 functions as an adaptor between IFNαRβL and STAT1. Although the interaction between IFNαRβL and STAT1 is detected in cellular lysates (Figs. 1 B and 2 A), the association between these proteins is not observed when STAT1 is produced in wheat germ lysates (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this is that RACK1 functions as an adaptor between IFNαRβL and STAT1 and that the wheat germ homolog of RACK1 fails to interact with IFNαRβL, STAT1, or both. Therefore, we assessed the ability of GST-βL to bind STAT1 produced alone or together with RACK1 using a wheat germ in vitro translation system. Fig. 2 Cshows that GST-βL interacts with RACK1 but not STAT1 when these proteins are produced separately (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 6). However, when RACK1 and STAT1 are in vitro translated together GST-βL pulls down STAT1 (Fig.2 C, lane 10). Thus, IFNαRβL and STAT1 interact only when RACK1 is present, strongly suggesting that RACK1 functions as an adaptor between IFNαRβL and STAT1. Although the experiments presented above demonstrate that the non-activated forms of IFNαRβL, RACK1, and STAT1 form a complex, they do not address whether RACK1 interacts with the phosphorylated form of STAT1. This is an important issue because once STAT1 is phosphorylated it must detach from the receptor to form a DNA-binding complex in association with STAT2 and p48. To address this issue, STAT1 phosphorylation was induced by treating U-266 cells with IFNα for 15 min. Then, we assessed the ability of GST-RACK1 and/or GST-IFNαRβL to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, as determined by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Immunoprecipitations with an anti-STAT1 serum or GST alone were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The resultant precipitates were divided in equal parts, resolved in separate gels, and immunoblotted using either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-STAT1 antibodies. Fig.3 A shows that neither GST-βL nor GST-RACK1 can precipitate the tyrosine-phosphorylated fraction of STAT1 after IFNα treatment (lower panel, lanes 6 and 7), but both bind non-phosphorylated STAT1 in control cells (upper panel, lanes 2 and3) as well as the non-phosphorylated fraction after IFNα treatment (upper panel, lanes 6 and7). As expected, the anti-STAT1 antibody precipitates the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of STAT1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 8). Identical results were obtained in similar experiments in which the same membrane was first immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and then anti-STAT1 antibodies and the converse (data not shown). These results demonstrate that RACK1 interacts only with the non-phosphorylated form of STAT1 and support the concept that STAT1 dissociates from the IFNαRβL-RACK1 complex after becoming phosphorylated to form a DNA-binding complex. This was further demonstrated by the finding that 20 min after IFNα treatment almost all STAT1 was localized to the nucleus (Fig.3 B, panel f), whereas RACK1 fluorescence increased and remained in the cytoplasm (panel e). In untreated cells, RACK1 is detected in the cytoplasm, as previously reported (13Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas STAT1 was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panels c and d, respectively). The specificity of the immunofluorescence procedure is demonstrated by the complete lack of signal when normal rabbit serum and anti-IgM were used as negative controls for STAT1 and RACK1 (Fig.3 B, panels a and b), respectively. To further determine the importance of the interaction between IFNαRβL, RACK1, and STAT1 in IFNα signaling, we expressed the human IFNαRβL chain with mutations of the RACK1 binding site in mouse L-929 cells. Several stable clones expressing the mutant IFNαRβL chain (designated αβLΔR1) were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 4). We next tested whether disruption of the interaction between the receptor and RACK1 would prevent the activation of STAT1. Human IFNα2 induced significantly lower levels of STAT1 phosphorylation in cells expressing mutations of the RACK1 binding site of IFNαRβL (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and6). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 was also reduced by the mutation of the RACK1 site (Fig. 5 A,lanes 3 and 6). Normal tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was detected when cells were treated with murine IFNα4 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2and 5), demonstrating that the STAT pathway was functional when activated through the endogenous mouse receptor. The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to huIFNα treatment was not due to a defect in kinase activation, because tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 was normal (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). These results indicate that the interaction between IFNαRβL and RACK1 is not only important for normal activation of STAT1 but also for STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation through a mechanism that remains to be elucidated (see “Discussion”).Figure 5Mutation of the RACK1 site on IFN αRβL impairs STAT activation and the induction of an antiviral state. A, cells stably transfected with IFNαRβL wild type (αβLwt) or with mutations of the RACK1 binding site (αβLΔR1, clones 21 (cl.21) and 24 (cl.24)) were treated with 1,000 units/ml IFNα2 (hα) or murine IFNα4 (mα) or left untreated (control,CT) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT1 and -STAT2 (upper panel) or anti-Jak1 sera (lower panel). Immunoblotting was first performed with the anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibody 4G10 (upper panel), followed by stripping and reblotting with the precipitating antibodies (lower panels; STAT1, STAT2, and Jak1). IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Western blot.B, the ability of IFN to protect cells against the cytopathic effect (CPE) of encephalomyocarditis virus was determined using a standard antiviral assay. Cells were pre-incubated with concentrations of IFNs ranging from 1–500 units/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. The medium was removed and replaced with medium containing a dilution of encephalomyocarditis virus stock (1/10,000) that killed 100% of the cells in 24 h. Cell viability was determined 24 h later using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.mu, murine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next studied whether huIFNα2 was able to elicit an antiviral response in cells expressing a mutation of the RACK1 binding site of IFNαRβL (Fig. 5 B, αβLΔR1, clones 21 and 24). Fig.5 B shows that huIFNα2 induced significantly lower levels of protection against encephalomyocarditis virus than did murine IFNα4, which activates the endogenous murine receptor, in two independent clones expressing mutations of the RACK1 site. The level of protection detected was also lower than that induced by huIFNα2 in cells expressing the wild type receptor. These results demonstrate that recruitment of RACK1 to the IFNαR complex is critical for the activation of STAT1 and STAT2 and for the induction of an antiviral state. The results presented in this study demonstrate that the adaptor protein RACK1 links STAT1 to the human type I IFN receptor. The interaction between the receptor and RACK1 is required for activation of STAT1 and the induction of an antiviral state by huIFNα. The RACK1-mediated interaction between STAT1 and IFNαRβL and the direct association of STAT2 with the distal part of the same chain (9Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C.

Stark G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrate that activation of the STAT pathway by type I IFNs requires the pre-association of STAT factors with the receptor. These findings raise the question whether a model in which STATs pre-associate with cytokine receptors through adaptor proteins containing a WD motif also applies to other cytokine systems. It has been recently reported that the WD motif-containing protein StIP (STAT3-Interacting Protein) interacts with several STATs and JAKs (29Collum R.G. Brutsaert S. Lee G. Schindler C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, there are differences between RACK1 and StIP. 1) StIP interacts with more than one STAT and Jak, suggesting that it is not STAT or cytokine specific, and 2) it has not been addressed whether StIP associates directly with cytokine receptors. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that StIP and RACK1 are members of a novel family of proteins involved in Jak-STAT signaling. The concept that other STAT-specific adaptors may exist is also supported by reports indicating that activation of STAT5 by growth hormone occurs in the presence of growth hormone receptors devoid of all tyrosines (30Hackett R.H. Wang Y.-D. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21326-21330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,31Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The alternative to a general model in which all STATs are pre-associated with cytokine receptors is that the only system that requires such pre-association is the type I IFN pathway. In this scenario, the recruitment of STAT1 through RACK1 may reflect a more stringent regulation of STAT activation due to the effect of type I IFNs on cell proliferation, or may preclude the need for phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine on the receptor for STAT1 activation. Unfortunately, we have not been able to address the latter question, because activation of STAT1 is dependent on the previous activation of STAT2 (11Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.J. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, addition of single tyrosines to IFNαRβL constructs in which all tyrosines had been substituted for alanines failed to affect STAT1 phosphorylation independently of STAT2 phosphorylation. This result raises the possibility that, unlike the IFNγ receptor, where phosphorylation of tyrosine 440 of the α chain is critical for STAT1 phosphorylation (12Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 32Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNαR is not critical for STAT1 activation. Our data also suggest that once STAT1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, it can dissociate from RACK1 and the receptor complex. This is supported by the finding that RACK1 interacts only with the inactive (non-phosphorylated) form of STAT1 and that soon after type I IFN stimulation STAT1 is almost exclusively detected in the nucleus, whereas RACK1 remains in the cytoplasm. These data suggest that RACK1 should not be part of the ISGF3 or γ-activated factor complex and does not translocate to the nucleus. This and our previous finding that RACK1 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated (13Croze E. Usacheva A. Asarnow D. Minshall R.D. Perez H.D. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5127-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) further support the concept that RACK1 is an adaptor or scaffold protein important in targeting specific signaling components such as STAT1 to the appropriate subcellular compartment for their activation. It should be pointed out that the region of IFNαRβL that interacts with RACK1 appears to overlap, at least in part, with the Box 2 domain. It has been proposed that this motif could play a role in the activation of Jak1 by the IL2Rβ chain (33Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10719-10725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the interaction between RACK1 and the Box 2 motif could be important for the recruitment of specific signaling proteins such as STAT1 and/or for providing the appropriate receptor configuration that allows Jaks to activate signaling components such as STATs. Unfortunately, the high levels of endogenous RACK1 make it extremely difficult to express potential dominant-negative mutants in which the interaction between RACK1 and STAT1 has been disrupted. Nevertheless, these experiments are important to determine whether the impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 observed when RACK1 cannot interact with the receptor is due only to the failure to recruit STAT1 or to the fact that RACK1 may also recruit other signaling proteins. Either mechanism may explain the finding that RACK1 is also required for efficient phosphorylation of STAT2. Thus, the biological significance of RACK1 could go beyond the recruitment of STAT1. This is also suggested by the finding that the Box 2 motif is important in signaling by cytokine receptors in which STAT1 is not required for biological activity. Finally, it should be pointed out that RACK1, as well as the β-subunit of G-proteins, binds pleckstrin homology domains, the SH2 domain of src, and protein kinase C β, raising the possibility that these or other proteins with similar motifs may be recruited by RACK1 to cytokine receptors. We are currently addressing the possibility that RACK1 recruits ubiquitously expressed proteins activated by type I IFNs such as insulin receptor substrate-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and Fyn (34Uddin S.

These results suggest the potential for genuinely complementary clinical anticancer activity of BBR3464 in comparison to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin).1 Cisplatin has a major role in combination chemotherapy for several solid tumors, such as germ cell tumors, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer (6Rosenberg B. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 3-30Google Scholar, 7Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem.

The specific choice of BBR3464 as clinical candidate comes from preclinical studies showing cytotoxicity at 10-fold lower concentration than cisplatin and collateral sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines (1Farrell N. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 321-338Google Scholar, 4Calvert P.M. Highley M.S. Hughes A.N. Plummer E.R. Azzabi A.S.T.

Importantly, BBR3464 also displays consistently high antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts characterized as mutant p53 (1Farrell N. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 321-338Google Scholar, 11Pratesi G. Perego P. Polizzi D. Righetti S.C. Supino R. Caserini C. Manzotti C. Giuliani F.C. Pezzoni G. Tognella S. Spinelli S. Farrell N. Zunino F. British J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This important feature suggests that the new agent may find utility in the over 60% of cancer cases where mutant p53 status has been indicated. DNA damage by chemotherapeutic agents is in many cases mediated through the p53 pathway (12Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmüller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistently, cytotoxicity displayed in mutant cell lines would suggest an ability to bypass this pathway (11Pratesi G. Perego P. Polizzi D. Righetti S.C. Supino R. Caserini C. Manzotti C. Giuliani F.C. Pezzoni G. Tognella S. Spinelli S. Farrell N. Zunino F. British J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). DNA is generally considered the major pharmacological target of platinum drugs (13Johnson N.P. Butour J.-L. Villani G. Wimmer F.L. Defais M. Pierson V. Brabec V. Prog. Clin. Biochem. Med. 1989; 10: 1-24Crossref Google Scholar). As such it is of considerable interest to understand the patterns of DNA damage that may lead to differential cell signaling induced by polynuclear platinum complexes in comparison to those induced by mononuclear agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin. Previous results have indicated a unique DNA binding profile for BBR3464, strengthening the original hypothesis that modification of DNA binding in manners distinct from that of cisplatin will also lead to a distinct and unique profile of antitumor activity (14Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The bifunctional DNA binding of BBR3464 is characterized by the rapid formation of long range intra- and interstrand cross-links (CLs). Since the central platinum unit does not contribute to covalent binding to DNA, it is not surprising that the DNA binding profile of BBR3464 is shared by dinuclear platinum compounds with simple diamine and polyamine (spermidine, spermine) linkers (14Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,15Zaludova R. Zakovska A. Kasparkova J. Balcarova Z.

Penazova, O. Vrana, V. Brabec, and N. Farrell, submitted for publication. The incorporation into the linker backbone of charge and hydrogen-bonding capacity dramatically increases the DNA affinity and affects the charge/lipophilicity balance as well as increasing the distance between the two platinum-DNA binding coordination spheres. All of these features may contribute to contribute to differentiating DNA binding, cellular uptake, and antitumor activity within the polynuclear platinum family itself (1Farrell N. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 321-338Google Scholar, 17Roberts J.D. Beggiolin G. Manzotti C. Piazzoni L. Farrell N. J. Inorg.

The high charge on BBR3464 facilitates rapid binding to DNA, which is significantly faster than that of the neutral cisplatin. This feature is also manifested in rapid binding to single-stranded DNA (19Kloster M.B.G. Hannis J.C. Muddiman D.C. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14731-14737Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Bifunctional binding to duplex DNA preferentially involves guanine (G) residues. Quantitation of interstrand DNA cross-linking in natural and linear DNA indicated ∼20% of the DNA to be interstrand cross-linked. This value is significantly higher than that for cisplatin; on the other hand, an intriguing aspect of BBR3464 is that long range delocalized CLs in which the platinated sites are separated by one or more base pairs are equally or even more probable than interstrand adducts. The (platinum,platinum) intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 are thus analogues of the major adducts of cisplatin, which forms on DNA ∼90% bifunctional intrastrand adducts between neighboring purine residues, affording an unwound duplex with a directional fixed kink and a widened, shallow minor groove (20Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). The structure of these adducts determined by phasing assay based on gel electrophoresis and by chemical probes of DNA conformation has revealed (21Marrot L. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz A. Marrot L. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7975-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Bellon S.F.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8026-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) that these adducts induce the overall helix bend of 32–34° toward major groove, DNA unwinding of 13°, severe perturbation of hydrogen bonding within the 5′-coordinated GC bp, and distortion extended over at least 4–5 bp at the site of the CL. Similarly, the minor 1,3-intrastrand CL of cisplatin also bends the helix axis toward the major groove by ∼35° and locally unwinds DNA by ∼23° (24Bellon S.F. Coleman J.H. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8026-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Teuben J.M. Bauer C. Wang A.H.J. Reedijk J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12305-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Another important feature of the conformational alteration induced by this lesion is that DNA is locally denatured and flexible at the site of the adduct (23Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Anin M.F. Leng M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in contrast to the case of the 1,2-intrastrand adduct. Given the recent advances in our understanding of the structural basis for the conformational alteration caused by intrastrand CLs of cisplatin, it is of considerable interest to examine how the structures of the various types of the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 affect conformational properties of DNA. Some structures altered by platinum adducts, such as stable directional bending and unwinding, attract various damaged DNA-binding proteins such as those containing high mobility group (HMG) domain (27Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J.

Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 73-110Google Scholar). This binding of these proteins has been postulated to mediate the antitumor properties of the platinum drugs (28Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 29Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 73-110Google Scholar). In addition, several reports have demonstrated (30Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 31Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971PubMed Google Scholar, 32Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that intrastrand CLs of cisplatin are removed from DNA during nucleotide excision repair (NER) reactions and that NER is also a major mechanism contributing to cisplatin resistance. Therefore, in addition to examining the structural alterations induced in DNA by the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464, we also investigated in the present work how these adducts are recognized by HMG1 protein and removed from DNA during in vitro NER reactions. BBR3464 (Fig. 1) was prepared by standard methods. Cisplatin was obtained from Sigma (Prague, Czech Republic). The stock solutions of platinum compounds were prepared at the concentration of 1 × 10−3min 10 mm NaClO4 and stored at 4 °C in the dark. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Fig. 1) were synthesized and purified as described previously (33Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HMG1 domain A (HMG1domA) and HMG1 domain B (HMG1domB) (residues 1–84 and 85–180, respectively) were prepared by M. Stros as described previously (34Stros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); their sequences (34Stros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from rat HMG1 cDNA. T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Acrylamide, bis(acrylamide), urea, and NaCN were from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Dimethyl sulfate (DMS), KMnO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), KBr, and KHSO5 were from Sigma (Prague, Czech Republic). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.ATP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The single-stranded oligonucleotides (the top strands of the duplexes in Fig. 1) were reacted in stoichiometric amounts with BBR3464. The platinated oligonucleotides were repurified by ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). It was verified by platinum flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry and by the measurements of the optical density that the modified oligonucleotides contained three platinum atoms. It was also verified using DMS footprinting of platinum on DNA (35Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 36Comess K.M.

J. 1990; 267: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that in the platinated top strands of all duplexes the N7 position of the two guanine (G) residues was not accessible for reaction with DMS. Briefly, platinated and nonmodified top strands (5′ end-labeled with 32P) were reacted with DMS. DMS methylates the N7 position of G residues in DNA, producing alkali-labile sites (38Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). However, if N7 is coordinated to platinum, it cannot be methylated. The oligonucleotides were then treated with hot piperidine and analyzed by denaturing 24% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the nonmodified oligonucleotides, shortened fragments due to the cleavage of the strand at one methylated G were observed in the gel. However, no such bands were detected for the oligonucleotides modified by BBR3464. These results indicate that one BBR3464 molecule was coordinated to both G resides in the top strands of all duplexes. If not stated otherwise, the platinated top strands were allowed to anneal with unplatinated complementary strands (bottom strands in Fig. 1) in 50 mm NaCl plus 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and used immediately in further experiments. This annealing procedure included a rapid heating of the mixture of the complementary oligonucleotides to 60 °C followed by the incubation at 25 °C for 2 h. It was verified that under these conditions the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 were stable for at least 24 h. FPLC purification and flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry measurements were carried out on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system with MonoQ HR 5/5 column and a Unicam 939 AA spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, respectively. Other details have been described previously (33Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The modification by KMnO4, DEPC, and KBr/KHSO5 were performed as described previously (39Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M.

Fox K.R. Drug-DNA Interaction Protocols. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1997: 51-79Google Scholar). The strands of the duplexes (22 bp shown in Fig. 1 B) were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. In the case of the platinated oligonucleotides, the platinum complex was removed after reaction of the DNA with the probe by incubation with 0.2 m NaCN (pH 11) at 45 °C for 10 h in the dark. Unplatinated 15- and 19–22-mer single strands (bottom strands in Fig. 1 B) were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Then they were annealed (see above) with their phosphorylated complementary strands (unplatinated or containing intrastrand CL of BBR3464 between G residues). Unplatinated and intrastrand CL-containing duplexes were allowed to react with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting samples along with ligated unplatinated duplexes were subsequently examined on 8% native polyacrylamide (mono:bis(acrylamide) ratio = 29:1) electrophoresis gels. Other details of these experiments were as described in previously published papers (23Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The 20-mer oligonucleotides 5′-d(AGAAGAAGACCAGAGAGAGG), 5′-d(AGAAGAACACAAGAGAGAGG), or 5′-d(AGAAGAACAACAGAGAGAGG) were 5′ end-labeled and annealed (see above) to their complementary strands 5′-d(CCTCTCTCTG*G*TCTTCTTCT), 5′-d(CCTCTCTCTTG*TG*TTCTTCT), or 5′-d(CCTCTCTCTG*TTG*TTCTTCT) respectively, where the asterisks represent a platinum CL. The duplexes (0.4 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of proteins in 20-μl sample volumes containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm LiCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm spermidine, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 0.05% Nonidet P40. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then made 7% in sucrose and 0.017% in xylene cyanol prior loading on prerun, precooled (4 °C) 6% native polyacrylamide gels (mono:bis(acrylamide) ratio = 29:1). Gels were electrophoresed for 3 h, visualized by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system), and the bands were quantitated with the ImageQuant software. The 20-mer oligonucleotides 5′d(CCTCTCTCTTG*G*TTCTTCTT), 5′d(CCTCTCTCTTG*TG*TTCTTCT), and 5′d(CCTCTCTCTTG*TTTG*TTCTCT), where the asterisks represent a BBR3464 CL, were used for preparation of linear 148-bp duplexes with centrally located 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,5-intrastrand CL of BBR3464 at nucleotides 75 and 76, 75 and 77, or 75 and 78, respectively. Uniquely modified 20-mers were end-labeled to introduce a radiolabel at the 11th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the CL, annealed with a set of five complementary and partially overlapping oligonucleotides, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Full-length substrates were separated from unligated products in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, purified by electroelution, reannealed, and stored in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at −20 °C. Other details of the purification of DNA substrates for NER were the same as described previously (44Matsunaga T. Mu D. Park C.-H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotide excision reactions were performed in cell-free extracts (CFEs) prepared from the HeLa S3 and CHO AA8 cell lines as described (31Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971PubMed Google Scholar, 46Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sancar from the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC).In vitro repair of intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 was measured with excision assay using these CFEs and 148-bp linear DNA substrates (see above) in the same way as described previously (31Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971PubMed Google Scholar) with small modifications. The reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 10 fmol of radiolabeled DNA, 50 μg of CFE, 20 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP in the reaction buffer (23 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 44 mm KCl, 4.8 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm EDTA, 0.52 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm ATP, 5 μg of BSA, and 2.5% glycerol) and were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. DNA was deproteinized and precipitated by ethanol. The excision products were separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system), and the bands were quantitated with the ImageQuant software. Mapping of incision sites was performed as described in a previous report (31Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971PubMed Google Scholar) with small modifications. Briefly, the major excision product (gel-purified) was further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with T4 DNA polymerase (0.15 units) in 10 μl of buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 15 mm(NH4)2SO4, 7 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml BSA, supplemented with 0.5 μg ofSmaI-digested pBluescript DNA, and visualized by autoradiography following resolution in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Similar analyses using radiolabeled, platinated 20-mers (used in the nucleotide excision assays) were also used to identify the nucleotide(s) at which the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase is blocked 3′ to the lesion. The location of the 5′ incision site made by the excinuclease was determined by comparison with the length of excision products observed in the absence of T4 DNA polymerase digestion. We demonstrated in our previous paper (14Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that preferential G binding of BBR3464 results in various types of adducts including long range intrastrand and interstrand CLs. Quantitation of cross-linking revealed that intrastrand CLs are equally or even more probable than interstrand adducts. Considering these facts we have designed a series of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes, TGGT, TGTGT, and TGTTTGT, whose sequences are shown in Fig. 1. The pyrimidine-rich top strands of these duplexes only contained two G residues in the sequences TGGT, TGTGT, and TGTTGT in the center (Fig.1, bold). These top strands were modified by BBR3464 so that they contained a single 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,5-intrastrand adduct of this platinum complex between two G residues at these central sequences. The 1,2-intrastrand CL is formed between neighboring G sites, whereas, in 1,3- and 1,5-intrastrand CLs, the platinated G sites are separated by one or three nucleotides, respectively. The cross-linked top strands of the duplexes TGGT, TGTGT, or TGTTTGT were hybridized with their complementary strands. The samples of the platinated TGGT, TGTGT, or TGTTTGT duplexes in which the upper strand was only 5′ end-labeled with 32P were reacted with DMS, which does not react with platinated G because the N7 position is no longer accessible (35Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The adducts were removed by NaCN (36Comess K.M. Costello C.E. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and then the sample was treated with piperidine. In the unplatinated duplexes, the central G residues in the top strands were reactive with DMS (data not shown). They were no longer reactive in all three cross-linked duplexes. This observation confirms that the two G residues in the upper strands remained platinated even after the duplex was formed and were involved in the intrastrand CL (36Comess K.M. Costello C.E. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oligonucleotide duplexes containing a site-specific 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,5-intrastrand CL between G residues were further analyzed by chemical probes of DNA conformation. The intrastrand cross-linked duplexes (22-bp, shown in Fig. 1 B) were treated with several chemical agents that are used as tools for monitoring the existence of conformations other than canonical B-DNA. These agents include KMnO4, DEPC, and bromine. They react preferentially with single-stranded DNA and distorted double-stranded DNA (39Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M.

Here, we demonstrate that the cultured neonatal cardiomyocyte is not an appropriate model to study the effects of GH because of artifactual loss of GH receptors (GHRs). To circumvent this problem, rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the murine GHR. Functional integrity of GHR was suggested by GH-induced activation of the cognate JAK2/STAT5, MAPK, and Akt intracellular pathways in the cells expressing GHR. Although exposure to GH resulted in a significant increase in the size of the cardiomyocyte and increased expression of c-fos, myosin light chain 2, and skeletal α-actin mRNAs, there were no significant changes in IGF-1 or atrial natriuretic factor mRNA levels in response to GH stimulation. In this model, GH increased incorporation of leucine, uptake of palmitic acid, and abundance of fatty acid transport protein mRNA. In contrast, GH decreased uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and levels of Glut1 protein. Thus, in isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes expressing GHR, GH induces hypertrophy and causes alterations in cellular metabolic profile in the absence of demonstrable changes in IGF-1 mRNA, suggesting that these effects may be independent of IGF-1.

Cittadini A. Fazio S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 555-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Patients with excess endogenous GH (i.e. acromegaly) suffer from cardiac complications including biventricular hypertrophy, impaired diastolic filling, and decreased cardiac performance on effort due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction (2Morvan D. Komajda M. Grimaldi A. Turpin G. Grosgogeat Y. Eur. Heart J. 1991; 12: 666-672PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with chronic GH deficiency also show cardiac abnormalities; in general, the data support the presence of a hypokinetic cardiac syndrome in patients with GH deficiency that can be reversed with GH replacement therapy (3Frustaci A.

Subsequent to these landmark findings, some studies have supported a beneficial effect of exogenous GH on cardiac function (7O'Driscoll J.G. Green D.J. Ireland M. Kerr D. Larbalestier R.I. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas other investigators were unable to demonstrate salutary effects of GH on cardiac function in patients with heart failure (8Osterziel K.J. Strohm O. Schuler J. Friedrich M. Hanlein D. Willenbrock R. Anker S.D. Poole-Wilson P.A. Ranke M.B. Dietz R. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1233-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A particularly well studied animal model is that of the transplanted GH-secreting pituitary tumor cell line, GH3. In this model of GH excess, there is increased myocardial contractility and calcium sensitivity of myocardial contractile proteins (1Sacca L. Cittadini A. Fazio S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 555-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Similarly, normal rats given recombinant GH show an increase in left ventricular mass, as well as an increase in several aspects of cardiac performance (9Cittadini A. Stromer H. Katz S.E. Clark R. Moses A.C. Morgan J.P. Douglas P.S. Circulation. 1996; 93: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the rodent model of myocardial infarction, administration of GH results in improvements in myocardial contractility, left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures, and cardiac index with no increase in the size of the infarct (10Isgaard J.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In general, animal models of GH deficiency also support a role for GH in the maintenance of cardiac structure and function. Thus, genetically GH-deficient dwarf mice show cardiac abnormalities that can be reversed following GH therapy (14Cittadini A. Stromer H. Vatner D.E. Grossman J.D. Katz S.E. Clark R. Morgan J.P. Douglas P.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, hypophysectomized rats given GH show little improvement in ventricular function, indicating that GH may cooperate with other factors (e.g. thyroid hormone) in its effects on the heart (15Shen Y.T. Wiedmann R.T. Lynch J.J. Grossman W. Johnson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1721-H1727PubMed Google Scholar). In the intact animal, GH increases the circulating levels of IGF-1 by stimulating the production of IGF-1 (16Harvey S. Scanes C.G. Daughaday W.H. Growth Hormone. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). IGF-1 itself induces hypertrophy and alters gene expression in isolated cardiomyocytes and increases myocardial contractility (17Donath M. Zapf J.

IGF-1 may also serve to inhibit cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis following infarction (19Li O. Li B. Wang X. Leri A. Jana K. Liu Y. Kajstura J. Baserga R. Anversa P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, to date, studies have not been able to demonstrate direct effects of GH on isolated cardiomyocytes. Thus, Ito et al. (20Ito H. Hiroe M. Hirata Y. Tsujino M. Adachi S. Shichiri M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1715-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that, whereas IGF-1 was able to induce hypertrophy with concomitant increase in expression of muscle-specific genes in isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, GH did not have an observable effect in this model. Similarly, Donath et al.(17Donath M. Zapf J. Eppenberger-Eberhardt M. Froesch E. Eppenberger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reported that in cardiomyocytes from adult rats IGF-1, but not GH, enhances myofibril development and down-regulates smooth muscle-α actin. In support of a direct (i.e. not secondary to stimulation of circulating IGF-1) effect of GH on cardiac function is the demonstration that ex vivo perfusion of the isolated rat heart with GH results in enhanced protein synthesis (21Hjalmarson A. Isaksson O. Ahren K. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 217: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At present, it is not known if GH, acting through its cognate receptor (growth hormone receptor (GHR)), has direct effects on the heart or if some or all of the observed cardiovascular effects of GH administration are secondary to an increase in circulating levels of IGF-1 and/or hemodynamic changes in vascular tone and blood pressure (22Ross Jr., J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 15-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Lupu et al. (23Lupu F. Terwilliger J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) reported that in a knockout model of GHR deficiency characterized by severe growth retardation, the weight of the heart in the adult animal, although decreased in absolute terms, was similar to controls when expressed relative to total body weight. Moreover, relative levels of IGF-1 transcripts in the heart also were unaffected. Thus, in this model of GHR deficiency, myocardial growth and IGF-1 expression are implicitly independent of the GH/GHR axis. However, the studies of Lupu et al. (23Lupu F. Terwilliger J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) do not preclude a role for GH/GHR in normal growth and development of the neonatal heart, including adaptive myocardial metabolism, characterized by a transition from virtually exclusive utilization of glucose and lactate in the fetus to fatty acids in the mature animal (24Vick III, G.W. Fisher D.J. Garson Jr., A. Bricker J.T. Fisher D.J. Neish S.R. The Science and Practice of Pediatric Cardiology. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 155-169Google Scholar). A major impediment to investigating the role of GH/GHR in the heart is the lack of a suitable in vitro tissue culture model. We have developed such a model by exploiting the strategy of recombinant adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GHR in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Using this model, we demonstrate that GH stimulates hypertrophy of the isolated cardiomyocyte, and these actions of GH seem to be largely independent of changes in IGF-1 gene expression, findings that support an important independent role for the GH/GHR axis in normal cardiac growth. In addition, GH alters the metabolic profile of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes by inhibiting glucose uptake, stimulating fatty acid uptake, and increasing protein synthesis, changes that facilitate both postnatal cardiac growth and maturation of myocardial metabolism. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were prepared from hearts of 1–3-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats using a previously described protocol (25Long C.S. Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were removed and transferred to a 100-mm dish containing heparin solution (1× Hanks' balanced saline solution, 0.8 μmMgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 units of heparin). After dissecting hearts into two pieces with a razor blade, the tissue was washed once with the heparin solution and incubated with gentle rocking in a solution containing 1× Hanks' balanced saline solution, 0.8 μm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2 μg/ml DNase, and 2 mg/ml trypsin. Tissue was pipetted three times every 20-min with a 10-ml-wide mouth pipette, and the supernatant was discarded at each time. Cardiomyocytes were recovered afterward by alternating rocking and pipetting of tissue every 5 min and pooled into a 50-ml tube containing 7 ml of fetal bovine serum. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and washed once with cold DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Fibroblasts were removed by plating (100-mm dishes) cells at 37 °C for 30 min in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cardiomyocytes were recovered by collecting the nonadherent cells and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum (Sigma), 10 mmHEPES, insulin-transferrin sodium selenite (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selinium selenite, respectively), 10 mm glutamine, 30 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were plated on Pronectin (BIOSOURCE)-coated tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. As assessed by staining with antisarcomeric antibody (MF20; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), these cell preparations typically contain greater than 95% cardiomyocytes, form a nearly confluent monolayer by the second day after plating, and beat spontaneously and synchronously. After 24 or 48 h of incubation, cells were washed with serum-free DMEM/F-12 culture medium and infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either the murine GHR (GHRAdlox) or the β-galactosidase (β-galAdlox) gene. The second generation shuttle vector pADLOX was modified to contain either the β-galactosidase (β-galAdlox) or the murine GHR cDNA (GHRAdlox). The in vitro coupled transcription-translation technique (Promega) was used to confirm that the plasmids coded for proteins of appropriate molecular weight (data not shown). The production of the replication-deficient adenoviral vectors expressing either the β-galactosidase or GHR cDNA was achieved by a protocol based on the Cre-lox principle for efficient and relatively quick identification of recombinant viral particles (27Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. DaI Y. Phipps L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adenovirus was plaque-purified, and a cesium chloride preparation was used for the experiments. The number of cell surface receptors was determined by competition binding using 125I-labeled human GH. 1 × 106 aliquots of neonatal cardiomyocytes (uninfected and infected at MOI of 12.5 plaque-forming units/cell for 48 h) were washed with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, and 1% human serum albumin), incubated with 50,000 cpm 125I-human GH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various concentrations of unlabeled GH for 90 min in binding buffer before centrifugation through 100 μl of dibutyl phthalate. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the amount of 125I-human GH bound in the presence of excess unlabeled rGH (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health), and the binding characteristics were analyzed using a computer program (GraphPad). After 24 h of adenoviral infection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Following three phosphate-buffered saline washes, the chamber slides were incubated in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspecific sites. Subsequently, the cells were covered with either anti-GHR antibody (GHR-2; specific for the cytoplasmic region of the GHR molecule and does not cross-react with GH-binding protein (28Camarillo I.G. Thordarson G. Ilkbahar Y.N. Talamantes F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) or antisarcomeric myosin antibody (MF-20). Following incubation for 1 h in the dark with the primary antibody, the cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline prior to exposure to Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. A Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with a video camera system was used to capture images and to determine cell size, estimated by measuring the area to which individual MF-20-positive cells attached. 20–45 randomly selected cells from each group (β-galAdlox- or GHRAdlox-infected, with and without exposure to rGH) were chosen for such analysis, which was conducted by an operator blinded to the identity of the cells being examined. The data gathered were analyzed using ImagePro software. GHRAdlox- or β-galAdlox-infected cells were incubated with or without rGH for certain time periods. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was prepared by the Tri-Reagent method and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. The integrity of the RNA and the accuracy of the spectrophotometric determinations were confirmed by visual inspection of the ethidium bromide-stained 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands after agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. IGF-I gene expression was studied by RNase protection assay as previously reported (29Werner H. Woloschak M. Adamo M. Shen-orr Z. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7451-7455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 30Lowe Jr., W.L. Lasky S.R. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10–50-μg aliquots of total RNA were hybridized to32P-labeled riboprobes generated from templates containing exon 4 of the rat IGF-I gene (a 376-base pairSau3AI–EcoRI fragment) or 18 S rRNA (Ambion). Protected probes were denatured, electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and exposed to X-Omat AR film for 1–2 days. The protected bands corresponding to IGF-I mRNA and 18 S rRNA were scanned using an Agfa Arcus II scanner, and densitometric analysis was performed using the MacBAS version 2.31 computer program (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). The level of IGF-I mRNA was normalized for the amount of 18 S rRNA and analyzed as relative abundance to untreated control samples. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was carried out using established protocols (31Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 32Gibson U. Heid C. Williams P.

The primers (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) and TaqMan probes (synthesized by Applied Biosystems) for the quantitation of the GHR, IGF-1, fatty acid transport protein (FATP), c-fos, and ANF transcripts were designed using the primer design software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) (TableI). The primers and TaqMan probe for 18 S rRNA were purchased from a commercial vendor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 18 S probe was labeled with reporter fluorescent dyes VIC and the GHR, IGF-1, FATP, c-fos, and ANF probes with 6-carboxyfluorescein. The relative efficiencies of the GHR and IGF-1 primers/probe sets and the 18 S primer/probe pair were tested by subjecting serial dilutions of a single RNA sample from each of the tissues analyzed to real time RT-PCR analysis. The plot of log input versus ΔCT was <0.1, which satisfies the previously established criterion for equivalence of efficiency of amplification (34PerkinElmer Applied, Biosystems.User Bulletin 2: ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1997Google Scholar). CT, or threshold cycle, represents the PCR cycle at which an increase in reporter fluorescence above a base-line signal can first be detected, and ΔCT refers to the difference between the threshold cycles for the target and the reference. After confirming that the efficiencies of amplification of the gene of interest (e.g.GHR) and 18 S transcripts were approximately equal, the amount of the transcripts for the specific gene relative to the 18 S transcript was determined by using the comparative CT (separate tube) method (34PerkinElmer Applied, Biosystems.User Bulletin 2: ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1997Google Scholar). The comparative CT method is similar to the conventional standard curve method, except it uses arithmetic formulas to achieve the same result for relative quantitation. The amount of target, normalized to an endogenous reference and relative to a calibrator is given by the following formula: -fold induction = 2ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = (CT GI (unknown sample) − CT 18 S (unknown sample)) − (CT GI (adult heart) − CT18 S (adult heart)); GI represents the gene of interest (e.g. GHR). Briefly, 2-ng aliquots of total RNA were analyzed using the One-Tube RT-PCR protocol (Applied Biosystems). Following reverse transcription at 48 °C for 30 min, the samples were subjected to PCR analysis using the following cycling parameters: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 15 s → 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in individual assays performed on two or more occasions.Table ISequence of primer and probe sets for TaqMan RT-PCR assayGene/transcriptPrimer/probeSequenceRat GHRForwardCTACTTCTGTGAGTCAGATGCCAAAReverseTGGTGATGTAAATGTCCTCTTGGTTProbe (FAM)CGCTGCGGCCCCTCACATGRat IGF-1ForwardCCGGACCAGAGACCCTTTGReverseCCTGTGGGCTTGTTGAAGTAAAAProbe (FAM)AAGAGCGTCCACCAGCTFATPForwardATGGATGATCGGCTATTTACATCTReverseGTAGGCAGTCATAGAGCACATCGTProbe (FAM)CCTTCGGCCACCATTRat skeletal α-actinForwardTCAGGCGGTGCTGTCTCTCTReverseTCCCCAGAATCCAACACGATProbe (FAM)TGCCTCCGGCCGAACCACCRat heart myosin light chain 2ForwardTCAACGCCTTCAAGGTGTTTGReverseTCAGCATCTCCCGGACATAGTProbe (FAM)CCCCGAAGGCAAAGGGTCGCRat c-fosForwardGGGACAGCCTTTCCTACTACCATTReverseCGCAAAAGTCCTGTGTGTTGAProbe (FAM)CCAGCCGACTCCTTCTCCAGCATG18 SForwardProprietary (Applied Biosystems)ReverseProprietary (Applied Biosystems)Probe (V1C)Proprietary (Applied Biosystems)5′-End reporter dyes were FAM (6-carboxylfluorescein) and VIC (proprietary; Applied Biosystems).

Open table in a new tab 5′-End reporter dyes were FAM (6-carboxylfluorescein) and VIC (proprietary; Applied Biosystems). The quencher fluorescent dye at the 3′-end was TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) for all probes. For biochemical activation experiments, serum-starved cardiomyocytes were treated with rGH (500–1250 ng/ml) or vehicle for the indicated duration. The pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in fusion lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 10–15-μg aliquots of the detergent extracts were resolved under reduced conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western transfer of proteins and blocking of Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 2% bovine serum albumin were performed as previously described (36Kim S.O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.S.

Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated dilutions of antibodies against total MAPK (1 μg/ml), phospho-MAPK (1:20,000), phosphotyrosine-STAT5 (1:5000), phospho-Akt (1:1000), anti-JAK2 (1:1000), anti-GHR (1:1000), anti-Glut1 (1:2500), anti-Glut4 (1:2500), or anti-β-actin (1:500).

Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) and anti-MAPK affinity-purified rabbit antibody (directed at residues 333–367 of rat ERK1; recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-activated (anti-phospho-) MAPK affinity-purified rabbit antibody (recognizing the dually phosphorylated Thr183 and Tyr185 residues that correspond to the active forms of ERK1 and ERK2) was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Anti-phospho-Akt (specifically recognizing Akt phosphorylated at Ser473) affinity-purified rabbit antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine-STAT5 polyclonal antibody (raised against a phosphopeptide surrounding phosphorylated Tyr694 of murine STAT5A, which is conserved in both STAT5A and STAT5B) was obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc.

Nitric oxide donors and PKG activators facilitated pinacidil-induced KATP channel activities in a concentration-dependent manner, and a selective PKG inhibitor abrogated these effects. In contrast, neither a selective protein kinase A (PKA) activator nor inhibitor had any effect on KATP channels at concentrations up to 100 and 10 μm, respectively. Exogenous PKG, in the presence of both cGMP and ATP, increased channel activity, while the catalytic subunit of PKA had no effect. PKG activity was prevented by heat inactivation, replacing ATP with adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP), removing Mg2+from the internal solution, applying a PKG inhibitor, or by adding exogenous protein phosphatase 2A. The effects of cGMP analogs and PKG were observed under conditions in which PKA was repressed by a selective PKA inhibitor. The results suggest that KATPchannels are regulated by a PKG-signaling pathway that acts via PKG-dependent phosphorylation. This mechanism may, at least in part, contribute to a signaling pathway that induces ischemic preconditioning in rabbit ventricular myocytes.

Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (6961) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was shown that phosphorylation levels decrease during ischemia in nonpreconditioned hearts, whereas they increase during ischemia in preconditioned hearts (3Weinbrenner C. Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2383-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A number of cellular components, including cytoskeletal and stress proteins, have been proposed as potential phosphorylation targets in the ischemic preconditioned heart (4Auchampach J.A. Gross G.J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: H829-H839PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the studies on the contribution of phosphorylation to KATP channel activity to the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning have centered on the role of protein kinase C. Protein kinase C may act as a link between one or more receptor-mediated pathways and increased KATP channel activity and thus lead to ischemic preconditioning (9Light P.E. Sabir A.A. Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. French R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The release of endogenous substances, such as adenosine, bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), and prostacyclin (10Parratt J.R.

These substances increase cGMP via direct stimulation of myocardial cells or via the endothelium. It was reported that the cGMP levels in preconditioned hearts are higher than in nonpreconditioned hearts (13Yamaguchi F. Nasa Y. Yabe K. Ohba S. Hashizume Y. Ohaku H. Furuhama K. Takeo S. Heart Vessels. 1997; 12: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Billman G.E. FASEB. J. 1990; 4: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Iliodromitis E.K. Papadopoulos C.C. Markianos M. Paraskevaidis I.A. Kyriakides Z.S. Kremastinos D.T. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since cGMP can induce protein phosphorylation via protein kinase G (PKG) activation, the involvement of PKG-dependent phosphorylation in ischemic preconditioning is expected. To date, however, the role of PKG in ischemic preconditioning and the possible PKG target proteins in this process are not well understood.There is evidence that KATP channels have potential phosphorylation sites, including serine/threonine residues (16Ashford M.L.

Cho K.P. Chae S.W. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since PKG is a serine/threonine protein kinase, it is likely that PKG leads to phosphorylation of KATP channels and ischemic preconditioning. In fact, the regulation of KATP channels by cGMP was recently shown in follicle-enclosed oocytes (21Sakuta H. Okamoto K. Watanabe Y. Jpn. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that this effect was mediated by PKG activation. However, there is no direct evidence that PKG activates KATP channels.In this study, we investigated the role of PKG-dependent phosphorylation in modulating KATP channels using isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. The experiments examined the signal transduction pathways involved in PKG-dependent phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that the NO/cGMP/PKG-signaling pathway facilitates the activity of KATP channels via phosphorylation. Our findings may be important for understanding the mechanism by which PKG acts as a link in one or more known receptor-mediated pathways to increase KATP channel activity during ischemic preconditioning.DISCUSSIONIn cardiac muscle, KATP channels, which open when the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) falls below a critical level, are known to be involved in ischemic preconditioning, a mechanism that protects the heart against ischemic injury (37Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar, 38Cameron J.S. Baghdady R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Duncker D.J. Verdouw P.D. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2000; 14: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to the more obvious effect of diminishing [ATP]i on the activation of this channel, various extracellular and intracellular modulators, such as adenosine (40Kim E. Han J. Ho W. Earm Y.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H325-H333PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (41Zhu Z. Li Y.L. Li D.P. He R.R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), ADP (42Han J. Kim E. Ho W.K. Earm Y.E. Heart Vessels. 1995; 9: 94-96Google Scholar), and lactate (43Han J. So I. Kim E.Y. Earm Y.E. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have been proposed to stimulate KATPchannel activity and thus contribute to ischemic preconditioning. The cGMP/PKG-pathway has also been suggested to play a cardioprotective role against ischemic-reperfusion injury (10Parratt J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Parratt J. J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 1996; 91: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that the modulation of Ca2+ availability (44Lincoln T.M. Keely S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 676: 230-244Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Wahler G.M. Dollinger S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C45-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reducing myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ (46Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and vasodilation with antiplatelet effects (47Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) were involved in cardioprotectivity. Although the cGMP/PKG-pathway and KATPchannels have both been implicated in mediating the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning, the signaling mechanism by which they are linked remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which PKG activates KATPchannels and thus could link these two effectors in a signaling pathway that produces cardioprotection during ischemic preconditioning.Our findings demonstrate that NO donors and PKG activators facilitate the pinacidil-induced KATP channel activity, and a selective PKG inhibitor prevents their effects. PKG, in the presence of both cGMP and ATP, increases the channel activity. This action of PKG is prevented by heat inactivation, replacing ATP with ATPγS (a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP), removing Mg2+ from the internal solution, applying a PKG inhibitor, or adding exogenous PP2A. Taken together, these results imply that a series of signal transduction pathways is involved in the regulation of KATPchannels; NO donors release NO, which activates guanylate cyclase in cardiac myocytes, causing cGMP accumulation and the activation of PKG, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates the KATPchannels.However, some previous studies reported contradictory results. Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NO potentiated the KATPchannel activity produced by K+ channel openers in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Under the same conditions, however, these investigators found that 8-Br-cGMP inhibited KATP channels. Therefore, they suggested that the mechanism of the NO-induced potentiation of KATP channels was independent of the cGMP/PKG-signaling pathway in the heart. In addition, Tsuura et al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that in rat ventricular myocytes, NO donors had no effect on KATP channels. Differences in experimental conditions and animal species between their study and ours may be responsible for the discrepancies in results.The major variations in experimental conditions are the mode of patch recordings and the compounds used. Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Tsuuraet al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) carried out experiments using the whole-cell and cell-attached modes of the patch-clamp method, whereas we only used the cell-attached mode. It is difficult to know how the mode of patch clamping affects the action of NO/cGMP on KATP channels. Since our study showed that the effect of NO/cGMP on KATPchannels was not direct, but required a series of signal transductions involving PKG activation and phosphorylation, it is plausible that dialysis of the cellular components during whole-cell patch clamping attenuated the effect of NO/cGMP.Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) used 8-Br-cGMP (100–500 μm), claiming that it is a specific activator of PKG. However, this compound has several major limitations that might influence the way in which their experimental data should be interpreted. First, 8-Br-cGMP at 100–500 μm can also strongly activate PKA because half-maximal stimulation of PKA occurs at 2.8–12 μm8-Br-cGMP (36Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, 8-Br-cGMP is hydrolyzed by certain phosphodiesterases, generating the corresponding 5′-monophosphate analogs and, subsequently, the nucleoside analogs (36Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Third, 8-Br-cGMP is as polar as cAMP (48Sandberg M. Butt E. Nolte C. Fischer L. Halbrugge M. Beltman J. Jahnsen T. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which implies insufficient membrane permeability. Therefore, it is unclear whether the 8-Br-cGMP-mediated effects on KATP channels observed by Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indeed occurred via PKG. In our study, to avoid misinterpretation of the experimental data, we utilized cyclic nucleotide analogs as new biochemical tools. These analogs are highly membrane-permeable, stable against phosphodiesterase hydrolysis, and display sufficient PKG/PKA specificity. (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS was used as a PKG activator, (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS as a PKG inhibitor, (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS as a PKA activator, and (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS as a PKA inhibitor. Since (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS exhibits sufficient selectivity for PKG versus PKA (34Butt E. Pöhler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), this compound is the best choice for triggering PKG activation. (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS was found to be the most potent inhibitor of PKG and inhibited PKG more than 300 times more potently than PKA (34Butt E. Pöhler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS was reported to be the best specific activator of PKA and a 300-fold less potent activator of PKG (35Genieser H.G. Winkler E. Butt E. Zorn M. Schulz S. Iwitzki F. Störmann R. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Ruchaud S. Lanotte M. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 234: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS is a better inhibitor of PKA (49Maronde E. Wicht H. Tasken K. Genieser H.G. Dehghani F. Olcese J. Korf H.W. J. Pineal Res. 1999; 27: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although cGMP and cAMP analogs normally have effects on the PKG and PKA pathways, respectively, it should be recognized that high concentrations of cGMP analogs can at least partially affect PKA signaling, and the converse is also true for cAMP analogs. Therefore, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using these analogs to determine the relative potencies of the activators and inhibitors. We found that (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS facilitated channel activity at concentrations of up to 100 μm and (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS inhibited the channel activity at concentrations of up to 10 μm, whereas (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS and (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS had no effect on the channels at concentrations of up to 100 and 10 μm, respectively. Additionally, we observed the effects of NO/cGMP analogs under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS. These results ruled out the importance of PKA in KATP channel regulation, indicating that the observed effects of NO/cGMP analogs are truly PKG-mediated.If this interpretation were correct, one would expect that activation of PKG would also directly increase KATP channel activity, even in excised patches. Neither Tsuura et al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) nor Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) directly tested the effect of PKG on KATP channels. We tested the effects of exogenous PKG using inside-out patches. Since PKG and PKA share some similarities in protein substrate sequence specificity, it is possible that PKG phosphorylates PKA-selective sites. To determine which is the more potent kinase in activating KATP channels, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using PKG and PKA (catalytic subunit). This experiment produced the following lines of evidence clearly showing that PKG acts directly on the KATPchannels: (a) in contrast to PKG, the catalytic subunit of PKA at the same concentration ranges had no effect on the channel (data not shown); (b) the stimulating effects of PKG still occurred under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS; and (c) KATP channel stimulation by PKG was reversibly inhibited by (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS.The preceding findings strongly suggest that KATP channels are stimulated by PKG but not by PKA. If PKG phosphorylated KATP channels directly, one would expect that protein phosphatase could inhibit PKG action. Our findings demonstrated that an endogenous membrane-associated PP2A was responsible for the reversal of PKG-mediated activation of KATP channels and that exogenous PP2A inhibited PKG-induced KATP channel activity. Furthermore, replacement of ATP with ATPγS and removal of Mg2+ from the internal solution prevented the effect of PKG. Together, these results show that PKG activates KATPchannels by an apparent phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the activity of a KATP channel depends on its net phosphorylation state, and this in turn depends on the balance between opposing PKG and phosphatase activities. Presumably, these processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation provide a mechanism by which KATP channel activity can be reversibly controlled. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first direct evidence that KATP channels can be opened through PKG-dependent phosphorylation in rabbit ventricular myocytes. Protein phosphorylation is a putative effector mechanism in the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning (1Rapundalo S.T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 559-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a phenomenon whereby a brief period of ischemia and reperfusion can protect the heart against subsequent prolonged ischemia and reperfusion injury (2Murry C.E.

Indeed, it was shown that phosphorylation levels decrease during ischemia in nonpreconditioned hearts, whereas they increase during ischemia in preconditioned hearts (3Weinbrenner C. Liu G.S.

Gross G.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Van Winkle D.M. Chien G.L. Wolff R.A. Soifer B.E. Kuzume K. Davis R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H829-H839PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the studies on the contribution of phosphorylation to KATP channel activity to the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning have centered on the role of protein kinase C. Protein kinase C may act as a link between one or more receptor-mediated pathways and increased KATP channel activity and thus lead to ischemic preconditioning (9Light P.E. Sabir A.A. Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. French R.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The release of endogenous substances, such as adenosine, bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), and prostacyclin (10Parratt J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Parratt J. J. Mol. Cell.

These substances increase cGMP via direct stimulation of myocardial cells or via the endothelium. It was reported that the cGMP levels in preconditioned hearts are higher than in nonpreconditioned hearts (13Yamaguchi F. Nasa Y. Yabe K. Ohba S. Hashizume Y. Ohaku H. Furuhama K. Takeo S. Heart Vessels. 1997; 12: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Billman G.E. FASEB. J. 1990; 4: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Iliodromitis E.K. Papadopoulos C.C.

Since cGMP can induce protein phosphorylation via protein kinase G (PKG) activation, the involvement of PKG-dependent phosphorylation in ischemic preconditioning is expected. To date, however, the role of PKG in ischemic preconditioning and the possible PKG target proteins in this process are not well understood. There is evidence that KATP channels have potential phosphorylation sites, including serine/threonine residues (16Ashford M.L. Bond C.T. Blair T.A. Adelman J.P.

Cho K.P. Chae S.W. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since PKG is a serine/threonine protein kinase, it is likely that PKG leads to phosphorylation of KATP channels and ischemic preconditioning. In fact, the regulation of KATP channels by cGMP was recently shown in follicle-enclosed oocytes (21Sakuta H. Okamoto K. Watanabe Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 61: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Sakuta H Okamoto K. Tandai M. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that this effect was mediated by PKG activation. However, there is no direct evidence that PKG activates KATP channels. In this study, we investigated the role of PKG-dependent phosphorylation in modulating KATP channels using isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. The experiments examined the signal transduction pathways involved in PKG-dependent phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that the NO/cGMP/PKG-signaling pathway facilitates the activity of KATP channels via phosphorylation. Our findings may be important for understanding the mechanism by which PKG acts as a link in one or more known receptor-mediated pathways to increase KATP channel activity during ischemic preconditioning. DISCUSSIONIn cardiac muscle, KATP channels, which open when the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) falls below a critical level, are known to be involved in ischemic preconditioning, a mechanism that protects the heart against ischemic injury (37Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar, 38Cameron J.S. Baghdady R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Duncker D.J. Verdouw P.D. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2000; 14: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to the more obvious effect of diminishing [ATP]i on the activation of this channel, various extracellular and intracellular modulators, such as adenosine (40Kim E. Han J. Ho W. Earm Y.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H325-H333PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (41Zhu Z. Li Y.L. Li D.P. He R.R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

Earm Y.E. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have been proposed to stimulate KATPchannel activity and thus contribute to ischemic preconditioning. The cGMP/PKG-pathway has also been suggested to play a cardioprotective role against ischemic-reperfusion injury (10Parratt J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Parratt J. J. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 1980; 676: 230-244Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Wahler G.M. Dollinger S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C45-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reducing myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ (46Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and vasodilation with antiplatelet effects (47Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) were involved in cardioprotectivity. Although the cGMP/PKG-pathway and KATPchannels have both been implicated in mediating the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning, the signaling mechanism by which they are linked remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which PKG activates KATPchannels and thus could link these two effectors in a signaling pathway that produces cardioprotection during ischemic preconditioning.Our findings demonstrate that NO donors and PKG activators facilitate the pinacidil-induced KATP channel activity, and a selective PKG inhibitor prevents their effects. PKG, in the presence of both cGMP and ATP, increases the channel activity. This action of PKG is prevented by heat inactivation, replacing ATP with ATPγS (a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP), removing Mg2+ from the internal solution, applying a PKG inhibitor, or adding exogenous PP2A. Taken together, these results imply that a series of signal transduction pathways is involved in the regulation of KATPchannels; NO donors release NO, which activates guanylate cyclase in cardiac myocytes, causing cGMP accumulation and the activation of PKG, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates the KATPchannels.However, some previous studies reported contradictory results. Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NO potentiated the KATPchannel activity produced by K+ channel openers in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Under the same conditions, however, these investigators found that 8-Br-cGMP inhibited KATP channels. Therefore, they suggested that the mechanism of the NO-induced potentiation of KATP channels was independent of the cGMP/PKG-signaling pathway in the heart. In addition, Tsuura et al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that in rat ventricular myocytes, NO donors had no effect on KATP channels. Differences in experimental conditions and animal species between their study and ours may be responsible for the discrepancies in results.The major variations in experimental conditions are the mode of patch recordings and the compounds used. Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Tsuuraet al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) carried out experiments using the whole-cell and cell-attached modes of the patch-clamp method, whereas we only used the cell-attached mode. It is difficult to know how the mode of patch clamping affects the action of NO/cGMP on KATP channels. Since our study showed that the effect of NO/cGMP on KATPchannels was not direct, but required a series of signal transductions involving PKG activation and phosphorylation, it is plausible that dialysis of the cellular components during whole-cell patch clamping attenuated the effect of NO/cGMP.Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) used 8-Br-cGMP (100–500 μm), claiming that it is a specific activator of PKG. However, this compound has several major limitations that might influence the way in which their experimental data should be interpreted. First, 8-Br-cGMP at 100–500 μm can also strongly activate PKA because half-maximal stimulation of PKA occurs at 2.8–12 μm8-Br-cGMP (36Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, 8-Br-cGMP is hydrolyzed by certain phosphodiesterases, generating the corresponding 5′-monophosphate analogs and, subsequently, the nucleoside analogs (36Butt E. Nolte C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Third, 8-Br-cGMP is as polar as cAMP (48Sandberg M. Butt E. Nolte C. Fischer L. Halbrugge M. Beltman J. Jahnsen T. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which implies insufficient membrane permeability. Therefore, it is unclear whether the 8-Br-cGMP-mediated effects on KATP channels observed by Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indeed occurred via PKG. In our study, to avoid misinterpretation of the experimental data, we utilized cyclic nucleotide analogs as new biochemical tools. These analogs are highly membrane-permeable, stable against phosphodiesterase hydrolysis, and display sufficient PKG/PKA specificity. (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS was used as a PKG activator, (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS as a PKG inhibitor, (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS as a PKA activator, and (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS as a PKA inhibitor. Since (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS exhibits sufficient selectivity for PKG versus PKA (34Butt E. Pöhler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), this compound is the best choice for triggering PKG activation. (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS was found to be the most potent inhibitor of PKG and inhibited PKG more than 300 times more potently than PKA (34Butt E. Pöhler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS was reported to be the best specific activator of PKA and a 300-fold less potent activator of PKG (35Genieser H.G. Winkler E. Butt E. Zorn M. Schulz S. Iwitzki F. Störmann R. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Ruchaud S. Lanotte M. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 234: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS is a better inhibitor of PKA (49Maronde E. Wicht H. Tasken K. Genieser H.G. Dehghani F. Olcese J. Korf H.W. J. Pineal Res. 1999; 27: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although cGMP and cAMP analogs normally have effects on the PKG and PKA pathways, respectively, it should be recognized that high concentrations of cGMP analogs can at least partially affect PKA signaling, and the converse is also true for cAMP analogs. Therefore, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using these analogs to determine the relative potencies of the activators and inhibitors. We found that (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS facilitated channel activity at concentrations of up to 100 μm and (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS inhibited the channel activity at concentrations of up to 10 μm, whereas (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS and (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS had no effect on the channels at concentrations of up to 100 and 10 μm, respectively. Additionally, we observed the effects of NO/cGMP analogs under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS. These results ruled out the importance of PKA in KATP channel regulation, indicating that the observed effects of NO/cGMP analogs are truly PKG-mediated.If this interpretation were correct, one would expect that activation of PKG would also directly increase KATP channel activity, even in excised patches. Neither Tsuura et al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) nor Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) directly tested the effect of PKG on KATP channels. We tested the effects of exogenous PKG using inside-out patches. Since PKG and PKA share some similarities in protein substrate sequence specificity, it is possible that PKG phosphorylates PKA-selective sites. To determine which is the more potent kinase in activating KATP channels, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using PKG and PKA (catalytic subunit). This experiment produced the following lines of evidence clearly showing that PKG acts directly on the KATPchannels: (a) in contrast to PKG, the catalytic subunit of PKA at the same concentration ranges had no effect on the channel (data not shown); (b) the stimulating effects of PKG still occurred under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS; and (c) KATP channel stimulation by PKG was reversibly inhibited by (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS.The preceding findings strongly suggest that KATP channels are stimulated by PKG but not by PKA. If PKG phosphorylated KATP channels directly, one would expect that protein phosphatase could inhibit PKG action. Our findings demonstrated that an endogenous membrane-associated PP2A was responsible for the reversal of PKG-mediated activation of KATP channels and that exogenous PP2A inhibited PKG-induced KATP channel activity. Furthermore, replacement of ATP with ATPγS and removal of Mg2+ from the internal solution prevented the effect of PKG. Together, these results show that PKG activates KATPchannels by an apparent phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the activity of a KATP channel depends on its net phosphorylation state, and this in turn depends on the balance between opposing PKG and phosphatase activities. Presumably, these processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation provide a mechanism by which KATP channel activity can be reversibly controlled. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first direct evidence that KATP channels can be opened through PKG-dependent phosphorylation in rabbit ventricular myocytes. In cardiac muscle, KATP channels, which open when the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) falls below a critical level, are known to be involved in ischemic preconditioning, a mechanism that protects the heart against ischemic injury (37Noma A.

(Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS was reported to be the best specific activator of PKA and a 300-fold less potent activator of PKG (35Genieser H.G. Winkler E. Butt E. Zorn M. Schulz S. Iwitzki F. Störmann R. Jastorff B. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Ruchaud S. Lanotte M. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 234: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS is a better inhibitor of PKA (49Maronde E. Wicht H. Tasken K. Genieser H.G. Dehghani F. Olcese J. Korf H.W. J. Pineal Res. 1999; 27: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although cGMP and cAMP analogs normally have effects on the PKG and PKA pathways, respectively, it should be recognized that high concentrations of cGMP analogs can at least partially affect PKA signaling, and the converse is also true for cAMP analogs. Therefore, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using these analogs to determine the relative potencies of the activators and inhibitors. We found that (Sp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS facilitated channel activity at concentrations of up to 100 μm and (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS inhibited the channel activity at concentrations of up to 10 μm, whereas (Sp)-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS and (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS had no effect on the channels at concentrations of up to 100 and 10 μm, respectively. Additionally, we observed the effects of NO/cGMP analogs under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS. These results ruled out the importance of PKA in KATP channel regulation, indicating that the observed effects of NO/cGMP analogs are truly PKG-mediated. If this interpretation were correct, one would expect that activation of PKG would also directly increase KATP channel activity, even in excised patches. Neither Tsuura et al. (24Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Hayashi S. Sakamoto K. Horie M. Seino Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) nor Shinbo and Iijima (27Shinbo A. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) directly tested the effect of PKG on KATP channels. We tested the effects of exogenous PKG using inside-out patches. Since PKG and PKA share some similarities in protein substrate sequence specificity, it is possible that PKG phosphorylates PKA-selective sites. To determine which is the more potent kinase in activating KATP channels, we carefully constructed concentration-response curves using PKG and PKA (catalytic subunit). This experiment produced the following lines of evidence clearly showing that PKG acts directly on the KATPchannels: (a) in contrast to PKG, the catalytic subunit of PKA at the same concentration ranges had no effect on the channel (data not shown); (b) the stimulating effects of PKG still occurred under conditions in which PKA was inhibited by (Rp)-8-pCPT-cAMPS; and (c) KATP channel stimulation by PKG was reversibly inhibited by (Rp)-8-Br-PEP-cGMPS. The preceding findings strongly suggest that KATP channels are stimulated by PKG but not by PKA. If PKG phosphorylated KATP channels directly, one would expect that protein phosphatase could inhibit PKG action. Our findings demonstrated that an endogenous membrane-associated PP2A was responsible for the reversal of PKG-mediated activation of KATP channels and that exogenous PP2A inhibited PKG-induced KATP channel activity. Furthermore, replacement of ATP with ATPγS and removal of Mg2+ from the internal solution prevented the effect of PKG. Together, these results show that PKG activates KATPchannels by an apparent phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the activity of a KATP channel depends on its net phosphorylation state, and this in turn depends on the balance between opposing PKG and phosphatase activities. Presumably, these processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation provide a mechanism by which KATP channel activity can be reversibly controlled. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first direct evidence that KATP channels can be opened through PKG-dependent phosphorylation in rabbit ventricular myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2099649920,"Werner's syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging. The gene responsible for WS encodes a protein homologous to Escherichia coli RecQ. Here we describe a novel Werner helicase interacting protein (WHIP), which interacts with the N-terminal portion of Werner protein (WRN), containing the exonuclease domain. WHIP, which shows homology to replication factor C family proteins, is conserved from E. coli to human. Ectopically expressed WHIP and WRN co-localized in granular structures in the nucleus. The functional relationship between WHIP and WRN was indicated by genetic analysis of yeast cells. Disruptants of the SGS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the WRN homologue in yeast, show an accelerated aging phenotype and high sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate as compared with wild-type cells. Disruption of the yeast WHIP (yWHIP) gene in wild-type cells and sgs1 disruptants resulted in slightly accelerated aging and enhancement of the premature aging phenotype of sgs1 disruptants, respectively. In contrast, disruption of the yWHIP gene partially alleviated the sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate of sgs1 disruptants."

The de-epoxidation reaction was investigated in an in vitro system using reconstituted light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and a thylakoid raw extract enriched in the enzyme Vx de-epoxidase. Reconstitution of LHCII with varying carotenoids was performed to replace lutein and/or neoxanthin, which are bound to the native complex, by Vx. Recombinant LHCII containing either 2 lutein and 1 Vx or 1.6 Vx and 1.1 neoxanthin or 2.8 Vx per monomer were studied. Vx de-epoxidation was inducible for all complexes after the addition of Vx de-epoxidase but to different extents and with different kinetics in each complex. Analysis of the kinetics indicated that the three possible Vx binding sites have at least two, and perhaps three, specific rate constants for de-epoxidation. In particular, Vx bound to one of the two lutein binding sites of the native complex, most likely L1, was not at all or only at a slow rate convertible to Zx. In reisolated LHCII, newly formed Zx almost stoichiometrically replaced the transformed Vx, indicating that LHCII and Vx de-epoxidase stayed in close contact during the de-epoxidation reactions and that no release of carotenoids occurred.

According to biochemical analysis, LHCII binds two lutein (Lu), 1 neoxanthin (Nx), and substoichiometric amounts of violaxanthin (Vx)/monomer (6Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol.

Two xanthophylls, which are associated with the two central membrane-spanning α-helices, have been identified in the crystal structure and tentatively assigned to Lu (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N.

Data obtained from site-directed mutagenesis of LHCII indicated that the Nx binding site is most likely associated with the more peripheral transmembrane helix (9Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C.

In CP29 (or Lhcb4), one of the minor Chl a/b binding proteins of PSII, only the two Lu binding sites, called L1 and L2, seem to be occupied, one by Lu and the other by Vx or Nx (10Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 0056-10061Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

It was shown that Vx could bind to all binding sites of the native complex, the two Lu (L1 and L2) as well as the Nx binding site, albeit with lower affinity than Lu and Nx. In the absence of other carotenoids during reconstitution, 2–3 Vx were found to bind to LHCII (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol.

The dissipation of excess light energy in the antenna of PSII, frequently measured as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chl fluorescence, is supposed to be important for the protection of plants against photo-oxidative damage (13Demmig-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 14Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The de-epoxidation of Vx to zeaxanthin (Zx) via the intermediate antheraxanthin (Ax) in the xanthophyll cycle plays a crucial role in the ΔpH-dependent qE-component of NPQ (16Niyogi K.K.

A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under in vivo conditions, xanthophyll conversion occurs in various antenna subcomplexes with different kinetics and to a different extent, which seems to be related to distinct functions of single subcomplexes in different components of NPQ (18Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether the differential xanthophyll conversion in single antenna complexes is determined by specific carotenoid binding sites or simply by a different accessibility of the Vx de-epoxidase (VxDE) to distinct antenna complexes. In this work, we investigated the possible role of different carotenoid binding sites for Vx convertibility using the most abundant Chl a/b protein, LHCII, as a model system for all LHC proteins. Pigments and overexpressed Lhcb1*2 were isolated as described (12Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reconstitution was performed by detergent exchange as described (23Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuehlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) at a Chl a/b ratio of 3 and a Chl and xanthophyll concentration of 0.8 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. Xanthophylls were added either as single species or as 1:1 mixtures. Vx/Zx ratios for reconstitution of Nx·Vx·Zx complexes were as depicted in Fig. 2. Because reconstituted LHCII was separated from unbound pigments by sucrose density centrifugation, sucrose was omitted from the solubilization buffer. 200 μl of reconstitution sample were applied to 11 ml of sucrose gradients, generated by one freeze-thaw cycle (0.4m sucrose, 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, 0.05% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside), and centrifuged at 280,000 ×g for 17 h at 4 °C. Pigments were extracted from all samples following the method of (24Martinson T.A. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described in (18Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). VxDE extracts were isolated from spinach essentially following the procedure described by Arvidsson et al. (25Arvidsson P.-O Bratt C.E. Carlsson M. Åkerlund H.-E. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 49: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Roughly, isolated thylakoids were broken by sonification at pH 5.1, and VxDE was released from the resulting membrane fragments by increasing the pH to 7.2 for the final sonification step. After centrifugation, VxDE was precipitated from the supernatant by differential (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and finally collected by ultracentrifugation (25Arvidsson P.-O Bratt C.E. Carlsson M. Åkerlund H.-E. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 49: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For de-epoxidation, VxDE extracts were diluted 15-fold with 0.4 m citrate-NaOH, pH 5.1. Recombinant LHCII or isolated Vx was mixed with monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) at a molar Vx/MGDG ratio of 1:30 and added to the assay yielding a final Vx concentration of about 100 nm. De-epoxidation, performed at 28 °C, was started by the addition of 30 mm ascorbate. For kinetic analysis, de-epoxidation was stopped by mixing the sample with 2-butanol at indicated time points. The pigment stoichiometry of complexes upon incubation with VxDE was determined after concentrating the sample in 30-kDa Centricon tubes (Amicon), resolubilization in 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and subsequent purification of monomeric complexes on sucrose gradients. The pigment composition of LHCII reconstituted with different carotenoids is summarized in Table I. 2.8–3.0 xanthophylls/monomer were determined in all complexes. In LHCII reconstituted in the presence of all major xanthophylls the data were compatible with a stoichiometry of 2 Lu and 1 Nx/monomer, whereas reconstitution with Vx and Nx in the absence of Lu yielded complexes containing 1.6 Vx and 1.1 Nx/monomer. Reconstitution of LHCII with Lu and Vx in the absence of Nx resulted in binding of 2 Lu and about 1 Vx/monomer, and with Vx as the single carotenoid species about 2.8 Vx were bound per LHCII protein.Table IPigment stoichiometries of different LHCII complexesLHCII complexPigment stoichiometry per 13 Chl (a + b)NxVxLuChl bChl aXanChl a/bNx·Vx·Lu1.0 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.011.9 ± 0.35.5 ± 0.47.5 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.2Vx2.8 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.27.6 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1Nx·Vx1.1 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.38.2 ± 0.32.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.5Vx·Lu1.1 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.28.1 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.1Pigments were extracted with 2-butanol from bands of monomeric LHCII obtained after sucrose density gradient centrifugation.

Under our experimental conditions, free Vx was fully converted to Zx by the VxDE within 10 min (Fig.1 A), with a transient accumulation of the intermediate Ax peaking at 2 min of incubation. A very similar result was obtained with Lu·Vx monomers containing 2 Lu and 1 Vx, although the kinetics was retarded by about a factor of 2 (Fig. 1 B) when compared with nonbound Vx. In LHCII containing 1.5 Vx and 1 Nx/monomer, de-epoxidation was even more strongly retarded. Moreover, the convertibility was restricted to about 50% of the total Vx, indicating a partial accessibility of Vx for de-epoxidation (Fig. 1 C). Replacement of all carotenoids by Vx led to a multiphasic kinetics of de-epoxidation; a fraction of about 60% was convertible to Zx within 30 min as before (Fig. 1,A and B), whereas the remaining portion showed a very slow turnover (Fig. 1 D). We determined the rate constants for both steps, Vx → Ax and Ax → Zx, of the de-epoxidation reactions in all experiments. Because the de-epoxidation follows a first-order reaction (26Härtel H. Lokstein H. Grimm B. Rank B. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Jahns P.

The time-dependent decay of Vx in Vx monomers (Fig.1 D), however, could only be modeled with at least two exponentials. For the rapidly convertible fraction (55–65%) of Vx, similar rate constants were determined as before, whereas the remaining fraction (35–45%) was characterized by a 10–20 times lower rate constant of about 0.01 min−1. Because of the few measuring points, several sets of exponentials yielded reasonable fits. Therefore, column B (under “Vx monomers”) in Table IIalso depicts a set of three exponentials with equivalent amplitudes representing three molecules of Vx. Obviously, three possible Vx binding sites have at least two and perhaps three specific rate constants for de-epoxidation. It is worth noting that the rate constant for the second step of de-epoxidation, Ax → Zx, was very similar in all complexes and was comparable with the conversion of unbound Vx to Ax.Table IIKinetics of Vx to Zx conversionParameterUnbound VxVx·Lu monomersVx·Nx monomersVx monomersVx·Zx·Nx monomersABmin−1k110.50.30.070.2 (0.55)0.6 (0.25)0.04k120.01 (0.45)0.1 (0.4)k130.02 (0.35)k20.70.60.80.6–0.80.6–0.80.8Rate constants were determined for the Vx to Zx conversion shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

We further investigated whether the reaction product Zx was re-bound (or stayed bound) to the LHCII complexes. For this purpose, samples were incubated for 70 min under conditions of de-epoxidation. Subsequently, pigmented protein complexes were separated from free pigment by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the pigment content of the resulting bands was analyzed by HPLC (summarized in Table III). To distinguish between VxDE-dependent shifts in pigment stoichiometry and potential pigment loss due to incubation temperature (28 °C) and the subsequent reconcentrating step, control samples in the absence of VxDE were also analyzed.Table IIIPigment stoichiometries of LHCII complexes after de-epoxidationPigment stoichiometriesNxVxLuZxChl bChl aΣ XanChl a + bXan/ChlDEPSVxControl, total pigment3.05.37.73.0130.230.0Control, monomers2.35.56.52.3120.190.0+ VxDE, total pigment0.62.44.98.13.0130.230.80+ VxDE, monomers0.71.45.36.72.1120.180.65Vx·NxControl, total pigment1.31.64.78.32.9130.220.0Control, monomers0.81.65.26.82.4120.200.0+ VxDE, total pigment1.10.90.73.99.12.7130.210.45+ VxDE, monomers0.91.20.35.16.92.4120.200.21Vx·LuControl, total pigment1.12.44.78.33.6130.280.0Control, monomers0.51.85.07.02.2120.180.0+ VxDE, total pigment0.13.11.24.58.54.5130.350.89+ VxDE, monomers0.11.70.45.07.02.2120.180.80Monomeric complexes were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and used for de-epoxidation experiments.

Data were normalized to 12 or 13 Chl (a + b). Mean values of two experiments are shown with deviations no larger than ±12%. Xan, xanthophylls; DEPS, de-epoxidation state (Zx/(Zx + Vx)). The de-epoxidation state (DEPS), defined as Zx/(Zx + Vx), of total pigment samples (i.e. the value shown for free pigment + monomers in Table III) of Nx·Vx-LHCII (0.45) and Vx-LHCII (0.8) after a 70-min VxDE treatment corresponded to the values obtained with the kinetic assays (Fig. 1, C and D). Only Vx·Lu-LHCII (0.9) exhibited a slightly decreased value when compared with the DEPS of 1.0 in the former experiment (Fig. 1 B). Comparing total pigment samples with reisolated monomers, a partial loss of xanthophylls and also of Chl was observed in all samples, including controls, which can be related to the incubation at 28 °C for 70 min. In comparison with untreated monomers (Table I), we observed a loss of about 0.5 Vx in Vx monomers and Vx·Lu complexes leading to 2.3 and 0.5 Vx, respectively. In Nx·Vx complexes, the Vx content remained unchanged whereas Nx was slightly reduced (TableIII). Newly formed Zx was bound to all LHCII complexes with different stoichiometries (Table III). In Vx-LHCII, 1.4 Zx were bound to the monomers while 0.7 Vx withstood the VxDE incubation. The fraction of VxDE-resistant Vx was even greater in Nx·Vx-LHCII, where 1.2 Vx and only 0.3 Zx were bound. The remaining 0.5 Vx in the control samples of Vx·Lu monomers was almost completely converted to 0.4 Zx with only minor amounts of Vx persisting VxDE treatment. Thus, somewhat reduced if similar DEPS values were found in the reisolated monomers as noted before in the kinetic analysis, indicating that the newly formed Zx molecules were rebound by or stayed bound to the complexes. De-epoxidation with Vx·Nx-LHCII containing 1.6 Vx and nearly 1 Nx/monomer (Fig. 1 C) resulted in a maximum DEPS of about 0.5, indicating that about 1 Vx/monomer was inaccessible for de-epoxidation. This partial conversion to Zx could result from two different restrictions. Assuming that the Vx molecules are bound to the two Lu binding sites, L1 and L2, of the native complex, de-epoxidation could be generally suppressed if one of the two Lu binding sites is occupied by Zx independently of the binding site. Alternatively, one specific binding site, either L1 or L2, could be unavailable for de-epoxidation, e.g. for structural reasons. We designed the following experimental approach to decide between these two possibilities. LHCII complexes were reconstituted with a mixture of Nx, Vx, and Zx yielding stoichiometries of 1 Nx/momomer in all cases but with Vx/Zx ratios varying between 1.9:0.5 and 0.03:1.9/monomer (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Bindicates an equivalent relative binding affinityKVx/Zx of 0.24 in L1 and L2. The absence of any biphasic behavior of the competition curve with a slope of 0.24 strongly suggests that L1 and L2 preferentially bind Zx with respect to Vx but do not differ in their relative affinities toward these carotenoids. We expected that no de-epoxidation would occur if the presence of Zx in one of the two Vx binding sites generally restricts de-epoxidation of the Vx present in these complexes. This should become particularly obvious in complex preparations with a Zx/Vx ratio ≥ 1. On the other hand, de-epoxidation of about 50% of the Vx should be observed again, if one specific binding site is inaccessible for de-epoxidation and if both binding sites have a similar affinity toward Vx and Zx. In fact, at all Vx/Zx ratios we found that de-epoxidation was limited to about 50% of the respective Vx pool. This is shown as an example for a Vx/Zx ratio of 1:1 in Fig.3. The rate constants for the reactions were in a similar range as in the respective experiments with Vx·Nx monomers (Table II). The observation that only 50% of Vx is convertible to Zx, irrespective of the Zx/Vx ratio in the reconstituted complexes, indicates that Vx is accessible to the VxDE only in one of the two Lu binding sites (L1 or L2). We have shown for the first time that Vx bound to solubilized LHCII can be de-epoxidized in vitro by partially purified VxDE prepared from spinach thylakoids. It has been found 2K. Hindehoffer, A. Lee, P. Thornber, and H. Y. Yamamoto, unpublished work. that purified VxDE did not de-epoxidize Vx bound to pigment protein fractions of LHCII even when the latter was supplemented with MGDG (19Yamamoto H.Y. Bassi R. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 539-563Google Scholar). In these experiments, it is most likely trimeric LHCII isolated from thylakoid membranes was used, whereas our data were obtained with recombinant monomeric LHCII. In experiments with the recombinant trimeric forms of the different complexes, however, we have also observed de-epoxidation, but to a lower extent (maximum 50% conversion) and at much slower rates (a factor of about 10; data not documented). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that Vx bound to trimeric LHCII is not readily accessible forin vitro de-epoxidation. Because our experiments were performed at 28 °C, Vx might have become accessible by thermally induced destabilization of the trimers. Incubation of complexes under de-epoxidation conditions and subsequent re-purification leads to a preferential loss of Chl a (compare Table Iand control monomers in Table III). The normalization of initially isolated versions of LHCIIb to 13 Chls and reisolated monomers to 12 Chls is justified by this loss. Otherwise, if a number of 12 Chls would be assumed in the original samples, the insertion of up to 1 Chl b after treatment for de-epoxidation had to be considered, which is very unlikely. Our pigment data indicate binding of almost 3 carotenoids/monomer in all complexes, in rough agreement with previous studies (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For LHCII containing either Vx as its single carotenoid species or Lu plus Vx, lower stoichiometries of 2.2–2.3 have also been reported (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These differences are most likely based on varying purification conditions and reflect a low affinity of Vx to the Nx binding site of the native protein. According to previous work (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we assume that in complexes containing 2 Lu and 1 Vx, the two Lu binding sites of the native complex, L1 and L2, are both occupied by Lu and that Vx is bound either to the Nx binding site of the native complex or to a peripheral site. The notion that Vx is most rapidly converted to Zx in complexes containing 2 Lu and 1 Vx could then be explained by assuming that Vx is easily accessible for VxDE at these sites. In complexes reconstituted with Vx and Nx, 1.6 Vx and 1 Nx were determined per monomer. Because Nx has a much higher affinity to the Nx binding site of the native complex in comparison with Vx (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), it is likely that in these complexes the Vx molecules are bound to the L1 and L2 site of LHCII. Our experiments have shown that only a portion of this Vx can be converted into Zx (Fig. 1 C) and that Vx bound to one specific site, either L1 or L2, is not available for de-epoxidation (Fig. 3). This may indicate that one of the two Lu binding sites essentially requires binding of a carotenoid, whereas the other one could, at least transiently, be empty. A similar conclusion has been drawn from recent studies with recombinant Lhcb4 (CP29) (10Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 0056-10061Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this monomeric antenna protein of PSII, the L1 site is occupied by Lu, whereas the L2 site can bind either Vx or Nx (10Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 0056-10061Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Vx bound to Lhcb4 is known to be de-epoxidized in vivo under high light stress (18Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus the proposed structural similarity among all Chl a/b-binding proteins would support the assumption that Vx bound to the site L2 of LHCII can be de-epoxidized to Zx, whereas the Vx bound to site L1 cannot. This is further in accordance with the observation that the L1 site is obligatory occupied by Lu in all Chl a/b-binding proteins analyzed so far, whereas the L2 site can be occupied by Vx to various extents in the different complexes (8Bassi R. Caffarri S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In LHCII complexes containing Vx as the single carotenoid species, all three binding sites are occupied by Vx. In contrast to the Vx·Nx monomers, Vx bound to both the L1 and L2 site was convertible to Zx. Obviously, the unexpected accessibility of Vx bound to L1 was related to the absence of Nx in these complexes. This interpretation would suggest a stabilizing function of Nx for the structure of LHCII. Because we did not observe a pronounced dissociation of these complexes, the lack of Nx may simply result in a slightly changed overall conformation providing an increased accessibility of Vx bound to L1. Two of the three Vx were rapidly convertible to Zx in these complexes with similar kinetics as found in the Lu·Vx and Vx·Nx monomers (Fig. 1, Table II). This finding confirms the conclusion that Vx bound to the L2 site and the Nx binding site of the native complex is easily accessible for de-epoxidation. Our analyses of the reaction kinetics indicated that Vx is de-epoxidized at different carotenoid binding sites at specific rates (Table II). It cannot be decided from our data whether this specificity is determined by different binding affinities of Vx to each site or by a different accessibility of VxDE to the three carotenoid binding sites. With the exception of the slowest phase, determined in the experiment with Vx monomers (about 0.01 min−1, Table II), the rate constants for de-epoxidation are in agreement with the kinetics found in earlier studies at saturating light intensities in intact leaves (26Härtel H. Lokstein H. Grimm B. Rank B. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or, under optimum conditions, in isolated thylakoids (28Siefermann D. Yamamoto H.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Pfündel E. Dilley R.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the kinetics determined with recombinant LHCII and VxDE extracts can be applied also to membrane bound antenna proteins. It is known that most of Vx present in thylakoid membranes is bound to PSI antenna proteins and to the minor PSII antenna proteins Lhcb4-6 but not to LHCII (8Bassi R. Caffarri S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto H.Y. Bassi R. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). According to the structural similarity among the different antenna proteins, the characteristics of Vx de-epoxidation at recombinant LHCII may be used as a model for all Chl a/b-binding proteins in higher plants. Furthermore, the analysis of Lu-deficient mutants of Arabidopsis have shown that Lu can presumably be replaced even under in vivo conditions by other xanthophylls, in particular Vx and Ax, without affecting the viability of the plants (30Pogson B. McDonald K.A. Truong M. Britton G. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Pogson B. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The kinetic analyses and the fact that the reaction product Zx is (re)bound to the LHC II complexes further provide new insights into the mechanism of de-epoxidation. The kinetic analyses have shown that, in contrast to the first step (Vx → Ax) of de-epoxidation, the kinetics of the second Ax → Zx step are nearly identical in all experiments and thus independent of the Vx binding site. This leads to ratios ofk2/k1(1,2,3) varying from 2 (in Vx·Lu monomers) to 80 (slowest phase in Vx monomers) indicating that both reactions are rate-limited by different factors. According to our data, the first step (Vx → Ax) seems to be kinetically controlled by the binding strength of Vx to the LHCII complex (or the accessibility of the VxDE to the binding site), whereas the Ax → Zx step may rather be rate-limited by processes related to the VxDE itself. It is tempting to speculate that the dynamic interaction of the intermediate Ax with VxDE (which is required to make the second epoxy group accessible to the active center of the enzyme) determines the kinetics of the second step. Because the Ax → Zx conversion follows similar kinetics in the presence and absence of LHCII complexes, the movement of Ax must be independent of antenna proteins. This lets us speculate that the intermediate Ax is not bound to the LHC II complexes but rather is associated with the VxDE. After de-epoxidation of the second epoxy group, the product Zx can be rebound by the LHCII complexes. It is unknown to what extent xanthophylls are released into the lipid phase after de-epoxidation under in vivo conditions. At least for LHCII and Lhcb4 it has been reported that occupation of some of the binding sites depends on the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (20Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Both a redistribution of xanthophyll cycle pigments among chlorophyll-binding proteins (20Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as well as a partial release into the lipid phase (21Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) can be assumed on the basis of these studies. Moreover, recent analyses of xanthophyll cycle mutants from Arabidopsis thalianaindicated that xanthophylls may serve important functions not only in energy dissipation but also as membrane stabilizers and antioxidants in the lipid phase (32Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 33Havaux M. Bonfils J.-P. Lütz C. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The latter characteristics resemble the proposed functions of tocopherols in the membrane (34Fryer M. Plant Cell Environ. 1992; 15: 381-392Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, at least a partial release of Zx into the lipid phase would make sense as judged from the physiological functions of xanthophylls. In our experiments with recombinant LHCII, however, the xanthophyll/Chl ratios of the de-epoxidized and control LHCII monomers were only slightly different in Vx complexes (0.18 and 0.19, respectively) and were identical for Nx·Vx-LHCII and Vx·Lu-LHCII, although Zx was also present in the free pigment zone (Table III). Obviously, the partial loss of xanthophylls was independent of the DEPS and was caused simply by the incubation at 28 °C. We conclude from this result that under our experimental conditions accessible Vx is converted to Zx and, provided that complexes do not fall apart, all newly formed Zx is rebound by the LHCII complexes. Considering the low concentrations of LHCII complexes and carotenoids in our assay, it can be assumed that LHCII and VxDE stay in close contact during the de-epoxidation reactions and that no release of carotenoids into the lipid phase occurs. In conclusion, our data support the view that the kinetics and the extent of Vx de-epoxidation is controlled by the carotenoid binding site of a distinct antenna protein. Thus, it is very likely that the differential xanthophyll conversion in single antenna complexes observed under in vivo conditions (18Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is determined by the characteristics of the Vx binding sites and not by the accessibility of VxDE to the antenna proteins. Further work is now needed to characterize the Vx de-epoxidation in other antenna proteins and to explore the influence of the xanthophyll conversion of protein modifications that occur under different light conditions (binding of protons, phosphorylation) and that are likely to be central to the regulation of light harvesting. The help of S. Raunser with the preparation of some of the reconstituted samples is gratefully acknowledged. Zx was a kind gift from Roche Diagnostics (Switzerland)."

By using parotid lobules from ad libitum fed rats stimulated with low doses of carbachol as anin vitro analog of resting secretion, we deduce from the composition of discharged proteins that secretion does not involve granule exocytosis. Rather, it derives from two other acinar export routes, the constitutive-like (stimulus-independent) pathway and the minor regulated pathway, which responds to low doses of cholinergic or β-adrenergic agonists (Castle, J. D., and Castle, A. M. (1996) J. Cell Sci. 109, 2591–2599). The protein composition collected in vitro mimics that collected from cannulated ducts of glands given low level stimulation in situ. Analysis of secretory trafficking along the two pathways of resting secretion has indicated that the constitutive-like pathway may pass through endosomes after diverging from the minor regulated pathway at a brefeldin A-sensitive branch point. The branch point is deduced to be distal to a common vesicular budding event by which both pathways originate from immature granules. Detectable perturbation of neither pathway in lobules was observed by wortmannin addition, and neither serves as a significant export route for lysosomal procathepsin B. These findings show that parotid acinar cells use low capacity, high sensitivity secretory pathways for resting secretion and reserve granule exocytosis, a high capacity, low sensitivity pathway, for massive salivary protein export during meals.

Macromolecular secretion is achieved by the intracellular transport pathway, culminating in exocytosis of post-Golgi carriers at the apical plasma membrane. In contrast, export of electrolytes and fluid is achieved by a transepithelial flux of ions and passive flow of water mediated by specific membrane-associated pumps and channels. Secretion is mostly neurally regulated with the discharge of macromolecules and of electrolytes and fluid being controlled differentially (1Castle D. Castle A. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 4-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the parotid gland, the rate of macromolecular (mostly protein) secretion is mainly controlled by sympathetic stimulation through β-adrenergic receptors. Rates of fluid and electrolyte secretion are mainly controlled by parasympathetic stimulation through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and, to a lesser extent, sympathetic stimulation through α-adrenergic receptors (see Refs. 2Asking B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1985; 124: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Asking B. Gjorstrup P. Acta Physiol.

Res. 1987; 66: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although these are the primary divisions in secretory signaling, they are not absolute. Indeed, the dilute secretion elicited by parasympathetic stimulation in situ (or muscarinic cholinergic agonistsin vitro) contains a protein content, whereas the protein-rich, low volume secretion produced by β-adrenergic agonists contains fluid and electrolytes. Furthermore, parasympathetically and sympathetically controlled signaling pathways are synergistic in enhancing the rates of protein export and fluid and electrolyte transport (4Asking B. Gjorstrup P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1980; 109: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 7Templeton D. Pfluegers Arch. 1980; 384: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Takemura H.

Thus alone and in combination, the signaling pathways enable acinar cells to vary the amount and composition of saliva over a wide range. The versatile secretory response of acinar cells enables them to play two critical physiological roles that are distinguished by the quantity and quality of secretion. Between periods of eating, an ongoing “resting” or basal secretion aids in maintaining the homeostasis (hydration, mineralization, and microbial population) of the oral cavity, while during eating, an acutely amplified discharge of saliva facilitates lubrication and initiates digestion of ingested food. Resting secretion is maintained at least in part by low frequency parasympathetic stimulation (6Emmelin N. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have been interested in the pathways and mechanisms of protein secretion used by acinar cells of the parotid gland as they relate to the differing physiological states of resting and eating. By using in vitro biosynthetic labeling of parotid tissue in a pulse-chase protocol coupled with secretagogue stimulation, we have identified up to four pathways that export the principal salivary proteins. Two pathways occur without stimulation, and two others are secretagogue-dependent (1Castle D. Castle A. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 4-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The unstimulated pathways are not inhibited by secretory antagonists, atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine, and thus appear to be truly secretagogue-independent. Together, they account for 10–15% of the newly synthesized secretory protein over a 4–6-h time course. The best characterized unstimulated pathway is the constitutive-like pathway, which has been observed in various exocrine and endocrine cells and has been distinguished from the constitutive secretory pathway. It preferentially exports newly synthesized proteins, beginning soon after transit through the Golgi, and has been deduced to originate by vesicular budding that is linked to the maturation of newly formed secretory granules (11Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The secretory composition of the constitutive-like pathway is enriched in proteins that are inefficiently sorted by condensation within the cores of maturing granules (12von Zastrow M. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2675-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13von Zastrow M. Castle A.M. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6566-6571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second unstimulated pathway occurring at >3-h chase times (after the bulk of constitutive-like secretion) exports proteins having a radiochemical composition resembling the content stored in mature secretory granules, and it may represent unstimulated granule exocytosis. Evidently, the magnitude of this type of release, which has been variable in previous studies (12von Zastrow M. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2675-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13von Zastrow M. Castle A.M. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6566-6571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar), is of significant interest with respect to its potential contribution to resting secretion. Of the two stimulated pathways, the principal one is secretory granule exocytosis, which we refer to as the major regulated pathway and which accounts for most secretory protein export. The other is the minor regulated pathway, which accounts for release of only a few percent of stored secretory proteins. It is distinguished from granule exocytosis by preferentially releasing newly synthesized secretory proteins rather than those that have been in prolonged storage and by its secretory composition, which closely resembles that of the constitutive-like pathway. Notably, the minor regulated pathway is much more sensitive to secretagogue stimulation than is granule exocytosis and is mobilized by both cholinergic and β-adrenergic stimuli (14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar). Since resting secretion in situ is maintained by low level parasympathetic stimulation, we were interested in whether the minor regulated pathway serves as its stimulus-responsive component. We now present evidence that this is the case, and we show that granule exocytosis contributes to resting secretion only in tissue from fasted animals where intracellular storage of salivary proteins is near maximal capacity. In tracing the minor regulated pathway in acinar cells, we provide experimental support for its common origin with the constitutive-like pathway by vesicular budding from immature granules and for its divergence from the constitutive-like pathway at a brefeldin A-sensitive branch point. Subsequent trafficking of the minor regulated pathway to the cell surface appears to be direct, albeit stimulus-controlled, whereas the constitutive-like pathway appears to be an indirect route involving passage through a distal compartment postulated to be endosomal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–124 g) were obtained from Hilltop (Scottsdale, PA), maintained 1 week in the vivarium, and were used either after ad libitum feeding or fasting overnight from 4:00 pm as specified. Expre35S35S used for biosynthetic labeling of parotid lobules was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Secretagogues, dl-isoproterenol, carbamyl choline (carbachol; CCh),1and pilocarpine were obtained from Sigma. Brefeldin A (BFA) was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI), and wortmannin was obtained from Sigma. Both were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. The activity of the specific batch of wortmannin used was confirmed by demonstrating its ability to elicit endosomal vesiculation in HeLa cells (15Martys J. Wjasow C. Gangi D. Kielian M. McGraw T.

Antibodies against amylase and proline-rich protein used in the present studies have been described previously (16Castle A.M. Stahl L.E. Castle J.D. J. Biol.

A rabbit antibody against parotid secretory protein was generously provided by Dr. William Ball (Howard University). Rabbit antibody against rat procathepsin B, which recognizes both precursor and mature forms of the enzyme, was from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Tissue from one rat was used in each experiment. Rats were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and lobules were dissected from excised parotid glands in chilled incubation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2). Preincubations (3 times for 10 min) and incubations including pulse labeling and subsequent chases (identified below) were performed in stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks as described previously (14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar). Although most experiments were conducted entirely at 37 °C, one set of experiments involved incubation post-pulse at 19 °C for 2 h to accumulate biosynthetically labeled proteins in the trans-Golgi network (18Turner M.D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) prior to warming to 37 °C for subsequent incubation and experimental analysis (see “Results”). At designated time intervals, all medium in each sample (1 ml) was removed and replaced with fresh medium including secretagogues or perturbants of transport as specified. At the end of incubation, the tissue in each sample was washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized. Media and homogenates were used for assay of amylase activity (19Bernfeld P. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (3443) Google Scholar) and for SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels), Coomassie staining, phosphorimaging, and quantitative analysis of35S-labeled proteins with ImageQuant software (14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar, 17Castle A.M. Huang A.Y. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For biosynthetic labeling, analysis of intracellular transport, and secretion of cathepsin B (proenzyme and enzyme), incubation with35S-amino-acids (0.25 mCi/ml) was increased to a 30-min pulse, and chases were performed for 30-min or hour intervals, as specified. Immunoprecipitations were performed on aliquots of media and detergent extracts (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate) of tissue homogenates following addition of protease inhibitors and preclearing of samples with 1 mg of protein A-Sepharose each. Incubations in a Triton X-100/deoxycholate/SDS-based RIPA buffer were performed overnight at 4 °C with anti-cathepsin B immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and were processed for SDS-PAGE and analysis as above. Immunofluorescent staining of cryosectioned parotid lobules was performed essentially as described before (20Cameron R.S. Cameron P.L. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lobules were fixed by the periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde procedure (21McLean W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar), frozen in 2.3m sucrose, 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone (1:1), sectioned (∼1 μm) at −50 °C, and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. The sections were blocked in 5% goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, and phosphate-buffered saline; suitable dilutions of primary and secondary (Alexa 594-conjugated) antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were made in 0.5% goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, and phosphate-buffered saline. Stained sections were mounted and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Lobules of control and stimulated tissue for morphological analysis by bright field microscopy and electron microscopy were fixed in phosphate-buffered 2% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, stained en block with 0.5% magnesium uranyl acetate, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon resin according to standard procedures. Thick (0.5 μm) sections were stained with toluidine blue, and thin sections for EM were mounted on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Rats were anesthetized with urethane, and parotid ducts, one per animal, were surgically exposed and cannulated on the surface of the masseter muscle. Secretagogues freshly dissolved in sterile PBS were administered by local interstitial injections in glandular parenchyma, 100 μl at each of two sites per gland. Stimulations were performed in the order 1 μm carbachol, 5 μm carbachol, 10 μm isoproterenol. The resulting secretions were collected manually from the cannula into microcentrifuge tubes, and they were assayed for amylase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and densitometry. In analyzing the secretory pathways that are present in parotid acinar cells, we have focused our attention on some of the major secretory products. In particular, we have examined the intracellular transport and discharge of amylase, the most abundant acinar protein in rat, and two other proteins, an ∼38-kDa proline-rich protein (PRP) and 25-kDa leucine-rich parotid secretory protein (PSP). As can be seen in the immunofluorescence micrographs shown in Fig. 1, all three proteins are expressed in substantial amounts throughout the entire acinar cell population. Furthermore, none of the proteins accumulates in the acinar extracellular space under the unstimulated or carbachol-stimulated conditions used in this study. 2A. Y. Huang, A. M. Castle, B. T. Hinton, and J. D. Castle, unpublished data. Consequently, compositional differences involving these three proteins among different secretory pathways are almost certainly the consequence of intracellular sorting events occurring generally in acinar cells and also do not reflect different cellular origins for distinct secretory pathways. More than 20 years ago, it was established in parotid acinar cells that secretory granules appear to be discharged in order of their synthesis with older granules being released first (22Sharoni Y. Eimerl S. Schramm M. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previously, we used biosynthetic labeling and analysis of radioactive secretory products to identify the constitutive-like and minor regulated pathways in parotid and to distinguish them from granule exocytosis as routes that preferentially export newly synthesized proteins (12von Zastrow M. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2675-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the two non-granule pathways exported amylase but almost no PSP, whereas both proteins were abundant in secretion released by granule exocytosis. (PRP was not analyzed because it contains no methionine or cysteine and thus was not labeled by the 35S-amino-acid mixture.) Examples of these differences in radiochemical composition are illustrated in Fig.2 A. As noted previously (14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar), the compositional differences are independent of the chase interval selected for observation. Whereas the biosynthetic labeling strategy enabled us to detect and characterize the minor pathways over any secretion resulting from exocytosis of unlabeled granules, we did not previously address their relative contributions as putative sources of resting secretion. Consequently, we have now examined the composition of total secretory proteins released from parotid lobules in the absence of stimulation and in the presence of low dose carbachol stimulation and compared it with the composition released by high dose isoproterenol stimulation and with the content of purified secretory granules. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the Coomassie staining profiles for unstimulated secretion and carbachol-stimulated secretion are highly similar to each other but differ from those of isoproterenol-induced secretion and granule content, which are identical to each other. Just as observed for the radiolabeled secretory profiles (Fig. 2 A), PSP is nearly absent from the protein staining profiles of unstimulated and carbachol-stimulated secretions, although it is prominent in granule content and isoproterenol-stimulated secretion. 3Two observations indicate that the relative lack of PSP in unstimulated and carbachol-stimulated secretions is not due to its selective retention in the glandular duct system following secretion, particularly when the overall level of discharged protein is low. First, the radiochemical compositions of the secretions remain distinct in the presence of a background of unstimulated granule exocytosis by lobules from fasted animals (Fig. 2, D andE). Second, in experiments presented in Fig. 6, secretion from parotid lobules following a 19 °C temperature block and brefeldin A treatment is low, yet the relative level of labeled PSP is increased (due to missorting), suggesting unrestricted secretion. In addition, PRP (which is not labeled by 35S in Fig. 2 A) is poorly represented in unstimulated and carbachol-stimulated secretions even though it is prominent in stored and released granule contents (Fig. 2 B). Thus the composition of resting secretion is distinct from that of secretory granule content, indicating that unstimulated exocytosis of granules contributes negligibly to the output of salivary proteins by lobules of ad libitum fed animals. To document that the secretion observed in vitro reflects what occurs in situ, we injected low concentrations of carbachol and subsequently a high concentration of isoproterenol into the glandular interstitium of an anesthetized rat and collected secretion from the cannulated parotid duct. Local application of a cholinergic agonist avoids significant activation of adrenal catecholamine secretion and consequent adrenergic stimulation of parotid tissue as can occur following systemic administration (3Asking B. Gjorstrup P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1980; 109: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2 C, the composition of secreted proteins following low doses of carbachol closely resembles that obtainedin vitro with unstimulated and carbachol-stimulated lobules, implying that resting secretion is derived from the constitutive-like and minor regulated pathways and that the pathways are apically directed. Rats are nocturnal feeders, and the total amylase content in parotid typically decreases by ∼40% overnight as a result of secretion (23Sreebny L.M. Johnson D.A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1969; 14: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In initiating morning experiments using parotid tissue from ad libitum fed animals, we are examining the secretory pathways in acinar cells that have a complement of storage granules that is below capacity. Although our experimental conditions satisfactorily approximate the physiological state, we were interested to examine whether overnight fasting, which should maximize the cellular storage pool of granules, affects the composition of resting secretion and the pathways that contribute to it. Thus, with tissue from fasted animals, we carried out biosynthetic labeling using a pulse-chase protocol, and we analyzed the radiochemical and total protein compositions of unstimulated secretion and secretion stimulated by 40 nm carbachol and by 10 μmisoproterenol. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the radiochemical composition released by the constitutive-like and minor regulated pathways is similar to that observed with tissue from ad libitum fed animals. Secretion of labeled PSP is underrepresented as compared with the level observed upon stimulating granule exocytosis with isoproterenol. However, the spectrum of total proteins secreted, as revealed by Coomassie staining, now includes increased amounts of PRP and PSP, suggesting participation of granule exocytosis (Fig.2 E). To distinguish whether the increased amount of PSP represents newly synthesized or older protein, we compared the specific radioactivities of amylase and PSP (normalized to Coomassie staining) in secretions following 40 nm carbachol and 10 μm isoproterenol addition. Whereas the specific radioactivity of amylase was 6-fold higher after carbachol than after isoproterenol, the specific radioactivity of PSP was lower (by 1.2-fold) after carbachol than after isoproterenol. Thus basal exocytosis of older (unlabeled) granules becomes a contributing pathway to resting secretion along with the other two pathways in acinar cells that are replete with granules. Fig. 2 F summarizes the output of newly synthesized and total amylase in the absence and presence of stimulation in a typical experiment. The data illustrate that the pathways contributing to resting secretion account for only small fractions of newly synthesized and stored amylase, whereas stimulated granule exocytosis releases much larger fractions. It is also apparent that the fractional output of amylase in resting secretion is increased during fasting. In an attempt to visualize morphological changes in response to low doses of carbachol and to assess whether the minor regulated pathway is activated broadly among acinar cells, we incubated lobules for brief times in the presence and absence of 40 nm carbachol and then chilled, fixed, and processed the samples for light and electron microscopy. Fig.3, A and B, shows light micrographs of toluidine blue-stained sections that have been printed in reverse contrast to enhance visualization and comparison of extracellular spaces bordering acinar cells, and particularly the apical lumina. In controls, the lumina appear mostly as small dark spots bordered by the light adjoined acinar cells. Following 1 min and especially 3 min of stimulation, a substantial fraction of the luminal spaces within individual lobules has expanded, implicating structural reorganization at the apical surface and possible secretion. Stereological measurements of the surface area of >1500 luminal profiles from multiple acini of unstimulated specimens and >2400 profiles from stimulated specimens made using the Openlab program (Improvision Inc.) indicated that the mean luminal diameter increased 1.5–2-fold by 3 min of stimulation with at least a 25% shift in the distribution of total profiles to larger dimensions. Not only is the response observed broadly in the acinar tissue, but also it occurs quite rapidly and correlates well with the rapid export of secretory products observed in our earlier study (Fig. 2 in Ref. 14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar). Examination by EM (Fig. 3, C and D) indicated that luminal expansion decreases the incidence of microvilli protruding into the lumen and brings the apical surface into closer proximity to the stored granule population. These observations suggest that the actin-rich terminal web may be reorganized in a way that is conducive to granule exocytosis, although there is no evidence suggesting that low dose carbachol treatment causes granule exocytosis. We showed previously that the minor regulated pathway could be stimulated to export pulse-labeled salivary proteins of high specific radioactivity at prolonged chase times, well after most of the constitutive-like secretion of the labeled proteins had occurred (14Castle J.D. Castle A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2591-2599PubMed Google Scholar). This distinguished the minor regulated pathway as a separate secretagogue-responsive storage compartment and discounted the possibility that stimulation was accelerating the constitutive-like pathway. Although the two pathways are distinct, they draw on the same pool of secretory proteins during formation as judged by comparing the radiochemical compositions at equal specific radioactivity of amylase (Fig. 2). Thus we have been interested in defining the divergence of the pathways and clarifying their separate routes to the cell surface. To begin, we have compared the formation of the two types of carriers by following the time dependence of specific radioactivity of amylase in unstimulated secretion and in secretion elicited by 40 nm carbachol in a pulse-chase experiment. Fig.4 A shows a sample time course of specific radioactivity for amylase released without stimulation or with single intervals of carbachol stimulation. Fig. 4 Bcompares the specific radioactivity of amylase secreted within single intervals of stimulation when carbachol is administered at different times of chase with that secreted in the absence of stimulation. We performed these studies on parotid lobules from both ad libitum-fed and fasted rats and obtained the same results with both types of tissue. As can be seen, the specific radioactivity of amylase rises and falls during the chase concomitantly in both unstimulated and stimulated secretions, demonstrating that carriers of both pathways are continually formed in parallel. Strikingly, however, the specific radioactivity of amylase released by the minor regulated pathway is ≥7-fold higher than that released by the constitutive-like pathway throughout the time course. This substantial difference suggests that"

Viral ribonucleotide reductase is an early gene product of both vaccinia and herpes simplex virus.

The membrane-permeant, intracellular Fe2+ chelator, 2,2′-bipyridine (bipyridyl, BIP), is known to sequester iron from this pool. We show here that BIP strongly inhibits the replication of both vaccinia and herpes simplex virus, type 1.

This time dependence was observed also in regards to inhibition of viral late protein and DNA synthesis by BIP. BIP did not inhibit the activity of vaccinia ribonucleotide reductase (RR), its synthesis, nor its stability indicating that BIP blocked the activation of the apoprotein. In parallel with its inhibition of vaccinia RR activation, BIP treatment increased the RNA binding activity of the endogenous iron-response protein, IRP1, by 1.9-fold.

Iron is essential to replication and growth, yet at the same time iron is cytotoxic. Iron is nutritionally essential due to its role as prosthetic group in a variety of enzymes and electron transfer proteins required for energy metabolism, for a variety of metabolic interconversions, and for the biosynthesis of the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis and repair (4Aisen P. Wessling-Resnick M. Leibold E.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity is due to the efficiency by which iron, as Fe2+, can support the production of oxygen radicals, particularly the hydroxyl radical, HO⋅ (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 86: 1-85Crossref Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells and organisms tightly regulate the uptake, efflux, and compartmentalization of iron so as to modulate the amount of iron accumulated and to ensure that by the appropriate sequestration, the cytotoxic potential of the iron that is absorbed is appropriately suppressed (4Aisen P. Wessling-Resnick M. Leibold E.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 5Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Silver S. Walden W.

However, pathogens live within the context of the iron-restricted milieu that the host maintains as a key to the suppression of the cytotoxic potential of iron. Bacterial pathogens adapt to this iron-limited environment in several ways. One is the production of chelating agents that possess exceptionally large affinities for iron as either Fe2+ or Fe3+ (9Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar,11Howard D.H. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 394-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Britigan B.E. Rasmussen G.T. Olakanmi O. Cox C.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another strategy is to divert transferrin iron by producing transferrin receptors that compete with the host's (11Howard D.H. Clin. Microbiol.

The dependence on the host's supply of iron that pathogens exhibit makes them susceptible to the potential bacteriostatic effects of host iron limitation or chelation. A large body of evidence indicates that manipulation of host iron status does lead to a modulation of the proliferation and virulence of many bacteria and protozoa (10Mabeza G.F. Loyevsky M.

In part, this is no doubt due to the fact that viruses produce limited metabolic machinery except for that required for the replication of their genome. On the other hand, DNA viruses are directly dependent on iron for their proliferation as a result of the essential role that iron plays in the catalytic center of ribonucleotide reductase (RR)1 (17Chabes A., V., D.

The genes encoding these two subunits are found on theHindIII F and I genomic fragments, respectively (26Slabaugh M.B. Davis R.E. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17803-17810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Howell M.L. Sanders-Loehr J. Loehr T.M. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. Slabaugh M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both are early genes in that they are temporally expressed prior to DNA replication in the vaccinia infectious cycle (28Howell M.L. Roseman N.A. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7155-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That a DNA virus requires the pool of dNTPs provided by RR in support of its replicative cycle is indicated by the effect of hydroxyurea (HU). HU inactivates ribonucleotide reductases by quenching the catalytic tyrosyl radical. HU blocks vaccinia replication in cultured cells (29Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 506-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vaccinia infection, and the essential role of RR in it, provides a useful biologic system in which to explore the mechanism by which iron-dependent enzymes obtain the metal that is critical to their activity. In effect, infection introduces in a regulated fashion a gene that encodes an iron-dependent enzyme whose biologic function (support of DNA synthesis and viral replication) and enzyme activity (NDP/NTP reduction) can be readily assayed. Analysis of the iron acquisition pathway employed by the viral RR will permit us to identify the iron pool(s) and proteins involved. This provides us with a useful model system that will permit the analysis of how iron is trafficked to iron apoproteins, and perhaps, how modulation of this trafficking could specifically impact on the replication of cell pathogens. In this study, we have used the membrane-permeant, Fe2+chelator, 2,2′-bipyridyl (BIP), as a probe of whether and how cellular iron is required for a productive infection by vaccinia virus in cultured cells. BIP has been established to interact with the “labile” iron pool within eukaryotic cells (30Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and appears to be the pool that is sensed by regulatory factors such as iron-response element-binding protein (IREPB/IRP1, cytosolic aconitase) (5Eisenstein R.S.

We show here that this pool appears also to support a productive viral infection by providing the iron required for the activation of the vaccinia RR. Vaccinia virus, strain WR, herpes simplex virus type 1, strain KOS, and the African green monkey kidney cell line BSC40 were used for this study. Monolayer cultures were grown Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Viral stocks were prepared from 48-h infected monolayers; these were titered in a standard plaque assay (37Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This same assay was used to determine viral yield in both vaccinia and herpesvirus infections. A plaque assay was used also to demonstrate that BIP did not inhibit a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. VSV is an RNA virus. The labeling procedure of Niles et al. (38Niles E.G. Lee-Chen G.-J. Shuman S. Moss B. Broyles S.S. Virology. 1989; 172: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used to follow protein synthesis in vaccinia-infected cells. Confluent monolayers of BSC40 were inoculated with vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20 for 30 min. The medium was aspirated and replaced with virus-free medium. At varying times after infection, the medium was removed; the cells were washed once with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with 0.8 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The label was removed, and the cells were moved into 1.0 ml of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and were subsequently visualized in the gel by autoradiography. The protocol described by Condit and Motyczka was used (37Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Duplicate 60-mm dishes of BSC40 monolayers were infected at an m.o.i. of 10. At varying times post-infection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with 15 μCi of [3H]thymidine (>80 μCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were scraped from the dishes into 1 ml of water and mixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were collected and washed on glass fiber filters and counted in a Beckman scintillation spectrophotometer. Cell extracts were prepared from control cells, and cells were treated with BIP (100 μm) for 3 h and used in an RNA gel shift assay for IRP1 (40Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Daniels-McQueen S. Brown P.H. Gaffield L. Russell D.A. Bielser D. Bailey L.C. Thach R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9503-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Swenson G.R.

The extracts were prepared by detergent lysis (0.5% Nonidet P-40) in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and RNasin (40 units, Promega, Madison, WI). The riboprobe was transcribed from plasmid pTZ18RM1 (see Ref. 42Swenson G.R. Patino M.M. Beck M.M. Gaffield L. Walden W.E. Biol.

The binding reactions (40Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 42Swenson G.R. Patino M.M. Beck M.M. Gaffield L. Walden W.E. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel; the gel was dried and analyzed using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager and Molecular Analyst software. The labeling and immunoprecipitation protocols were as described by Howell et al. (28Howell M.L. Roseman N.A. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7155-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Duplicate 60-mm dishes of BSC40 monolayers were infected at an m.o.i. of 10. At varying times post-infection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with 80 μCi [35S]methionine, harvested, and washed. A cell extract was prepared in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 0.008% bromphenol blue, and 7.5% glycerol. Extract was incubated with polyclonal antibody to either the R1 or R2 subunit of vaccinia virus (kindly supplied by Dr. Christopher Mathews), and the immunocomplexes were isolated by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled, and 25 μl was applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The labeled R1 and R2 subunits were visualized by autoradiography. The assay described by Slabaugh et al. (43Slabaugh M.B. Johnson T.L. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 507-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was followed. Monolayers of BSC40 cells (100-mm dishes) were infected at an m.o.i. of 10. At various times post-infection, the medium was removed, and the dishes were placed on ice. All further manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Following washing in a 25 mm Hepes buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, cell extracts were prepared in a hypotonic Hepes lysis buffer with the assistance of a Dounce homogenizer. Aliquots (20 μl) of these extracts were used in a ribonucleotide reductase assay mixture containing 25 μm(∼200 cpm/pmol) [3H]cytidine 5′-diphosphate (>20 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 30 min the reaction mixtures were quenched by the addition of 10 m perchloric acid. The mixture was clarified by centrifugation, and 40 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube that was tightly capped. Following boiling to convert all nucleotides to monophosphates and clarification of this mixture by centrifugation, a marker solution containing 20 mm each of CMP, dCMP, and dUMP was added, and the total nucleotides were fractionated by chromatography on plastic-backed cellulose thin layer plates. dUMP is a secondary product as a result of the dCMP deaminase activity present in BSC40 cell extracts. The markers permitted visualization of the reaction products under UV light; the corresponding regions of the plates were removed and counted in a Beckman scintillation spectrophotometer. Confluent monolayers of BSC40 cells were inoculated with vaccinia virus at an m.o.i. of 10, either in the absence of 2,2′-bipyridyl (control) or in the presence of BIP from 10 to 100 μm. Initial tests demonstrated that at 100 μm BIP did not markedly inhibit the growth of these cells to confluency and did not cause significant changes in cell morphology or survival in confluent cultures (data not shown). Plates were titered for the number of viable virus produced after 48 h of infection (Fig. 1). The data show that BIP caused a 3–4-log decrease in viral yield with the sharpest decrease occurring between 40 and 80 μm. Early viral gene expression precedes DNA replication. Both are required for intermediate and late gene expression. A survey of protein production during a vaccinia infection serves as a temporal measure of the progression of the infectious cycle. To determine where in this cycle the BIP-dependent inhibition of virus formation occurred, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine at different times, i.e. hours post-infection (hpi). Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and observed by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Analysis of protein synthesis in the control infected cells (no BIP) demonstrated the onset of viral early protein production (examples designated by E in Fig.2) within 3 hpi followed by the shut-off of synthesis of these and host proteins at 6 hpi. The loss of host and early virus gene expression precedes onset of the viral late protein synthesis that is dependent on the initiation of viral DNA replication. The effect of BIP (100 μm in this experiment) was striking. BIP did not inhibit the production of viral early proteins. However, it delayed the shut-off of viral early and host protein synthesis and prevented the accumulation of late viral proteins. This phenotype would be consistent with the inhibition by BIP of viral DNA replication. Viral DNA replication was assessed directly by measuring the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA at different times post-infection. A typical time course of labeling is shown in Fig.3. Although the non-infected control cells (closed triangles) exhibited a constant level of [3H]thymidine incorporation (average value over the 9-h experiment, 12,650 cpm), the vaccinia-infected cells showed a 10-fold increase in incorporation at 3–6 hpi that then declined to control levels at 9 hpi (open circles). BIP inhibited this virus-dependent burst of DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner that closely paralleled the concentration-dependent effect on viral yield seen in Fig.1. Thus, 40 μm BIP inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by <10% (open triangles), whereas 60 μm BIP inhibited >90% (closed circles) with little further inhibition at 100 μm BIP (labeling not different from uninfected control cells, closed triangles). This result also was fully consistent with the inhibition by BIP of late protein synthesis (Fig. 2) since expression of late genes, but not early ones, requires concurrent DNA synthesis. In summary, both labeling experiments indicate that BIP inhibits viral DNA synthesis and that this results in a block to further progression of the infectious cycle including expression of viral intermediate and late genes. This block was reversible as indicated by the additional results shown in Fig. 3. At 6 hpi, the BIP (100 μm) was removed from a set of cultures, and DNA synthesis was measured in these now BIP-free cells. Within 1 h, DNA synthesis began and followed a time course similar to the virus-infected cell controls (cf. open squares to open circles). This recovery of virus-dependent DNA synthesis led to a productive infection since the viral yield from these cultures was equivalent to the yield from cultures that had never been treated with BIP (2.8 versus 2.5 × 109 plaque-forming units, respectively). Viral infected cells from which the BIP had not been removed did not exhibit this DNA synthesis pattern at any time over the 12-h experiment (closed squares) and exhibited the 3-log decrease in viral yield shown in Fig. 1. BIP appears to block virus production by inhibiting viral DNA replication. Thus, BIP appears to work early in the infectious cycle. If the BIP effect was restricted to an early step in infection, then at some time point post-infection, BIP would no longer be able to inhibit. This inference was tested by measuring both incorporation of [3H]thymidine at 6 hpi and viral yield at 48 hpi in cells that were treated with BIP (100 μm) at various times post-infection. In Fig. 4 the DNA synthesis in these cells was compared with that in uninfected cells (mock) and in control infected cells (none, no BIP added). The data demonstrate that to inhibit strongly DNA synthesis at 6 hpi, BIP must be added by 3 hpi (stippled bars). A similar result was observed in regards to the inhibition of viral yield (Fig. 5, closed circles). The results were completely consistent with the inference above that BIP acted early in infection and that the mechanism of BIP inhibition of virus production was linked to the BIP inhibition of DNA synthesis.Figure 5Bypyridyl, hydroxyurea, and Ara-C inhibit viral replication at different times post-infection; a membrane-impermeant Fe2+ chelator, BPS , does not inhibit. BIP (100 μm, closed circles), hydroxyurea (10 mm, open triangles), and Ara-C (100 μg/ml, open squares) were added to vaccinia-infected monolayers of BSC40 cells at the times post-infection indicated in the figure. The viral yield in these infected cells was then determined at 48 hpi by a standard plaque assay. The inhibition of vaccinia virus infection by the membrane-impermeant Fe2+ chelator, BPS (100 μm), was also tested. This reagent was without inhibitory effect (open circles). The data in the figure are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To probe further the mechanism of the BIP inhibition, the temporal effect of other inhibitors on viral DNA synthesis and yield was determined. In particular, HU inhibits active RR by reducing the ferric iron core. This results in the loss of the tyrosyl radical essential to the catalytic activity of this enzyme (27Howell M.L. Sanders-Loehr J. Loehr T.M. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. Slabaugh M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RR is an early protein produced by vaccinia and other large DNA viruses and is required for a productive infection (20Prichard M.N. Shipman Jr., C. Chemotherapy. 1995; 41: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Slabaugh M.B. Davis R.E. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, we employed cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), which directly inhibits DNA polymerization. The temporal sensitivity of viral-dependent DNA synthesis to these two inhibitors is shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding inhibition of viral yield is shown in Fig. 5. Unlike BIP, HU inhibited DNA synthesis by 70% even if added at 5 hpi (Fig. 4, shaded bars), whereas Ara-C retained full inhibition when added at this time (solid bars). A similar pattern was observed in regard to viral yield (Fig. 5). HU (open triangles) and Ara-C (open squares) were equally effective in inhibiting viral yield when added up to 2 hpi. However, differences were observed when these inhibitors were added at later times. In contrast to BIP, HU was fully effective when added up to 3 hpi, while in contrast to both of the other compounds Ara-C was fully effective even when added 4 hpi. The premise underlying our original prediction that BIP would inhibit vaccinia infection was that this lipophilic, membrane-permeant Fe2+ chelator would readily diffuse into cells and sequester iron within the cells that otherwise would be available in support of viral replication. The data show clearly that BIP does inhibit viral replication. A membrane-impermeant iron chelator was used"

MRP1 is characterized by an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0), which is connected to a P-glycoprotein-like core region (ΔMRP) by a cytoplasmic linker domain zero (L0). It has been demonstrated that GSH plays an important role in MRP1-mediated MDR. However, the mechanism by which GSH mediates MDR and the precise roles of TMD0 and L0 are not known. We synthesized [125I]11-azidophenyl agosterol A ([125I]azidoAG-A), a photoaffinity analog of the MDR-reversing agent, agosterol A (AG-A), to photolabel MRP1, and found that the analog photolabeled the C-proximal molecule of MRP1 (C932–1531) in a manner that was GSH-dependent. The photolabeling was inhibited by anticancer agents, reversing agents and leukotriene C4. Based on photolabeling studies in the presence and absence of GSH using membrane vesicles expressing various truncated, co-expressed, and mutated MRP1s, we found that L0 is the site on MRP1 that interacts with GSH. This study demonstrated that GSH is required for the binding of an unconjugated agent to MRP1 and suggested that GSH interacts with L0 of MRP1.

The amino acid sequence suggests that P-gp consists of two homologous halves and a variable linker region. Each half of the protein has six transmembrane segments and one nucleotide binding domain (NBD).

MRP1, however, is an active transporter of amphiphilic conjugated organic anions, including a number of compounds conjugated with GSH, glucuronide, and sulfate.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that VCR and GSH are co-transported by MRP1 (16Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent VCR transport into membrane vesicles overexpressing MRP1 could be stimulated by GSH, and ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]GSH was stimulated by VCR. Although all of the above data strongly suggest that GSH is essential for MRP1-mediated MDR, the role of GSH in binding and/or transport of drugs by MRP1 is unclear. In contrast to the above studies, Vezmar et al. (17Vezmar M. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Georges E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Vezmar M. Georges E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that a quinoline-based photoactive drug,N-{4-[1-hydroxy-2-(dibutylamino) ethyl] quinolin-8-yl}-4-azidosalicylamide (IAAQ), photolabeled MRP1 in both MRP1-overexpressing intact cells and membrane vesicles, and that GSH is not required for the binding of the drug. More recently, another quinoline-based photoaffinity drug,N-(hydrocinchonidin-8′-yl)-4-azido-2-hydroxybenzamide (IACI), which has a structure very similar to that of IAAQ, has also been shown to photolabel multiple sites of MRP1 in the absence of GSH (19Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of whether GSH is essential for MRP1-mediated MDR, and, if it is essential, which step in the drug transport is stimulated by GSH: the drug binding step or subsequent steps. Photoaffinity analogs of some xenobiotics are powerful tools for studying drug binding sites on proteins (20Chowdhry V. Westheimer F.H.,. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 293-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity analogs of some anti-cancer and other reversing agents, such as azidopine (21Bruggemann E.P. Currier S.J.

Although the resistance phenotypes conferred by expression of MRP1 are similar to those of P-gp expression, a photoaffinity labeling study using known photoaffinity analogs for P-gp failed to photolabel MRP1 under the same conditions used for P-gp (24Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Leier et al. (25Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that LTC4 photolabeled MRP1; however, the labeling site of LTC4 on MRP1 has not been determined. Recently, we isolated a novel polyhydroxylated sterol acetate, named agosterol A (AG-A), from a marine sponge (Spongia sp.). We found that AG-A completely reversed MDR in human KB carcinoma cells overexpressing MRP1 (27Aoki S. Yoshioka Y. Miyamoto Y. Higuchi K. Setiawan A. Murakami N. Chen Z.-S. Sumizawa T. Akiyama S. Kobayashi M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 6303-6306Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and that AG-A competitively inhibited the transport of LTC4 by MRP1 (28Chen Z.-S. Aoki S. Komatsu M. Ueda K. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Ren X.-Q. Belinsky M.G. Lee K. Kruh G.D. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S.-i. et al.Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 30: 2057-2070Google Scholar). This suggests that AG-A is a new MDR-reversing agent. In the present study, we synthesized a photoaffinity analog of AG-A, [125I]11-azidophenyl agosterol A ([125I]azidoAG-A), and used it to photolabel MRP1. We found that GSH is required for [125I]azidoAG-A binding to the C-terminal half of MRP1. In order to clarify the site of GSH interaction on MRP1, a series of truncated and mutated MRP1constructs and co-expressed half-molecules of MRP1 were used to see if they are photolabeled by the photoanalog of AG-A in the presence or absence of GSH. We found that the C-proximal fragment of MRP1 (C932–1531) is photolabeled by the photoanalog of AG-A in the presence of GSH and GSH interacts with the L0region of MRP1. [125I]NaI (3.7 GBq (100 mCi)/ml) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AG-A was isolated from a marine sponge (Spongia sp). collected in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Details of its isolation and determination of its structure were described in a previous paper (27Aoki S. Yoshioka Y. Miyamoto Y. Higuchi K. Setiawan A. Murakami N. Chen Z.-S. Sumizawa T. Akiyama S. Kobayashi M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 6303-6306Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2-Azido-5-(trimethylstannyl) benzoic acid was attached to the 11-hydroxy group of AG-A with a C-4 linker and then iodinated with [125I]NaI and chloramine T (Fig. 1) (29Latli B. Tomizawa M. Casida J.E. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The product was confirmed as [125I]azidoAG-A by comparison with a standard sample on thin layer chromatography. 7.2 μ Ci/nmol [125I]azidoAG-A was used for the experiment. PAK-104P, MK571, and ONO-1078 were obtained as described previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mouse IgG2a and Protein G-Sepharose 4B were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Cellfectin and competent DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Other drugs and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. KB/MRP, human KB cells transfected with MRP1 cDNA, and KB/CV, KB cells transfected with an empty vector, were cultured in minimum essential medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% newborn calf serum as described previously (31Chen Z.S. Furukawa T. Sumizawa T. Ono K. Ueda K. Seto K Akiyama S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Sf21 insect cells were cultured in serum-free Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Membrane vesicles were prepared from KB/MRP, KB/CV cells, and Sf21 insect cells infected with various recombinant baculoviruses as described previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were suspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 250 mm sucrose. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar). pFastBacMRP1-His containing the MRP1 coding region was constructed as described previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To generate a construct expressing ΔMRP, an adaptor was constructed using two oligonucleotides (5′-TCGACGCCGCCATGGATGCATCG-3′, 5′-GATCCGATGCATCCATGGCGGCG-3′) encoding a consensus Kozak sequence (bold and underlined), aNsiI site (underlined), and cohesive ends of SalI (italic) and BamHI (bold). The adaptor was then ligated to pFastBac MRP1-His in which theSalI/BamHI fragment encoding MRP1 amino acids 1–280 was removed. The correct insertion of the adaptor was identified by the presence of the NsiI site and sequence analysis. To generate constructs for expression of the N1–932 and C932–1531 of MRP1, nucleotides 2505–2995 and 2993–4399 of MRP1 were amplified by PCR from an MRP1 cDNA template. The primers used for the 2505–2995 fragment were 5′-CTGGGGGCCAGAAGCAGCGCGTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTATGCGGTGCTGTTGTGGTGCC-3′ (reverse). A stop codon (underlined) was introduced into the reverse primer. The primers used for the 2993–4399 fragment were: 5′-ATGGCAGAACTGCAGAAAGCTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGACTTCTTCATCCGAGT-3′ (reverse). In the forward primer, a start codon was introduced (underlined). The two PCR fragments were first cloned into a pBluescript T-vector to make pBluescriptMRPN and pBluescript MRPC. The orientation and fidelity of the PCR fragments were verified by sequence analysis and were then excised from the plasmid as XhoI/NotI and SalI/NcoI fragments, respectively. TheXhoI/NotI fragment was then ligated to pFastBacMRP1-His predigested with XhoI andNotI to construct pFastBac1 MRPN encoding N1–932. The SalI/NcoI fragment, together with the MRP1 NcoI/KpnI fragment, was cloned between the XhoI and KpnI sites in the multiple cloning site II of pFastBac DUAL donor plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) to construct pFastBac DUAL MRPCfor C932–1531. The construct pFastBac DUAL MRPfull resulted from ligation of the two largeBssHII/PvuI fragments of the N and C donor plasmids. To express TMD0L0 and ΔMRP from a dual vector, pFastBac MRP1-His was digested with BamHI and SphI. After being blunted by T4 polymerase, the two sites were then ligated to each other. The fidelity of the blunting was confirmed by reconstitution of a BamHI site. The fragment encoding TMD0L0 of MRP1 was removed from the plasmid as a SalI/KpnI fragment and then cloned between the XhoI and KpnI sites in multiple cloning site II of the pFastBac DUAL donor plasmid. Translation of the inserted fragment terminated at a stop codon in the DUAL vector resulting in the addition of eight amino acids, PVPGDGGG. TheBssHII/PvuI fragment was then ligated with the large BssHII/PvuI fragment of the ΔMRP expression construct. To facilitate detection of the expressed CoreN of MRP1, a sequence encoding a myc tag was inserted by PCR using pBluescriptMRPN as a template. For this purpose, two primers: 5′-TCTGAAGAGGATCTGTAAACTAGTTCTAGAGCGGCCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGAGTTTCTGTTCTGCGGTGCTGTTGTGGTGCC-3′ (reverse), encoding the myc epitope EQKLISEEDL (underlined) were used. The PCR products were digested with DpnI to remove template plasmid DNA and then self-ligated in the presence of T4 kinase (34Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Following verification by DNA sequencing, the insertion was removed as anXhoI/NotI fragment and exchanged with the corresponding fragment in the ΔMRP expression construct to construct pFastBac MRP CoreN-myc. In order to co-express the CoreN of MRP1 with C932–1531, the BssHII/PvuI vector part of the above plasmid was exchanged with the largeBssHII/PvuI fragment of the pFastBac DUALMRPC. Constructs encoding L0ΔMRP, ML0ΔMRP, and ΔL0full were prepared as described above. The PCR primer used for L0ΔMRP was 5′-GCCGCCATGGACCCTAATCCCTGCCCAGAG-3′ encoding a consensus Kozak sequence (underlined). The primers used to introduce two mutations, K267M and W261A, into MRP1 were 5′-GAGTGCGCCATGACTAGGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTTCGCGTTCTTTACCAAAAC-3′ (reverse) encoding mismatched bases (bold). The underlined mismatched base introduces a silent mutation, which destroys an original BsmI site inMRP1 and acts as a marker for the mutant cDNA. The primer used for ΔL0full was a reverse primer: 5′-GGATCCTGGATGGTTTCCGAGAAC-3′. Baculoviruses encoding the above wild type and mutant MRP1s were generated using the Bac to Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (100 μg of protein) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 5 μm photoanalog of AG-A labeled with 125I (1.2 × 106 cpm) in the absence or presence of various agents and different concentrations of GSH as indicated. Following continuous irradiation of the samples with a short wavelength (366 nm) UV lamp for 20 min at 25 °C, the samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer as described by Debenham et al. (35Debenham P.G. Kartner N. Siminovitch L. Riordan J.R. Ling V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Autoradiograms were developed after 6–24 h of exposure. Gel slices corresponding to specific bands on the autoradiogram were cut, and the radioactivity (cpm) was measured with an Auto Well Gamma System (ARC-380, Aloka Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Background radioactivity in equal areas of the gel in each lane was measured and subtracted from the radioactivity of the band. Membrane proteins (300 μg) were photolabeled by [125I]azidoAG-A as described above. Membrane vesicles were then solubilized in 2 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NH4Cl, 2 mmMgCl2) containing 1% CHAPS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 4 μg of anti-MRP1 monoclonal antibody, QCRL-3, or 8 μg of control mouse IgG2a. The mixture was then incubated with 200 μg of 20% Protein G-Sepharose in buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous mixing, and the precipitates were washed four times with Buffer A containing 1% CHAPS. The precipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Membrane vesicles were treated with diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (ICN Biomedicals, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada) according to Hipfner et al. (7Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M.

Briefly, membrane vesicles (50 μg) were diluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and then treated with 2–50 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mmaminophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Wako Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and 0.5 TIU (trypsin inhibitory unit)/ml aprotinin, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal fragments of trypsinized MRP1 were detected with specific monoclonal antibodies MRPr1 (epitope amino acids MRPr1 (epitope aa 238–247) (36Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively. Treatment of membrane vesicles with trypsin was carried out either before or after the photolabeling as indicated. We recently demonstrated that AG-A reverses MDR in human KB carcinoma cells overexpressing MRP1. AG-A competitively interacts with the binding site for LTC4 on MRP1 and inhibited the transport of LTC4 by MRP1 (28Chen Z.-S. Aoki S. Komatsu M. Ueda K. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Ren X.-Q. Belinsky M.G. Lee K. Kruh G.D. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S.-i. et al.Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 30: 2057-2070Google Scholar). To examine whether AG-A directly binds to the drug binding site of MRP1, we synthesized the photoaffinity analog of AG-A, [125I]azidoAG-A (Fig. 1). [125I]AzidoAG-A photolabeled the 190-kDa cellular component only in the presence of GSH. The labeled band was not detected even in the presence of GSH in membrane vesicles from KB/CV cells that did not express detectable levels of MRP1 (Fig.2 A). The photolabeling increased with increasing concentrations of GSH up to 2 mm(Fig. 2 B). To determine if the 190-kDa component was MRP1, photolabeled membrane vesicles from KB/MRP cells were solubilized with CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-MRP1 antibody, QCRL-3 (37Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled protein was immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibody, but not by nonimmune mouse IgG2a confirming that the [125I]azidoAG-A-binding protein is MRP1 (Fig.2 C). We then characterized the effect of GSH on [125I]azidoAG-A binding to MRP1. Loe et al.(16Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar) reported that, in addition to GSH, some shortS-alkyl-GSH derivatives stimulated [3H]VCR uptake by MRP1. We therefore investigated whether GSH derivatives could also stimulate [125I]azidoAG-A binding to MRP1. As shown in Fig. 3 A,S-methyl-GSH stimulated photolabeling of MRP1 to an extent similar to that for GSH. Stimulation of labeling was less efficient forS-ethyl-GSH, and S-octyl-GSH was ineffective. The role of the reducing activity of GSH in stimulation of the AG-A-MRP1 binding was tested by determining the ability of the sulfhydryl reducing agents, dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, and thioredoxin, and a glucuronic acid, to substitute for GSH in binding assay (Fig.3 B). It seems that the reducing activity of GSH is not essential for the photolabeling. In order to determine if [125I]azidoAG-A binds to the biologically relevant site(s) of MRP1, quantitative inhibition studies were performed with a molar excess of AG-A, LTC4, or several anti-cancer and reversing agents and conjugated organic anions. The effect of AG-A, ADM, VCR, and LTC4 on photolabeling of MRP1 in membrane vesicles from KB/MRP cells is shown in Fig. 4 A. The data for all agents used were quantified by removing slices of the gel corresponding to the bands on the autoradiograms (including those not shown) and measuring their radioactivity (Fig. 4 B). AG-A inhibited the photolabeling in a dose-dependent manner and completely inhibited it at 200 μm. Inhibition by LTC4was similar to that of AG-A. Among the anticancer agents, VCR and ADM inhibited photolabeling most strongly, with half-maximal inhibition at 33.9 and 30.4 μm, respectively, and almost complete inhibition at 200 μm. VP-16 and cisplatin inhibited the labeling by only 30% and 7% at 200 μm, respectively. Among the reversing agents, 4-oxo-8-[p-(4-phenylbutyl-oxy)benzoylamino]-2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-1-benzopyran hemihydrate (ONO-1078) (38Nagayama S. Chen Z.-S. Kitazono M. Takebayashi Y. Niwa K. Yamada K. Tani A. Haraguchi M. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Aikou T. Akiyama S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 14: 175-182Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) had the highest inhibitory activity, and completely inhibited the labeling at 200 μm. ONO-1078, 3-([{3-(2-[7-chloro-2-quinolinyl]ethenyl)phenyl}-{(3-dimethylamino-3-oxopropyl)-thio}-methyl]thio)propanoic acid (MK571) (39Gekeler V. Ise W Sanders K.H. Ulrich W.R. Beck J. Biochem.

Chen Z.S. Chuman Y. Seto K. Furukawa T. Haraguchi M. Tani A. Shudo N. Akiyama S.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited the labeling by 50% at 10.6, 18, and 24.9 μm, respectively. Among the conjugated organic anions, LTC4 inhibited the photolabeling most strongly, with half-maximal inhibition at 1.3 μm. 17-β-Estradiol-17 (β-d-glucuronate) (E217βG) inhibited the photolabeling by 50% at 129 μm and by 40% at 200 μm. These results indicate that [125I]azidoAG-A bound to the biologically relevant site on MRP1. In order to determine the drug binding site of AG-A on MRP1, the MRP1 molecule was cleaved into defined fragments by trypsin digestion and the fragments tested for binding to [125I]azidoAG-A. Membrane vesicles from KB/MRP cells were digested with trypsin and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for the N- and C-terminal half of MRP1, i.e. MRPr1 (epitope aa 238–247) and MRPm6 (epitope aa 1511–1520) (36Flens M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2117200341,"Regeneration of visual pigments of vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors occurs by the initial noncovalent binding of 11-cis-retinal to opsin, followed by the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the protein. Here, we show that the noncovalent interaction between 11-cis-retinal and opsin affects the rate of dark adaptation. In rods, 11-cis-retinal produces a transient activation of the phototransduction cascade that precedes sensitivity recovery, thus slowing dark adaptation. In cones, 11-cis-retinal immediately deactivates phototransduction. Thus, the initial binding of the same ligand to two very similar G protein receptors, the rod and cone opsins, activates one and deactivates the other, contributing to the remarkable difference in the rates of rod and cone dark adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2137341154,"Potassium depolarization of skeletal myotubes evokes slow calcium waves that are unrelated to contraction and involve the cell nucleus (Jaimovich, E., Reyes, R., Liberona, J. L., and Powell, J. A. (2000) Am. J. Physiol. 278, C998–C1010). Studies were done in both the 1B5 (Ry53−/−) murine “dyspedic” myoblast cell line, which does not express any ryanodine receptor isoforms (Moore, R. A., Nguyen, H., Galceran, J., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D. (1998) J. Cell Biol.140, 843–851), and C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line that expresses all three isoforms. Although 1B5 cells lack ryanodine binding, they bind tritiated inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate. Both type 1 and type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptors were immuno-located in the nuclei of both cell types and were visualized by Western blot analysis. After stimulation with 47 mmK+, inositol trisphosphate mass raised transiently in both cell types. Both fast calcium increase and slow propagated calcium signals were seen in C2C12 myotubes. However, 1B5 myotubes (as well as ryanodine-treated C2C12 myotubes) displayed only a long-lasting, non-propagating calcium increase, particularly evident in the nuclei. Calcium signals in 1B5 myotubes were almost completely blocked by inhibitors of the inositol trisphosphate pathway: U73122, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, or xestospongin C. Results support the hypothesis that inositol trisphosphate mediates slow calcium signals in muscle cell ryanodine receptors, having a role in their time course and propagation. Potassium depolarization of skeletal myotubes evokes slow calcium waves that are unrelated to contraction and involve the cell nucleus (Jaimovich, E., Reyes, R., Liberona, J. L., and Powell, J. A.

A., Nguyen, H., Galceran, J., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D. (1998) J. Cell Biol.140, 843–851), and C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line that expresses all three isoforms. Although 1B5 cells lack ryanodine binding, they bind tritiated inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate. Both type 1 and type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptors were immuno-located in the nuclei of both cell types and were visualized by Western blot analysis. After stimulation with 47 mmK+, inositol trisphosphate mass raised transiently in both cell types. Both fast calcium increase and slow propagated calcium signals were seen in C2C12 myotubes. However, 1B5 myotubes (as well as ryanodine-treated C2C12 myotubes) displayed only a long-lasting, non-propagating calcium increase, particularly evident in the nuclei. Calcium signals in 1B5 myotubes were almost completely blocked by inhibitors of the inositol trisphosphate pathway: U73122, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, or xestospongin C. Results support the hypothesis that inositol trisphosphate mediates slow calcium signals in muscle cell ryanodine receptors, having a role in their time course and propagation. ryanodine receptor 4,5-trisphosphate IP3 receptor 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Depolarization-induced calcium release in skeletal muscle is generally detected as a fast process mediated by dihydropyridine receptors in the T-tubule membrane and ryanodine receptors (RyR)1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev.

We previously found evidence for at least two identifiable calcium signals (5Jaimovich E. Rojas E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in skeletal muscle cells in cultures exposed to high external potassium, which suggests that there are at least two calcium release systems that respond to the depolarization signal. The two signals were called the fast and slow waves. We were also able to observe fluorescence heterogeneity during slow waves, corresponding to two separate processes: first, a more rapid increase in fluorescence (the “slow-rapid” wave) that propagates through both nuclei and cytosol regions; second, a slower component of increased fluorescence (the “slow-slow” wave), which is seen only in the nuclear region. The fact that the cell does not contract during either part of the slow wave indicates that the overall cytosolic calcium concentration remains below the contraction threshold and that the high fluorescence areas that we see must be highly compartmentalized, most probably in the nuclear region. As expected, high concentrations of ryanodine eliminated the initial rapid calcium increase associated with contraction, and interestingly, it also eliminated the first or slow-rapid cytosolic propagation as well. However the second slow calcium rise phase was preserved. This suggests that a ryanodine-sensitive calcium pool is involved in the mechanism of propagation of the slow-rapid Ca2+ wave through the cytosol. The apparently different intracellular distributions of receptors, RyR in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R), at least in some developmental stages, concentrated in membranes associated with the nuclei (7Guihard G. Proteau S. Rousseau E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Humbert J.P. Matter N. Artault J.C. Köppler P. Malviya A.N. J. Biol.

Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), points to the presence of two separate calcium release systems. We proposed that the role for the IP3R could be to modulate cytosolic calcium concentrations within the appropriate levels, sub-cellular regions, and time scale required to activate nuclear calcium release. Slow calcium signals in these cells appear to be mediated by IP3 receptors and are likely to control phosphorylation cascades involved in regulation of gene expression. 2J. A. Powell, M. A. Carrasco, D. S. Adams, B. Drouet, J. Rios, M. Müller, M. Estrada, and E. Jaimovich, unpublished information. The aim of the present work was to determine the definitive role of RyRs, if any, in either component of the slow release process. To this aim, we compared the calcium signals in dyspedic muscle cells (1B5), which do not express any of the RyR isoforms and lack excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling (10Buck E.D. Nguyen H.

Hermann-Frank A. Lüttgau H.Ch. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and the C2C12myoblast line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g of glucose/liter), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 10% bovine serum (all Life Technologies, Inc.) in gelatin-covered dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The serum was reduced to 2% horse serum after 2 days to induce cell maturation and fusion, and cells were studied 5–7 days after differentiation was initiated. For intracellular calcium measurements at single-cell level, the myoblasts were cultured on glass coverslips to reach 80% confluence and then differentiated into myotubes by withdrawal of growth factors. Calcium images were obtained from myotubes that were loaded with the fluorescence calcium dye fluo-3-acetoximethylester (fluo-3AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using an inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135 M-LSM Microsystems). Alternatively we observed calcium transients with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a cooled CCD camera and image acquisition system (Spectra Source MCD 600). Myotubes were washed three times with Krebs buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-Na, 5.6 mmglucose, pH 7.4) to remove serum and loaded with 5.4 μmfluo-3 (coming from a stock in pluronic acid, 20% Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature. After loading, myotubes were washed for 10 min to allow the deesterification of the dye and used within 2 h. The coverslips were mounted in a 1-ml capacity plastic chamber and placed in the microscope for fluorescence measurements. After excitation with a 488-nm wavelength argon laser beam or filter system, the fluorescence images were collected every 0.4–2.0 s and analyzed frame by frame with the data acquisition program of the equipment. A PlanApo 60X (NA 1.4) objective lens was used. In most of the acquisitions, the image dimension was 512 × 120 pixels. Intracellular calcium was expressed as a percentage of fluorescence intensity relative to basal fluorescence (a value stable for at least 5 min in resting conditions). The increase in fluorescence intensity of fluo-3 is proportional to the rise in intracellular calcium level (18Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments using inhibitors, U-72133 (Sigma), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (Aldrich), xestospongin C (Calbiochem), and ryanodine (Sigma) were used. Elimination of out-of-focus fluorescence was performed using both the “no-neighbors” deconvolution algorithm and Castleman's (19Castleman K. Digital Image Processing. Englewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall, New Jersey1989Google Scholar) PSF (point spread function) theoretical model, as has been described previously (20Estrada M. Liberona J.L. Miranda M. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E132-E139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify fluorescence, the summed pixel intensity was calculated on the section delimited by a contour. As a way of increasing efficiency of these data manipulations, action sequences were generated. To avoid the possible interference in the fluorescence by high potassium solution effects on the cellular volume, the area of fluorescent cell was determined by image analysis using adaptive contour and then creating a binary mask, which was compared with its bright-field image. Radioligand binding assay for [3H]IP3 was determined as described (9Liberona J.L Powell J.A. Shenoi S. Petherbridge L. Caviedes R. Jaimovich E. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent plates of C2C12 and dyspedic mouse cell lines 5–7 days after withdrawal of serum were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with an ultrasonic homogenizer for 10–15 s. They were then incubated in a medium that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and different concentrations (10–200 nm) of [3H]IP3(d-myo-[2-3H]IP3, specific activity 21.0 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 800–1000 cpm/pmol) to 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min (Heraus Biofuge 15R), the supernatant was aspired, and the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in NaOH (1 m) to measured the radioactivity. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μmIP3 (Sigma). [3H]Ryanodine binding was measured in C2C12 and dyspedic mouse cell homogenates as described (21Jaimovich E. Donoso P. Liberona J.L. Hidalgo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 855: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The incubation medium contained 0.5 m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.1, and 1 mm5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate or 5 mm adenosine trisphosphate. The samples were incubated with [3H]ryanodine (5–100 nm) for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of cold ryanodine (10 μm) for nonspecific binding. Homogenate proteins were resolved in 7% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 0.2 A. Primary antibody incubations using dilutions of 1:1000 of antibodies against either type 1 (Affinity Bioreagents) or type 3 (Transduction Laboratories) IP3 receptor were carried out at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1.5 h, the membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. After scanning the films, a densitometry analysis of the bands was performed with the Scion Image program from NIH. Myotubes grown on coverslips were fixed in iced methanol, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies obtained from commercial sources were raised against anti-ryanodine receptor (monoclonal; Affinity Bioreagents) and anti-type 1 IP3R (polyclonal; Affinity Bioreagents). Anti-type-3 IP3R antibody was raised in rabbits against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of the rat type-3 IP3R cDNA (CRRQRLGFVDVQNCMSR) (22Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 834-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The antibody used in this study was affinity-purified using the immunogenic peptide. The cells were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and incubated with the appropriate goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three more times, the coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mg/mlp-phenylendiamine to retard photobleaching. The samples were evaluated in a scanning confocal microscope and phase contrast microscope and documented through computerized images. In most cases a nuclear staining was carried out with #33342 Hoeschst (Polyscience Inc., Warrington, PA) either before fixing or added to the secondary antibody preparation. Primary antibodies were used in 1:100 to 1:25 dilutions and label displacement with the antigenic peptide was used as a test for specificity. Myotubes were rinsed and preincubated at room temperature for 20 min with a “resting solution” of the following composition: 58 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm LiCl, 10 mmglucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Next the cells were stimulated, replacing this solution by high potassium solution. At the times indicated, the reaction was stopped by rapid aspiration of the stimulating solution, the addition of 0.8 m ice-cold perchloric acid, and freezing with liquid nitrogen. Samples were allowed to thaw, and cell debris was spun down for protein determination. The supernatant was neutralized with a solution 2m KOH, 0.1 m MES, and 15 mm EDTA. The neutralized extracts were frozen until required for IP3determination. IP3 mass measurements were carried out by radioreceptor assay (23Bredt D.S. Mourey R.J. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 59: 976-982Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude rat cerebellum membrane preparation was obtained after homogenization in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 15 min. This procedure was repeated 3 times, suspending the final pellet in the same solution plus 0.3 m sucrose and freezing it at −80 °C until use. The membrane preparation was calibrated for IP3 binding with 1.6 nm[3H]IP3 (DuPont) and 2–120 nmcold IP3 (Sigma) carrying out the sample analysis in a similar way but adding an aliquot of the neutralized supernatant instead of cold IP3. [3H]IP3radioactivity remaining bound to the membranes was measured in a Beckman LS-6000TA liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman Instruments). Cell number was counted in a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion to identify living cells before plating. All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between basal and post-stimulated points were determined using a paired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate fluo-3 fluorescence in both a RyR-expressing mouse muscle cell line (C2C12) and in dyspedic cells (1B5) in response to potassium depolarization. A typical effect of high potassium solution (47 mm K+) on intracellular calcium in C2C12 cells (Fig.1 A) consists of a fast (reaching the peak in less than 1 s) increase of fluo-3 fluorescence in the entire cell (n = 54 of 63); fluorescence slowly decreased during the next few seconds. After the first signal began to decline, a second, smaller signal was evident at about 10–20 s in 48% of the cells observed (n = 26). This signal usually propagates along a region of the cell, and fluorescence in some nuclei continues to increase after the wave passes them. The analysis of this particular cell allowed measurements of a given calcium signal in different regions of the myotube in order to study these phenomena (see below). The response seen is similar to the calcium transients described in cultured primary rat (5Jaimovich E. Rojas E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mice2 myotubes. Nuclear region signals appear to have a relative fluorescence change higher than the cytoplasmic signals, probably because fluo-3 is concentrated in the nucleoplasm (6Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myotubes from the dyspedic (1B5) skeletal muscle cell line, which lacks ryanodine receptors, also displayed intracellular calcium increases upon K+ stimulation, but the kinetic pattern of this signal was different from that of their “normal” counterpart (Fig.1 B). As expected in dyspedic myotubes, the fast calcium signal was not present. However, a slow increase of calcium in the nuclei was apparent several seconds (mean time 8.2 ± 4.6 s range 2–18 s) after K+ stimulation. No propagation of this signal in the cytoplasm was evident. A total of 57 independent experiments using K+ were recorded in dyspedic myotubes; 43 of them (75%) demonstrated a significant slow calcium rise in the nuclear region. It is interesting to note also a difference in duration of the slow calcium signal; the mean duration of Ca2+increase in C2C12 cells was 11.5 ± 6.0 s (range 2–26 s), whereas in dyspedic cells, the mean duration was significantly higher (27.8 ± 13.8 s range 8–42 s; p < 0.05). In a more detailed study of the intracellular calcium increases produced by potassium stimulation in both cell lines, the relative changes in the fluorescence of a cell are displayed as a function of time. In Fig. 2 A, the series of fluorescence images of a multinucleated C2C12 myotube shown in Fig. 1 A was analyzed; two different regions of equivalent areas of cytosol containing “responsive” or “unresponsive” nuclei were delimited. Within each contour, the summed intensity of all pixels in each image of the sequence was calculated (20Estrada M. Liberona J.L. Miranda M. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E132-E139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of all pixels inside the pre-established contour was quantified for each of the images of the acquired series. When the time course of relative fluorescence for C2C12 cells is analyzed (Fig. 2 A), it is evident that the signal has at least two components. Fast fluorescence rise occurred simultaneously in both areas selected, indicating a very fast, propagated signal that spanned the whole cell in less than 1 s and slowly declined. When we analyze two sections separated by 33 μm, it can be seen that fluorescence rises in both areas at the same time (fast component). However, the slow component occurred as an oscillation, starting earlier in the left-side region (filled circles) and then propagated to the right (empty circles). As a distinct nucleus fluoresced in the right-hand region (see Fig. 2 A, inset), it is possible to notice a shoulder in the curve, indicating the presence of both a faster (smaller) and a delayed component in this signal (empty circles). A similar analysis for dyspedic myotubes was also performed (Fig. 2 B). 1B5 cells show a delayed, not propagated component of calcium rise that lasted longer than those of C2C12 cells and was clearly higher in nuclear than in cytosolic regions (compare the intensity of the signal in two areas containing nuclei with that of a cytosolic area, Fig. 2 B). In another subset of experiments, we tested a possible role of calcium influx on K+-activated Ca2+ transients with confocal imaging. To minimize Ca2+ entry into myotubes, the experiments were performed in a low external Ca2+ solution containing 96 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA. In seven independent experiments each of the calcium transients were clearly visible in both C2C12 and 1B5 cells, and the spatial and temporal pattern of those signals were similar to those obtained in normal external calcium (data not shown). To identify the calcium release systems involved in these signals, we measured calcium signals in both 1B5 and C2C12 cells in the presence of known inhibitors of IP3-mediated processes. In 1B5 cells (Fig. 3), the calcium rise was either completely blocked or greatly inhibited in the presence of 10 μm phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (5 out of 6 experiments). The same happened for the slow part of the signal in C2C12 cells (not shown). 100 μmxestospongin C, an IP3 receptor blocker (24Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), also almost completely inhibited the calcium rise in 6 out of 7 experiments with 1B5 cells. Finally, as was shown by Powell et al. 2 in primary cultures, 50 μmcell-permeant modulator of the IP3-signaling 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (25Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Miroshiba K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) also inhibited the slow calcium signal in both cell lines (9 out of 12 experiments) but did not affect the fast calcium rise in C2C12cells (not shown). When C2C12 cells were previously incubated with 20 μm ryanodine, the fast rise after potassium depolarization was completely abolished (Fig.4), and a long-lasting increase of calcium fluorescence (mean duration 28 ± 6 s) was evident in the whole cell after a 6-s delay. Note that fluorescence intensity was particularly high at the level of the cell nuclei. It is also important to note in this case the complete lack of slow propagation of the signal, all nuclear fluorescence increasing at about the same time (Fig. 4). The presence of ryanodine receptor/calcium release channels (RyR channels) in C2C12 and 1B5 skeletal myotubes was studied using a radioligand assay. In C2C12 cells, [3H]ryanodine binding as a function of [3H]ryanodine concentration was hyperbolic (Fig. 5 A). The Scatchard analysis for the specific binding component (inset, Fig. 5 A) was fitted to a single family of receptors, with a high maximal binding capacity (Bmax = 0.88 pmol/mg of protein). [3H]Ryanodine binding to C2C12myotubes is similar to that described for other skeletal muscle myotubes (6Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Liberona J.L Powell J.A. Shenoi S. Petherbridge L. Caviedes R. Jaimovich E. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Liberona J.L Caviedes P. Tascón S. Hidalgo J. Giglio J.R. Sampaio S.V. Caviedes R. Jaimovich E. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, under identical assay conditions, no specific [3H]ryanodine binding could be detected in dyspedic myotubes (1B5 cells), since no difference between total and nonspecific binding was found (Fig. 5 B). This confirms the previously published results for this cell line (13Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A second family of calcium release channels known to be targeted to the nucleus corresponds to inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptors (27Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar,28Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 488-496Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Expression of IP3Rs in C2C12as well as 1B5 myotubes was determined by [3H]IP3 binding to myotube homogenates of C2C12 and 1B5 cells, respectively (Figs. 5,C and D). A saturating (specific) binding curve for [3H]IP3 was found in both cell lines. The Scatchard analysis for the specific binding component was fitted to a single family of receptors, with a high maximal binding capacity. Similar Kd values were found in 1B5 and C2C12 myotubes, 61.8 ± 16.3 and 60.1 ± 22.2 nm, respectively, and the total amount of IP3 receptors (Bmax) was the same in both cell types (3.12 versus 2.8 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). The presence of different IP3R isoforms was investigated in C2C12 and 1B5 cell myotubes by immunoblotting polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated total cell lysates (Fig.6). Cerebellum proteins (first lane, left panel) and HeLa cells (third lane, right panel) were used as positive controls for type 1 and type 3 IP3 receptors, respectively. Both C2C12 and 1B5 cell myotubes co-expressed both type 1 and type 3 IP3 receptor isoforms (Fig.6) in nearly equal proportions. However, a densitometry analysis showed that 1B5 myotubes expressed higher levels of both proteins, which were estimated as a fraction of total protein compared with C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 6, lower panels). The intracellular localization of IP3 receptor isoforms was monitored by immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.7, A and B, fluorescence due to type 1 IP3R presents a similar pattern in both C2C12 and 1B5 myotubes. Immunoreactivity is seen primarily in the nuclear envelope and some internal nuclear structures. However, the internal nuclear labeling is most likely to be nonspecific because these structures are seen when the cells are incubated with preimmune serum in place of the primary antibody (6Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The staining of type 1 IP3 receptor appears to be continuous around the nuclear envelope. This was confirmed by sectioning the cells in z axis using scanning confocal microscopy (data not shown). On the other hand, the antibody against type 3 IP3R shows a significant amount internal nuclear labeling (Fig. 7, C and D) especially in 1B5 myotubes, where it is expressed at high levels. There is also a punctate pattern of type 3 staining throughout the cellular matrix in both cell types. C2C12 myotubes showed specific immunoreactivity after exposure to anti-RyR antibodies (Fig.7 E) and demonstrated that RyR, when expressed, did not co-localize with IP3 receptor. This indicates that there is a different spatial distribution of these proteins in these myotubes. As expected, there was no RyR immunoreactivity in 1B5 myotubes (not shown). Rabbit preimmune serum was used to determine nonspecific labeling' no secondary antibody mark was evident under these conditions (Fig. 7 F). The IP3 mass was measured by a radioreceptor assay in both normal and dyspedic myotubes. The basal level of intracellular IP3 in C2C12cells was 26.1 ± 1.9 pmol/mg of protein, and in dyspedic cells, the basal level was 2–3-fold higher (80.6 ± 9.7 pmol/mg of protein). When these results are expressed as pmol of IP3per million of cells counted, this difference still persists. The level of IP3 in cultured muscle cells appears to be regulated by membrane potential; transient increases in the mass of IP3are elicited by potassium-induced depolarization (6Jaimovich E. Reyes R.

Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5278-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although its effects do not appear to confer a fully malignant phenotype in murine promyelocytes (9Kogan S.C. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5261-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Leukemic transformation is likely to initiate in a subpopulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (10Grignani F. Valtieri M. Gabbianelli M. Gelmetti V. Botta R. Luchetti L. Masella B. Morsilli O. Pelosi E. Samoggia P. Pelicci P.G. Peschle C. Blood. 2000; 96: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, PML-RARα confers resistance to growth factor starvation (10Grignani F. Valtieri M. Gabbianelli M. Gelmetti V. Botta R. Luchetti L. Masella B. Morsilli O. Pelosi E. Samoggia P. Pelicci P.G. Peschle C. Blood. 2000; 96: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably exerting its oncogenic effect through repression of the genetic program normally leading to full myeloid differentiation. Because external signals such as cytokines regulate limited expansion and maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, PML-RARα may initiate leukemia transformation in these cells by disrupting differentiation signaling pathways. However, though cytosolic signalings in APL cell differentiation are getting increasing attention (11Liu T.X. Zhang J.W. Tao J. Zhang R.B. Zhang Q.H. Zhao C.J. Tong J.H. Lanotte M. Waxman S. Chen S.J. Mao M. Hu G.X. Zhu L. Chen Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genes whose expression is repressed by PML-RARα remain poorly identified (9Kogan S.C. Bishop J.M.

Frankel S.R. Miller Jr., W.H. Scheinberg D.A. Itri L.M. Hittelman W.N. Vyas R. Andreeff M. Tafuri A. Jakubowski A. Gabrilove J. Gordon M.S. Dmitrovsky E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). This suggests that pharmacological levels of ligand can reverse the oncogenic effects of PML-RARα. It is likely that PML-RARα mediates the sensitivity of APL blasts to ATRA-induced differentiation. Indeed, ligand binding to the fusion protein induces the release of transcriptional repression (16Lin R.J. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and PML-RARα may have an ATRA-dependent activator function (17Grignani F. Ferrucci P.F. Testa U.

However, little is known about specific signaling through which ATRA induces differentiation. Antigens binding to T and B cell receptors initiate intracellular signaling events leading to clonal expansion of reactive cells. Unlike growth factor receptors, T cell receptor and B cell receptor lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. Instead, antigen receptor engagement results in activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). Among the substrates of the antigen receptor PTKs are members of a class of proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions, known as adaptors (18Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Myung P.S. Boerthe N.J. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With multiple binding sites and the potential to create combinations of multiprotein complexes, adaptors are well suited to integrate signals from surface receptors. Little is known about adaptor proteins in myeloid cells (18Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Like APL patient blasts, NB4 leukemic cells carry the t(15;17) and undergo ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation (20Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By applying a subtraction cloning approach to these cells, we identified a novel ATRA-inducible gene designated PRAM-1 (PML-RARα target gene encoding anAdaptor Molecule-1). The predicted PRAM-1 protein contains proline-rich and SH3-like domains and shares structural homologies with the adaptor SLAP-130/fyb (21da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E.

Ectopic expression of PML-RARα in U937 myeloid precursor cells inhibits PRAM-1 expression, which is superinduced upon treatment with ATRA. Furthermore, PRAM-1 is expressed and regulated early during in vitro differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Finally, PRAM-1 interacts with known partner molecules of SLAP-130/fyb, such as SLP-76 and SKAP-HOM, as well as with the PTK lyn. These observations point to PRAM-1 as an adaptor protein with potentially important roles in leukemogenesis and myeloid differentiation. NB4 (20Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P.

COS-7 cells were grown in 9-cm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell viability was estimated using standard trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing NB4, NB4.306, and U937-derived cells (≤1 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded at 2 × 105cells/ml 16 h prior to ATRA treatment. U937-PR9 and U937-MT cells were used for induction of PML-RARα expression or as control, respectively. Cells were cultured either with or without varying concentrations of ZnSO4 (Sigma) and ATRA (Sigma). Differentiation was assessed by (i) the percentage of cells with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) deposits, as described (24Breitman T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and (ii) cell morphology under light microscopy on cytospin slides stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (Sigma). Cord blood cells were obtained with informed consent from healthy donors at the end of full term deliveries at the Saint-Vincent de Paul Hospital (Paris, France). Sample preparation (achieving a purity of 95 ± 2% CD34+) and CD34+ cell culture were conducted as described (25Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Primary APL cells expressing the PML-RARα gene were obtained from patients diagnosed at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France) and kindly provided by C. Chomienne. Cells were purified and cultivated with 10−7m ATRA as described (14Chomienne C. Ballerini P. Balitrand N. Daniel M.T. Fenaux P. Castaigne S. Degos L. Blood. 1990; 76: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 days after treatment, cells were tested for differentiation (≥80% nitro blue tetrazolium-positive). Mononuclear cells and granulocytes were isolated from peripheral blood using a Ficoll Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient. Monocytes were further purified from lymphocytes using an indirect labeling system followed by a magnetic separation on a macs column (Myltenyi Biotec). Cell purity assessed by May-Grünwald-Giemsa was ≥95%. A cDNA fragment isolated from an ATRA-treated NB4 cDNA library 2C. Moog-Lutz, unpublished results. contained 1063 bp corresponding to the 3′ end of PRAM-1 cDNA. This fragment was used to search expressed sequence tag data bases (GenBankTM/EMBL and Incyte Genomics Lifeseq®) and, in combination with RACE-PCR reactions using HL-60 RACE-ready cDNA (CLONTECH), allowed us to generate 1800 bp of continuous open reading frame sequence. A 494-bp 5′ cDNA sequence was amplified by RACE-PCR from ATRA-treated NB4 RNA (with 5 × 10−7m for 48 h) using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLON- TECH) with a 5′-CCTTGGAAACGGAGTGGCCCCCAGC-3′ primer. Sequence homologies were identified using the FastA and BLAST programs by searching GenBankTM, EMBL, and the Incyte Genomics Lifeseq® data base. Sequence information from many different Incyte Genomics data base clones was used to confirm and extend the results of RACE-PCR experiments. For example, clone 3418957H1 is 100% identical to the 5′ terminal end of the final PRAM-1 RACE product clone. Using the Marathon cDNA and the Advantage-GC polymerase (CLONTECH), a contiguous cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of PRAM-1 from ATRA-treated NB4 RNA using 5′-GGCCCCAGCTCGGGTCCCACTCATC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTGTCCTGGCCCCACGCCTACC-3′ primers. PCR products were subcloned into pT-Adv (CLONTECH) and sequenced. All PCR-generated cDNAs were confirmed by multiple, independent derivations from RNA templates. Plasmid DNA was purified through Nucleobond columns (Macherey-Nagel), and double-stranded DNA templates were sequenced using pBluescript and internal primers. Sequence analysis and alignments were obtained using the GCG programs (Wisconsin Package, version 10.0-UNIX, Genetic Computer Group, Inc.). Sequence homologies were identified using the FastA and BLAST programs by searching data banks as above and, in the case of translated sequences, by searching Swiss-Prot, PIR/NBRF, and SPTREMBL data banks. The PRAM-1 coding sequence was subcloned into a pCB6+-derived expression vector (26Patwardhan S. Gashler A. Siegel M.G. Chang L.C. Joseph L.J. Shows T.B. Le Beau M.M. Sukhatme V.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 917-928PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the zinc-inducible sheep metallothionein promoter from the pMT010 vector (27Choo K.H. Filby R.G. Jennings I.G. Peterson G. Fowler K. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1986; 5: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), resulting in the pMT-PRAM-1 vector. The PRAM-1 coding sequence was also inserted into the pAT4 vector (28Lutz P. Rosa-Calatrava M. Kedinger C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to direct the expression of PRAM-1 tagged with the F domain of the human estrogen receptor at its amino terminus. SLP-76 and SKAP-HOM cDNAs were inserted into the pEF-BOS expression vector (29Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), at a site located 3′ to the sequences encoding the Flag epitope. Total RNA extraction and hybridization were as described (25Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human RNA Master Blot and human immune system multiple tissue Northern blot II were fromCLONTECH. The PRAM-1 probe corresponded to the 3′ end (1063 bp) of the PRAM-1 cDNA. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was a 574-bp PCR product obtained using 5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGA-3′ sense and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ antisense primers. Radioactivity was detected and quantified using a Storm 860 phosphorimaging system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from CD34+ cells induced to differentiate toward the myeloid lineage was extracted at different times using an Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using the AdvantageTM system (CLONTECH). Expression of the PRAM-1 and control β-actin mRNA in differentiating cells was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following primers corresponding to distinct exon sequences: sense (5′-CCTCAGTTCAGCAAGCCGCCAGGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCAGGGGGAGTGGTTGGTTTTCCAG-3′) for PRAM-1; sense (5′-CCTCGCCTTTGCCGATCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3′) for β-actin. PCR cycles were conducted with (i) denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, (ii) annealing for 45 s at 60 °C, and (iii) extension for 1 min at 72 °C, followed by an extension final step at 72 °C for 7 min. The number of PCR cycles was determined for PRAM-1 (35 cycles) and β-actin (25 cycles) to ensure quantification of the PCR products in a linear range of amplification. The β-actin PCR reaction was performed using cDNA prepared at each day of the kinetic to determine the dilutions needed to provide equal amounts of reverse transcription products for all samples. Aliquots of each PCR reaction were electrophoresed, transferred onto nylon filters (Hybond-N,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with the PRAM-1 (5′-CGGCACAGCATCTCCTCATTG-3′) and β-actin (5′-ACCCCGTGCTGCTGACCGAGG-3′) 32P-labeled probes as described (25Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified using a Storm 860 phosphorimaging system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An amino-terminal peptide (ESHQDFRSIKAKFQA) was synthesized according to the deduced amino acid sequence of the PRAM-1 protein and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a cysteine residue added to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the peptide (Eurogentec). Rabbit sera (1PNP) were collected before (pre-immune) and 3 months after the initial injection and three booster immunizations (Eurogentec). A polyclonal sheep antiserum (Elmira Biologicals) was raised against the carboxyl-terminal 134 amino acids of human PRAM-1 fused with glutathione S-transferase (generated by cloning the corresponding PRAM-1 coding sequence into the pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). The monoclonal antibody directed against the F domain of the human estrogen receptor was as described (28Lutz P. Rosa-Calatrava M. Kedinger C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from International Biotechnologies, Inc., and anti-lyn was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-SLP-76 sheep antiserum 0083 and anti-SKAP-HOM rabbit antiserum were as described (29Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) of 0.5-μg DNA vectors (adjusted to 14 μg per 9-cm Petri dish with pBluescript carrier DNA). The medium was changed after 16 h, and for zinc-induced expression of PRAM-1, 75 μmZnSO4 was added to the medium. Thirty-six h after transfection, COS-7 cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.4m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). ATRA-treated NB4 cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer. After two freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, the resulting cell lysates were cleared by a 15-min 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C. After one-step preclearing (30 min, 4 °C) with GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), antibodies (1 μl of antiserum or 1 μl of ascites fluid) were added to the cell protein extract, in a binding buffer adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After 90 min at 4 °C, 15 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose suspension were added for an additional hour. Sepharose beads were then washed three times in 0.5 ml of the binding buffer. After 5 min of boiling in Laemmli buffer, samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Background immunoreactivity was reduced by pre-incubating membranes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. Western analysis was carried out with antisera diluted 1:5000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Detection of antibody binding was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). Enzymatic activity was detected using the chemiluminescence reagent plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and autoradiography. PRAM-1 mRNA expression was increased 4 h after exposure of NB4 cells to ATRA, with maximum expression at 96 h (Fig.1 A). Sequential treatment of NB4 cells with cycloheximide and ATRA indicated that ATRA-induced up-regulation of the PRAM-1 mRNA does not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1 A). As expected, ATRA did not affect growth and differentiation (Fig. 1 B, aand b, respectively) of NB4.306, an ATRA-resistant NB4 subclone that has lost the capacity to encode an intact ATRA-binding PML-RARα fusion protein (23Dermime S. Grignani F. Clerici M. Nervi C. Sozzi G. Talamo G.P. Marchesi E. Formelli F. Parmiani G. Pelicci P.G. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, no induction of PRAM-1 mRNA was observed (Fig. 1 B, c). In contrast, expression of PRAM-1 mRNA was strongly up-regulated in NB4 cells induced to growth arrest and differentiation by ATRA (Fig.1 B, a and b, respectively). These data strongly suggest that increased PRAM-1 mRNA expression correlates with the capacity of leukemia cells to undergo granulocytic differentiation when treated with ATRA. A 2356-bp PRAM-1 cDNA was obtained from ATRA-treated NB4 cells (Fig. 1 C). The sequence surrounding a 5′ ATG codon is in agreement with the consensus initiation sequence (32Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 3′ untranslated region ends with a ATAAA polyadenylation signal followed by a poly(A) tail (33Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame of PRAM-1 consists of 2154 bp translated into a predicted protein of 718 amino acids. Residues 70–165 comprise a series of eight proline-rich repeats with the consensus sequence KPP(P/Q)P(E/Q)(V/A/ F)TDLPK. Several proline residues are clustered as type I (RXPXXP) or type II (PXXPXR) SH3 recognition motifs (34Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the carboxyl-terminal region of PRAM-1, two tyrosine-based motifs have sequences conforming to the general motif preferentially selected by Group I SH2 domains (35Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E.

Both PRAM-1 and SLAP-130/fyb contain a central, proline-rich region. Together, these data suggest that PRAM-1 is a novel adaptor protein. PRAM-1 mRNA was mainly expressed in bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.2 A), in freshly purified human granulocytes and monocytes, as well as, albeit to a much lesser extent, in lymphocytes (Fig. 2 B). PRAM-1 mRNA was not detected in non-hematopoietic tissues, except in lung, which is known to contain a number of myelo-monocytic cells (data not shown). Purified CD34-positive human cord blood cells expressed low levels of the PRAM-1 mRNA (Fig. 2 C, b, lane 1), which increased gradually during myeloid differentiation, with maximal expression at the promyelocytic stage (Fig. 2 C,b, lane 6). Analysis of leukemia cell lines assigned to specific hematopoietic lineages supported the notion that PRAM-1 is mainly expressed in myeloid cells (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that PRAM-1 mRNA is expressed and regulated during normal myelopoiesis. In contrast to NB4 cells, PRAM-1 mRNA was not induced in NB4.306 cells, suggesting that an intact PML-RARα is required for ATRA to regulate PRAM-1 mRNA expression. To explore further the role of PML-RARα in the expression of PRAM-1 mRNA, we used cell lines generated by stable transfection into human U937 myeloid precursor cells of a zinc-inducible vector without an exogenous cDNA (U937-MT) or driving the PML-RARα cDNA (U937-PR9) (17Grignani F. Ferrucci P.F. Testa U. Talamo G. Fagioli M. Alcalay M. Mencarelli A. Peschle C. Nicoletti I. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Zinc-induced expression of the PML-RARα protein in U937-PR9 cells resulted in an 8-fold decrease of PRAM-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3 A,lane 2 versus lane 1). Subsequent ATRA treatment of these cells resulted in a 60-fold increase of PRAM-1 mRNA expression at 24 h (Fig. 3 A, lane 6 versus lane 2). No repression was observed in zinc-treated U937-MT cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 8 versus lane 7), and a 3-fold increase was observed in these cells with ATRA treatment (Fig. 3 A,lane 12 versus lane 7), as expected, because U937 cells express an active retinoic acid receptor (36Botling J. Castro D.S. Oberg F. Nilsson K. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). U937-PR9 and U937-MT cells were then left untreated or treated with increasing concentrations of ZnSO4 with or without ATRA (Fig. 3 B). This dose-response experiment indicates that repression and ATRA inducibility of PRAM-1 correlates with the amount of the PML-RARα expressed. Together, these results suggest that PRAM-1 is a PML-RARα target gene. PRAM-1 mRNA was highly induced by in vitro treatment with ATRA of blasts freshly obtained from peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients with APL (Fig. 3 C) expressing the PML-RARα gene. This induction correlated with ATRA-induced differentiation of these cells, as assessed morphologically and by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay (data not shown). Using COS-7 cells transfected with a PRAM-1-expressing vector, anti-PRAM-1 polyclonal antibodies detected a specific protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa (Fig.4 A, a). The discrepancy between the predicted molecular mass of 79 kDa and its migration on SDS-PAGE was probably due to numerous prolines and charged residues in PRAM-1, as also noted for the SLP-76 (37Jackman J.K.

In ATRA-treated NB4 cells, endogenous PRAM-1 migrated at the same rate as ectopically expressed PRAM-1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 A, a), and was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment (Fig. 4 A,b).

The expression of rat TFF3 was limited to the villi of the jejunum and had no effect on base-line morphology. Rat TFF3 expression did result, however, in a reduced sensitivity to indomethacin (85 mg/kg subcutaneously), which only caused a 29% reduction in villus height in transgenics versus 51% reduction in controls (p < 0.01). Indomethacin increased initial intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration, but the presence of rat TFF3 caused no additional change in proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine), cell migration ([3H]thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine), apoptosis (terminal deoxyuridine nucleotidyl nick end labeling), or E-cadherin immunostaining. In vitrostudies following changes in resistance of intestinal strips in Ussing chambers (voltage-clamp technique) showed increased base-line resistance in the rat TFF3-expressing region (326 ± 60versus 195 ± 48 ohm·cm2 in controls,p < 0.05) and reduced the fall in resistance following HCl exposure by about 40% (p < 0.01). Overexpression of TFF3 stabilizes the mucosa against noxious agents, supporting its role in mucosal protection/repair. It may therefore provide a novel approach to the prevention and/or treatment of intestinal ulceration.

When an injury does occur, it is usually rapidly repaired by an initial process involving cell migration (restitution), increased proliferation, and subsequent remodelling. There is increasing evidence that a group of molecules, termed the trefoil factor family (TFF),1are involved in gastrointestinal defense and repair, possibly acting by more than one mechanism. Three TFF members have been identified in mammals: TFF1 (previously termed pS2), TFF2 (previously spasmolytic polypeptide), and TFF3 (previously intestinal trefoil factor). All three TFF members contain one or two highly conserved trefoil domains, are located clustered within a 50-kilobase sequence on chromosome 21q22.3 (1Gott B. Beck S. Machado J.C. Carneiro F. Schmitt H. Blin N. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 4: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and are remarkably resistant to proteolytic digestion (2Playford R.J. Marchbank T. Chinery R.

Under nondamaged circumstances, expression of the three TFF mammalian homologues are geographically distinct. TFF1 and TFF2 are both primarily located in the stomach, whereas TFF3 is predominantly present in the mucous cells of the small and large intestine (3Tomasetto C. Rio M. Gautier C. Wolf C.

The temporal relationship to acute injury varies with each peptide, however, suggesting they may have different pathophysiological roles (7Alison M.R. Chinery R. Poulsom R. Ashwood P. Longcroft J.M.

This idea is also supported by the finding that mice that have had the TFF1 gene functionally deleted (“knock-out”) have a markedly different phenotype (gastric adenomas and carcinomas; Ref. 9Lefebvre O.

To gain further insight into the function of the TFF family and TFF3 in particular, we have now established a model that chronically overexpresses rat TFF3 in the proximal small intestine of mice. We use this model to determine the effect of TFF3 overexpression under basal circumstances and its ability to influence sensitivity to damage using both in vitro and in vivo models of injury. Materials were obtained from Sigma Chemicals (Poole, Dorset, UK) unless otherwise stated. Genetic modification of animals and all animal procedures were approved by the appropriate local and national authorities. All of the animals were kept on standard chow diet ad libitum and were killed by cervical dislocation. Nucleotides −1178 to +28 of the rat FABPi promoter inserted into the EcoRI-SmaI sites of pUC13 was kindly donated by Jeff Gordon (Washington University, St. Louis, MO; Ref. 12Sweetser D.A.

The details of the production and map are shown in Fig.1. The final 1.6-kilobase cassette was microinjected into over 200 recently fertilized oocytes (strain C57 × CBA). The forward primer comprised bases 997–1017 of the FABPi sequence, and the reverse primer comprised bases 374–394 of the rTFF3, resulting in a 550-bp product. These primers detect the construct but do not cross-hybridize with native normal mouse DNA. Ear snips were collected in 0.25 ml of “ear buffer” (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmNaCl, 0.1% (v/v) SDS) and incubated in 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C for 16 h. Samples were diluted in water, boiled for 20 min, and stored at −20 °C prior to PCR analysis. Of 150 live-born mice, PCR analysis identified one founder mouse that had incorporated the construct. A line (RPTMrITF/1) was established from this founder. For all studies, heterozygotes were used because this allowed negative littermates to act as controls. To establish the expression of rTFF3 RNA in transgenic positive animals, total RNA was prepared from the intestine of several heterozygote-positive mice and -negative littermates. Total RNA was isolated from ileum and jejunum using the RNAgents/total RNA isolation system (Promega, Southampton, UK). RNA integrity was established by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was transferred to Nylon filters (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer and cross-linked by UV irradiation (UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). Northern blot analyses were performed using a specific 110-bp probe to the 3′-untranslated region of the rTFF3 cDNA, which did not interact with the native mouse TFF3 RNA. The probe was labeled with 32P using a nick translation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Filters were hybridized using QuickHyb (Stratagene) and washed as follows twice in 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and once in 0.5× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C. Equal loading of RNA into the wells was confirmed by stripping the filters and reprobing with a 558-bp32P-labeled DNA sequence corresponding to the coding region of 18 S RNA from positions 28 to 586 (kindly donated by A. Gandarillas, Imperial Cancer Research Fund). Expression of rTFF3 peptide was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining using methods described previously (14Taupin D.R. Pang K.C. Green S.P. Giraud A.S. Peptides. 1995; 15: 1001-1005Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The antibody used for these immunostaining studies, rITF1#7, is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal decapeptide of rTFF3 and detects the presence of both the rat and mouse forms of TFF3. The samples were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. 4-μm sections were cut onto poly-l-ornithine-coated slides and rehydrated. The slides were incubated with normal goat serum (1:20) for 30 min, primary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h, and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 30 min. The location of rTFF3 antibody binding was visualized using the avidin-biotin method (Vector), and a brown reaction product was obtained with a peroxidase substrate (diaminobenzidine and phosphate-buffered saline in addition to 0.3% hydrogen peroxide). This study was performed to examine the effect of rTFF3 expression on base-line and post-indomethacin morphometry (microdissected villi), proliferation (BrdUrd staining), apoptosis (terminal deoxyuridine nucleotidyl nick end labeling), cell migration up the crypt and villus (using double labeling with BrdUrd and [3H]thymidine), and cell adhesion molecule distribution (E-cadherin immunohistochemistry). Six groups (n = 6/group) of control and rTFF3 transgenic animals were injected with [3H]thymidine (0.5 mCi/kg, intraperitoneally; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 17 h before killing and BrdUrd (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 1 h before killing, i.e. the “double labeling technique,” to determine the differences in proliferation and the cell migration between groups. All animals also received a single dose of indomethacin (85 mg/kg, subcutaneously) at various time points either before or after the [3H]thymidine and BrdUrd, so that at the time of killing, changes in morphology, morphometry, and cell migration could be assessed 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h after injection of indomethacin. Following killing, the various sections of the intestine were dissected free, and the weights and lengths of the small and large intestine of transgenic and negative littermates were recorded. To maintain consistency between animals, the lengths of the small intestine and the colon were expressed as 100%, and two serial 1-cm samples were taken from the following regions of the small intestine: 5% of small intestine length (defined as duodenum), 30% of small intestine length (defined as jejunum), and 90% of small intestine length (defined as ileum). The proximal 1-cm segments of each section were collected in Carnoy's solution, left at room temperature for 4 h, and then stored in 70% alcohol until further assessment of morphology and morphometry. The second 1-cm segments were fixed in neutral buffered formalin for subsequent analysis of migration, proliferation, E-cadherin expression, and apoptosis. Using methods described previously (15Goodlad R.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 205-216Google Scholar), small pieces of the Carnoy's-fixed jejunal and ileal tissue samples were hydrated, hydrolyzed, stained with the Feulgen reaction, and transferred to 45% (v/v) acetic acid, and the crypts and villi were teased apart under a stereo dissecting microscope. The tissues were then transferred to a glass microscope slide, flattened gently beneath a coverslip, and examined under a compound microscope. The villus height, crypt depth, and cross-sectional surface area were assessed by tracing the outline of the crypts and villi using a precalibrated drawing tube. The tracings were then scanned and analyzed using a flatbed scanner connected to an Apple Macintosh computer running the National Institutes of Health public domain program IMAGE. Twenty individual crypts and villi were assessed in each animal at each site, and the mean values from these 20 measurements were used in the subsequent ANOVA. This technique utilizes the fact that because the BrdUrd was given shortly before death, whereas the [3H]thymidine was given 17 h prior, the BrdUrd provides a marker for the proliferative zone within the crypt, whereas [3H]thymidine-positive cells provide an index for the distance traveled by cells up the villus over this 16-h period. The neutral buffered formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin wax, and 5-μm-thick sections were cut on gelatin-coated slides. The sections were hydrolyzed in 1 m HCl for 8 min and 60 °C and then stained for BrdUrd with MAS 250 (Sera-Lab, Loughborough, UK) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG. A brown reaction product was obtained with a peroxidase substrate (diaminobenzidine and phosphate-buffered saline in addition to 0.3% hydrogen peroxide). Autoradiography was then carried out on these same sections; slides were dipped in K2 (Ilford Ltd., Mobbersley, UK) emulsion dissolved in water warmed to 45 °C, left to dry on a cold plate, and exposed at 4 °C for 4 weeks. The slides were immersed in D-19 developer (Kodak, Paris, France) for 4 min, immersed in 1% acetic acid for 30 s, and finally fixed twice in 30% sodium thiosulfate for 4 min. The slides were then washed in cold tap water for 1 h and counterstained using Giemsa solution. For each animal, at each of the two sites, the positions of [3H]thymidine- and BrdUrd-labeled cells were recorded from 20 individual crypts and villi. The highest labeled position was determined for both the [3H]thymidine- and the BrdUrd-labeled cells and used in the subsequent ANOVA. The rate of cell migration was determined by the difference between the highest [3H]thymidine- and BrdUrd-labeled cells. The difference between these cell positions shows the maximal distance that cells migrated within the 16-h period of the experiment. Tissue sections were cut and stained for BrdUrd as described above and counterstained with hematoxylin. The slides were examined until well orientated crypts were found. The number of labeled mitotic cells/crypt were recorded for each individual animal. Twenty crypts/animal were scored at each site, and the mean number of labeled cells was used in the subsequent ANOVA. All tissues were scored by a person unaware of the experimental conditions. In vitrostudies suggest that addition of TFF peptides may result in a down-regulation of membranous E-cadherin expression (16Liu D. El-Harirry I. Karayiannakis A.J. Wilding J. Chinery R. Kmiot W. McCrea P.D. Gullick W.J. Pignatelli M. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 557-563PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined changes in the distribution of E-cadherin in the study groups; 4-μm sections of the paraffin-embedded tissue samples were cut onto poly-l-ornithine-coated slides and rehydrated. The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and sections were microwaved for 10 min at 1200 Watts in citric acid buffer, pH 6. The slides were incubated with normal swine serum (1:20) for 30 min followed by a primary monoclonal antibody directed against E-cadherin. All of the sections were tested with two different monoclonal antibodies: HECD-1, directed against the extracellular domains 1 and 2 of human E-cadherin, (10 μg/ml, 17), and a rat-anti-mouse E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (Sigma catalog number U3254). Antibodies were incubated with slides for 16 h at 4 °C. Labeling was performed using a commercial streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (DAKO, Ely, UK). The sections were examined blind and scored for intensity (strong, weak, or negative) and distribution (basolateral only, apical, or circumferential). Three nonadjacent sections 4 μm thick were cut from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample onto poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Cells containing DNA strand breaks, a marker of apoptosis, were detected by staining using the terminal deoxyuridine nucleotidyl nick end labeling method as described previously (18Moss S.F. Attia L. Scholes J.V. Walters J.R. Holt P.R. Gut. 1996; 39: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For each block at least 10 well orientated-crypt villus units were evaluated by light microscopy (×400 magnification) by an observer unaware of the experimental conditions. The total number of cells/crypt and villus were counted, as were the number of positively staining cells/crypt and villus. The number of positively stained cells/100 cells was expressed as the apoptotic index (%). This in vitro method measures the short circuit current (Isc) across mucosal preparations under voltage-clamp (0 mV) conditions. The changes in resistance following challenge with luminal thus provides an indirect method of assessing tissue sensitivity to injurious agents (19Rutten M.J. Ito S. Mechanisms of Mucosal Protection of the Upper GI Tract. Raven Press, New York1984: 987-998Google Scholar). Transgenic mice and negative littermates (n = 6/group/site) were killed, and four adjacent segments of either jejunum and ileum intestine were placed immediately into Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4,1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 11.1 mm glucose). Full thickness tissue sections were then placed in between the two halves of a modified Ussing chamber (0.2 cm2 of exposed area) and bathed on each side with 5 ml of oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) KH solution at 37 °C, pH 7.4. Tissues were voltage-clamped at 0 mV, and the resultant basalIsc was recorded continuously, on top of which 1-mV voltage pulses were applied at 100-s intervals throughout the period of experimentation. The resultant deflections in the current were recorded, and the resistance (in ohms·cm2) was determined using Ohms Law. The mean resistance calculated from six consecutive voltage pulses, 10 min prior to washes with either KH (both sides for 10 min) or an acid wash (50 mmHCl apical and KH basolateral for 10 min) was denoted as 100% for each preparation. Following 10 min of wash (as described above), tissues were bathed once again with fresh KH. The individual resistance measurements were calculated as a percentage of the mean pre-wash values for a further 60 min. For statistical analyses, the data from all experiments are expressed as the means ± S.E. For the study on base-line parameters and sensitivity to indomethacin, the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using the presence of transgene and the time since administration of indomethacin as factors. Where a significant effect (p < 0.05) was found, individuals t tests were performed, based on the group means and residual obtained from the ANOVA, a method equivalent to repeated measures analyses. For the voltage-clamp study, basal Isc and resistance were compared between the transgenic and control groups using unpaired two-tailed t testing. The changes in resistance following HCl exposure were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using the presence of transgene and the time since acid exposure as factors (zero time point not included as zero variance). Subsequent analyses were performed as for the indomethacin study. Positive heterozygote offspring were detected using PCR (Fig.2 A). As expected when using this promoter (20Playford R.J. Marchbank T.

A. 1996; 93: 2137-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), Northern blot analyses (Fig. 2 B) and immunohistochemical staining showed that expression of rTFF3 was restricted to the jejunum of transgenic animals. Expression of rTFF3 was limited to enterocytes on the surface of the villi, with the crypts being negative (Fig. 3).Figure 3Distribution of rat TFF3 in FABPi−1178 to +28-rTFF3 fusion gene transgenic mice as demonstrated by immunostaining. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a polyclonal antibody directed against TFF3. A brown reaction product was then obtained with a peroxidase substrate. A, control animals showed presence of (mouse) TFF3 in the goblet cells of the jejunal villi (initial magnification, ×100). B, in the transgenic animals, additional positivity (because of the presence of rat TFF3) was seen in the enterocytes of the jejunal villi but, as expected using the FABP promoter, did not result in expression in the crypt region (initial magnification, ×37). C, immunostaining of villi of a transgenic animal that have been cut in cross-section showing the enterocytes stained positive for TFF3, whereas the cells and mesenchyme of the villi core were negative (initial magnification, ×100).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The morphology of microdissected villi in the jejunum of control and transgenic animals under base-line conditions was identical, with long, round ended villi (Fig.4, top panel). The villi obtained from control animals that had received indomethacin were progressively shorter with distal bulbous expansion (Fig. 4,middle panel). This effect of indomethacin was much less marked in the jejunum of transgenic animals (i.e. the rTFF3-expressing region; Fig. 4, bottom panel). Morphometric analyses showed a progresssive fall in the villus height of both the jejunum and ileum, reaching a minimum size after 12 h in the jejunum (Fig. 5, upper panel) and 24 h in the ileum (Fig. 5, lower panel). ANOVA for jejunal villus height gave a significant effect for the presence of transgenic DNA (p < 0.001) and administration of indomethacin (p < 0.001), with a significant interaction between transgenic status, administration of indomethacin, and timing (p < 0.001). This showed that the effect of the presence of transgenic DNA varied depending on the presence of indomethacin and its time since administration.Figure 5Effect of indomethacin on the jejunal morphometry of transgenic and control mice. Experimental protocol is as described in the legend for Fig. 2. Villus heights were assessed in microdissected villi obtained from control (○) and transgenic (●) animals under base-line conditions (0 h) and at various times after receiving the injection of indomethacin (n = 6 animals/group). The results are expressed as the means + S.E. * and **,p < 0.05 and <0.01 versus equivalent site and time of control animals, respectively. Note that y axis of the lower panel has a smaller range, reflecting the fact that ileal villi are shorter. Upper panel, in the jejunum of control animals, indomethacin caused a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in villus height during the period 6–24 h after indomethacin administration. The degree of shortening was much less severe, however, in the jejunum (rTFF3-expressing region) of transgenic littermates. Lower panel, indomethacin also caused significant shortening of the villi of the ileal region of control animals. A similar degree of shortening was also seen in the ileum (non-rTFF3-expressing region) of transgenic animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the finding in the jejunum, there was no difference in the degree of shortening of the ileal villi between control and trangenic animals caused by indomethacin (Fig. 5,lower panel). ANOVA gave a significant effect caused by indomethacin administration (p < 0.001) but none caused by the presence of transgenic DNA (p = 0.747), with no interaction between transgene and indomethacin (p = 0.768; Fig. 5, lower panel). For both the jejunal and ileal regions, assessment using villus surface area as the parameter of damage gave similar results to using villus height (data not shown). There was no significant effect on the crypt depths caused by the presence of transgenic DNA or indomethacin administration (data not shown). There was no significant difference in proliferation, as assessed by the number of BrdUrd-labeled mitotic cells/crypt, between transgenic mice and their negative littermates at any time point in either the jejunum or the ileum (effect of presence of transgenic DNA on ANOVA, p= 0.514 for jejunum and p = 0.388 for ileum). Administration of indomethacin caused a significant increase in the number of mitoses compared with base line at 6 and 12 h post-indomethacin administration and was followed by a decrease at 30 h post-indomethacin (Fig. 6,upper panel). Administration of indomethacin also caused a significant increase in the rate of migration compared with base line at 6, 12, and 18 h in transgenic and control animals (Fig. 6, lower panel). However, there was no significant difference in the rate of migration, as assessed by the change in the cell position over 16 h, between transgenic mice and their negative littermates at any time point in either jejunum or ileum (effect of presence of transgenic DNA on ANOVA,p = 0.122 for jejunum and p = 0.231 for ileum). Base-line apoptotic index of combined crypt and villus values was 1.54% in the jejunum of controls and 2.72% in transgenic animals (group SEM 1.03). ANOVA showed no significant effect of the presence of transgenic DNA (p = 0.133) and no effect of indomethacin (p = 0.299), with no interaction (p = 0.314). Subanalyses of the crypt and villi apoptotic indices also showed no significant differences between groups (data not shown). Both the anti-human and anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies used gave identical results; the enterocytes on the villi and within the crypts showed the presence of strong E-cadherin staining on basolateral membranes. The expression of E-cadherin was not influenced by the presence of transgene or indomethacin (Fig. 7). There was no significant difference between theIsc values in the jejunum of transgenic and control animals (6.38 ± 2.8 versus 3.75 ± 1.2 μA/cm2, p = 0.418). The ileal samples also showed no significant differences (3.05 ± 0.98 μA/cm2 in transgenic versus 3.96 ± 1.4 μA/cm2 in control animals, p = 0.61). Basal resistance measurements in the jejunal tissue of transgenic animals (rTFF3-expressing intestinal region) were higher than the equivalent region of controls (326 ± 60 versus195 ± 48 ohm·cm2, p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the basal resistances between transgenic and control animals in the ileal (non-rTFF3-expressing) region. The fall in resistance of jejunal tissue following exposure to HCl administration was significantly less in the rTFF3-expressing jejunal region of transgenic animals (effect of transgene p < 0.001; Fig.8). There was no significant difference between transgenic animals and controls, however, in the sensitivity to HCl exposure in the non-rTFF3 ileal region (ANOVA effect of trangene,p = 0.11; Fig. 8). Ectopic expression of the rat homologue of TFF3 in the jejunum of mice resulted in a normal phenotype under nondamaged circumstances but reduced the amount of initial injury sustained using in vivoand in vitro models. This protective effect of rTFF3 in the transgenic animals was limited to regions that overexpressed the peptide and, based on results from the in vivo experiment, did not appear to be mediated by alteration in proliferation, migration, or apoptosis. The trefoil peptides form a family of molecules that share a motif comprising six-cysteine residues linked by three intrachain disulfide bonds. This configuration, termed a trefoil or P domain, is distinct from those found in other peptide families such as epidermal growth factor. Three members of this family, TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3, are found in mammals, and the amino acid sequence is h"

This sequence does not show any sequence similarity to the previously reported ones involved in light-regulated gene expression. A one-hybrid screen isolated a cDNA encoding a DNA-binding protein, named DF1, with specificity for the DE1 sequence 5′-TACAGT. DF1 has domains similar to the trihelix DNA-binding domain found in the GT-1 and GT-2 proteins, which are plant transcription factors. The DE1-binding domain of DF1 is most similar to the carboxyl-terminal trihelix domain of the rice GT-2 protein with specificity for the GT2 sequence 5′-GGTAATT, which is also necessary for dark-inducible expression of the rice phyA gene. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that this DNA-binding domain specifically binds to two types of DNA sequences, DE1 and GT2. Additionally, using DF1/GT-1 chimeras, we show that the second and third helices of the trihelix DNA-binding domain of DF1 are responsible for this dual DNA binding specificity. Our results show that DF1 has specificity for the two distinct cis-regulatory elements, both important for light down-regulated and dark-inducible gene expression in higher plants.

Our results show that DF1 has specificity for the two distinct cis-regulatory elements, both important for light down-regulated and dark-inducible gene expression in higher plants. base pair 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside electrophoretic mobility shift assay wild type glutathione S-transferase decahistidine-tagged Light is one of the most important signals affecting plant gene expression (1Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Light signals regulate the transcription of a number of genes in positive and negative manners. The mechanisms of light-enhanced transcription have been extensively studied (1Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Variouscis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors responsible for light-enhanced gene expression have been characterized (1Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of light down-regulated transcription is less clear. Only a few cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors responsible for down-regulation have been reported. For example, the GT2 (5′-GGTAATT) sequence in the light down-regulated ricephyA gene is necessary for dark-activation of this gene (2Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Affinity screening using GT2 sequences has been used to isolate the DNA-binding protein, named GT-2 (2Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The GT-2 protein is a member of the trihelix DNA-binding proteins (3Zhou D.-X. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which are considered to be specific to plants and have domain(s) containing three α helices involved in DNA binding. Although the GT-2 protein is one of the well characterized plant DNA-binding proteins, the function of its binding site, the GT2 sequence, is less clear because there has been no report concerning a gain-of-function analysis using the GT2 sequence fused to the minimal promoter. Therefore, combinatorial interaction between the GT2 element and the other element may be required for dark activation. Except for the GT2 protein, we do not know of a DNA-binding protein with specificity for the cis-regulatory element involved in light down-regulated gene expression. Previously, we reported that a small GTPase gene in pea,pra2, which belongs to the YPT/rab family, is one of the genes whose expression is down-regulated by photoreceptor phytochrome (4Yoshida K. Nagano Y. Murai N. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6636-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The pra2 gene is mainly expressed in the growing zone of etiolated epicotyls, and its expression is repressed when the plant is illuminated (5Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The DE1 sequence (5′-GGATTTTACAGT) in thepra2 gene is another cis-regulatory element necessary for light down-regulated and dark-enhanced expression in plants (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function analysis has shown that the DE1 sequence is sufficient to confer dark-inducible and light down-regulated expression to a minimal promoter (7Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-19727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This sequence does not show any sequence similarity to the previously reported ones involved in light-regulated gene expression. In addition, to our knowledge, DE1 is the first discovered cis-regulatory element that is both necessary and sufficient for light regulation. Physiological and genetic analyses have shown that the DE1 sequence receives the signals from phytochrome A, phytochrome B, and blue-light photoreceptors (7Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-19727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, the DE1 sequence should be a useful tool for studying the molecular mechanism involved in light down-regulated gene expression in plants. In this study, we identified a cDNA whose product binds to the DE1 sequence. We found that this protein is a member of the trihelix DNA-binding proteins and binds to two distinctcis-regulatory elements, DE1 and GT2, both important for light down-regulated and dark-inducible expression in plants. The methods for the creation of reporter constructs were described previously (7Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-19727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For the first screening, the pHISi reporter plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing five tandem copies of the 18-bp1sequence, which contains the DE1 sequence with neighboring 3 bp at both ends, was used. For the second screening, the pLacZi reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) containing nine tandem copies of the 18-bp sequence, which contains the DE1 sequence with neighboring 3-bp at both ends, was used. For the third screening, the pLacZi reporter plasmid containing three tandem copies of the 20-bp sequence, which contains the DE1 sequence with neighboring 4 bp at both ends, was used. The reporter constructs were integrated into the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae YM4271 (CLONTECH). Total RNA was prepared from the growing zones of pea (Pisum sativum cv. Alaska) stems (between 0 and 1 cm from the top of the hook) that had been grown in the dark for 7 days at 25 °C as described elsewhere (8Nagano Y. Murai N. Matsuno R. Sasaki Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 447-455PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+-RNA was extracted by the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Complementary DNA was synthesized with the HybriZAP-2.1 two-hybrid cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), cloned into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of HybriZAP-2.1 or λZapII, and packaged using the MaxPlax packaging extract (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The plasmid library was constructed by excising from the HybriZAP library by infection with the helper phage ExAssist (Stratagene). The resulting HybriZAP cDNA library contained ∼8 × 106 independent cDNAs. The histidine yeast reporter strain was transformed with a pea cDNA library by the LiAc/polyethylene glycerol method. Approximately 1.5 × 107 cDNA plasmids were screened. Based on their large colony size and rapid growth, about 500 histidine-positive clones were selected. Plasmids were recovered and electroporated into theEscherichia coli strain DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids were rescreened by transforming the second lacZreporter strain. The filter-replica method using X-gal was used to confirm β-galactosidase activities. Three plasmids showed the blue color. These plasmids were rescreened by transforming the thirdlacZ reporter strain. One plasmid showed the blue color. To isolate the full-length cDNA, a λZapII cDNA library was screened using a part of this cDNA insert as a probe. The gene was named DF1. The accession number for the sequence reported in this article is AB052729. The protein expression vector used in this study was pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the pET-16b vector (Novagene). Procedures for the production and purification of a fusion polypeptide were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. The polypeptide containing the trihelix DNA-binding domain (from 519 to 651) of the pea DF1 protein was expressed in E. coli as a decahistidine-tagged (His10 tag) protein or a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused protein. The GST-fused GT-1 protein contains the Arabidopsis GT-1 sequence (from 65 to 195). DF1/GT-1 chimeras were created by the overlap extension method (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). The GST-fused chimera protein, GT-1helix 1-DF1helices 2–3, contains theArabidopsis GT-1 sequence (from 65 to 108) and the pea DF1 sequence (from 563 to 651). Another GST-fused chimera protein, DF1helices 1–2-GT-1helix 3, contains the pea DF1 sequence (from 519 to 578) and the Arabidopsis GT-1 sequence (from 125 to 195). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed by the method previously described (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The probes used in this study, DE1 and GT2, are shown in Figs. 3 A and 4 A, respectively. The recombinant protein (5 pmol) was mixed in 20 μl of the binding buffer (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), bovine serum albumin (500 μg/μl) and competitor DNA. The competitor DNAs used in this study are listed in Figs. 3 A and 4 A. The protein-DNA complex was formed by incubating at 25 °C for 20 min with 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe (4 fmol). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4 °C in a 5% polyacrylamide Tris/borate/EDTA gel containing 10% glycerol. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography.Figure 4Determination of the DNA sequence bound to the DF1 protein using the GT2 probe.

Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) was used to screen for pea cDNA encoding for protein that binds to the DE1 sequence. Tandem copies of the 18-bp sequence containing the 12-bp DE1 sequence with a neighboring 3 bp at each end were subcloned into the upstream region of HIS3 andlacZ reporter genes. About 500 histidine-positive clones were selected from 1.5 × 107 transformants (Fig.1 A). We rescreened plasmids recovered from histidine-positive clones by transforming thelacZ reporter strain and obtained three plasmids showinglacZ-positive phenotypes (Fig. 1 B). To exclude the cDNAs whose products bind to the joint sequence between the 18 bp sequences, we rescreened the plasmids using the reporter constructs having tandem copies of the 20-bp sequence containing the DE1 sequence with a neighboring 4 bp at each end. Finally, one plasmid showed alacZ-positive phenotype (Fig. 1 C). To isolate longer cDNAs, this cDNA was used to screen a λZAPII cDNA library. We further characterized the longest cDNA of the isolated clones. The gene, designated as DF1, contains an open reading frame of 682 amino acid residues. A sequence similarity search revealed that DF1 has domains similar to the trihelix DNA-binding domain (3Zhou D.-X. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) found in GT-1 (11Perisic O. Lam E.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) proteins. GT-1 and GT-2 are DNA-binding proteins that recognize light-responsivecis-regulatory elements and are homologous within trihelix DNA-binding domains, which contain three α helices involved in DNA binding. Fig. 2 A shows the schematic representation of DF1 and other related proteins. Among trihelix DNA-binding proteins, DF1 is the most similar to proteins having twin trihelix DNA-binding domains, such as GT-2 and GTL-1 proteins. These twin trihelix DNA-binding proteins differ structurally from GT-1 because GT-1 has only one trihelix DNA-binding domain. The DF1 protein also has twin trihelix domains. In addition to having two conserved DNA-binding domains, GT-2, GTL-1, and DF1 proteins each have an additional conserved domain, a central domain, which is located between two DNA-binding domains. However, except for the three conserved domains, the amino acid sequences of these twin trihelix DNA-binding proteins are not conserved. Fig. 2 B shows the multiple alignments among several trihelix DNA-binding proteins. As recent in silico analysis has postulated that the trihelix domain is distantly related to the Myb DNA-binding domain (15Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the alignment includes the c-Myb DNA-binding domains. All these proteins have well conserved amino acid residues. Among Arabidopsisproteins, the amino acid sequence of DF1 is most similar to that of the protein predicted from the BAC clone F7O12 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, DF1 is not orthologous to GT-2 and GTL-1 proteins. However, proteins having twin trihelix DNA-binding domains, such as DF1, GT-2, and GTL-1, may have overlapping functions because they share a high degree of similarity. The orthologous Arabidopsis gene is located adjacent to the GT-2 gene, in the opposite orientation, on chromosome 1. To analyze the DNA-binding specificity of the DF1 protein, we conducted an EMSA using a 31-bp synthetic DNA probe containing the single DE1 sequence (Fig.3 A, WT). We focused only on the carboxyl-terminal trihelix domain of DF1 because a one-hybrid screen first isolated this DNA-binding domain, and studies of both domains would have been complicated. We expressed the carboxyl-terminal trihelix DNA-binding domain of DF1 in E. coli as a His10 tag or a GST-fused protein. The addition of the His10 tag DF1 protein to the binding reaction mixture showed the retarded band(s) of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). The addition of the GST-fused DF1 protein to the binding reaction mixture also showed the retarded bands of DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). Because it is easy to produce sufficient amounts of recombinant GST-fused protein and it is difficult to dissolve the His10 tag DF1 protein in solution, we used the GST-fused DF1 protein in the following experiments. The results were essentially the same as those of the experiments using the His10 tag protein (data not shown). To test whether the observed binding was specific to the DE1 sequence, we carried out competition experiments. The competitor sequences are shown in Fig. 3 A. The addition of a 400-fold wild-type competitor diminished the retarded band (Fig. 3 B, lane 4, WT). The MT competitor contained the three nucleotide changes, which could not bind to the nuclear factors with specificity for the DE1 sequence (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A gain-of-function analysis using the 3-bp mutated constructs fused to the minimal promoter has shown that this construct does not have the ability for light down-regulation (7Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-19727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The EMSA showed that the MT competitor did not diminish the retarded band (Fig.3 B, lane 5). These data indicate that the DNA binding specificity is consistent with the results of the EMSA using nuclear extracts (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the gain-of-function analysis (7Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-19727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine the core-binding site of the DF1 protein, we carried out competition experiments using the 6-bp mutated competitors (Fig.3 A, LS2-LS4). In our previous work (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we identified the DE1 element using the 6-bp mutated constructs by transient assay analysis. The LS3 construct (Fig. 3 A) did not show red-light down-regulation. The LS2 construct (Fig.3 A) affected red-light down-regulation. This analysis indicates that the 12-bp sequence, designated DE1 (5′-GGATTTTACAGT), mediates phytochrome down-regulation and that the 6-bp sequence (5′-TACAGT) is the core region for down-regulation. The addition of a 400-fold LS3 competitor did not diminish the retarded band (Fig.3 B, lane 7). The addition of an LS2 competitor diminished the band slightly (Fig. 3 B, lane 6), whereas the addition of an LS4 competitor diminished the band greatly (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). These results show that recombinant DF1 binds the DE1 sequence and the core-binding site is the sequence 5′-TACAGT. Thus, these results are very consistent with those of the transient assay analysis (6Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine the DF1-binding site more precisely, we carried out competition experiments using the pairwise-mutated competitors (Fig.3 A, MT1-MT9). The addition of MT4, MT5, and MT6 competitors, which correspond to the core region of the DE1 element, did not diminish the retarded band (Fig. 3 B, lanes 12–14). The addition of the MT2 and MT3 competitors diminished the band slightly (Fig. 3 B, lanes 10 and11), and the addition of other competitors diminished the band greatly (Fig. 3 B, lane 9 and lanes 15–17). These results show that the sequence 5′-TACAGT is the core-binding site of the DF1 protein, and its surrounding sequence is slightly involved in the binding of the DF1 protein. The DE1-binding domain shows sequence similarities to many trihelix DNA-binding domains. Among these, the binding sequences of GT-1 (11Perisic O. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and GT-2 (2Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proteins have been characterized. The GT1 element (5′-GTGTGGTTAATATG) of pea rbcS-3Ais the binding site of tobacco GT-1. (The core-binding sequence is underlined.) The GT2 (5′-TGGCGGTAATTAAC) and the GT3 (5′-TCGAGGTAAATCCG) sequences of rice phyA are the binding sites of carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal trihelix DNA-binding domains, respectively, of the rice GT-2 protein (13Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the DF1 binding sequence (5′-TACAGT) is clearly different from the binding sequences of GT-1 and GT-2 proteins. The DE1-binding domain of the DF1 protein is most similar to the GT2 element-binding domain of the rice GT-2 protein. To determine whether DF1 has the ability to bind to the binding sites of these trihelix DNA-binding proteins, we carried out competition experiments using competitors containing the above binding sequences (Fig. 3 A, GT1-GT3). The addition of GT1 and GT3 competitors did not diminish the retarded band (Fig. 3 B, lanes 18 and 20). However, the addition of a GT2 competitor diminished the band (Fig.3 B, lane 19). Thus, these results suggest that DF1 has the ability to bind to the GT2 element. The complementary sequence of the GT2 probe (5′-TGGCGGTAATTAAC) is 5′-GTTAATTACCGCCA. In this complementary sequence, the sequence 5′-TACCGC is partly similar to the core DE1 sequence 5′-TACAGT. Therefore, the DF1 protein might bind to this sequence and not to the GT2 core sequence. To determine the DNA binding specificity to the GT2 sequence, we also conducted the EMSA using a 31-bp synthetic DNA probe containing the GT2 sequence (Fig.4 A, GT2) and the pairwise-mutated competitors (Fig. 4 A). The addition of the GST-fused DF1 protein to the binding reaction mixture showed the retarded bands of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 4 B,lane 2). The addition of MT12, MT13, MT 14, and MT15 competitors, which correspond to the core region of the GT2 element, did not diminish the retarded bands (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6–9). The addition of the MT11 competitors diminished the bands slightly (Fig. 4 B, lane 5), and the addition of the GT2, MT10, MT16, and WT (containing the DE1 sequence) competitors diminished the bands greatly (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–4and lanes 10–11). This analysis showed that the core-binding site of DF1 is 5′-GGTAATTA. This recognition specificity of the DF1 protein is very similar to that of the GT-2 protein (2Dehesh K. Bruce W.B. Quail P.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, these results again show that DF1 has the ability to bind specifically to the GT2 sequence, which is clearly different from the core DE1 sequence. We are interested in knowing which helices of the trihelix DNA-binding domain of DF1 are responsible for the dual DNA binding specificity. In addition, it has not been determined which helices of the trihelix DNA-binding domain of the other related protein can recognize DNA sequences, although deletion and mutational analyses have shown that the trihelix DNA-binding domain of Arabidopsis GT-1 is essential for DNA binding (16Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine the mode of action for recognizing two distinct DNA sequences, we conducted the EMSA using DF1/GT-1 chimeras (Fig.5). Fig. 5 A shows the recombinant proteins used in this study. Both DF1 and GT-1helix 1-DF1helices 2–3 proteins were able to bind to two types of sequences, the GT2 and DE1 sequences (Fig.5 B, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8), although the DF1 protein bound to these sequences more strongly. Each of two types of proteins could have similar affinities to the GT2 and DE1 sequences. In contrast, the DF1helices 1–2-GT-1helix 3 protein bound to neither of two types of sequences (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 9). The GT-1 protein bound to both sequences only weakly (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 10). Thus, the second and third helices of the trihelix domain are responsible for the binding to the DE1 and GT2 sequences. The creation of the chimera protein may affect the DNA binding specificity. To determine the DNA binding specificity of the DF1helices 1–2-GT-1helix 3 protein to both sequences, we conducted the EMSA using the pairwise-mutated competitors. The addition of MT12, MT13, MT14, and MT15 competitors to the binding reaction mixture containing the labeled GT2 probe did not diminish the retarded bands (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5–8). On the other hand, the addition of GT2, MT11, and MT16 competitors diminished the bands slightly (Fig. 5 C,lanes 3, 4, and 9). Thus, although the specificity to the sequence was reduced markedly, the core GT2 sequence, 5′-GGTAATTA, could be the core-binding site of the DF1helices 1–2-GT-1helix 3 protein. Similarly, the addition of MT4, MT5, and MT6 competitors to the binding reaction mixture containing the labeled DE1 probe did not diminish the retarded bands (Fig. 5 C, lanes 14–16). On the other hand, the addition of WT, MT3, and MT7 competitors diminished the bands slightly (Fig. 5 C, lanes 12, 13, and 17). These results show that the DE1 sequence 5′-TACAGT is the core-binding site of the DF1helices 1–2-GT-1helix 3 protein. Thus, this chimera protein can recognize two distinct DNA sequences, DE1 and GT2, indicating that second and third helices of the DNA-binding domain are responsible for the dual DNA binding specificity. The carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain of DF1 can recognize two distinct cis-regulatory elements, DE1 and GT2, both important for light down-regulated and dark-inducible gene expression in higher plants. This is an especially exquisite mechanism as DF1 protein transduces information from the light signal to the two effectors, DE1 and GT2. Plants must have acquired this mechanism during the course of evolution. One possible explanation for this evolved mechanism is that ancestral DF1 protein could bind to only one recognition sequence and the subsequent discontinuous change(s) in the amino acid sequence of the DNA-binding domain resulted in the dual DNA binding specificity. Another possibility is that continual changes in both the DNA-binding domain and its recognition sequences eventually resulted in the dual DNA binding specificity. In the current study, we have described a DNA-binding protein having a domain that recognizes two distinct DNA sequences, although both arecis-regulatory elements having similar functions. Interestingly, two recognition sequences show no or little sequence similarities. To date, cases in which one DNA-binding protein has the specificity for distinct, although related, sequences have been reported. For example, the DNA-binding protein MYB.Ph3, a member of the MYB proteins in Petunia, binds to two types of sequences: 5′-A(a/D)(a/D)C(G/C)GTTA (where a/D is A, G, or T, A as the preferred base) and 5′-AGTTAGTTA (17Solano R. Fuertes A. Sanchez-Pulido L. Valencia A. Paz-Ares J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2889-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, murine c-MYB only binds to the former sequence. A single residue substitution in MYB.Ph3 caused a switch from the dual DNA binding specificities to the c-MYB specificity (17Solano R. Fuertes A. Sanchez-Pulido L. Valencia A. Paz-Ares J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2889-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, c-MYB with the reciprocal substitution gained MYB.Ph3 specificity (17Solano R. Fuertes A. Sanchez-Pulido L. Valencia A. Paz-Ares J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2889-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the trihelix DNA-binding domain may be distantly related to the Myb DNA-binding domain (15Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Single or multiple residue substitutions in the trihelix DNA-binding domain from the ancestral protein might cause dual DNA binding specificity for two distinct and unrelated cis-regulatory elements. The dual DNA binding specificity might be the common feature of the trihelix DNA-binding protein. Arabidopsis GT-1 binds not only to the GT1 sequence 5′-GGTTAA but also to the repeated GATA sequences (16Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the precise characteristics of the protein have not been determined because the precise specificity to the GATA sequence has not been determined and these two recognition sequences may be related. Affinity screening using GT-1 binding sites has isolated the GT1 protein (11Perisic O. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies have postulated that three putative α helices (trihelix domain) in GT-1 might be involved in DNA binding. Subsequent deletion analyses of GT-1 have shown that the trihelix DNA-binding domain of GT-1 is certainly involved in DNA binding (16Hiratsuka K. Wu X. Fukuzawa H. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined which helices are responsible for DNA binding. Using DF1/GT-1 chimeras, the current study showed that second and third helices of the trihelix DNA-binding domain of DF1 are responsible for specific DNA binding. This mode of action is similar to those of the other DNA-binding proteins containing three helices, such as the Myb DNA-binding domain and the homeodomain. A recent in silico study has postulated that the trihelix DNA-binding domain is distantly related to the Myb DNA-binding domain (15Nagano Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, this postulation is consistent with our results using DF1/GT-1 chimeras. In the current study, we added a characterized member of trihelix DNA-binding proteins. The carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain of DF1 can bind to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, DE1 and GT2, both responsible for light down-regulated and dark-inducible gene expression in higher plants. The rice GT-2 protein binds to the GT2 sequence, which is necessary for dark-inducible expression of the ricephyA gene. As the GT-2 protein shares a high degree of similarity to DF1, the GT-2 protein might also bind to the DE1 sequence. Another trihelix DNA-binding protein, GT-1, can bind to the GT1 sequence, which is necessary but not sufficient for light-induced expression of the pea rbcS-3A gene (11Perisic O. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Gilmartin P.M. Memelink J. Hiratsuka K. Kay S.A. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the trihelix DNA-binding proteins could be generally important for light-regulated gene expression. In addition, the current study emphasizes the importance of twin trihelix DNA-binding proteins for light down-regulated and dark-inducible gene expression in plants.Arabidopsis, the genome of which was almost completely sequenced (18The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, Nature, 408, 2000, 796, 815.Google Scholar), contains more than 10 trihelix DNA-binding proteins (several of which are listed in Refs. 4Yoshida K.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the trihelix DNA-binding proteins, especially of twin trihelix DNA-binding proteins including DF1 protein, should be an important task for the research of light-regulated gene expression in plants.

Subsequent ring opening of the covalently bound nucleotide followed by hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond could then afford the pyrimidine type product. The hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond without prior ring opening could afford GMP. The enzyme reaction is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.3. Inhibition by pyrophosphate is competitive.

Specifically, GTP cyclohydrolase I catalyzes a ring expansion of GTP (Compound 1) conducive to the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (Compound 3) (1Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2349-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shiota T. Palumbo M.P. J. Biol.

On the other hand, GTP cyclohydrolase II catalyzes the formation of a pyrimidine derivative that serves as the first committed intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of riboflavin (Compound 5) (Fig. 1) (5Foor F.

Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme converts GTP (Compound 1) into a mixture of pyrophosphate, formate, and a heterocyclic reaction product that was assigned as 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-monophosphate (Compound 4) (Fig.1) on the basis of indirect evidence. More recently, Blau et al. (13Blau N. Bosshard R. Redweik U. Niederwieser A. Biochem. Clin. Aspects Pteridines. 1982; 1: 103-116Google Scholar) obtained chromatographic evidence for the formation of two different heterocyclic products, but these were not investigated in more detail. The ribA gene specifying GTP cyclohydrolase II ofEscherichia coli has been cloned by marker rescue (14Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G. Volk R. Kohnle A. Lottspeich F. Allendorf D. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4045-4051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Certain microorganisms and plants were subsequently shown to specify bifunctional enzymes comprising GTP cyclohydrolase II and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase domains (15Herz S. Eberhardt S. Bacher A. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway are potential targets for anti-infective chemotherapy because enterobacteria and certain yeasts are unable to absorb riboflavin from the environment and therefore absolutely depend on endogenous biosynthesis of the vitamin. The need for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies is urgent in light of the rapidly progressing resistance development in all major pathogen groups. With this aim, we describe studies on the reaction mechanism of GTP cyclohydrolase II, the first enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. H218O (18O enrichment > 95%) was purchased from Promochem (Wesel, Germany). [ribosyl-13C5]GTP was prepared as described previously (9Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P.

Recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase II fromE. coli was purified as described previously (16Bacher A. Richter G. Ritz H. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Krieger C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and protein. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance at 293 nm was recorded. The concentration of 2,5-diamino-6-β-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (Compound 4) was estimated photometrically using an absorption coefficient of ε293 nm = 9.6 mm−1 cm−1 (17Dietrich R. Bencovic S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6144-6145Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Alternatively, enzyme assays were performed as described previously (16Bacher A. Richter G. Ritz H. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Krieger C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 13C and31P NMR spectra were recorded with a DRX 500 spectrometer equipped with four channels and a pulsed gradient unit from Bruker Instruments (Karlsruhe, Germany). One-dimensional 13C and31P NMR spectra were measured under 1H decoupling (WALTZ16). Two-dimensional HMQC and HMQC-total correlation spectroscopy spectra were performed with XWINNMR software (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany). The length of total correlation spectroscopy mixing was 60 ms. 13C and 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced to external trimethylsilyl propane sulfonate. 31P chemical shifts were referenced to external 75% phosphoric acid in 10% D2O. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm GTP, 10% D2O, and 43% H218O (>95 atom %) (v/v). The total volume was 500 μl. A solution containing 50 μg of recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase II from E. coli was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Reaction mixtures containing 10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.95 mm GTP, and 5 μg of recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase II ofE. coli were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Aliquots of 30 μl were retrieved at intervals. After the addition of 10 μl of 40 mm EDTA solution, 30-μl aliquots were applied to an HPLC column of Hypersil ODS (5 μm, 4 × 250 mm, Schambeck, Bad Honnef, Germany) that was developed with a mixture of isopropanol/triethylamin/85% phosphoric acid/water (8:10:3:979, v/v, pH 7.0). The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored photometrically with a diode array photometer. The product of GTP cyclohydrolase II can easily decompose under the formation of 2,4,5-triamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone as shown already by Foor and Brown (5Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize decomposition, we analyzed crude reaction mixtures by 1H, 13C, and31P NMR spectroscopy without any pretreatment. [ribosyl-13C5]GTP was used as substrate to increase the sensitivity and selectivity of NMR detection. As a consequence of the 13C-labeling pattern of the proffered substrate, only product carbon atoms originating from the carbohydrate side chain of the substrate afforded intense13C NMR signals (Fig. 2, Table I). These signals are all characterized by complex multiplet structures caused by13C13C coupling. Two-dimensional1H13C correlation experiments (Fig.3) identified two spin systems corresponding to two major reaction products (Compounds 4and 6, Fig. 4). The relative NMR signal intensities indicated a molar ratio of 1.4 for Compound4/Compound 6. The 1H and13C NMR chemical shifts, as well as13C13C and 13C1H coupling patterns of both products were typical forN-ribosyl moieties (Table I). The glycosidic carbon atoms with 13C chemical shifts at 84.7 and 81.5 ppm correlated to1H signals at 5.82 and 5.58 ppm, respectively, in the HMQC experiment (Fig. 3 A). 13C31P couplings were observed for the 13C NMR signals of 4′- and 5′-carbon atoms of both glycosides indicating 5′-phosphate motifs (Fig.2, Table I).Table INMR data of [13 C5-ribosyl]2,5-diamino-6α-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (Compound 6) and [13 C5-ribosyl]2,5-diamino-6β-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (Compound 4)Carbon atomChemical shiftCoupling constantsHMQC-total correlation spectroscopy1H13C31PJCCJCPppmHzCompound61′5.8281.45 (dd)39.9 (2′), 5.3 (3′)1′, 2′2′4.2470.22 (dd)38.2 (1′, 3′)1′, 2′, 3′3′4.2471.05 (ddd)3.0 (1′), 38.6 (2′, 4′)2′, 3′, 4′4′4.0280.89 (ddd)44.7 (5′), 36.5 (3′)8.53′, 4′, 5′5′3.7663.50 (dd)43.2 (4′)4.54′, 5′31P7.22Compound41′5.5884.73 (dd)44.2 (2′)1′, 2′2′4.2073.4 (dd)44.4 (1′), 38.3 (3′)1′, 2′, 3′3′4.2070.92 (ddd)39.5 (2′, 4′)1′, 2′, 3′, 4′4′4.0082.84 (ddd)38.2 (3′), 43.1 (5′)8.43′, 4′, 5′5′3.7363.88 (dd)4.5 (3′), 43.2 (4′)4.54′, 5′31P7.13 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Two-dimensional 1H13C correlation spectra of a product mixture obtained by treatment of [ribosyl-13C5]GTP with GTP cyclohydrolase.

Signal integrals are summarized in Table II. The low intensity signal at 7.07 ppm was tentatively interpreted as GMP. This assignment was subsequently confirmed by HPLC analysis (TableIII, Fig. 5). The rate of formation of GMP as compared with that of the main products, Compounds 4 and 6, is about 10–15% as shown by HPLC and 31P NMR analysis.Table II31 P NMR signals of the GTP cyclohydrolase II product mixtureCompoundChemical shiftRelative integralsppm%Compound 67.2279Compound 47.13100GMP7.0725Pyrophosphate−3.75280 Open table in a new tab Table IIIHPLC analysis of reaction mixturesCompoundRetention volumemlCompound43.5Compound 63.8GMP5.2GDP6.3GTP7.5Samples were applied to a HPLC column of Hypersil ODS (5 μm, 4 × 250 mm) that was developed with a mixture of isopropanol/triethylamin/85% phosphoric acid/water (8:10:3:979, v/v, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1.

GDP was present as a contamination in the commercial GTP used for certain assays and could be detected by HPLC, but the GDP concentration did not increase during the enzyme reaction. It follows that the enzyme can hydrolyze the α/β- but not the β/γ-anhydride bond of GTP without the accompanying release of formate from the imidazole ring of GTP. GMP is generated by the catalytic activity of the enzyme and not by spontaneous hydrolysis. HPLC analysis monitored by a diode array photometer showed that Compounds 4 and 6 have slightly different absorption maxima at 294 and 291 nm, respectively (Fig.6). The substrate, GTP, has hardly any absorption at this wavelength. The enzyme-catalyzed reaction can therefore be monitored conveniently via the absorption change at 293 nm (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). To study the mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed phosphoanhydride hydrolysis in more detail, GTP was treated with GTP cyclohydrolase II in a buffer containing at least 41% H218O. 31P NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed satellite signals with up-field shifts of 25 ppb for the N-glycosides and 23 ppb for GMP (Fig. 7). The satellite signals represented ∼42% of the total intensity of each respective signal in close accordance with the fraction of H218O in the reaction mixture. On the other hand, the 31P NMR signal of pyrophosphate did not show a heavy isotope satellite. It follows that the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction contributes solvent oxygen exclusively to the organic products and not to pyrophosphate. Steady-state kinetic analysis (data not shown) showed significant deviation from Michaelis-Menten behavior. The data could be best approximated by a cooperative model with a Hill coefficient of 1.33 ± 0.24 (Table IV).Table IVKinetic properties of wild-type GTP Cyclohydrolase II of E. coliParametersValueKapp (μM)29 ± 3Hill coefficient1.33 ± 0.24Kl (low concentration of orthophosphate) (μM)0.94 ± 0.27Kl (high concentration of orthophosphate) (μM)9.4 ± 0.9Kl (pyrophosphate) (μM)24 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Foor and Brown (5Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that GTP cyclohydrolase II is inhibited by pyrophosphate, but the details had not been studied. We found that pyrophosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor with aKI of 24 ± 7 μm. Orthophosphate acts as a partial uncompetitive inhibitor at low concentrations. At high phosphate concentrations, the type of inhibition changed to a competitive mode (data not shown) (Table IV). Niederwieser and co-workers (13Blau N. Bosshard R. Redweik U. Niederwieser A. Biochem. Clin. Aspects Pteridines. 1982; 1: 103-116Google Scholar) have observed two different ultraviolet-absorbing compounds by HPLC analysis of GTP cyclohydrolase II reaction mixtures, but the structures of these compounds were not determined. A more detailed analysis using HPLC and NMR spectroscopy revealed two major products and one minor product. The two major products could be identified as N-ribosyl monophosphates and were assigned as the α- and β-anomers of 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-3(4H)-pyrimidinone 5′-monophosphate (Compounds 6 and 4, Fig. 4). The minor product was identified as GMP. The origin of the α-anomer is attributed to spontaneous isomerization of the β-anomer produced by enzyme catalysis. Earlier, we reported on the spontaneous anomerization of Compound 2 (Fig. 1), which serves as an intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I (9Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ribose side chains of the formamide derivative 2 and the aminopyrimidine derivative 4 afford similar13C NMR spectra. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction by HPLC and31P NMR spectroscopy indicates that the formation of the α-isomer is delayed by comparison with that of the β-isomer (data not shown). In summary, these results indicate that the α-isomer is an artifactual species obtained by spontaneous isomerization. On the other hand, the data show that the formation of GMP at a low rate is a genuine enzyme-catalyzed reaction because no spontaneous formation of GDP was found to occur under the reaction conditions. This is well in line with data by Kobayashi et al. (18Kobayashi M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26394-26399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), who showed that the 5′-triphosphates of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine can be converted to the respective monophosphates by GTP cyclohydrolase II, although the enzyme is unable to open the imidazole ring of the structurally modified guanine residues of these nucleotides. We proposed earlier that the initial step in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II could involve the attack of the triphosphate moiety of GTP (Compound 1) by a nucleophilic amino acid side chain affording a phosphoguanosyl derivative of the enzyme (Compound7) and inorganic pyrophosphate (19Bacher A. Eisenreich W. Kis K. Ladenstein R. Richter G. Scheuring J. Weinkauf S. Bioorganic Chemistry Frontiers.in: Dugas H. Schmidtchen F.P. 3. Springer, Berlin1993: 147-192Google Scholar) (Fig.8). The covalently bound nucleotide could then undergo ring opening leading to Compound 8, and the reaction could be terminated by hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester motif. Alternatively, cleavage of the phosphodiester bond without preliminary ring opening should yield GMP (Compound9) as the final product. The proposed mechanism involving covalent catalysis with the formation of a phosphodiester requires the incorporation of 18O from solvent into each of the products, i.e. the 5-aminopyrimidine derivatives 4 and 6 as well as GMP (Compound9), which was confirmed experimentally. Thus, the experimental data are compatible with the formation of a phosphoguanosyl/enzyme intermediate, but they are not sufficient to prove it."
https://openalex.org/W2061170180,"Recent studies highlight the existence of an autonomous nuclear polyphosphoinositide metabolism related to cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, only few data document the nuclear production of the putative second messengers, the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In the present paper, we examine whether GTP-binding proteins can directly modulate 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositide metabolism in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In vitro PI3K assays performed without the addition of any exogenous substrates revealed that guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) specifically stimulated the nuclear synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), whereas guanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate was ineffective. PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 prevented GTPγS-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3synthesis. Moreover, pertussis toxin inhibited partially PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, suggesting that nuclear Gi/G0 proteins are involved in the activation of PI3K. Immunoblot experiments showed the presence of Gα0 proteins in VSMC nuclei. In contrast with previous reports, immunoblots and indirect immunofluorescence failed to detect the p85α subunit of the heterodimeric PI3K within VSMC nuclei. By contrast, we have detected the presence of a 117-kDa protein immunologically related to the PI3Kγ. These results indicate the existence of a G protein-activated PI3K inside VSMC nucleus that might be involved in the contol of VSMC proliferation and in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative disorders.

Recently, we have demonstrated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was essential for the progression of VSMCs throughout the G1phase of the cell cycle (3Bacqueville D. Casagrande F. Perret B. Chap H. Darbon J.M. Breton-Douillon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), implying that a better understanding of the PI3K signaling pathway might be of pathophysiological relevance. PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of the inositol ring in phosphoinositides (PI) to generate the putative second messengers PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (4Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In addition to proliferation, the PI3K products have also been involved in cell transformation, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization (5Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Three distinct classes of PI3Ks have now been identified on the basis of their in vitro substrate specificity, structure, and mode of regulation (7Domin J.

The most studied are class I PI3Ks, whichin vitro phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and display a preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vivo. Class I PI3Ks form a heterodimeric complex and are subdivided according to the adaptor protein associated with the catalytic subunit. Class IA PI3Ks consist of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110 α, β, δ) (9Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J.

In contrast, class IB PI3K or PI3Kγ defines a G protein-coupled receptor-regulated PI3K (11Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It is made of a p110γ catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory subunit unrelated to p85 (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A.

The p110γ can be activated in vitro by both the α and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (11Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T.

This stimulation is considerably enhanced by the p101 adaptor (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

Moreover, there is now considerable evidence that a nuclear PI cycle, apart from that occurring in the plasma membrane, is involved in the regulation of nuclear functions (14D'Santos C.S. Clarke J.H. Divecha N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that nuclei contain almost all the enzymes involved in the classical PI cycle, including kinases required for the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2, phospholipases C, and diacylglycerol kinase (15Payrastre B.

Furthermore, specific changes in the nuclear levels of PI have been implicated in both cell growth and differentiation (17Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F.

To date, information concerning the role and the regulation of nuclear PI3K are still very limited. Immunocytochemical and biochemical analyses demonstrate the presence of the p85α regulatory subunit in the nuclei of rat and human cells (20Lu P.J. Hsu A, L. Wang D, S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S.

Recently, a study based on the immunolocalization of epitope-tagged p110γ in HepG2 cells reported that PI3Kγ translocates to the nucleus after serum stimulation (24Metjian A. Roll R.L. Ma A.D. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27943-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since a nuclear G protein-regulated PI3K activity has not yet been demonstrated, we investigated whether GTP-binding proteins directly modulate 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositide (3-PI) metabolism in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta VSMCs. Our data provide the first evidence for the existence of a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive PI3K inside VSMC nucleus. This enzyme, which might be related to PI3Kγ, phosphorylates an intranuclear pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2, suggesting that nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may regulate protein kinases involved in vascular proliferative disorders. All culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. U73122, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). GTPγS, GDPβS, and RNase-free DNase I were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal anti-p110γ, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-p110γ was kindly provided by S. Roche. Specific polyclonal anti-Gα0antibodies directed against the last 10 amino acids of the common carboxyl-terminal sequence of the Gα01 and G α02 (anti-Gα0(C-ter) or against the amino acid 291–302 of the α subunit of G01(anti-Gα01) were obtained and characterized as previously described (25Rouot B. Charpentier N. Chabert C. Carrette J. Zumbihl R. Bockaert J. Homburger V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse antibodies and polyclonal anti-p85α antibody were, respectively, supplied from New England Biolabs Inc. (Saint Quentin, France) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-nucleoporin p62 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Lactate dehydrogenase and 5′-nucleotidase kits, polyclonal anti-tubulin antibodies, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. COS-7 cells overexpressing human p110γ or p110α were a generous gift of A. Yart and P. Raynal. VSMCs were prepared from 6-week-old pig thoracic aorta using the explant technique (26Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, as previously described (27Breton M. Berrou E. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Deudon E. Picard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For all the experiments, VSMCs were used from the third to the sixth passage. Growing VSMCs were washed twice with ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free PBS and once with a hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Medium was then switched to hypotonic buffer supplemented with 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, benzamidin, and leupeptin for 1 min, and VSMCs were lyzed by the addition of 1% Nonidet-P40 and 1% deoxycholic acid. Cells were allowed to swell for 1 min and were sheared by three passages through a 25-gauge needle. The cell lysate was layered over a 0.3 m/2m sucrose discontinuous gradient and was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min in polypropylene tubes pretreated with a siliconizing agent (Sigmacote) in a further attempt to reduce nuclei adsorption. Then, nuclei were recovered at the interface of 0.3m/2 m sucrose and washed once with the assay buffer containing 1 mg/ml fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 200 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and proteases inhibitors, as above. As to the yield of the nuclear isolation, an average of 0.5 × 106 nuclei were obtained from 1 × 106 cells. 1 × 106 cells and 1 × 106 nuclei contained 300 μg and 30 μg of proteins, respectively. Nuclei were disrupted by sonication (10 kHz for 3 × 1 s) using an ultrasonic cell disrupter (Branson Sonifier 250) and treated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 units/1.5 × 106 nuclei RNase-free DNase I. All assays were conducted in a final volume of 100 μl of assay buffer containing 5 × 106 nuclei, 1 μmthapsigargin (ATPase inhibitor), and 5 μmU73122(phospholipase C inhibitor). For experiments in the presence of PI3K inhibitors and a Gi/G0 inhibitor, nuclei were preincubated with 20 nm wortmannin or 10 μmLY294002 and 5 ng/ml pertussis toxin, respectively, for 15 min on ice. When indicated, 100 μm GTPγS or 100 μmGDPβS was added for another 15 min. The assays were then started by the addition of 1 mm ATP (10 μl) containing 65 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the 32P incorporation was allowed for 15 min at 30 °C under shaking. For exogenous lipid phosphorylation, 30 μl of lipid vesicles containing 100 μm PtdIns and 200 μm phosphatidylserine were added 5 min before starting the assay. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1360 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), 300 μl of 2 n HCl, and 280 μl of 200 mm EDTA. Lipids were immediately extracted after the modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). Lipids were then analyzed either on oxalate-coated thin-layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) developed in isopropanolol:acetic acid:H2O (65:1:34) or by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman International Ltd, U. K.) after deacylation, as previously described (29Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The synthesis of radioactive standard PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was performed from specific anti-p85α immunoprecipitates, essentially as described in Payrastre et al. (30Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Proteins from whole cells or purified nuclei were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 units/105 cells RNase-free DNase I, boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5 and 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblotted as previously described (30Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was achieved using the relevant antibody, anti-p85α (1/1000) for 1 h at room temperature and anti-tubulin (1/1000), anti-nucleoporin p62 (1/1000), monoclonal and polyclonal anti-PI3Kγ (1/100 and 1/1500, respectively), anti-Gα0(C-ter) and anti-Gα01 (1/500) overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/2500) were incubated of 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. VSMCs were plated on glass coverslips, stimulated for 3 days with 10% fetal calf serum, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then permeabilized, and the DNA was denaturated for 30 min in a solution of 2 n HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS. Cells were washed extensively with PBS and were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.5% Tween 20. Coverslips were incubated with the anti-p85α antibody (1/20, overnight at 4 °C) then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1/100, 1 h), mounted in Mowiol, and examined under epifluorescent illumination using a Zeiss microscope coupled to a Micromax camera (Princeton Instruments Inc.). The purified nuclei were immediately fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin sections were then cut (Reichert ultratome), placed on 300 mesh copper grids, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Hitachi 300 transmission electron microscope. Membrane-depleted nuclei from pig aorta VSMCs were isolated by hypotonic shock combined with detergents. The purity of nuclear preparations was evaluated by biochemical and immunochemical analyses. Lactate dehydrogenase and 5′-nucleotidase activities, recognized as markers for cytoplasm and plasma membrane were, respectively, found to be 0.29 ± 0.12% (n = 3) and 0.18 ± 0.08% (n = 3) of the activity in the total homogenate. Furthermore, Western blot analysis using anti-tubulin antibody showed the absence of immunoreactivity to the cytoskeletal proteins in the purified nuclei (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the nuclear fraction was highly enriched with nucleoporin p62, a protein of nuclear pore complex (Fig. 1 B). Finally, electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the isolation procedure yielded nuclei of high purity (Fig. 1 C). No appreciable morphological change of the nuclei was noted during the isolation procedure, the nucleolar structure was maintained, and the lysis procedure completely removed the nuclear envelope to leave the naked laminar layer and nuclear pore remnants (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Previous studies suggest the existence of a nuclear PI3K pathway (20Lu P.J. Hsu A, L. Wang D, S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S.

Therefore, we first investigated whether membrane-free nuclei were able to produce 3-PI from endogenous precursors. We assessed nuclear PI3K activity in vitro by phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into inositol lipids. All assays were conducted in the presence of 2 mm EGTA and 5 μmU73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, so that nuclear PLC activity would not interfere with PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A(upper panel), HPLC analyses revealed a peak of [32P]phosphatidic acid, suggesting a residual PLC activity, but we never detected radiolabeled 3-PI. To look for the possible presence of a G protein-regulated PI3K (11Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T.

Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), we next tested whether 100 μm GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, could trigger the production of 3-PI in isolated nuclei (Fig.2A, middle panel). Under this condition, we detected the synthesis of only one PI3K product, the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and the incorporation into [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was 49073 ± 2000 cpm/107 nuclei (n = 3) (Fig.3 A). This peak coincided with the HPLC profile of pure [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3used as a control (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the [32P]phosphatidic acid peak was always present, and we never observed the production of any other inositol lipids, especially PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,4)P2. No further stimulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was observed with 200 μmGTPγS (data not shown). Moreover, 100 μm GDPβS was unable to activate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis, as presented in Fig. 2 A (lower panel). These results were confirmed by TLC showing the specific activation of only PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis by GTPγS in isolated nuclei (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 3). A weak wortmannin-insensitive production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3was observed in the absence of GTPγS (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2), but in general, the PI3K activity was too small to be detectable. These data strongly suggest that a nuclear GTP-dependent PI3K phosphorylates a pre-existing intranuclear pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We next investigated the effects of two specific PI3K inhibitors on GTPγS-induced nuclear PI3K activation. Both HPLC (Fig. 3 A) and TLC studies (Fig. 3 B) showed that accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was reduced by 60–80% after preincubation of nuclei with 20 nmwortmannin or 10 μm LY294002, demonstrating that the nuclear GTP-dependent PI3K is sensitive to PI3K inhibitors in a classical range of concentrations.Figure 3Effects of PI3K inhibitors on GTPγS-induced nuclear PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 synthesis. Membrane-depleted nuclei were isolated, and nuclear lipid kinase activity was assayed as described in Fig. 2. Nuclei were pretreated for 15 min with 20 nm wortmannin or 10 μm LY294002 before incubation with 100 μm GTPγS. A, lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC. Quantification of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis is expressed as cpm/107 nuclei. Data for GTPγS alone are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Data for PI3K inhibitors represent the mean of two independent experiments. B, lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC. The data shown are representative of two different experiments. The position of standard radioactive 3-PI is shown as the control.

To address this question, vesicles containing PtdIns/phosphatidylserine (100 μm/200 μm, final concentrations) were added to nuclear PI3K assays, and the formation of 32P-labeled lipids derived from PtdIns was analyzed by HPLC (Fig.4). Incubation of nuclei with exogenous PtdIns in the absence of GTPγS resulted in the synthesis of [32P]PtdIns(4)P, as already described (15Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also of [32P]PtdIns(3)P (36,963 ± 4105 cpm/107nuclei, n = 3) but not of any other 3-PI (Fig.4 A, upper panel, and Fig. 4 B). This result suggests that membrane-free VSMC nuclei also contain a GTP-independent PI3K phosphorylating in vitro exogenous PtdIns to PtdIns(3)P but unable to phosphorylate the intranuclear pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2. In the presence of GTPγS, [32P]PtdIns(3)P synthesis was increased by 40% (57114 ± 572 cpm/107 nuclei, n = 3,p < 0.01), and under that condition, we also measured PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). These results indicate that the nuclear GTP-dependent PI3K can phosphorylate both endogenous nuclear PtdIns(4,5)P2 and exogenous PtdIns. We next performed immunoblot experiments to identify the two PI3K isoforms expressed in isolated nuclei (Figs.5 and 6). The existence of a nuclear PI3K that phosphorylates both PtdIns and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a GTP-dependent manner suggests that it could be a class IB PI3K. Indeed, we detected the presence of the catalytic subunit of the G protein-regulated PI3K by using two different anti-PI3Kγ antibodies (Fig. 5). The analysis with a monoclonal antibody against the amino-terminal region of human p110γ revealed a 117-kDa protein in both the total cell homogenate (Fig. 5 A, lane 1) and the nuclear fraction (Fig.5 A, lane 2), assayed here in similar amounts in terms of nuclei number. A positive control with human p110γ overexpressed in COS-7 cells also showed a single band at 117 kDa (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Moreover, the p110γ detection was specific, as the monoclonal antibody did not cross-react with human p110α overexpressed in COS-7 and as no signal was detected in VSMC nuclei when the primary antibody was omitted (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 5). The polyclonal anti-p110γ antibody also confirmed the presence of a 117-kDa protein in VSMC nuclei (Fig. 5 B). Unfortunately, as previously noted in HepG2 cells (24Metjian A. Roll R.L. Ma A.D. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27943-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), all available antibodies were unable to detect endogenous PI3Kγ by immunofluorescence in VSMCs.Figure 6Expression of p85α in VSMCs.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5738-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we checked whether class IA PI3Ks would also be present in VSMC nuclei (Fig. 6). We used an anti-p85α antibody to detect this adaptor protein and loaded the same amount of proteins (15 μg) from cell homogenate or from purified nuclei (Fig.6 A). In contrast to previous reports, p85α was undetectable in VSMC nuclei when compared with total cell homogenates, although 10 times as much nuclei were assayed. The absence of nuclear p85α expression was further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the p85α labeling was evident as a ring at the perinuclear region and as fluorescent dots in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, whereas the nuclear interior remained unstained. These results strongly suggest that the heterodimeric PI3K p85α/p110 is absent from our nuclear preparations but could be present in the nuclear envelope, whereas a 117-kDa PI3K γ-like kinase is, significantly, located inside VSMC nuclei. We next sought to determine whether nuclear heterotrimeric Gi/G0 proteins could be responsible for the nuclear PI3K activation by using PTX. Pretreatm"

The secreted form of meprin A is a homo-oligomer composed of α subunits, a multidomain protease of 582 amino acids coded for near the major histocompatibility complex of the mouse and human genome.

Meprins are multidomain, oligomeric glycoproteins with subunit masses of 85,000–110,000 Da (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The subunits, α and β, may associate to form either homo- or hetero-oligomeric proteins (6Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Multimers containing α subunits (both homo- and hetero-oligomers) are designated meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18), whereas homo-oligomers of β are designated meprin B (EC 3.4.24.63). The mouse α and β subunits are ∼42% identical at the amino acid level, and their cDNA-deduced primary sequences predict a similar arrangement of functional domains (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 5Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1222-1229Google Scholar). Meprin α cDNA (Structure FTI) encodes a 760-amino acid protein with an NH2-terminal signal sequence followed by a prosequence, the protease domain (containing the zinc active site), a MAM1domain, a MATH (meprin and TRAF homology; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) domain, followed by an AM (after MATH) domain, an EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domain, a putative COOH-terminal transmembrane domain (TM), and a cytoplasmic (C) tail. The α subunit contains a 56-amino acid domain (I) inserted between the AM and EGF-like domains that is not present in the β subunit. The I domain has been shown to direct COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of the α subunit during biosynthesis (7Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mature α subunit lacks the domains COOH-terminal to the AM domain, including the transmembrane domain. As a result, meprin α homo-oligomers are secreted, and meprin α is only found membrane-bound via interactions with the β subunit (which does not undergo COOH-terminal proteolysis and is a type I integral membrane protein). Studies of membrane-bound meprins indicated that the subunits are linked via disulfide bonds to form dimers (6Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These dimers can further associate via noncovalent interactions to form tetramers (8Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Meprins are unique among proteases in their oligomeric structure. Because hetero-oligomer formation requires interactions between the α subunits and membrane-bound β subunits, it was unclear whether the secreted homo-oligomer, which contains only α subunits, could form multimers of the same oligomeric state or even larger complexes. Native gel electrophoresis of unpurified secreted meprin A followed by Western blot detection of the enzyme demonstrated that it migrated with a mobility larger than 700 kDa (9Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-320, the cysteine residue in the MAM domain involved in an intersubunit disulfide bond, to an alanine (C320A) resulted in expression of a monomeric form of meprin. The mutant had little or no ability to hydrolyze proteins, although it retained activity against peptide substrates and showed decreased thermostability and an increased susceptibility to tryptic degradation (9Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This work indicated that the oligomeric state is critical for activity and stability of the enzyme but could not determine whether the properties exhibited by the monomeric mutant were due to lack of formation of the disulfide-linked dimer or the inability of the subunits to associate noncovalently. Moreover, the oligomeric state of meprin could not be accurately determined by native gel electrophoresis of the unpurified protein because the band observed could have been due to meprin subunits in association with other proteins. Thus, the oligomeric structure of the purified meprin protein was investigated, and the importance of this structure to function was examined. Recombinant mouse meprin A was purified from the media of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) stably transfected with full-length mouse meprin α cDNA (10Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25577-25584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purification involved mono-Q and superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column chromatography; the protein was activated by trypsin after mono-Q chromatography (5Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1222-1229Google Scholar, 10Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J.

An 8 μm meprin solution was labeled with 10 molar equivalents ofN-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidylpropionamide (Molecular Probes) for 12 h at 4 °C in the dark. Excess label was removed by passing the mixture through a Sephadex G-25 column. Cross-linking was initiated by subjecting the protein to ultraviolet light for 7 min, as described elsewhere (11Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and quenched with 5 μl of gel loading buffer. Fifty μl of an 800 μm N-biotinyl-N′-[6-maleimidiohexanoyl]-hydrazide (biotin-maleimide) solution dissolved in dimethylformamide was added to 500 μl of an 8 μm meprin solution. The protein was incubated for 10 h at 4 °C, and excess label was removed with a Sephadex G-25 column. The labeled protein was subsequently deglycosylated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England BioLabs), and proteins were separated from carbohydrates by gel filtration. Deglycosylated, labeled protein was incubated with 50 μg of trypsin at pH 8.5, 37 °C for 14 h. The resulting peptides were separated by a reverse phase C-18 HPLC column (11Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and fractions were analyzed by reflector mode MALDI mass spectrometry using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Samples from different preparations of meprin were diluted with deionized water to ∼25 μg/ml and then negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate using a double carbon method (12Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were obtained with a LEO 912AB microscope operated at 100 kV at an absolute magnification of 31,500. The spectrometer slit of the energy filter was used to remove inelastically scattered electrons. For preparation of figures, negatives were digitized at an optical resolution corresponding to 6.4 Å/pixel on an Agfa Duoscan flatbed scanner, and then composites were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Statistics of particle measurements were compiled from enlarged prints on a digitizing tablet with SigmaScan (Jandel). Eight μm meprin was reduced with 5 mm TCEP (Molecular Probes), pH 8.0, for 30 min at 4 °C. Excess reducing agent was removed by a Sephadex G-25 column, and the enzyme was subjected to native gel electrophoretic analysis to determine the dissociation of the oligomer and nonreducing SDS-PAGE to assess the amount of disulfide bond reformation. Proteolytic activity was determined with an internally quenched fluorescent bradykinin substrate analog, BK+ (2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH, where Dnp is dinitrophenyl), and the protein substrate azocasein as described previously (5Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1222-1229Google Scholar). An 8 μm solution of native or reduced meprin was incubated at 47 °C for 5–35 min at 5-min intervals. The protein was cooled to 25 °C, and the activity toward BK+ was determined. Susceptibility to trypsin digestion was assessed by mixing 2 μl of an 800 nm solution of either the native protein or the reduced protein with trypsin at final concentrations of 20–100 ng/ml. After 15 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of a 3-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to determine the extent of proteolysis. When purified recombinant mouse meprin A homo-oligomer was subjected to nondenaturing, nonreducing gel electrophoresis, the native protein migrated as a species larger than the 669,000 molecular weight marker (Fig.1 A). The monomeric molecular weight of a meprin α subunit is ∼90,000, indicating that the multimeric protein is capable of forming at least octamers. Cross-linking the protein with disuccinimidyl followed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol resulted in dimers and higher order oligomers (Fig. 1 B). The largest cross-linked species observed migrated above the 669,000 molecular weight marker, confirming that meprin can form an octamer or even higher order complexes. When the protein was subjected to analytical size exclusion chromatography to obtain more precise molecular weight information, the elution volume of meprin corresponded to a molecular weight of 905,000, indicating that the protein is primarily decameric (Fig. 1 C). The width of the meprin peak was comparable to that of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), the protein standard closest in mass. However, the meprin peak was more asymmetric than any of the monodisperse standard proteins. As shown in the elution profile (Fig. 1 C), there appears to be some trailing on the right side of the peak, indicating the presence of smaller oligomeric forms. The large size of the complex distinguishes the meprin A homoligomer as the largest known secreted protease. The ability of the secreted protein to form decameric complexes, compared with the tetrameric structure of hetero-oligomeric meprins (8Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may result from the lack of the potential conformational barriers imposed by being membrane-bound. The electrophoretic mobility of the protein under both reducing and denaturing conditions corresponds to the monomeric molecular weight (Fig.2 A). Under denaturing (in the presence of SDS) but nonreducing conditions (no 2-mercaptoethanol), the protein migrates as a dimer (Fig. 2 B). When the enzyme was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and then subjected to native gel electrophoresis (no SDS), the protein migrated as a dimer of noncovalently linked subunits (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the oligomer is composed of disulfide-linked dimers that associate noncovalently to form the native structure. The interaction between the covalently linked dimers does not appear to be strong because only dimers, not higher order oligomers, are observed after reduction of the S-S bond. The secreted form of meprin A contains 11 cysteine residues per subunit (StructureFTII). Previous work indicated that Cys-320 in the MAM domain is responsible for the covalent interaction of subunits (9Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-320 to alanine (C320A) resulted in a meprin α monomer that exhibited altered proteolytic activity and stability (9Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This mutant was incapable of forming not only disulfide-linked dimers but noncovalently linked oligomers as well. To determine whether the changes seen in the mutant were due to the loss of the disulfide-linked dimer or instead to loss of interactions between the noncovalently linked subunits, we reduced wild type meprin with the phosphine TCEP and measured the activity and stability of the protein. TCEP was selected as a reducing agent because it does not contain a thiol group. Thiol-containing reagents such as 2-mecaptoethanol or dithiothreitol have been shown to inhibit meprin by either chelation of the active site zinc ion or reduction of conserved intrasubunit disulfide bonds in the protease, MAM, or AM domains (13Beynon R.J. Shannon J.D. Bond J.S. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Reduction with TCEP resulted in dissociation of the oligomer into noncovalently linked dimers, as was the case with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2 C); the disulfide bond did not reform when TCEP was removed, even after a period of days (data not shown). To determine the number of free thiols that are solvent-exposed, meprin protein (2.5 μm) was incubated with 2 mm5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 5,5′-Dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with free thiols, releasing thionitrobenzoic acid, which can be quantified (14Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21202) Google Scholar). The 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay indicated that there was one free thiol per subunit before reduction and three additional thiols per subunit after reduction with TCEP; most likely one intrasubunit disulfide bond was reduced in addition to the intersubunit disulfide bridge. When meprin was reduced with TCEP, subjected to Sephadex G-25 column chromatography to remove the reducing agent, and assayed for enzymatic activities, little or no activity loss was detected. The rate of hydrolysis of BK+ by the reduced enzyme was 95% that of the nonreduced form (5.95 × 103 versus 5.66 × 103 fluorescence units/s for the native and reduced form, respectively). This demonstrated that the reduction and formation of noncovalently linked dimers had not significantly altered the protease domain of the enzyme, which contains two intradomain disulfide bridges, and that the disulfide-linked dimer is not required for activity toward peptides. Similarly, the activity of the reduced enzyme toward the protein substrate azocasein was 90% that of the nonreduced protein, indicating that only the noncovalently associated dimer was necessary for hydrolysis of proteins. The stability of the TCEP-reduced form of meprin was similar to that of the native enzyme, as assessed by heat inactivation and vulnerability to trypsin digestion. The thermostability was evaluated by incubating the proteins at 46 °C, removing samples at time intervals, and subsequently determining the ability of the protease to hydrolyze BK+. Unlike the monomeric C320A mutant (9Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the noncovalent dimeric reduced form of meprin exhibited the same rate of heat inactivation as the native enzyme. Furthermore, both the wild type and TCEP-reduced forms of the enzyme were equally resistant to proteolytic digestion by trypsin. These results indicate that the changes exhibited by the C320A mutant were not due to the inability of the protein to form the disulfide-linked dimer but rather to an inability to form the noncovalent associations; thus, the noncovalently associated dimer is the functional protomer of the oligomer. Only 1 of the 11 cysteine residues present in the secreted form of the meprin subunit is a free thiol that is exposed to solvent as determined by 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (data not shown). This cysteine residue was specifically labeled with the thiol-reactive photocross-linkerN-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidylpropionamide, and the protein was subjected to ultraviolet light to initiate cross-linking (Fig. 3 A). In the absence of cross-linker and 2-mercaptoethanol, the protein migrated as a single band corresponding to dimer (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). In the absence of cross-linker but in the presence of reducing agent, the mobility of the protein was consistent with monomer only, indicating that the intersubunit disulfide bond was completely reduced (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). In the presence of cross-linker and the absence of the reducing agent, a band corresponding to a cross-linked tetramer was observed (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). When both cross-linker and reducing agent were present, a cross-linked protein corresponding to the meprin dimer was observed (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). This indicates that the cross-link must have occurred between the noncovalently linked subunits because cross-linking between the disulfide-linked dimers would result in only dimers after SDS-PAGE, regardless of whether reducing agent was present or not. To determine the location of the cysteine residue that was labeled withN-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidylpropionamide and thus one of the sites of interaction between the noncovalently linked subunits, meprin was labeled with the thiol-reactive probe biotin-maleimide. The site of the modified cysteine residue was determined by subjecting the biotin-labeled protein to tryptic digestion followed by MALDI mass spectrometry to identify the labeled peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A monoisotopic mass of 1655.826 Da ([M+H]+) was observed by reflector mode MALDI mass spectrometry, which is consistent with the monoisotopic mass of the protonated fragment containing amino acids 353–361 modified with the biotin probe (expected mass of 1655.870 Da) (Fig. 3 B). The labeled cysteine residue, Cys-355, resides in the MAM domain, which has been described as an adhesion domain that mediates protein-protein interaction. For instance, the MAM domains of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ are required for specific homophilic cell-cell interactions in transfected nonadherent insect cells (15Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The studies herein demonstrate that the MAM domain plays an important role in maintaining both covalent and noncovalent interactions in the meprin multimer. Removal of the MAM domain by truncation or deletion mutagenesis results in misfolding of the protein and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, demonstrating the importance of this domain in folding and assembly of the native protein (16Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To further characterize the high molecular weight oligomers, meprin was imaged by electron microscopy. In negatively stained samples, two distinct populations of oligomers were seen (Fig.4). As shown in a typical field (Fig.4 A), these are linear, open structures that have the flexibility to bend into a variety of crescent shapes and closed circular particles. The open chains, which comprise the majority of multimers, consistently measure 8–10 nm in width. The length of the chains varies considerably. Whereas most measure between 30 and 60 nm, some are as small as 20 nm or as large as 90 nm. Two distinct views of the chains are visible. One is most common in crescent shapes and is characterized by a smooth outer face and a notched or toothed inner face (Fig.4 B, row 1). The second orientation of the chains is typical of the straighter and shorter oligomers (Fig. 4 B, row 2). In this view, both sides have regularly spaced notches, and there are also distinct stain-filled holes along the midline. The second population of meprin multimer structures is composed of rings. The majority of these structures measure ∼80 nm in circumference (Fig. 4 D; Fig. 4 B, row 3). This indicates that they are formed from the longer chains, that is, when sufficient length is reached to allow interaction of the ends and closure of the crescents. The average measurement of the inner diameter of these rings is 13 nm. Occasionally, much larger circles are seen (Fig. 4 B, row 4). These measure 100–120 nm in circumference and appear to be formed by end-to-end interactions of two chains. Assembly of the complex may involve attaching subunits together to form a rigid structure, such that upon the addition of subunits, the curvature of the oligomer increases until enough subunits are added to close the ring. Formation of a ring from a chain containing lower numbers of subunits may be thermodynamically unfavorable due to the rigidity of the structure. Although ring closure would provide more protein-protein contact, the strain on the structure would make it less stable than the open form, requiring the association of a critical number of subunits for ring formation. Chains containing fewer subunits than this number would be unlikely to form a ring and would remain open, whereas those containing more subunits would favor ring formation. A model of the multimer is proposed in which the protein is built from disulfide-linked dimers associated noncovalently to form either crescent-shaped structures or closed rings (Fig.5). The subunit interactions are mediated by the MAM domain, which is involved in both the covalent linkage and noncovalent linkage of the subunits. Reduction of the rings with TCEP results in dissociation into the active protomer, the noncovalently linked dimer. Similarly, reduction of the open, crescent-shaped multimer yields only noncovalently linked dimers. As shown schematically in Fig. 5, reduction would yield monomers at the ends of the chain, which, in the absence of the restriction imposed by the quaternary structure, are free to associate noncovalently. Meprin may function to degrade large complexes of proteins in vivo, which could require multiple copies of the active protomer in close proximity. The presence of multiple subunits may serve to increase the efficiency of proteolysis. Linkage of these units together in a specified geometry could serve to effectively digest proteins, in a manner reminiscent of the proteasome (18Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Meprin also shares similarities to other proteases such as tripeptidyl peptidase II and aminopeptidase I. These enzymes are large multimeric complexes composed of homo-oligomers that function to digest polypeptides and play roles in protein turnover within the cell (19Tomkinson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 355-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Metz G. Marx R. Rohm K. Z. Naturforsch. 1977; 32c: 929-937Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Geier E.

Yeast aminopeptidase I is a dodecamer with a molecular mass of ∼640 kDa (20Metz G. Marx R. Rohm K. Z. Naturforsch. 1977; 32c: 929-937Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tripeptidyl peptidase II forms even larger complexes, between 5000 and 9000 kDa (21Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It is composed of subunits of 138 kDa that associate to form a rod-shaped structure about 50 nm in length and 17 nm in diameter (21Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, unlike these proteases, the meprin A homo-oligomer is secreted from the cell and degrades extracellular proteins and peptides. We thank Dr. A. Daniel Jones for assistance with the MALDI mass spectrometry analysis."

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry to identify serine 440 in recombinant human 69-kDa choline acetyltransferase as a protein kinase C phosphorylation site, and site-directed mutagenesis to determine that phosphorylation of this residue is involved in regulation of the enzyme's catalytic activity and binding to subcellular membranes. Incubation of HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type 69-kDa choline acetyltransferase with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate showed time- and dose-related increases in specific activity of the enzyme; in control and phorbol ester-treated cells, the enzyme was distributed predominantly in cytoplasm (about 88%) with the remainder (about 12%) bound to cellular membranes. Mutation of serine 440 to alanine resulted in localization of the enzyme entirely in cytoplasm, and this was unchanged by phorbol ester treatment. Furthermore, activation of mutant enzyme in phorbol ester-treated HEK293 cells was about 50% that observed for wild-type enzyme. Incubation of immunoaffinity purified wild-type and mutant choline acetyltransferase with protein kinase C under phosphorylating conditions led to incorporation of [32P]phosphate, with radiolabeling of mutant enzyme being about one-half that of wild-type, indicating that another residue is phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Acetylcholine synthesis in HEK293 cells expressing wild-type choline acetyltransferase, but not mutant enzyme, was increased by about 17% by phorbol ester treatment.

These neurons control a wide range of physiological and biochemical processes in most organ systems, including regulation of cardiovascular and motor functions, and cognitive functions such as learning, attention, and memory. Diminished ChAT activity signals degeneration of cholinergic neurons in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. For example, a consistent finding in necropsy brain of subjects with Alzheimer disease is profound loss of ChAT that correlates with diminished cognitive function early in the course of the disease. Decreased ChAT activity can be accounted for, at least in part, by loss of cholinergic neurons, but may also be related to decreased expression of cholinergic phenotypic genes and/or altered regulation of the enzymes catalytic activity leading to decreased function. There is polymorphism in expression of mRNA for ChAT and, in human only, one of these transcripts, denoted the M isoform, has two translation initiation sites yielding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 69 and 82 kDa; all other transcript isoforms encode the 69-kDa form of enzyme only (1Oda Y. Nakanishi I. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that the 82-kDa form of the enzyme is targeted to nucleus of cells, whereas 69-kDa ChAT is localized to non-nuclear cellular compartments such as cytoplasm and plasma membrane (3Resendes M.C. Dobransky T. Ferguson S.S.G. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas cytosolic/membrane-associated ChAT is clearly involved in catalyzing ACh biosynthesis, the functional role of the nuclear form of the enzyme remains to be elucidated. A critical issue in production of the neurotransmitter ACh is subcellular distribution and regulation of catalytic activity of its biosynthetic enzyme ChAT. Factors controlling ChAT enzyme activity, and the role that post-translational modifications play in this in healthy neurons and during pathological processes such as Alzheimer disease is poorly understood. It has been demonstrated previously that ChAT undergoes phosphorylation both in vitro and in nerve terminals by calcium-dependent protein kinases (4Bruce G. Hersh L.B. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt B.M. Rylett R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1774-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Habert E. Birman S. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Results obtained recently in our laboratory showed that ChAT serves as a substrate for a number of protein kinases, but that it's enzymatic activity is regulated by phosphorylation by only some of the kinases. The highest activities induced by phosphorylation were observed following phosphorylation of ChAT by protein kinase C (PKC) (7Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In terms of subcellular compartmentalization, it appears that phosphorylation may regulate association of ChAT with plasma membrane or membranes of subcellular organelles (4Bruce G. Hersh L.B. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and partitioning of enzyme between cytosol and membrane fractions. The current studies are aimed at identification of phosphorylation sites of 69-kDa human ChAT by PKC, and characterization of their functional role in regulation of enzymatic activity and/or subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme within the cell. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis and MALDI-TOF (time-of-flight) in linear and reflectron mode, we identified serine 440 as a PKC phosphorylation site, and determined that phosphorylation of this amino acid plays a role in membrane-association of the enzyme and participates in regulation of it's catalytic activity. The cDNA for human 69-kDa ChAT (N1-ChAT) in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. H. Misawa (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo). The mutant S440A-ChAT was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser440 → Ala in wild-type 69-kDa human ChAT by polymerase chain reaction using the forward primer 5′-GAGAGCGCGGCCATCCGCCGA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCGGCGGATGGCCGCGCTCTC-3′ coupled with forward primer 5′-AAAAGGTACCGCCACCATGGCAGCAAAAACTCCCAGCAGTGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTTTGGATCCAGTCAAGGTTGGTGTCCC-3′ to give the full-length mutant cDNA with KpnI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Following restriction endonuclease digestion of the ends, the fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1. Integrity of the mutation and the full-length cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Monolayers of HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing inserts encoding wild-type and mutant 69-kDa human ChAT using the LipofectAMINE 2000 method (Life Technologies, Inc.). G418-resistant stable transformants were selected and tested for ChAT enzyme activity by radioenzymatic assay and ChAT protein by immunoblot. Cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml G418 in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Two different immunoaffinity columns were used for preparation of purified native ChAT in an one-step purification protocol. The antibody used was a rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared to a peptide encoding the last 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of human ChAT (called CTab) (7Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The first column was prepared by attachment of Fab (antigen-binding fragments) of CTab to CNBr-Sepharose. Fab fragments were prepared by proteolytic cleavage of whole affinity-purified CTab antibody with immobilized papain (>5000 units/g of Sepharose CL-6B) using PBS, pH 7.0, supplemented with 50 mm cysteine-HCl and 5 mm Na4EDTA. Proteolytic treatment was performed with 1000 units papain per mg of antibody for 5 h at 37 °C with shaking, then 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to the suspension, mixed, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was subsequently applied to a Protein G-Sepharose column to separate the Fc fragments and undigested IgG. Fab fragments, present in the column flow-through from the Protein G-Sepharose column, were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against three changes of 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column. The flow-through from the DEAE-Sepharose column contained the purified fraction of Fab fragments to be used for preparation of the immunoaffinity column with CNBr-Sepharose; this was accomplished using the standard protocol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech allowing the binding of ∼7 mg of Fab fragments/ml of gel. The capacity of this column was at least 3 mg of purified ChAT protein/ml of gel. The second approach was based on immobilization of whole purified CTab antibody on Protein G-Sepharose. Antibody to be coupled (15 mg/ml gel) was dissolved in 5 ml of antibody binding buffer (50 mmsodium borate, pH 8.2) and added to 5 ml of Protein G-Sepharose. After 30 min of gentle rocking, the gel was washed with 5 gel volumes of antibody-binding buffer and one volume of cross-linking buffer (0.2m triethanolamine, pH 8.2). Immediately after this wash, 33 mg of dimethyl pimelimidate dissolved in 5 ml of cross-linking buffer was added, and the antibody was covalently attached to the Protein G-Sepharose (by 1 h gently rocking at room temperature) with antigen binding sites facing outward to interact with antigen. The purification capacity of this immunoaffinity column is at least 5 mg of purified ChAT protein/ml resin. The same protocol was used for purification of recombinant ChAT with both types of immunoaffinity columns. For purification of ChAT used for MALDI-MS determination of phosphorylation sites, crude cellular extracts were prepared from baculovirus-infected, ChAT-expressing High-5 cells for enzyme purification as described previously (7Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For purified ChAT used for in vitrophosphorylation/stoichiometry studies, total cellular extracts of HEK293 cells stably expressing ChAT were prepared by sonication (3 × 15 s) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm AEBSF, leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants from both High-5 and HEK293 cell lysates were diluted 1:1 with loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF), then loaded onto an immunoaffinity column at 0.25 ml/min. Columns were then washed with 10 column volumes of loading buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, followed by 5 column volumes of loading buffer. Purified ChAT protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with a small volume of 2 mTris-HCl, pH 8.8, to a final pH of about 8.0. Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant ChAT with PKC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed at 30 °C. The kinase reaction buffer (30 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm glycerol 3-phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycerol, 100 mg/ml phosphatidylserine) was added to the purified enzyme preparation (1–3 mg/ml) and incubated for varying times, then the phosphorylation reaction was stopped by addition of electrophoresis sample buffer. For the stoichiometry experiments, the concentration of purified ChAT was estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. One microgram (14.5 pmol) of purified ChAT was phosphorylated by PKC (0.4 milliunit) for varying times in the presence of 0.6 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi), as described above. Samples were run on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, then proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane; only residual radioactivity was retained in the gels after transfer as monitored by Cerenkov counting. Nitrocellulose membranes were apposed to film, and following brief (5 min) autoradiography, membranes were processed for immunoblotting. Subsequently, areas corresponding to radioactive bands on autoradiography were cut from the membranes, and incorporated [32P]phosphate was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Cells were treated at ∼50% confluence. 2 h before treatment, fresh medium was added to the cells, then the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was diluted from a 1 mm stock in Me2SO in the same medium and added to cells for varying times and at varying concentrations. Following treatment, cell lysates were prepared for measurement of total ChAT activity by sonication (3 × 15 s) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmAEBSF, leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 250 μm eserine sulfate). For ChAT subcellular localization and activation studies, cells were treated for 2 h with 1 μm PMA. Wild-type and mutant 69-kDa ChAT-expressing HEK293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS then scraped into PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. Cells were gently resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet containing crude nuclei was washed once with lysis buffer and three times in wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate). The original post-nuclear supernatant was combined with the washes then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h with the supernatant yielding the cytosolic fraction and the pellet containing the membranes. Membrane pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer then solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 by sonication (3 × 15 s). Purified nuclei were not used in the present study, because this subcellular fraction contains little 69-kDa ChAT (3Resendes M.C. Dobransky T. Ferguson S.S.G. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ChAT activity was measured radioenzymatically by a modified method of Fonnum (8Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), as published previously (9Rylett R.J. Goddard S. Lambros A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lysates of ChAT-expressing HEK293 cells were diluted for measurement of ChAT activity (cytosolic fraction 1:100 and membrane fractions 1:10) with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmAEBSF, leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 250 μm eserine sulfate, and 1 mm DTT. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on 7.5 or 10% gels according to the method of Laemmli (10Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. For staining, gels were incubated in 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol for 20 min; in the case of samples to be prepared for mass spectrometry, gels were washed in acetic acid/methanol for an additional 3 h to ensure adequate removal of SDS. For immunoblotting, proteins from SDS-PAGE gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in a semidry electroblotting apparatus using transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine) containing 20% methanol. Nitrocellulose membranes were stained after protein transfer with 0.02% solution of Ponceau-S in 1% acetic acid solution to visualize transferred proteins and standards. Subsequently, membranes were saturated with 8% non-fat milk powder in PBS, then probed with the anti-ChAT CTab antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and bound primary antibody was reacted with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoaffinity-purified ChAT (10 μg) was phosphorylated by PKC as described above, then phosphorylated isoforms were separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE using the method of Garrels (11Garrels J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 245: 7961-7977Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with isoelectric focusing gels containing 2% Ampholines, pH 3.5–10, and the second dimension run on 7.5% separating gel (thickness 1 mm). Protein spots corresponding to32P-phosphorylated isoforms identified by autoradiography were cut from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, rinsed, incubated with sequencing grade-modified (TPCK) trypsin (Promega), and reduced, andS-alkylated by carboxyamidomethylation (12Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7818) Google Scholar). The resulting tryptic peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC, and fractions containing [32P]phosphopeptides were identified by Cerenkov counting of all fractions. Masses of peptides present in these fractions were obtained by MALDI-MS (TofSpec SE, Micromass, Inc., Beverly, MA), then compared with theoretical tryptic peptide masses for ChAT using the program GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Denmark). The in-gel protein trypsinization, HPLC, and MALDI-MS analyses were performed at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Facility/W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Additional MALDI-TOF analysis was performed at the Molecular Medicine Research Centre Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Toronto. In this case, protein samples in SDS-polyacrylamide gel were processed by in-gel trypsin digestion, and recovery and purification of peptide fragments were carried out on C18-ZipTips (Whatman) eluted in 65% (v/v) acetonitrile:1% acetic acid (v/v):water in our laboratory. Peptide masses were determined by MALDI-TOF in reflectron and linear mode. Wild-type HEK293 cells and cells stably expressing wild-type and mutant ChAT, plated in 12-well plates, were preincubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm PMA for 2 h at 37 °C prior to determination of ACh synthesis capacity. Cells were then washed with Krebs-Ringer (KR) solution, and incubated with [3H]choline (0.5 μm; 1 μCi/well) in KR solution for 15 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed with KR, then extracted in 2% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. Cell extracts were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to recover cellular protein for measurement. Supernatants were shaken with 4 volumes of diethyl ether twice to remove trichloroacetic acid then extracted with 10 mg/ml sodium tetraphenylboron in 3-heptanone to recover choline and choline esters in the organic phase and separate them from phosphorylcholine and other choline metabolites remaining in the aqueous phase. Choline esters where back-extracted into 0.4n HCl, then reduced to dryness. Dried samples were solubilized in choline kinase reaction buffer (choline kinase 0.02 unit, DTT, ATP, MgCl2 in glycylglycine buffer pH 8.0), then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow separation of [3H]ACh from unmetabolized [3H]choline. In a previous study, we demonstrated that 69-kDa human ChAT is a substrate for a number of protein kinases, including PKC, with phosphorylation of purified recombinant ChAT in vitro by PKC leading to a 2-fold increase in catalytic activity of the enzyme (7Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended this observation to determine which isoforms of PKC phosphorylate ChAT. Using incorporation of [32P]phosphate and autoradiography to monitor covalent modification by PKC isoforms, we observed that 69-kDa human ChAT was phosphorylated by PKC α, β-I, γ, δ, ε, and ξ but not by PKC β-II (data not shown). To test the effect of activation of PKC on ChAT activity in situ, monolayers of HEK293 cells stably expressing 69-kDa human ChAT were treated with the phorbol ester PMA. As shown in Fig.1, this resulted in a time- and dose-dependent activation of the recombinant enzyme. ChAT activity was significantly increased by 10 min with the effect becoming maximal at 157 ± 10% of control and reaching a plateau by 2 h (Fig. 1 A). In terms of effective concentration, an EC50 value of about 0.3 μm was determined from the sigmoidal dose-response curve shown in Fig. 1 B, with maximal increase in ChAT activity obtained at about 1 μm (158% ± 8%). The effect of PMA appeared to be biphasic with concentrations of PMA above 2 μm resulting in smaller increases in ChAT activity (data not shown). Immunoaffinity columns prepared by covalent binding of Fab fragment of the anti-ChAT antibody CTab to CNBr-Sepharose or whole purified antibody to Protein G-Sepharose allowed isolation of highly purified enzyme in a single purification step. This preparation of purified native protein is comprised of the same enzyme isoforms as produced in cells, as demonstrated by immunoblots of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). The purity of ChAT obtained from the one-step immunoaffinity purification protocol using High-5 cell lysate is greater than 95% as demonstrated on Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig.2), with a yield of at least 90% of total ChAT activity when compared with total activity in the crude extract. The 69-kDa form of human ChAT contains 10 putative canonical consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKC, including SYK (position 126–128), SYR (161), TNR (255), THR (283), SSR (346), SRK (347), SIR (440), SEK (476), SNR (532), and SSK (586). The strategy adopted for identification of functional PKC phosphorylation site(s) by mass spectrometry is outlined in Fig.3. Purified recombinant ChAT was incubated under phosphorylating conditions with PKC and [γ-32P]ATP then separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE to allow identification of phosphorylated isoforms by autoradiography. Following tryptic digestion of the 32P-labeled ChAT isoforms, the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC, and two fractions were identified to contain 32P-labeled phosphopeptide. These were recovered and analyzed by MALDI-MS. One fraction contained a peptide with mass of 1390.43 (±0.2%), whereas the other contained a peptide with mass of 1237.30 (±0.2%). Comparison with the theoretical tryptic peptide masses for ChAT revealed two peptides with the calculated mass of 1391.764 having sequences LVPTYESASIRR (residues 432–443) and RLVPTYESASIR (residues 431–442). Another peptide with a calculated mass of 1235.663 had the sequence LVPTYESASIR (residues 432–442). These three peptides all contained the PKC consensus sequence SIR (residues 440–442) therefore identifying the candidate phosphorylation site serine 440. Further analysis using MALDI-TOF in linear and reflectron mode revealed an 80-Da shift in the mass of this peptide from predicted mass of 1391.764 to a measured mass of 1472.03, indicative of the presence of a phosphate group. Based on this confirmation of serine 440 as a putative phosphorylation site, we pursued functional analysis through mutagenesis of this residue. To investigate the biological role of phosphorylation of 69-kDa human ChAT at serine 440, we prepared a site-directed mutant in which serine 440 was changed to alanine (called S440A-ChAT). To characterize this mutant, we monitored the time course of phosphorylation of purified wild-type and S440A-ChAT by PKC. As illustrated in autoradiographs in Fig. 4 B, [32P]phosphate was rapidly incorporated into both forms of the enzyme with maximal phosphorylation occurring by 30 min. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that at steady state wild-type ChAT contained about 2.8 mol of phosphate per mol of enzyme protein, whereas S440A-ChAT contained about one-half this amount (Fig. 4 A). These results predict a phosphorylation of two or more sites of 69-kDa human ChAT by PKC, with Ser440 serving as one of these phosphorylation sites. Subcellular compartmentalization of wild-type and S440A-ChAT and the effect of activation of PKC in situ by PMA on this measure was determined in HEK293 cells stably expressing the two forms of the enzyme. Interestingly, subfractionation of cells into cytosolic and membrane components revealed striking differences in distribution of wild-type and S440A-mutant ChAT. The wild-type enzyme was present in both fractions, with 88% of total enzyme activity found in cytoplasm and the remaining 12% being membrane-associated; following washing with 350 mm NaCl, only residual enzyme activity (∼0.5%) was recovered in the membrane fraction, suggesting that ChAT protein was ionically associated with the membranes. In contrast, all activity of the S440A-ChAT was recovered in the cytosolic fraction, with no measurable enzyme activity found in the membrane fraction. As shown in Fig. 5 A, treatment of cells with 1 μm PMA for 2 h resulted in activation of wild-type ChAT in both membrane (165% of control) and cytosolic (148% of control) compartments. PMA treatment also led to activation of the S440A-ChAT in cytosol (125% of control) but did not result in appearance of detectable ChAT activity in the membrane fraction from these cells (Fig. 5 A). Immunoblots for ChAT were performed on cytosolic and membrane samples from control and PMA-treated cells to determine whether the increase in ChAT activity was related to a change in the amount of enzyme protein in any of the fractions, or translocation of enzyme between cytoplasm and membrane. As indicated in Fig. 5 B, treatment of HEK293 cells expressing either wild-type or S440A-ChAT with 1 μmPMA for 2 h did not result in changes in enzyme amount in cytosolic or membrane fractions, as analyzed by densitometry in seven independent experiments. The capacity for cells expressing wild-type versus S440A-ChAT to synthesize [3H]ACh from [3H]choline in the absence or presence of PMA stimulation was tested. ACh was not synthesized in wild-type HEK293 cells, with almost all [3H]choline taken up into the cells converted to phosphorylcholine or other choline metabolites not extracted from aqueous solution by sodium tetraphenylboron. In contrast, expression of wild-type or S440A-ChAT in HEK293 cells shifted choline metabolism so that only about 10–20% of [3H]choline transported into the cells was converted to these metabolites, with the remainder being metabolized to [3H]ACh or remaining as unmetabolized [3H]choline. Treatment of cells expressing wild-type and S440A-ChAT with 1 μm PMA for 2 h prior to incubation with [3H]choline resulted in ACh synthesis increasing to 117% of control for wild-type ChAT and remaining at 97% of control for S440A-ChAT. We found recently that purified recombinant 69-kDa human ChAT is a substrate for PKC, and that phosphorylation of the enzyme in vitro led to a 2-fold increase in activity (7Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that 1) 69-kDa human ChAT undergoes rapid regulation of its catalytic activity in response to activation of cellular PKC by phorbol ester PMA, 2) the enzyme is phosphorylated by PKC at residue serine 440 within a functional consensus sequence for PKC, and 3) mutation of serine 440 to alanine resulted in loss of binding of ChAT to membranes and attenuation of PMA-ind"

We tested the hypothesis that 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-glucopyranoside (4MαG), a small, neutral dye molecule, cannot permeate an empty translocon pore by measuring its activation by an ER resident α-glucosidase, which is dependent on entry into the ER. The basal entry of dye into the ER of broken Chinese hamster ovary-S cells was remarkably high, and it was increased by the addition of puromycin, which purges translocon pores of nascent polypeptides, creating additional empty pores. The basal and puromycin-dependent entries of 4MαG were mediated by a common, salt-sensitive pathway that was partially blocked by spermine. A similar activation of 4MαG was observed in nystatin-perforated cells, indicating that the entry of 4MαG into the ER did not result simply from the loss of cytosolic factors in broken cells. We reject the hypothesis and conclude that a small, neutral molecule can permeate the empty pore of a translocon complex, and we propose that translationally inactive, ribosome-bound translocons could provide a pathway for small molecules to cross the ER membrane.

These processes require the transport of a broad spectrum of molecules across the ER membrane while maintaining a selectivity during transport which prevents the loss of essential gradients. The ER membrane is rich in pathways for the active and passive transport of molecules ranging in size from ions and small polar molecules to proteins. The pore of the translocon (sec61 complex) is the largest pore in the ER membrane, with an estimated diameter of 40–60 Å in the ribosome-bound state and a smaller diameter of 9–15 Å in the ribosome-free state (1Hamman B.D. Chen J.C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 2Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). When bound by a ribosome, the pore of the translocon is aligned with the peptide exit tunnel in the large subunit of the ribosome (3Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and the average diameter of this tunnel is about 20 Å (4Morgan D.G. Menetret J.F. Radermacher M. Neuhof A. Akey I.V. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 301-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, the polypeptide exit tunnel of the ribosome and the pore of the translocon provide a linked pore of sufficiently large dimensions to permit the translocation of polypeptides across the ER membrane. The role of the translocon pore as the pathway used for the cotranslational insertion of nascent proteins into the ER is well established, and recent evidence supports an even broader role for the translocon pore in protein transport because the pore also provides a pathway for the retrograde export of proteins from the lumen of the ER to the cytosol (5Gillece P. Pilon M. Romisch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Romisch K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4185-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model for ribosome-translocon interactions in which the large subunit of the ribosome remains bound to the translocon pore after translation is terminated was proposed recently (7Potter M. Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 112-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An intriguing implication of this model is that the ER membrane might contain a large number of ribosome-bound translocon complexes with the pore unoccupied by polypeptides. The very large diameter of the pore of the ribosome-translocon complex raises the possibility that many small molecules could permeate this pathway when it is empty, i.e. unoccupied by polypeptides. According to the prevailing model, a large barrier to permeation of the translocon pore is produced by the binding of BiP, a prominent ER chaperone protein, to the luminal end of the pore (2Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This gate can be opened only by nascent polypeptides that have grown to a length greater than ≈70 amino acids. However, this model was developed using charged molecules to probe the permeability of the translocon pore, and the question remains whether the binding of BiP to the pore actually produces a tight mechanical seal that blocks the passage of all molecules, or, alternatively, does the binding of BiP produce a looser seal that functions as a selectivity filter, allowing some molecules to pass through? In particular, is there a barrier to permeation of the translocon pore by neutral, polar molecules? The answer to this question is important because permeation of the translocon pore by small neutral molecules could play an essential role in bidirectional signaling or the transport of substrates between the lumen of the ER and the cytosol. We have tested the hypothesis that the translocon pore maintains a high barrier to permeation by neutral, as well as charged molecules by measuring the entry into the ER of a small polar molecule, 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-glucopyranoside (4MαG). The rationale for this assay was that entry of 4MαG into the ER can be detected if it is cleaved by α-glucosidase II, a resident ER glucosidase (9Burns D.M. Touster O. J. Biol.

The rate of accumulation of the fluorescent product should then provide a measure of the rate of entry of 4MαG into the ER. α-Glucosidase II has been purified from the ER (7Potter M. Seiser R.M.

Wu J.Y. Brady R.O. Chen Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The activity of α-glucosidase II can also be distinguished from α-glucosidase I, another neutral ER glucosidase (18Shailubhai K. Pukazhenthi B.S. Saxena E.S. Varma G.M. Vijay I.K. J. Biol.

J. 1987; 247: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), by the fact that 4MαG is not hydrolyzed by α-glucosidase I (19Shailubhai K. Pratta M.A. Vijay I.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We report that the empty translocon pore is highly permeable to 4MαG, and we propose that translationally inactive ribosome-translocon complexes might provide a pathway for the movement of small, neutral molecules across the ER membrane. 4MαG and puromycin HCl were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. CHO-S cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were grown to a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml in stirrer flasks in serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For a 32-well assay (eight conditions in quadruplicate), 20 ml of cells was pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of KG buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.25). The resuspended cells were pressurized for 2 min at 80 p.s.i. of N2 in a Parr nitrogen cavitation homogenizer and gently broken open by release through the needle valve. Under these conditions, 53% of the cells were permeabilized, as measured by propidium iodide staining. Gentle opening of the plasma membrane was essential. Increasing the N2 cavitation pressure produced a disproportionate increase in the base-line activation of 4MαG, a likely result of increased breakage of the ER with the more vigorous cavitation. Permeabilization with 100 μm digitonin, which was 100% effective, increased the variability of our measurements, perhaps as a result of destabilization of the ER membrane by the detergent. We also observed that any attempt to pellet the broken cells produced a greatly increased background fluorescence. Assays were performed using Nunc 48-well plates read in a CytoFluor 4000 (PE Biosystems) plate reader. 0.5 ml of a suspension of broken cells was loaded per well. A stock solution of 20 mm 4MαG was prepared in methanol and diluted into KG buffer at a final concentration of 20 μm, unless otherwise noted. The center wavelength and bandwidth of the excitation and emission filters were 360/40 and 460/40, respectively. All measurements were made at 35–37 °C. The plate with solutions was prewarmed to 37 °C for 15 min, and the dye was added immediately before transferring the plate to the reader. The fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 2-min intervals, with 10 s of mixing before each measurement. Puromycin HCl was prepared as a 10 mmstock solution in water and used at a final concentration of 100 μm. The substrate 4MαG is nonfluorescent until the glycosidic linkage between the glucose and coumarin dye moieties is cleaved by α-glucosidase, releasing the free, fluorescent dye. The activation of 4MαG is irreversible, and the slope of the fluorescenceversus time curve, S(t), is proportional to the rate of activation of the dye at timet. Under most conditions,S(t) was a constant, but under some conditions there was a gradual increase or decrease inS(t) which followed a simple exponential time course. The linear and exponential contributions toS(t) were well fitted by Equation1 S(t)=S0*ek*tEquation 1 where S0 is the initial slope (ΔF min−1)and k is an exponential rate constant (min−1). Best fit estimates of S0 and k for each well were obtained using the Solver nonlinear curve-fitting routine in Excel (Microsoft). Parameters for Michaelis-Menten and Hill functions were estimated using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear curve-fitting routine in Origin, version 6.0 (Microcal). Statistical analysis was performed using JMPin (SAS Institute). Averages are plotted ± S.E. of the mean. We first examined the activation of 4MαG in a broken cell preparation nonspecifically permeabilized by the addition of 0.05% sodium deoxycholate. Representative data and fitted curves calculated from Equation 1 are shown in Fig.1 A. The increase in fluorescence over time was fitted well by a combination of linear and exponential components, with the linear component dominating at concentrations of 4MαG above 10 μm. At lower concentrations of 4MαG, an exponential decay of the initial slope,S0, was apparent, probably as a result of depletion of the 4MαG substrate with time. There was no activation of dye when 4MαG was added to KG buffer in the absence of cells (data not shown). The dependence of S0 on the concentration of 4MαG is shown in Fig. 1 B. At 4MαG concentrations below 100 μm, S0values were fitted by a single Michaelis-Menten function with aKm of ≈5 μm, which was close to theKm of α-glucosidase II for 4MαG reported in bovine mammary gland (10Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the α-glucosidase activity at low substrate concentrations could be characterized by a single kinetically defined process, a second, highly variable component became increasingly evident at concentrations of 4MαG ≥ 100 μm (Fig. 1 B). We did not identify the source of this variable component. We chose 20 μm as a standard working concentration for our experiments because it was below the concentration at which the rate of activation became highly variable, yet it was high enough to drive a sufficient steady-state influx into a membrane-bound compartment (described below). We next examined the rate of activation of 4MαG as a function of pH to determine if 4MαG could be activated in CHO-S cells by an acidic α-glucosidase that is present in the lysosomes of some cells. The activation of 4MαG was strongly dependent on pH, and it was clearly attributable to glucosidase activity that was optimal between pH 6.2 and 7.5. There was no evidence of an acidic α-glucosidase (Fig.2 A), which has a pH optimum of 4.5 (17Van Hove J.L. Yang H.W. Wu J.Y. Brady R.O. Chen Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We also performed an assay for β-glucosidase, which, if present in CHO-S cells, might nonspecifically activate some 4MαG. Equimolar substitution of 4MαG by 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside, the β anomer of 4MαG and substrate for β-glucosidase, yielded no fluorescent product (Fig.2 B). This assay was performed under conditions in which the activity of β-glucosidase added to the preparation was readily detectable (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that neither acidic α-glucosidase nor β-glucosidase is present in CHO-S cells, and 4MαG is activated in CHO-S cells by α-glucosidase II. The addition of 4MαG to the solution bathing intact CHO-S cells resulted in very little activation of the dye (Fig.3 A), indicating that 4MαG does not easily cross intact membranes. To enable access of 4MαG to the ER, we chose low pressure N2 cavitation as a gentle method to break open the plasma membrane. The addition of 4MαG to cavitation-permeabilized cells produced a surprisingly high basal rate of activation, S0,basal, ∼20–45% (median = 28%) of the rate observed in cells permeabilized by 0.05% sodium deoxycholate (Fig. 3 B). This high basal rate was especially remarkable given that cavitation permeabilized only slightly more than 50% of the cells, whereas the detergent permeabilized all of the cells (data not shown). Although a high basal rate of entry of 4MαG into the ER might be inferred from the high rate of activation, an alternate explanation is that 4MαG was activated by α-glucosidase exposed to the buffer by accidental breakage of the ER. We tested this with a protease protection assay using trypsin. When trypsin (0.25% w/v) was added to detergent-permeabilized cells, S(t)decreased exponentially with time (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that α-glucosidase not protected by intact membranes could be inactivated irreversibly by trypsin. In contrast, the same concentration of trypsin added to cavitation-permeabilized cells in the absence of detergent produced an exponential increase, rather than a decrease, in S(t) (Fig.3 C). The lack of a time-dependent decrease ofS(t) in the absence of detergent demonstrated that the α-glucosidase was protected from proteolysis by trypsin, from which we conclude that the basal activation of 4MαG was produced by α-glucosidase sequestered inside a membrane-bound compartment. Puromycin is an aminoacyl tRNA analog that terminates the elongation of polypeptide chains, releasing nascent polypeptides from ribosomes and clearing the proteins from the pore of the translocon (20Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Skogerson L. Moldave K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Puromycin-treated translocons are permeable to ions (22Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and we tested the prediction that translocon pores cleared of protein by puromycin would provide additional open pores through which 4MαG could enter the ER. The addition of 100 μm puromycin increasedS0 to a value, S0,pur, which was significantly greater than the basal rate (Fig.3 A). The increase in S0 produced by the addition of puromycin, ΔS0,pur =S0,pur − S0,basal, was about 30% greater than S0,basal. We tested puromycin at concentrations between 100 and 500 μm, and we observed maximal dye entry at 100 μm puromycin (data not shown). We conclude from the high specificity of puromycin for terminating translation and the fact that the ER is the only membrane-bound compartment to which ribosomes are attached that the puromycin-dependent activation of 4MαG was produced by the entry of 4MαG into the ER through ribosome-bound translocons. The source of the puromycin-independent, basal activation of 4MαG was less clear. As a first step, we tested by correlation analysis the hypothesis that ΔS0,pur andS0,basal were independent processes. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) between ΔS0,pur andS0,basal (both calculated as a percentage of a detergent control) across a large number of assays (Fig. 3 D,n = 142), and we reject the hypothesis of independence. We estimated the portion of S0,basal which could not be accounted for by variability in ΔS0,purby regressing S0,basal onto ΔS0,pur, and this uncorrelated residual was ∼36% of S0,basal or 18% of the detergent control (Fig. 3 D). The correlation in the large data set was probably reduced by variability in the magnitude ofS0,basal and ΔS0,purover months of experiments, and the correlation between ΔS0,pur and S0,basalwas substantially higher (reaching values of 0.75) when smaller data sets (n < 20) collected over shorter periods of time were analyzed (data not shown). The correlation and regression analysis demonstrated that the processes underlyingS0,basal and ΔS0,purwere not independent, and a significant portion ofS0,basal could be predicted from ΔS0,pur. The activation of 4MαG is irreversible, and the hydrolysis of 4MαG by α-glucosidase could deplete the 4MαG concentration within a membrane-bound compartment if it is not replenished by a continuous entry of dye. The rate of entry of 4MαG is dependent on the permeability of the membrane to 4MαG and the concentration gradient for 4MαG across the membrane. This should produce an increase in the apparentKm of the α-glucosidase for 4MαG, with the magnitude of the increase inversely proportional to the permeability of the membrane to 4MαG. We measured the dependence ofS0,basal and ΔS0,pur on the concentration of 4MαG in cavitation-permeabilized cells to test this prediction. Both sets of data were fitted by Michaelis-Menten functions (Fig. 4). The ΔS0,pur data were fitted by a single component with an apparent Km near 80 μm (TableI). The S0,basaldata were fitted with two components, a dominant component with an apparent Km also near 80 μm and a very small, high affinity component. The apparent Km of ΔS0,pur and the dominant component ofS0,basal were increased ∼16-fold relative to the Km of the enzyme with detergent-permeabilized membranes (i.e. 5 μm, Fig. 1), and we conclude from the very similar shift in the apparent Kmvalues that S0,basal and ΔS0,pur are produced by the entry of dye via pathways with very similar permeabilities to 4MαG. The small, high affinity component in S0,basal might represent the activity of α-glucosidase released into the buffer, but the very small size of this component (<3% of total) provides additional evidence that nearly all of the activation of 4MαG in cavitation-permeabilized cells occurred within a membrane-bound compartment.Table IMembrane-dependent shift in apparent KmKmS0,maxμmDetergent-treated5.3 ± 0.2No detergentS0,basal0.7 ± 2.84.5 ± 6.179.4 ± 15.7152.5 ± 6.0ΔS0,pur83.1 ± 16.865.1 ± 6.9The dependence of S0 on 4MαG concentration was characterized by fitting the data sets with the functionS0 = S0,max/(1 +Km/C), where S0,max is the maximum slope, C is the concentration of 4MαG, andKm is the concentration of 4MαG which produces one-half S0,max.

Parameter values are given ± S.E. of the parameter estimate. The puromycin-dependent activation of 4MαG is most easily accounted for by a puromycin-induced release of nascent polypeptide chains from the pores of translationally active translocons, with the empty pores providing additional pathways for the entry of 4MαG. Ribosomes can be dissociated from translocons by first releasing nascent polypeptide chains with puromycin, then increasing the ionic strength of the buffer above about 100 mm (23Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Treatment with high salt has been shown to eliminate the permeation of translocon pores by ions (22Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We examined the rate of activation of 4MαG in cavitation-permeabilized cells broken open in KG buffer containing 50, 140, 200, or 300 mm potassium glutamate. Increasing the potassium glutamate concentration decreased both S0,basal and ΔS0,pur in an identical, concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5). The concentration-dependent decreases in S0,basaland ΔS0,pur were fitted with a Hill function with very similar parameter values (Fig. 5 and TableII), a concentration midpoint near 150 mm and a Hill coefficient of 7.6. The high cooperativity was consistent with the breakage of multiple salt bonds, and the absence of a second component, as evident in the quality of the single component fit, indicated that all of the salt bonds had a similar sensitivity to the salt concentration. The concentration midpoint we observed was appropriate for the salt-dependent release of ribosomes (23Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We conclude that the salt-sensitive step for ΔS0,pur is the salt-dependent release of ribosomes from translationally inactive, unoccupied translocons.Table IISalt-dependent inhibitionSmaxConst.Kih%%mS0,basal27.416.10.1517.6ΔS0,pur11.52.90.1537.6The slope data were normalized as a percentage of the detergent control and fitted with a Hill function of the following form:S(C) =Smax/[1 + (C/Ki)h] + Const., where Smax is the maximum relative slope,C is the potassium glutamate concentration,S(C) is the slope at C,Ki is the concentration at which there is half-maximal inhibition, h is the Hill coefficient, andConst. is the salt-insensitive activity.

We surmised from the striking similarities in the inhibition of ΔS0,pur and S0,basal by high salt that the salt-sensitive release of ribosomes from unoccupied translocons was also the most likely mechanism underlying the reduction in S0,basal by high salt. This interpretation is especially attractive given recent evidence that the majority of large ribosomal subunits remain bound to the ER after the normal termination of protein synthesis (24Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and this state would be equivalent to the ribosome-bound, unoccupied state of the translocon produced by treatment with puromycin (25Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To strengthen this interpretation, we developed a quantitative model of the salt-sensitive and salt-insensitive components ofS0 in the absence (S0,basal) and the presence (S0,pur) of puromycin (Fig.6 and ). This model has three free parameters: f, the fraction of pores open in the absence of puromycin; x, the permeability of a blocked pore relative to an empty pore; and s, the fraction of empty pores from which ribosomes can be removed by high salt. We measuredS0,basal and S0,pur in a normal salt buffer (140 mm KG) and a high salt buffer (300 mm KG) (n = 14 experiments). The salt-sensitive component of S0,pur was then calculated and entered into the model, and the parameters f,x, and s were adjusted to optimize the fit toS0,basal and S0,pur under the normal and high salt conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the fit was very good with parameter estimates of f = 0.738, x = 0.106, and s = 0.775. These parameter estimates were robust and independent of the starting values. Although this analysis indicated that 4MαG might permeate the blocked pores to a limited extent, it is clear from Fig. 6 B that permeation of empty pores is the primary pathway. We conclude from this analysis that the majority (74%) of the pores are permeable to 4MαG in the absence of puromycin, and this result is consistent with the persistent binding of ribosomes to translocons after termination of translation (24Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V.

We have previously shown that mean plasma Lp(a) levels in the chimpanzee are significantly higher than those observed in humans (Doucet, C., Huby, T., Chapman, J., and Thillet, J. (1994) J. Lipid Res 35, 263–270). To evaluate the possibility that this difference may result from a high level of expression of chimpanzee apo(a), we cloned and sequenced 1.4 kilobase (kb) of the 5′-flanking region of the gene and compared promoter activity to that of its human counterpart. Sequence analysis revealed 98% homology between chimpanzee and human apo(a) 5′ sequences; among the differences observed, two involved polymorphic sites associated with Lp(a) levels in humans. The TTTTA repeat located 1.3 kb 5′ of theapo(a) gene, present in a variable number of copies (n = 5–12) in humans, is uniquely present as four copies in the chimpanzee sequence. The second position concerns the +93 C>T polymorphism that creates an additional ATG start codon in the human apo(a) gene, thereby impairing translation efficiency. In chimpanzee, this position did not appear polymorphic, and a base difference at position +94 precluded the presence of an additional ATG. In transient transfection assays, the chimpanzeeapo(a) promoter exhibited a 5-fold elevation in transcriptional activity as compared with its human counterpart. This marked difference in activity was maintained with either 1.4 kb of 5′ sequence or the minimal promoter region −98 to +141 of the human and chimpanzee apo(a) genes. Using point mutational analyses, nucleotides present at positions −3, −2, and +8 (relative to the start site of transcription) were found to be essential for the high transcription efficiency of the chimpanzee apo(a) promoter. High transcriptional activity of the chimpanzee apo(a) gene may therefore represent a key factor in the elevated plasma Lp(a) levels characteristic of this non-human primate.

In humans, apo(a) contains an inactive plasminogen-like protease domain, and two plasminogen-like kringle domains, kringles IV and V. The kringle IV domain is present in multiple tandem copies of variable number. This variation is responsible for an elevated degree of size heterogeneity in the apo(a) protein (4Utermann G.

The plasma concentration of Lp(a) remains quite constant throughout life in a given individual, although considerable variation (up to a 1000-fold) in Lp(a) level is observed between individuals (<0.001 to >1 mg/ml). Twin, family, and sib-pair linkage studies have revealed that such intra-individual variability in plasma concentration is under genetic control and almost entirely explained by variations at the apo(a) gene locus (7Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Indeed, apo(a) isoform size polymorphism has been shown to account for 30–70% of the total variability in Lp(a) levels, according to the ethnic origin of the populations examined (7Boerwinkle E.

This effect is thought to result primarily from differential efficacy of post-translational processing of apo(a) isoforms in the hepatic cell (10White A.L. Guerra B. Lanford R.E. J. Biol.

In addition to the number of KIV repeats, variations in apo(a) gene sequence in the 5′-flanking region of the gene may also contribute to variance in plasma Lp(a) levels (12Wade D.P. Clarke J.G.

In addition to humans, the presence of Lp(a) has been detected only in Old World monkeys (19Makino K. Abe A. Maeda S. Noma A. Kawade M. Takenaka O. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 78: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and, surprisingly, in the European hedgehog (20Laplaud P.M. Beaubatie L. Rall Jr., S.C. Luc G. Saboureau M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1157-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is the non-human primate most closely related to humans, and indeed, Lp(a) in this species displays some remarkable characteristics. We observed that the mean plasma levels of Lp(a) and the distribution of apo(a) isoforms are distinct in chimpanzee as compared with those reported in humans, cynomolgus monkey, or baboon (21Doucet C. Huby T. Chapman J. Thillet J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lp(a) concentrations in the chimpanzee are significantly higher than those observed in either a Caucasian population (mean Lp(a) level = 0.61 mg/mlversus 0.18 mg/ml) or in African populations for which the highest mean Lp(a) levels (∼0.30–0.40 mg/ml) have been reported (8Sandholzer C.

Delport R. Trommsdorff M. Vermaak H. Janus E.D. Utermann G. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 4: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As generally observed in humans, an inverse correlation between Lp(a) concentrations and apo(a) isoform sizes was found in the group of chimpanzees that we examined (21Doucet C. Huby T. Chapman J. Thillet J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, apo(a) isoforms of low molecular mass were detected with a greater frequency in monkeys as compared with humans (mean values 665 ± 121 kDa versus789 ± 114 kDa), which could partly account for the elevated Lp(a) levels observed in the chimpanzee. Nevertheless, chimpanzees generally exhibited superior levels of Lp(a) as compared with humans for apo(a) isoforms of similar size. In view of these characteristics, we hypothesized that sequence differences in the 5′-flanking region of theapo(a) gene might account for the elevated expression level of apo(a) in chimpanzee. Consequently, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-flanking region of the chimpanzee apo(a) gene. The transcriptional activity of this region was 5-fold greater as compared with that of the corresponding region of the human apo(a)gene. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this difference is due to three base substitutions in the very proximal promoter region. All animals were housed at the Regional Center for Training and Research in Human Reproduction in Gabon. Blood samples were taken from 50 unrelated animals, and genomic DNA was prepared by phenol extraction. The 5′-flanking region of the chimpanzee apo(a)gene was amplified by PCR using five different sets of primers to obtain overlapping fragments (Table I, primer sets P1, P3, P4, P5, and LP); these fragments covered 1.4 kb of 5′ sequence. Primers were designed according to the corresponding region of the human apo(a) gene (12Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The conditions of the PCR reaction were as follows: in a 50-μl final volume, 100 ng of genomic template DNA were mixed with 20 pmol of each primer, 10 pmol of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Stratagene) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1.5 mmMgCl2 at pH 8.8. PCR reactions were carried out using the following program: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at the appropriate temperature (Table I) for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. 30 cycles were carried out under these conditions after an initial cycle for which the denaturation step was 5 min at 95 °C, in a Techne PHC-3 thermocycler. The PCR products were purified and ligated to an EcoRV-digested cloning vector (pBluescript). The 5′- and 3′-extremities of PCR clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab The region starting at −1410 bp upstream of the ATG codon and comprising the pentanucleotide repeat sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using REPD and REPR primers (Table I). The (TTTTA)n repeat was detected by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. 10-μl aliquots of the PCR reaction were loaded on the gels and run for 45 min at 30 mA in a Miniprotean II instrument (Bio-Rad, France). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light. The 1.4-kb fragment of the chimpanzeeapo(a) 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR under the same conditions as mentioned above, except that the elongation time was 2 min. The primers used were MB22 and PCR78 described by Zysow et al. (13Zysow B.R. Lindahl G.E. Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Lawn R.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) for the amplification of the corresponding 5′-region of the human apo(a) gene. Primer PCR78 encompasses the translation initiation start site of the apo(a) gene, but a base pair mismatch transforms the ATG codon into an AGG sequence in the amplified fragment. MluI and BglII sites, present at the 5′-end of primer MB22 and PCR78, respectively, were used for directional cloning of the PCR product intoMluI/BglII-digested pGL3-basic (Promega), a promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector. The resulting plasmid was designated pCH. The corresponding region of the human apo(a)gene, containing a C at position +93, was equally cloned in the pGL3-basic expressing vector (plasmid pHU). To generate the 5′-deletion constructs 5′ΔpCH and 5′ΔpHU, in which the luciferase gene is driven by the minimal apo(a) promoter sequence (−98 to +141), plasmids pCH and pHU were digested by MluI (5′ cloning site, see above) and PvuII (−98) to completion. Each vector was then separated from the excised apo(a)fragment on agarose gel and religated after blunting the cohesive termini with the Klenow enzyme. All Plasmids used in transfection experiments were purified on AX-100 columns (Macherey-Nagel, France). Substitution mutants for positions −3 and −2 were prepared from either the pCH or the pHU constructs by using the Gene Editor kit (Promega, France). Synthetic oligonucleotides containing two mismatched bases were used to introduce mutations in the human (CC→TT) and the chimpanzee (TT→CC) promoters. Briefly, the mutagenic oligonucleotides (mutTT-2-3: 5′-TAATGTTTGAATTCTGCTGAGCCAG-3′ or mutCC-2-3: 5′-TAATGTTTGAACCCTGCTGAGTCAG-3′) were annealed to heat-denatured plasmids together with a second oligomer, which allows the selection of the mutated vectors with the Gene Editor antibiotic mix. The bound primers were extended and ligated with T4 polymerase and T4 ligase. The mixture was then used to transform the repair-deficientEscherichia coli strain BMH 71-18 mutS. Plasmid DNA prepared from an overnight culture was used to transform JM109 cells. Mutants were then selected on LB plates containing both ampicillin and the Gene Editor antibiotic selection mix. Mutated plasmids were identified by the absence (for the mutated human sequence) or the presence of an EcoRI site (for the mutated chimpanzee sequence). The presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. As described above for pCH and pHU, the mutated constructs were digested with MluI and PvuII to generate 5′ΔpCHmut.-3,-2 and 5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2 for which the firefly luciferase cassette is under the control of the first 239 bp of theapo(a) promoter. The same mutagenesis procedure was applied to plasmid 5′ΔpHU as described above to simultaneously substitute positions −3, −2 (CC→TT) along with a third position (−51 G→C, or −24 A→T, or +8 C→T, or +65 G→A, or +94 G→A) by the nucleotides found in the chimpanzee sequence at the respective positions. Mutations at positions −2, −3, and +8 were introduced using the mutagenic oligonucleotide mut-2-3+8 (5′-TAATGTTTGAATTCTGCTGAGTCAG-3′). For the generation of the other mutants, mutTT-2-3 (see above) was used in combination with a second mutagenic oligonucleotide encompassing the third position to mutate (position −51: 5′-ATCTATTGACATTCCACTCTC-3′, position −24: 5′-TATAAGACTCTTTATTCAAGG-3′, position +65: 5′-GGTTTGTGGATGCGTTTACTC-3′, position +94: 5′-GTCAACAACATCCTGGGATTG-3′). After a first screening of the mutated constructs by restriction analysis, the sequences of the selected mutants (5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2,-51, 5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2,-24, 5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2,+8, 5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2,+65, and 5′ΔpHUmut.-3,-2,+94) were verified by sequencing. HepG2 cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mmglutamine. For transient transfections, 2 × 105 cells were plated into six-well dishes, grown for 24 h, and then incubated with 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 0.3 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pSV-gal,Promega, France), and 5 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., France) for 16 h. The medium was then replaced by fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity using a microplate reader luminometer (Victor, Wallac, France). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by a colorimetric method (Promega). Each transfection assay included control transfections with no DNA, and with pGL3-basic. HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent 75-mm flasks by the method described by Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclear extracts were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (BCA, Pierce). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), 0.25 pmol of32P-end-labeled double-strand oligonucleotide was mixed with 6 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 4 mm spermidine, and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. The appropriate competitor was added to the reaction mixture before the addition of the end-labeled probe. Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice, loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at 200 V for 3 h. The protein-DNA complex were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Life Science) at −70 °C. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-TAATGTTTGAATTCTGCTGAGTCAG-3′ (CH probe) and 5′-TAATGTTTGAACCCTGCTGAGCCAG-3′ (HU probe) corresponding to the −14 to +11 region of the chimpanzee and humanapo(a) genes, respectively. The nonspecific competitor had the following sequence: 5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the sequence of the 1.4-kb 5′-flanking region of the chimpanzee apo(a) gene with that of the corresponding region of the human gene. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology between chimpanzee and human apo(a) genes (98%). Several differences are of note. The first one concerns the TTTTA repeat present at position −1400 bp in humans. The number of repeats varies from 5 to 12 in human populations (15Trommsdorff M. Kochl S. Lingenhel A. Kronenberg F.

In the 5′-flanking region of apo(a) that we cloned, the number of repeats was four. To determine whether there was also a polymorphism in the chimpanzee apo(a) promoter at this position, we amplified a fragment spanning this repeat in 50 animals. In every animal, we found the same size for this fragment, indicating that the number of TTTTA repeats was constant in the chimpanzee (Fig.2). Another interesting difference concerns position +93 (relative to the start site of transcription). In humans, a C/T polymorphism has been described at this position that creates an additional ATG start codon (13Zysow B.R. Lindahl G.E. Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Lawn R.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In chimpanzee, every clone that was sequenced had a C at this position. Moreover, the next position was also different from that in the human sequence. Consequently, an ATG could not be present in the chimpanzee sequence. It is also of note that the corresponding sequence in baboonapo(a) is identical to that of the chimpanzee in this region (24Hixson J.E. Jett C. Birnbaum S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2324-2331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Representative example of the size determination of the apo(a) 5′-region encompassing the TTTTA repeats in chimpanzee. PCR products generated by amplification of genomic DNA from eight unrelated animals by using REPD and REPR primers were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.

M is the molecular weight DNA marker pBR322 digested by MspI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next compared the promoter activity of the 1.4-kb fragment of 5′-flanking sequence in the chimpanzee apo(a) gene to that of the corresponding human sequence. As shown in Fig.3, the chimpanzee apo(a)promoter construct (pCH) exhibited 5-fold greater activity than that of the human (pHU) promoter. In vitro promoter analyses of this 1.4-kb 5′-region of the human apo(a) gene had previously shown that the essential regulatory elements were located in the very proximal 5′-flanking sequence. Furthermore, deletion of sequences −1301 to −98 had little to no effect on promoter activity (25Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the transcriptional activities of the −98 to +141 apo(a) regions of the chimpanzee and human promoters to evaluate the role of this minimal promoter fragment in the marked difference in activity observed with the 1.4-kb apo(a)fragments. The 5′-deletion mutants of pCH and pHU were generated using the PvuII site located at position −98. Transient transfection assays revealed that the chimpanzee short construct 5′ΔpCH had approximately 5-fold higher transcriptional activity than the corresponding human plasmid 5′ΔpHU (Fig. 3). Therefore, similar differences in transcriptional activity were observed between both species using either the 1.4-kb apo(a) fragments or constructs containing the minimal apo(a) promoter regions −98 to +141. These results provided a firm indication that base differences located specifically in the very proximal 5′-region of the gene were responsible for the high transcription level of the chimpanzee apo(a) sequence as compared with its human counterpart. As a first step in the identification of these nucleotides, we compared the chimpanzee apo(a) promoter sequence to the corresponding human and baboon sequences. Lp(a) concentrations in baboon are not significantly different from those observed in Caucasians (26Rainwater D.L. Manis G.S. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 73: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, assuming that the baboon and human apo(a) promoters possess similar transcriptional activities, we hypothesized that the identification of base changes specific to the chimpanzee apo(a) sequence could be relevant to the increased apo(a) promoter activity observed in this species. Nine positions were found to be altered in the chimpanzeeapo(a) 5′ sequence, whereas they were conserved in both humans and baboon (boxed in Fig. 1). Among these nine differences, only two adjacent base changes (CC→TT), at positions −3 and −2 from the start site of transcription, were present in the −98 to +141 region (in boldface characters in Fig. 1). Consequently, site-directed mutagenesis was used to evaluate the effect of this set of change (CC↔TT) on the promoter activities of the chimpanzee and human apo(a) sequences. Mutagenesis of the chimpanzee apo(a) promoter to replace nucleotides TT at positions −3 and −2 with CC resulted in a significant reduction in transcriptional activity to the level of its human counterpart (Fig.4, see plasmid5′ΔCHmut.-3,-2). This result suggests that either one or both T bases are implicated in the increase of transcriptional activity observed with the chimpanzee sequence. However, the reverse change, i.e. the human promoter mutated to TT, did not result in an increase but rather in a small reduction in luciferase expression (Fig. 4, see plasmid5′ΔHUmut.-3,-2). Therefore, the thymidine residues at positions −3 and/or −2 are essential for high level transcription of the chimpanzee apo(a) promoter, but it appears that one or several other nucleotides may also be involved. In addition to positions −3 and −2, the two species differ at five additional positions (−51, −24, +8, +65, and +94, see Figs. 1 and 4) in the −98 to +141 region. Each one of these bases was mutated independently in the short human construct 5′ΔpHU along with positions −3 and −2. Transient transfection assays revealed that substituting the nucleotides at positions −3, −2, and +8 in 5′ΔpHU by those found at the corresponding positions in the chimpanzee sequence increased the transcriptional activity of the promoter about 5-fold, to a level similar to that observed for the wild type chimpanzee construct 5′ΔpCH (Fig. 4). This effect was observed only with these combined mutations, but in contrast, was not detected when any of the four other different positions was mutated along with positions −3 and −2 (Fig.4).Figure 4Mutational analysis of the chimpanzee and human apo(a) minimal promoter regions. Expression vectors 5′ΔpHU and 5′ΔpCH contain the −98 to +141 regions of the human and chimpanzee apo(a) genes, respectively. The base differences between the human and chimpanzee apo(a)sequences and their respective positions to the transcription start site (+1) are indicated.

We therefore investigated protein-DNA interactions in this region. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells and synthetic oligonucleotides spanning the −14 to +11 region of both human and chimpanzee apo(a)genes. Interaction with the CH probe corresponding to the chimpanzee sequence in the absence of competitor resulted in the formation of three complexes (Fig. 5, lane 1); the band designated C1 specifically competed with a molar excess of unlabeled CH probe (Fig. 5, lane 3), but not with a nonspecific competitor (Fig. 5, lane 2) or with the human HU probe (Fig. 5, lane 4).

The paramagnetic ferric iron at the active site of recombinant human PAH (hPAH) and its midpoint potential at pH 7.25 (E m (Fe(III)/Fe(II))) were studied by EPR spectroscopy. Similar EPR spectra were obtained for the tetrameric wild-type (wt-hPAH) and the dimeric truncated hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) corresponding to the “catalytic domain.” A rhombic high spin Fe(III) signal with a g value of 4.3 dominates the EPR spectra at 3.6 K of both enzyme forms. An E m = +207 ± 10 mV was measured for the iron in wt-hPAH, which seems to be adequate for a thermodynamically feasible electron transfer from BH4 (E m (quinonoid-BH2/BH4) = +174 mV). The broad EPR features from g = 9.7–4.3 in the spectra of the ligand-free enzyme decreased in intensity upon the addition of l-Phe, whereas more axial type signals were observed upon binding of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), the stable oxidized form of BH4, and of dopamine. All three ligands induced a decrease in the E m value of the iron to +123 ± 4 mV (l-Phe), +110 ± 20 mV (BH2), and −8 ± 9 mV (dopamine). On the basis of these data we have calculated that the binding affinities ofl-Phe, BH2, and dopamine decrease by 28-, 47-, and 5040-fold, respectively, for the reduced ferrous form of the enzyme, with respect to the ferric form. Interestingly, an E m value comparable with that of the ligand-free, resting form of wt-hPAH, i.e. +191 ± 11 mV, was measured upon the simultaneous binding of both l-Phe and BH2, representing an inactive model for the iron environment under turnover conditions.

The crystal structures of the complexes of rat TH and hPAH with the oxidized cofactor analogue dihydrobiopterin (BH2) have also been determined (7Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Stevens R.C.

Moreover, the structure of the ternary complex hPAH·BH2·l-Phe has recently been studied by NMR spectroscopy and molecular docking (9Teigen K. Frøystein N.A. Martı́nez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These structural studies support the proposal that an iron-peroxo-tetrahydropterin complex forms during the catalytic cycle (10Dix T.A. Benkovic S.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 101-107Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and may either act as the hydroxylating intermediate itself or be the precursor of a ferryl oxo intermediate capable of aromatic hydroxylation (11Davis M.D. Kaufman S.

Thus,l-Phe seems to bind at the second coordination sphere of the iron with a distance between the hydroxylation sites (C4a in the pterin and C4 in l-Phe) of 6.3 Å, which is adequate for the intercalation of iron-coordinated molecular oxygen (9Teigen K.

Moreover, the crystal structure of hPAH complexed with diverse catecholamines has revealed that the inhibitors bind to the iron by bidentate coordination through the catechol hydroxyl groups (13Erlandsen H.

Although these recent structural studies have provided further insight into the function of the iron and the pterin in the catalytic reaction of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, little is yet known about the details of electron transfer reactions and the catalytic mechanism. It seems clear that no product or intermediate is released prior to the binding of all substrates, and the first observable product of the pterin is a 4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin, which is dehydrated toquinonoid-dihydrobiopterin (q-BH2) either spontaneously or in a reaction catalyzed by pterin 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (16Kappock T.J.

In the catalytic reaction Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by BH4, termed “reductive activation” of the enzyme (22Marota J.J. Shiman R.

Gaffney B.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Some experimental evidence has been presented in favor of Fe(II) during subsequent turnovers (16Kappock T.J. Caradonna J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2659-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), but this has not been proven, and a redox cycling from the Fe(II) to Fe(III) and even Fe(IV) has alternatively been proposed (16Kappock T.J.

However, it is not known to what extent the binding of substrate, cofactor, and catecholamines at the active site affects the coordination environment of the catalytic iron and its reactivity. Earlier EPR spectroscopic studies on rat PAH have revealed that the coordination geometry of the ferric iron depends on the buffer ions and the presence of ligands coordinating at the first and the second coordination sphere (20Martı́nez A.

Moreover, the same proportion of iron that coordinates to catecholamines is reduced by the tetrahydropterin cofactor and participates in catalysis (20Martı́nez A. Andersson K.K. Haavik J. Flatmark T.

In the present study we have further characterized the X-band EPR spectroscopic properties of both the tetrameric wild-type and a dimeric truncated form of human PAH corresponding to the catalytic domain, as well as the effect of the substrate l-Phe, reduced and oxidized pterin cofactor, and the inhibitor dopamine. We also report for the first time the midpoint potential of the iron in the wild-type human PAH as isolated and its modulation upon the binding of substrate, oxidized pterin cofactor (BH2), and dopamine.

Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The tetrameric form of wt-hPAH and the dimeric hPAH(Gly103-Gln428), corresponding to the “catalytic domain,” were separated from aggregated/higher oligomeric forms and from maltose-binding protein and factor Xa by size exclusion chromatography on HiLoad Superdex 200 HR prepacked column (1.6 × 60 cm) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically using the absorption coefficients A 280 nm (1 mg ml−1 cm−1) = 1.0 for wt-hPAH and 0.9 for hPAH(Gly103-Gln428); the assay of PAH activity was performed as described (32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Enzyme samples initially were prepared in 20 mm NaHepes, 0.2 mNaCl, pH 7.0. The iron content of the enzyme samples, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, was as previously reported (1.8–2.0 atoms Fe/tetramer for wt-hPAH and 0.8–0.9 atoms Fe/dimer for hPAH(Gly103-Gln428)) (32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the experiments for the initial characterization of the iron center and the effect of ligands on the X-band EPR spectrum of hPAH, enzyme samples of either wt-hPAH or hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) were prepared in 20 mm NaHepes, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.0. Additions and incubations (5 min, pH 7.0, 25 °C) of either of the following compounds: l-Phe, dopamine,l-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2, Dr. B. Schircks' Laboratories) and 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6-MPH4, Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories) in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), were performed in the EPR tubes prior to freezing the samples. We have previously shown that DTT alone does not reduce the Fe(III) in rat PAH in the presence of dioxygen (20Martı́nez A. Andersson K.K. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the EPR-monitored redox titrations the samples were prepared in 50 mm Mops buffer, 0.2 m KCl, pH 7.25, and the final enzyme (wt-hPAH) concentration was 100–120 μmsubunit. Nonspecifically bound Cu(II), giving rise to characteristic EPR signals around g = 2.0–2.3, was removed by incubation of the enzyme with 5 mm EDTA followed by three cycles of dilution and concentration in EDTA-free Mops buffer using Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon). This treatment did not result in any significant change in the shape or intensity of the Fe(III) signal around g = 4.3. A first series of EPR analysis was performed on the recombinant hPAH in the absence and presence of ligands at 9.64 GHz microwave frequency on a Bruker ESP300E equipped with an Oxford Instruments cryostat 900 at 3.6 K. Other EPR parameters are given in the figure legends. The EPR spectra were smoothed with the polynomial filter (n = 15) provided in the WINEPR software (Bruker) and were base-line corrected. Quantification of the Fe(III) EPR was performed by comparing the double integral of the spectra of hPAH with the double integral of a 500 μm transferrin standard at several temperatures (which excludes an error that might be introduced by very different D values). In the cases in which quantification was performed using simulated spectra, similar results were obtained. Room temperature potentiometric titrations for subsequent EPR monitoring were performed in a 2-ml anaerobic cell under purified argon. The bulk potential of the stirred solution was measured using a platinum wire electrode with respect to the potential of a Radiometer REF201 Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Reported potentials were all expressed relative to the normal hydrogen electrode. 100 μm subunit hPAH in 50 mm Mops, 0.2m KCl, pH 7.25 was poised at various potentials in the presence of 100 μm each of the following mediators:N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine,2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, phenazine ethosulfate, methylene blue, resorufin, indigosulfonate, phenosafranin, safranin O, neutral red, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. Sodium dithionite and K3Fe(CN)6 were used as reductant and oxidant, respectively. Redox equilibrium was obtained as judged by the attainment of a stable solution potential within a few minutes after the addition of the titrant to the reaction mixture. The samples were transferred anaerobically to EPR tubes and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Midpoint potentials (E m) were obtained from the experimental data points with a least squares fit to the Nernst equation (n = 1). In addition to the titration of the ligand free enzyme, titrations in the presence of eitherl-Phe (5 mm), BH2 (5 mm), both l-Phe (5 mm) and BH2 (5 mm), or dopamine (1 mm) were also performed. The EPR-monitored titrations of hPAH samples were performed at a microwave frequency of 9.41 GHz and a microwave power of 8 mW, with a 10-Gauss (1.0 mT) modulation amplitude and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz at 29 K. These temperature values were used to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio under nonsaturating conditions. Simulation of the spectra was performed as described (33Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Tris has been found to be an inhibitor of the enzyme, competitive to the pterin cofactor (22Marota J.J. Shiman R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and our previous EPR spectroscopic studies on rat PAH demonstrated that Tris, in its base form, induces changes in the active site iron (20Martı́nez A. Andersson K.K. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, we have used Hepes and Mops buffers in the present EPR studies. Recombinant wt-hPAH revealed a low temperature (3.6 K) EPR spectrum typical for high spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) (Fig.1, spectrum A). The spectrum is dominated by a resonance centered around g = 4.3, with an accompanying broad signal with g value of ∼9.7, which is characteristic of ferric iron in a rhombic environment, with an E/D value of ∼1/3. Some minor iron species showing weak signals with g values spread from 9.7 to 7.0 and 5.3 to 4.3 with various E/D values between 0.05 and 0.33 were also present, indicating some microheterogeneity in the coordination geometry of the enzyme-bound iron. Nevertheless, the iron environment appears to be more homogenous in the recombinant hPAH than previously observed for the hepatic rat and bovine enzymes, which have been isolated through procedures including preincubation of the crude extracts with ferrous ions and DTT (34Gottschall D.W. Dietrich R.F. Benkovic S.J. Shiman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 845-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those PAH preparations showed a split of the major resonance at g = 4.3 and a higher proportion of iron in a less rhombic environment (gmax values in the range of 7 to 6 and E/D < 0.05) (20Martı́nez A. Andersson K.K. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Quantification of the Fe(III) EPR in wild-type hPAH gave numbers that were in reasonable agreement with the total iron content measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, i.e.0.45–0.52 atoms iron/subunit for recombinant wt-hPAH (32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This value is also similar to the catalytically active iron measured in rat PAH (19Bloom L.M. Benkovic S.J. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4204-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Kappock T.J. Harkins P.C. Friedenberg S. Caradonna J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30532-30544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Citron B.A. Davis M.D. Kaufman S. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although the isolated rat and bovine liver enzyme preparations contain about 1 atom iron/subunit, only a fraction of it has been found to be reduced by the cofactor and thus to participate in catalysis (19Bloom L.M. Benkovic S.J. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4204-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Martı́nez A. Andersson K.K. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The effect of preincubation of the samples with eitherl-Phe or 6-MPH4 as well as with both compounds simultaneously (turnover conditions) on the EPR spectrum of wt-hPAH is shown in Fig. 1. For a better estimation of the amount of iron that is not in the completely rhombic environment (E/D = 1/3, g = 4.3, resonance at 160 mT), the corresponding zero line for each spectrum is shown. The area enclosed by the recorded spectra between 70 and 100 mT and this zero line correlates with iron in a less rhombic environment. A comparison of these areas in spectra 1A and 1B shows that preincubation of wt-hPAH (spectrum A) with the substratel-Phe (spectrum B) results in a decrease of these signals. Moreover, a concomitant increase of the intensity of the major signal at g = 4.3 is observed. Quantification, performed by double integration of the spectra shown in 1A and 1B between 60 and 240 mT reveals that the total intensity of both spectra is identical within the error range of the method (10%). By contrast, when the reducing cofactor analogue 6-MPH4 is added to the resting form of the enzyme, the amount of ferric iron decreases to 35%, as judged by the decrease of the double integral of the major signal at g = 4.3 (Fig. 1, spectrum C). This reduction is slightly enhanced (only 28% of the iron is in the ferric state) if 6-MPH4 is added to the enzyme preincubated with l-Phe, i.e. at turnover conditions (Fig. 1, spectrum D). The deletion of the N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal tetramerization domains of hPAH results in an activated (about 3-fold) dimeric hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) form that does not show any significant further activation by prior incubation withl-Phe, and contrary to the full-length wt-hPAH, it does not bind l-Phe with positive cooperativity (32Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Aarden J.M. Haavik J. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As seen by the crystal structures of this truncated form (1Erlandsen H. Fusetti F. Martı́nez A. Hough E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and of rat PAH containing the catalytic and regulatory domains (3Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the negative effect exerted by the regulatory domain on the catalytic activity is not accompanied by significant structural changes around the 6-coordinating iron site. Accordingly, no significant differences were observed in the main features of the X-band EPR spectra of the full-length and truncated hPAH forms either in the absence or presence of l-Phe (Fig.1, spectra A and B and Fig.2, spectra A andB). However, there seem to be differences in the coordination environment between the iron in the full-length and the isolated catalytic domain as indicated by the decreasedP 12 values for the microwave power saturation behavior of the truncated PAH (Table I), which may indicate a more homogenous iron coordination environment for this form.Table IMicrowave power saturation (P12) of the iron signal at g = 4.3 of different forms of hPAH at different temperaturesSampleP 124 K6 K10 KmWwt-hPAH0.93 ± 0.14>3.50 ± 0.1758 ± 8hPAH(Gly103-Gln428)0.90 ± 0.131.47 ± 0.1210.3 ± 0.7hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) + 1 mml-Phe1.3 ± 0.19.4 ± 1.6n.d. 1-an.d., not determined.1-a n.d., not determined. Open table in a new tab The oxidized cofactor analogue BH2 inhibits both wt-hPAH and hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) by a competitive type of inhibition versus the natural pterin cofactor BH4, with a K i of 120 μmfor wt-hPAH and 100 μm for the truncated form (9Teigen K. Frøystein N.A. Martı́nez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex between hPAH(Gly103-Gln428) and BH2 has recently been solved both by NMR spectroscopy and docking in the ligand-free crystal structure of the enzyme (9Teigen K. Frøystein N.A. Martı́nez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by x-ray crystallography (8Erlandsen H. Bjørgo E. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2208-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have examined here the effect of BH2 on the EPR spectrum of this double truncated form. The addition of BH2 at concentrations of 500 μmresults in the appearance of a less rhombic type of high spin ferric species with g values of 7.4, 4.3, and (1.8) from the lowest and 5.8, (1.7), and (1.5) from the middle Kramer's doublet with E/D = 0.07 (Fig. 2, spectrum C). The g values below 2 (in parentheses) can be estimated only from rhombograms, as any g or D strain has severe broadening effects in these g value regions. It seems that spectrum 2C consists of two major species, i.e. one with E/D = 0.07 and one with E/D = 0.33, as well as some minor species with intermediate E/D values that distort the signal at g value = 5.8. Studies intended to determine the E m (Fe(III)/Fe(II)) for the active site iron in hPAH by direct electrochemistry using activated glassy carbon as the working electrode were unsuccessful with all the promoters used. Thus, EPR-monitored redox titrations of the iron in wt-hPAH (100–120 μmenzyme subunit in Mops buffer at pH 7.25) were performed in the absence of ligands and in the presence of l-Phe (Fig.3, spectrum A), BH2 (Fig. 3, spectrum B), and l-Phe and BH2 simultaneously bound (Fig. 3, spectrum C) at 29 K. For the samples with BH2 the ratio of the intensities of the signals with g values of 5.8 and 7.4 is higher in the EPR spectra taken at 29 K (Fig.3, spectrum B) than in those taken at 3.6 K (Fig. 2,spectrum C), substantiating the assignment of the signal at g value = 7.4 to the lowest and at g value = 5.8 to the middle Kramer's doublet. We have also studied the effect of dopamine on both the EPR spectrum of wt-hPAH and the E m . The crystal structure of the complexes between the catalytic domain of hPAH and several catecholamines shows that these inhibitors bind to the iron by bidentate coordination through"

Although the single-headed subfragment of myosin (S1)1 has always been considered a good model system for studying myosin structure and function, it is clear that some important features of whole myosin may be overlooked by studying only this model species. A prominent example is that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth and vertebrate non-muscle myosin II is manifested only in subfragments that have two heads as well as a minimal length of the coiled-coil tail (1Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, single-headed myosin is unregulated and always active (2Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Tethering of the two heads together via the coiled-coil tail can also impose steric and mechanical constraints on the interaction of the two heads with actin. This has been explored in the case of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin (3Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Hackney D.D. Clark P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (HMM) but not for the regulated HMMs, where light chain phosphorylation may also be expected to affect the coupling between the two heads. Structural differences between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated HMM in the presence of ATP were recently revealed through analysis of two-dimensional crystalline arrays by image reconstruction and docking of high resolution structures into the observed density maps (5Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the phosphorylated state the two heads showed no contact with each other. In contrast, the unphosphorylated HMM showed an interaction between the two heads, with the actin-binding interface of one head bound to the converter domain of the other. This asymmetrical interaction between the unphosphorylated heads suggested a mechanism for how phosphorylation-dependent regulation of activity is achieved. One head cannot interact with actin and therefore its ATPase activity will not be enhanced, whereas the other head cannot undergo the rotation of the converter domain that is necessary to achieve phosphate release (5Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This unexpected structure provided evidence that the coupling between the heads of double-headed smooth muscle heavy meromyosin is influenced by the state of light chain phosphorylation. To further understand how the two heads of smooth muscle HMM interact with each other, we undertook a kinetic analysis of HMM in both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. In addition to the kinetic changes that account for regulation of ATPase activity, another major difference was detected in the strong binding states of the cross-bridge cycle. Although both heads of phosphorylated HMM bind to actin in the presence of ADP, only one head of unphosphorylated HMM binds to actin under these conditions. This observation not only shows that light chain phosphorylation changes the mechanical coupling between heads but also provides a mechanism whereby ADP binding to one head can gate the response of the second head. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by conventional protocols (7O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Freeman and Co., NY1992Google Scholar). For HMM expression, Sf9 cells in suspension culture were coinfected with two recombinant viral stocks, one coding for the heavy chain (amino acids 1–1175) and one coding for both the regulatory light chain and essential light chains. The heavy chain was cloned with a FLAG tag at the C terminus to facilitate purification (DYKDDDDK). The cells were harvested at 65–75 h, and the recombinant proteins were isolated on an anti-FLAG affinity column (Sigma). Unlike proteolytically prepared HMM, the expressed HMM yielded a homogeneous product with intact heavy and light chains. Thiophosphorylated HMM was prepared by incubation of unphosphorylated HMM with ATP-γ-S, CaCl2, myosin light chain kinase, and calmodulin. The protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 3 mg sucrose/mg protein and stored at −80 °C. F-actin was prepared following the method of Spudich and Watts (8Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrene as described previously (9Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl, pH 7, unless specified. Kinetics measurements used a standard Hi-Tech SF-61 DX2 stopped flow spectrophotometer using a 100W Xe/Hg lamp and a monochromator for wavelength selection. Pyr-actin and mantATP fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected after passing through a 389-nm cutoff filter. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and the emission was detected after passing through a 320-nm cutoff filter. All of the transients shown are the average of three to six shots of the stopped flow apparatus superimposed with the best fit of a single or double exponential function. In kinetic experiments it is normal to quote the concentrations of the reacting species after mixing in the stopped flow (dilution by 2, 1:1 mixing). Where the amplitudes are analyzed to provide information on the concentration of a species present at equilibrium, then the concentration before mixing is relevant. In Figures, the concentrations are quoted as initial or final as appropriate. Titration curves were fitted with a quadratic function as described by Kurzawa and Geeves (10Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When a myosin head binds to an actin molecule that has been covalently labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide (pyr-actin) the fluorescence of the pyrene group is quenched by up to 70%. Dissociation of HMM from pyr-actin by ATP was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of the pyrene group (3Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,9Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On adding excess ATP to pyr-acto-HMM the observed transient was a single exponential with a similar observed rate constant (kobs) and amplitude for both thiophosphorylated (thioP) and unphosphorylated (uP) HMM (Fig.1). The apparent second order rate constant for ATP binding to HMM was 0.25–0.3 μm−1s−1, and the observed amplitude was consistent with complete dissociation of thioP and uP-HMM from the acto-HMM complex. A similar experiment was performed using excess ADP (Fig.1 A). Addition of ADP produced no change of fluorescence in acto-thioP-HMM as observed previously for acto·smooth S1 (11Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Evidence that a ternary actin·HMM·ADP complex was formed is shown in Figs. 2 and3. In striking contrast, when ADP was added to acto-uP-HMM, a fluorescence increase was observed which was approximately half of the amplitude of that seen for ATP with akobs of 0.41 s−1. This result indicates that half of the unphosphorylated myosin heads are no longer tightly bound to actin. Note that the experiment is done with a 2-fold excess of actin over HMM. Loss of half of these tightly bound heads means that only one in four of the actins has a tightly bound myosin head.Figure 3ADP inhibition of ATP-induced dissociation of pyrene-actin complex.

Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the exponential increase in pyrene fluorescence depends upon the amount of acto-HMM complex present before addition of ATP. The kobs was independent of the protein concentration (kobs = 4.5 s−1 for thioP-HMM, and kobs= 3.5 s−1 for uP-HMM). The amplitude of the dissociation reaction was linearly dependent on HMM concentration until a plateau was reached for both thioP- and uP-HMM (Fig. 2, Aand B). These data show that the binding between HMM heads and actin is tight and stoichiometric, with a dissociation constant (Kd) ≪ 40 nm. Similar results were obtained at salt concentrations between 30 and 500 mm KCl (Table I).Table IData from the actin-HMM titrationsProteinKCl+ADPKd+ADP−ADPmmnmFmFmthioP-HMM30<100.44 ± 0.080.42 ± 0.0320018 ± 4.30.38 ± 0.020.40 ± 0.0150088 ± 70.25 ± 0.040.32 ± 0.01uP-HMM30<100.17 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.0220051 ± 100.25 ± 0.100.44 ± 0.01S120049 ± 280.30 ± 0.050.31 ± 0.01Fm is maximum change of pyr-acto fluorescence at saturating HMM.Kd is the affinity of HMM for actin. Open table in a new tab Fm is maximum change of pyr-acto fluorescence at saturating HMM.Kd is the affinity of HMM for actin. The affinity of actin for HMM·ADP was measured by repeating the assay described above in the presence of 100 μm ADP. The dependence of the signal amplitude on thioP-HMM concentration was fitted with aKd of 18 nm at 200 mm KCl (Fig. 2 A). The Kd was <10 nmat 30 mm KCl and 87 nm at 500 mmKCl. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that the maximum amplitude for the fluorescence change was the same in the presence and absence of ADP (Table I). This result confirms that each head of thioP-HMM can make the rigor or R-state attachment to actin in the presence or absence of ADP. The results with uP-HMM in the presence of ADP are in marked contrast to those with thioP-HMM (Table I). At 200 mm KCl, the affinity of uP-HMM for actin was 51 nm, but the amplitude of the fluorescence change was only half of that seen with no nucleotide (data not shown). Because of the relatively small signal amplitude of the reaction and the hyperbolic saturation curve, the end point was not well defined. The measurement was therefore repeated at lower ionic strength (30 mm KCl) where the binding is tighter. The lower ionic strength data show a break point at a concentration of uP-HMM approximately equal to that of actin (Fig.2 B). The data clearly show that the maximum fluorescence amplitude is much smaller in the presence of ADP than in its absence. Furthermore the slope of the line for fluorescence versus[HMM] in the presence of ADP is half of that in the absence of ADP. Thus at each HMM concentration only half of the fluorescence change is produced in the presence of ADP. Thus the effect is observed from an 8-fold molar excess of actin to HMM heads to concentrations where HMM heads are in excess of actin. The maximum amplitude of the signal in the presence of ADP is close to half of that in the absence of ADP over a range of salt concentrations (Table I). The simplest interpretation of the data is that only one head of uP-HMM can make a rigor-like R-state complex with actin in the presence of ADP. Because the saturation point is independent of ADP, either the second head is binding in the weaker attached or A-state, which does not give a fluorescence signal change, or the second head is sterically preventing the binding of a second HMM to that actin site. Because ADP induces a dramatic change in the binding of uP-HMM to actin we determined the affinity of ADP for acto-HMM. The pyr-acto-HMM complex, in the presence of increasing concentrations of ADP, was dissociated by mixing with a large excess of ATP (Fig. 3 A). The best fit to the sum of one or two exponentials is superimposed on the experimental traces (fast phase ≈350 s−1, slow phase ≈40 s−1). The fast phase arises from heads without nucleotide that bind ATP very quickly and dissociate from actin. The slow phase results from heads that have ADP at the active site and the rate of ATP binding is limited by the rate of ADP dissociation. A comparison of the amplitudes of the fast and slow components allowed the fraction of HMM heads occupied by ADP to be estimated, and thus the affinity of the head for ADP to be deduced (11Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The total amplitude was independent of ADP concentration as expected if all heads remain tightly bound to actin in the presence of ADP (Fig.3 B). The fast and slow phase amplitudes were plotted as a fraction of the total amplitude at each ADP concentration (Fig.3 B). A fit of the two curves to a hyperbola gave similar binding constants, KADP, of 10.8 μm for the titration of the increase of the slow phase and decrease of the fast phase (TableII). In all of these plots the initial concentration of ADP is plotted because this is the concentration when the ADP binding is at equilibrium just before the addition of ATP.Table IIAffinity of ADP for the binding sites on HMMProteinKADP1KADP2μmμmthioP-HMM0.70.7uP-HMM2v.weakacto·thioP-HMM1010acto·uP-HMM1–210–20v. weak, very weak. Open table in a new tab v. weak, very weak. The same experiment was repeated with uP-HMM. The interpretation of this titration was not as simple as for thioP-HMM because the two effects are apparent. The total amplitude decreases as tightly bound heads are lost at increased ADP concentration. At 100 μmthe total amplitude has decreased by 50% and little further change is expected based on the results in Figs. 1 and 2. ADP concentrations greater than 100 μm cannot be used because at higher concentrations the fast and slow amplitudes are no longer distinct due to a reduction in the rate of the fast phase because of competition of ATP with ADP. The loss of total amplitude appears monophasic and required 10–20 μm ADP for half of the effect. The change in fractional amplitude of the fast and slow phases showed two components. The transient appears as 50% fast and slow phase at 16 μm ADP with half-saturation at 1–2 μmsuggesting an ADP affinity of 1–2 μm for half of the sites. The remainder of the fast phase required much higher concentrations of ADP to eliminate it and was similar to the concentration dependence seen in the total amplitude plot, consistent with an affinity of 10–20 μm. This leads to the conclusion that 50% of the acto-HMM sites bind ADP with an affinity of 1–2 μm, and the remainder bind with a much lower affinity (10–20 μm). The binding of excess ATP to HMM results in a ≈10% increase in protein fluorescence that could be fitted by a single exponential at all ATP concentrations. The value of kobs was linearly dependent upon ATP concentration from 0–30 μm with the same slope for both uP-HMM and thioP-HMM (1.2 μm−1s−1) (12Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because ADP binds HMM with a much smaller fluorescence change than ATP, the displacement of ADP can be monitored from the net increase in fluorescence as ATP replaces ADP. ThioP-HMM was preincubated with various ADP concentrations and then mixed with excess ATP (Fig.4 A). In the presence of ADP the reaction is biphasic. The fast phase occurred at 21 s−1, which is the kobs for ATP binding to any unoccupied thioP-HMM. The slow phase occurred at thekobs for ADP dissociating from thioP-HMM and was 3 s−1. As the ADP concentration is increased, the amplitude of the slow phase increases while that of the fast phase decreases. The best fit to a hyperbola (Fig. 4 B) gives aKADP of 0.7 μm for both phases. The decrease in total amplitude is consistent with the fact that ADP binding to HMM causes a smaller fluorescence enhancement than does ATP binding. The same experiment was repeated with uP-HMM (Fig. 4, C andD). The observed rate constant of the fast phase was ≈30 s−1, and that of the slow phase was 2.4 s−1. The total amplitude decreases at the same time as the proportion of fast and slow amplitudes changes (Fig.4 D). The total amplitude decreases by half at 40 μm ADP and at the same time the remaining amplitude is 50% fast and slow phase. The best fit to hyperbolae for the slow and fast phase data gave similar values of KADP of 2 μm. The total amplitude shows the same concentration dependence. The loss of total fluorescence is large and unexpected and remains to be explained. If the two heads are binding ADP differently, then we have no simple way to assign the amplitudes of the fluorescence changes to particular nucleotide binding states. The observation that half of the observed transient is compatible with ATP binding unhindered to the nucleotide site suggests that approximately half of the sites have no tightly bound ADP. This suggests that half of the sites are binding ADP with an affinity of 2 μm, and the remainder have a much weaker affinity and may not bind ADP at all under these conditions. The asymmetry in the behavior of uP-HMM shown here does not result from heterogeneity in the protein. The recombinant HMM heavy chain is intact, and the species that were analyzed were either completely phosphorylated or completely unphosphorylated within the limits of detection by gels. Multiple turnover assays in the stopped flow gave ATPases of 0.019 s−1 for thioP-HMM and 0.0024 s−1 for uP-HMM indicating a good level of regulation. Single turnover assays based on the displacement of a fluorescent ATP analogue from HMM in the steady state by unlabeled ATP (13Bennett A.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) showed that 85–90% of the transient was described by a single exponential with a kobs of 0.0008 s−1 and a small fraction (10–15%) with a kobs of ∼10 times faster (giving an average turnover rate of 0.0019 s−1). The results were similar using either mantATP or mant-deoxyATP. Thus the 50% heterogeneity of the behavior of uP-HMM cannot be accounted for by simple heterogeneity in the protein preparations. The affinity of HMM for actin in the absence of nucleotide is stronger than S1 as expected from all other studies of dimeric versus monomeric myosin fragments (3Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2120-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of the high affinity, it is not possible to tell if phosphorylation affects the binding to actin. However, it is clear that in the absence of nucleotide both heads of thioP-HMM and uP-HMM bind stoichiometrically to actin and form the normal rigor-like R-conformation of the actomyosin complex that results in quenching of the pyrene fluorescence. In the presence of ADP, the affinity of thioP-HMM for actin (18 nm) was ∼2 times tighter than that for recombinant smooth S1 under similar conditions (Table I, proteolytically prepared smooth S1 was 87 nm (11Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). The contribution of the second head is expected to produce higher affinity binding. In a study of skeletal S1 versus HMM, Conibear and Geeves (3Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found that HMM bound to actin in the presence of ADP at 20–50 times the affinity of S1 (depending upon the ionic strength), so the 2-fold difference observed here is small. A key observation of the work on skeletal HMM showed that in the presence of ADP the probability of the myosin forming an R-like conformation was significantly reduced for HMM compared with S1. This was most simply observed by adding ADP to a saturated actin·HMM complex where an increase in pyrene fluorescence was observed without any detachment of HMM from actin indicating loss of ∼20% of the R-states. This was suggested to be due to strain induced between the two heads in trying to form identical stereospecific interactions with two actin sites 5.5 nm apart (see Fig.5). This effect of strain was not apparent in the absence of nucleotide because the binding was very tight. The affinity of smooth HMM for actin is tighter than that for skeletal HMM, it is weakened only 5-fold by ADP compared with >20-fold for skeletal S1, and there is no apparent loss of R-states upon addition of ADP to the thioP-HMM. It appears therefore that both heads can form the R-state interaction, but the second head makes only a modest contribution to the overall affinity. The situation with uP-HMM in the presence of ADP is markedly different. The affinity of uP-HMM for actin (51 nm) is significantly weaker than that of thioP-HMM (18 nm) and close to that of S1 (49 nm) suggesting very little contribution of the second head to overall affinity. Furthermore despite a 1:1 stoichiometry between actin and HMM only half of the heads are in the R-state. This result is supported by the maximum fluorescence amplitude data and the amplitudes observed on adding excess ADP to acto-uP-HMM (Figs. 1 and 2). It is significant that the fluorescence transient observed on addition of ADP to acto·uP-HMM is very slow and consistent with a slow first order rearrangement event and not ADP binding itself. The stoichiometry implies that the second head of a molecule is bound to actin but not in an R-state or that it is detached but in a nearby position that prevents binding of another head to that site. A structure similar to that observed by Wendt et al.(5Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) for uP-HMM (in the presence of ATP and the absence of actin), in which only one head of HMM is available to bind to actin, is compatible with the data presented here. The binding of ADP to thioP-HMM was consistent with two identical binding sites with an affinity of 0.7 μm, which was reduced to 10 μm in the presence of actin. These results are similar to those of smooth S1 (1 μm without actin, 5 μm in the presence of actin) and suggest that under all of the conditions examined here the two nucleotide sites bind ADP independently of each other. The observation that the ADP affinity is reduced 5–10-fold upon actin binding for both S1 and thioP-HMM is consistent with the two independent heads binding to actin in the same way. For uP-HMM, in the absence of actin there is evidence that ADP binds to two classes of binding sites with affinities of 2 μm and >40 μm. It is possible that the two classes of binding sites are related to the asymmetric structure of uP-HMM observed in two-dimensional crystals such that one of the two sites is blocked by the adjacent head (5Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the presence of actin there is also evidence of two classes of binding sites for ADP with 10-fold different affinities (1–2 and 10–20 μm). The first affinity is similar to the affinity of ADP for an actin free S1 head (1 μm), and the second is similar but weaker to the affinity of ADP for acto-S1 or acto-thioP-HMM (5–10 μm). At a simple level this is compatible with only one head being attached to actin, but several issues need to be explained. Why does only one head reduce its affinity for actin dramatically? Given that both heads of HMM are bound tightly to actin in the absence of nucleotide (pyrene fluorescence quenched), how can the affinity of one head of HMM for ADP be so tight? Why is the affinity of ADP for the second head (10–20 μm) weaker than for actoS1 or acto-thioP-HMM (5 μm)? To interpret the data on actin binding to acto-HMM in more detail we need to consider the interplay of mechanical distortion between the two heads and ADP binding. Consider the two major changes in conformation of acto-S1 that are thought to occur for smooth S1 on release of Pi and ADP as shown in Fig. 5 A. If the two heads of HMM bind in the rigor conformation to two adjacent actins that are 5.5 nm apart in the filament, then there must be 5.5 nm of distortion in the two heads to bring the tails together in the subfragment-2 region of the rod. How this distortion is distributed between the heads is not known, but as shown in Fig. 5 B, the strain in the structure is likely to operate in opposite directions on the two heads: in the direction of the power stroke for the trailing head and in the opposite direction for the lead head. If the movement associated with ADP dissociation is in the same direction as the power stroke (Fig. 5 A) then ADP binding to the lead head will reduce the strain in the system, whereas binding an ADP to the trailing head will tend to increase the strain. It is expected therefore that the lead head will have a higher affinity for ADP and that the first ADP to bind will go to the lead head. In the case of thioP-HMM these effects must be small because no difference between the ADP binding to the two heads is observed. We can now consider the model shown in Fig. 5 C for uP-HMM where the two M's joined by a line represent the two heads of HMM and the trailing head is to the left of the two. Starting from the position with both heads in rigor (pyrene fluorescence quenched) ADP binds to the lead head (step 1). It can then either bind a second ADP with lower affinity to the trailing head (step 2a) followed by detachment of one head (probably the lead head because this is strained toward a state with lower actin affinity) (step 3a). Alternatively the lead head detaches (step 2b) followed by binding of the second ADP (step 3b). Both the binding of ADP to the lead head and the detachment of the leading head will reduce the strain on the trailing head and thereby make ADP binding easier to the second head leading to increased affinity for ADP. In step 1, the affinity of ADP is of the order of 1 μm, which is tighter than seen for actin-thioP-HMM or actin·S1, 5 μm and similar to an actin-free head. The higher affinity is a result of the loss of strain within the system on binding ADP. Detailed consideration of the route through the reaction scheme cannot distinguish which route will be preferred but the experimental data suggest (see legend to Fig.5 C) the occupancy of AM-MD or AMD-AMD to be small and at intermediate ADP concentrations the predominant states to be AM-AMD and AMD-MD. Thus binding of ADP to the trailing head is required to produce significant detachment of the lead head. It is likely that the conformational change of the rear head on binding ADP, which moves the neck away from the lead head, contributes to the detachment of the lead head. Such coupled movements of the two heads in relation to either Pi or ADP release could provide a mechanism of gating the response of the two heads or of processivity under the correct conditions as seen for the kinesin family of motors (16Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Cross R.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R854-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ma Y.Z.

The observation that this behavior is seen only in the uP-HMM and not in the thioP-HMM suggests that phosphorylation changes the mechanical coupling between the two heads. The role of such mechanical effects in regulation of smooth HMM activity or the latch state remains to be determined. We thank Dr. S.S. Lehrer for initiating this collaboration and for his helpful comments on the manuscript."
