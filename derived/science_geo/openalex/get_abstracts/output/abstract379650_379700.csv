https://openalex.org/W2004873484,"The negative impact of obesity on reproductive success is well documented but the stages at which development of the conceptus is compromised and the mechanisms responsible for the developmental failure still remain unclear. Recent findings suggest that mitochondria may be a contributing factor. However to date no studies have directly addressed the consequences of maternal obesity on mitochondria in early embryogenesis.Using an established murine model of maternal diet induced obesity and a live cell dynamic fluorescence imaging techniques coupled with molecular biology we have investigated the underlying mechanisms of obesity-induced reduced fertility. Our study is the first to show that maternal obesity prior to conception is associated with altered mitochondria in mouse oocytes and zygotes. Specifically, maternal diet-induced obesity in mice led to an increase in mitochondrial potential, mitochondrial DNA content and biogenesis. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was raised while glutathione was depleted and the redox state became more oxidised, suggestive of oxidative stress. These altered mitochondrial properties were associated with significant developmental impairment as shown by the increased number of obese mothers who failed to support blastocyst formation compared to lean dams. We propose that compromised oocyte and early embryo mitochondrial metabolism, resulting from excessive nutrient exposure prior to and during conception, may underlie poor reproductive outcomes frequently reported in obese women."
https://openalex.org/W1963640511,"MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is highly up-regulated during hypertrophic and cancerous cell growth. In contrast, we found that it declines in cardiac myocytes upon exposure to hypoxia. Thus, the objective was to explore its role during hypoxia. We show that miR-21 not only regulates phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), but also targets Fas ligand (FasL). During prolonged hypoxia, down-regulation of miR-21 proved necessary and sufficient for enhancing expression of both proteins. We demonstrate here for the first time that miR-21 is positively regulated via an AKT-dependent pathway, which is depressed during prolonged hypoxia. Accordingly, hypoxia-induced down-regulation of miR-21 and up-regulation of FasL and PTEN were reversed by activated AKT and reproduced by a dominant negative mutant, wortmannin, or PTEN. Moreover, the antiapoptotic function of AKT partly required miR-21, which was sufficient for inhibition of caspase-8 activity and mitochondrial damage. In consensus, overexpression of miR-21 in a transgenic mouse heart resulted in suppression of ischemia-induced up-regulation of PTEN and FasL expression, an increase in phospho-AKT, a smaller infarct size, and ameliorated heart failure. Thus, we have identified a unique aspect of the function of AKT by which it inhibits apoptosis through miR-21-dependent suppression of FasL."
https://openalex.org/W2006545231,"Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), like exercise, increases mitochondrial content and inhibits muscle atrophy. To understand these actions, we tested whether PGC-1α or its close homolog, PGC-1β, influences muscle protein turnover. In myotubes, overexpression of either coactivator increased protein content by decreasing overall protein degradation without altering protein synthesis rates. Elevated PGC-1α or PGC-1β also prevented the acceleration of proteolysis induced by starvation or FoxO transcription factors and prevented the induction of autophagy and atrophy-specific ubiquitin ligases by a constitutively active FoxO3. In mouse muscles, overexpression of PGC-1β (like PGC-1α) inhibited denervation atrophy, ubiquitin ligase induction, and transcription by NFκB. However, increasing muscle PGC-1α levels pharmacologically by treatment of mice with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside failed to block loss of muscle mass or induction of ubiquitin ligases upon denervation atrophy, although it prevented loss of mitochondria. This capacity of PGC-1α and PGC-1β to inhibit FoxO3 and NFκB actions and proteolysis helps explain how exercise prevents muscle atrophy.

This capacity of PGC-1α and PGC-1β to inhibit FoxO3 and NFκB actions and proteolysis helps explain how exercise prevents muscle atrophy. The mass of a muscle and its functional capacity are determined by the balance between rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation. The rapid, debilitating loss of muscle that occurs upon inactivity, nerve damage, and in many systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes, cancer, sepsis, or renal failure) is characterized by an increased rate of protein degradation (1Lecker S.H.

Many of these genes are induced by the FoxO family of transcription factors (5Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L.

Although activation of the NFκB pathway is sufficient to induce muscle wasting (11Cai D. Frantz J.D. Tawa N.E. Melendez P.A. Oh B.C. Lidov H.G. Hasselgren P.O. Frontera W.R. Lee J. Glass D.J.

FASEB J. 2009; 23: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), its precise role and the factors that control its activity in muscle are still poorly understood. Despite appreciable recent progress in understanding the biochemical basis of atrophy, no pharmaceutical agents are available to inhibit this highly debilitating process. Exercise can protect against disuse atrophy as well as various systemic types of muscle wasting (13Wehling M. Cai B. Tidball J.G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Adams G.R. Haddad F. Bodell P.W. Tran P.D. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl.

Nutr. 2003; 6: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms by which contractile activity reduces atrophy remain unclear. In principle, contractile activity may somehow enhance protein synthesis, suppress overall protein breakdown, and/or block the atrophy-related transcriptional program. Understanding exactly how exercise protects against atrophy may suggest novel means to inhibit the loss of muscle mass in bed-ridden individuals when exercise is impractical or impossible. Such information may lead to improved rehabilitation methods and allow restoration of muscle function in many disease states or in the frail (sarcopenic) elderly.

The two homologous family members, PGC-1α and PGC-1β, are potent coactivators of gene transcription, although they lack DNA-binding activity. Instead, they dock on transcription factors such as ERRα, PPARα, or NRF-1 and influence their function. The expression of PGC-1α in muscle increases acutely and chronically with exercise (17Goto M.

Importantly, overexpression of PGC-1α in adult muscle fibers reduces the capacity of denervation, fasting, and even activated FoxO3 to cause rapid fiber atrophy (16Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C.

Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α in muscle was shown to both extend lifespan and prevent the muscle wasting characteristic of aged mice (24Wenz T. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L.

Because protein degradation increases markedly during various types of rapid atrophy, and overexpression of PGC-1α can inhibit muscle wasting, it seemed likely that PGC-1α and perhaps PGC-1β can inhibit overall protein degradation. One major goal of this study was to test this hypothesis and to examine the alternative possibility that these coactivators might enhance rates of protein synthesis in muscle. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium green fluorescent protein Hanks' balanced salt solution internal ribosomal entry site constitutively active FoxO3 tibialis anterior nuclear respiratory factor-1.

One pharmacological agent that increases PGC-1α content is 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase and other AMP-sensitive enzymes. AICAR, which has been used in human clinical trials and in experimental studies (25Cuthbertson D.J. Babraj J.A. Mustard K.J. Towler M.C. Green K.A. Wackerhage H. Leese G.P. Baar K. Thomason-Hughes M.

Mice treated with AICAR for many days or weeks have increased resistance to fatigue upon running (26Narkar V.A. Downes M. Yu R.T. Embler E. Wang Y.X. Banayo E. Mihaylova M.M. Nelson M.C. Zou Y.

Physiol. 2003; 95: 960-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which presumably causes these effects. On the other hand, AICAR may potentially exacerbate atrophy, because AICAR treatment of cultured myotubes for 1 day or less has been reported to induce Atrogin1 and MuRF1 expression, activate protein degradation, and induce loss of protein (32Nakashima K. Yakabe Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1650-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33Krawiec B.J. Nystrom G.J. Frost R.A. Jefferson L.S. Lang C.H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E1555-E1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such reports seem inconsistent with the ability of PGC-1α to retard atrophy in vivo (16Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W.

Therefore, we investigated whether treatment with AICAR, by raising levels of PGC-1α, might be a useful approach to inhibit muscle wasting in vivo. Such studies are also of interest because of the possibility that control of mitochondrial content and function are linked to the proper regulation of skeletal muscle mass (16Sandri M. Lin J. Handschin C. Yang W. Arany Z.P. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16260-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 24Wenz T. Rossi S.G.

In fact, loss of mitochondria and therefore endurance appears to be an important but poorly characterized component of muscle atrophy that would be valuable to block pharmacologically. The primary goals of this study were to examine 1) whether PGC-1α and its much less studied homolog PGC-1β actually influence muscle mass through effects on rates of protein synthesis or breakdown in skeletal muscle and 2) whether overexpression of PGC-1β or AICAR treatment can protect against denervation (disuse) atrophy in vivo when muscles lose mitochondrial content. Using both myotubes in culture and adult mouse muscles, we demonstrate that overexpression of PGC-1α or PGC-1β can enhance growth of myotubes and inhibit atrophy of adult muscles by slowing protein degradation and blocking the activation of proteolysis by FoxO3. However, raising levels of PGC-1α with AICAR fails to prevent atrophy, though it still may yield the physiological benefits of increased mitochondrial content. C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Myoblasts were differentiated to myotubes and subsequently maintained in low serum media (DMEM plus 2% horse serum) as described previously (34Sacheck J.M. Ohtsuka A. McLary S.C. Goldberg A.L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E591-E601Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Infection with adenoviruses expressing PGC-1α, PGC-1β, or GFP was on the third or fourth day with differentiation medium, when myotubes were fully formed. For those cultures that were infected with a second adenovirus (caFoxO3 or GFP), the first virus was removed from the myotubes at 24 h, the cells were washed once, and the second virus was added in fresh differentiation medium. The adenoviruses expressing GFP, PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and caFoxO3 have been described previously (5Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H.

Then, cells were washed, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The total protein was measured using Coomassie Plus (Pierce). Protein synthesis was expressed as [3H]tyrosine incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble proteins per microgram of protein. As in our prior studies, long-lived cell proteins were labeled with l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine (4 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24–28 h (7Zhao J. Brault J.J. Schild A. Cao P. Sandri M. Schiaffino S.

The cells were washed and infected with adenoviruses in chase medium (DMEM plus 2% horse serum) plus high amounts of nonradioactive tyrosine (2 mm) to limit reincorporation of the [3H]tyrosine. This chase also allows degradation of short-lived proteins. Starting 48 h after infection, the cells were washed and fresh chase media were added. Aliquots of culture medium were taken at specified times for quantitation of [3H]tyrosine release. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) and pelleted. Radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble supernatant was measured using liquid scintillation counting. At the end of the chase period, cells were solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured. Total radioactivity is the sum of the residual radioactivity in the cells and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivities at different time points. Protein breakdown was expressed as [3H]tyrosine released over time as a percentage of total [3H]tyrosine incorporated. These rates of breakdown of long-lived proteins were highly linear for at least 4 h. Proteasomal and lysosomal proteolysis rates were determined precisely as done before (7Zhao J. Brault J.J.

The following day, the medium was shifted to differentiation medium to induce myotube formation. Three days later, myotubes were infected with GFP, PGC-1α, or PGC-1β adenovirus. One day later, the medium containing the first adenoviruses was removed, the cells were washed, and fresh media containing GFP or caFoxO3 adenoviruses was added. Twenty-four hours later, myotubes were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer and analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). To control for transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase activity was divided by Renilla luciferase activity. Myotubes or muscles were homogenized on ice in a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2. Then, total protein was measured using Coomassie Plus (Pierce). Citrate synthase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 30 °C as done by Srere (35Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2029) Google Scholar), and succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured at 37 °C as done by Green and Narahara (36Green J.D. Narahara H.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Muscles were homogenized with a Polytron in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Total protein was measured using a BCA Protein or Coomassie Plus Assay Kit (Pierce). Then, equal amounts of total protein per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were obtained from Abcam (β-actin, NRF-1, and succinate dehydrogenase), BD Pharmingen (cytochrome c), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (F1-ATPase and PGC-1α), Dr. Stewart Lecker (Atrogin1) (37Bdolah Y.

Secondary antibodies were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Band intensities were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). After anesthesia, hair was removed, and the skin disinfected from the lateral surface of the hind limb. A small (<5 mm) incision was made in the skin approximately mid-femur. With blunt dissection, the sciatic nerve was exposed, and a 2-mm section was removed. The skin was closed with surgical glue (Vet Bond). Tibialis anterior muscles of adult male CD1 mice (28–32 g) were transfected by electroporation of plasmids precisely as described previously (5Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E.

In many experiments, denervation was performed at the same time as the electroporation. Muscles were analyzed 5 or 10 days later. No gross evidence for necrosis or inflammation as a result of the transfection procedure was noted. To determine the effects on muscle fiber size, 30 μg of PGC-1β-IRES-GFP plasmid was injected. This plasmid was constructed by mutating the PGC-1β plasmid using PCR to add an XmaI restriction site just prior to the Kozak sequence and a NotI restriction site just prior to the STOP codon. After restriction digest, this PGC-1β sequence was inserted into the pIRES-hrGFPII plasmid (Stratagene). The coding region was sequenced to confirm proper insertion. In reporter experiments, 10 μg of the expression vector (PGC-1α, PGC-1β, or GFP) with 10 μg of the 3.5-kb Atrogin1 promoter reporter construct (5Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E.

Luminescence measurements in muscles transfected with reporter constructs were performed similarly to those done in myotubes, except that the harvested muscles were manually homogenized in lysis buffer. Tibialis anterior muscles transfected with PGC-1β-IRES-GFP plasmids were cryosectioned (10 μm), and then the transverse sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescent images were collected in the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School. Using ImageJ, cross-sectional areas were measured in fibers expressing GFP and in an equal number of non-transfected fibers from the same muscle as we have done previously (5Sandri M. Sandri C.

AICAR (Toronto Research Chemical, Inc.) was prepared fresh daily in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (1 g of AICAR/20 ml). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 mg of AICAR/kg of body weight/day for 2 weeks. Then, the muscles of one hind limb were denervated. AICAR treatment was continued for an additional 2 weeks until the muscles were collected. Therefore, muscles were treated with AICAR for a total of 4 weeks. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using paired Student's t test (for comparisons of only denervated versus innervated muscles) or analysis of variance (for multiple comparisons) followed by the Tukey's honestly significant difference procedure, where appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered significantly different. To test if PGC-1α or its close homolog, PGC1-β, can influence muscle growth, protein synthesis, or protein degradation, differentiated C2C12 myotubes were infected with adenoviruses expressing either coactivator.

https://openalex.org/W1976923074,"Background Besides its well-established role in nerve cell survival and adaptive plasticity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also involved in energy homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation. Although BDNF is present in the systemic circulation, it is unknown whether plasma BDNF correlates with circulating markers of dysregulated metabolism and an adverse cardiovascular profile. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine whether circulating BDNF correlates with indices of metabolic and cardiovascular health, we measured plasma BDNF levels in 496 middle-age and elderly subjects (mean age ∼70), in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Linear regression analysis revealed that plasma BDNF is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, regardless of age. In females, BDNF was positively correlated with BMI, fat mass, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and inversely correlated with folate. In males, BDNF was positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, free thiiodo-thyronine (FT3), and bioavailable testosterone, and inversely correlated with sex-hormone binding globulin, and adiponectin. Conclusion/Significance Plasma BDNF significantly correlates with multiple risk factors for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular dysfunction. Whether BDNF contributes to the pathogenesis of these disorders or functions in adaptive responses to cellular stress (as occurs in the brain) remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1999488124,"Four sequential Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) eventually failing azole-echinocandin combination therapy were investigated. The first two isolates (1 and 2) were susceptible to antifungal azoles, but increased itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole MICs were found for the last two isolates (3 and 4). Microsatellite typing showed that the 4 isolates were isogenic, suggesting that resistance had been acquired during azole treatment of the patient. An immunocompromised mouse model confirmed that the in vitro resistance corresponded with treatment failure. Mice challenged with the resistant isolate 4 failed to respond to posaconazole therapy, while those infected by susceptible isolate 2 responded. Posaconazole-anidulafungin combination therapy was effective in mice challenged with isolate 4. No mutations were found in the Cyp51A gene of the four isolates. However, expression experiments of the Cyp51A showed that the expression was increased in the resistant isolates, compared to the azole-susceptible isolates. The microscopic morphology of the four isolates was similar, but a clear alteration in radial growth and a significantly reduced growth rate of the resistant isolates on solid and in broth medium was observed compared to isolates 1 and 2 and to unrelated wild-type controls. In the mouse model the virulence of isolates 3 and 4 was reduced compared to the susceptible ones and to wild-type controls. For the first time, the acquisition of azole resistance despite azole-echinocandin combination therapy is described in a CGD patient and the resistance demonstrated to be directly associated with significant change of virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2020711392,"A rapid and accurate method to detect and quantify Leishmania parasite is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of Leishmaniasis and monitoring of antileishmania therapy. In this study, real-time assay was applied to estimate parasite load in clinical samples of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients. The mean parasite load in blood of VL patients (n = 31) was 8,372 parasites/ml, while the mean parasite load in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) was 194,962 parasites/million nucleated cells (n = 12). Parasite load was undetectable after treatment with amphotericin B (n = 9) in VL, while a residual parasite burden was detected in 2 of 6 patients following treatment with sodium antimony gluconate. Further, circulating levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 were analysed in VL patients (n = 29) by Cytometric Bead Array to evaluate correlation with parasitic load. Interestingly, IL-10 levels correlated significantly with parasite load (r = 0.82, P<0.0001). The mean parasite load in dermal lesions of PKDL patients was 9,502 parasites/µg tissue DNA at pre-treatment stage (n = 25), with no detectable parasites after therapy (n = 5). Parasite burden was distinctly higher (P<0.0001) in nodular lesions (n = 12) (19,586 parasites/µg tissue DNA) compared to papular/macular lesions (n = 13, 193 parasites/µg tissue DNA). Further, chronic PKDL lesions showed significantly (P = 0.0166) higher parasite load in comparison with acute lesions. Results indicate that chronic, nodular cases constitute the major parasite reservoir for anthroponotic transmission. Our results establish that the high parasite load in VL is strongly correlated with a high level of IL-10, implicating IL-10 as a marker of disease severity. The assay is applicable for diagnosis as well as prognosis of both VL and PKDL, providing a simple molecular tool to monitor the efficacy of antileishmanial drugs or vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2020435230,"Pannexin 3 (Panx3) is a new member of the gap junction pannexin family, but its expression profiles and physiological function are not yet clear. We demonstrate in this study that Panx3 is expressed in cartilage and regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Panx3 mRNA was expressed in the prehypertrophic zone in the developing growth plate and was induced during the differentiation of chondrogenic ATDC5 and N1511 cells. Panx3-transfected ATDC5 and N1511 cells promoted chondrogenic differentiation, but the suppression of endogenous Panx3 inhibited differentiation of ATDC5 cells and primary chondrocytes. Panx3-transfected ATDC5 cells reduced parathyroid hormone-induced cell proliferation and promoted the release of ATP into the extracellular space, possibly by action of Panx3 as a hemichannel. Panx3 expression in ATDC5 cells reduced intracellular cAMP levels and the activation of cAMP-response element-binding, a protein kinase A downstream effector. These Panx3 activities were blocked by anti-Panx3 antibody. Our results suggest that Panx3 functions to switch the chondrocyte cell fate from proliferation to differentiation by regulating the intracellular ATP/cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1966878363,"Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) has potent antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that ERbeta-selective agonists might be a new class of therapeutic and chemopreventive agents. To understand how ERbeta regulates genes, we identified genes regulated by the unliganded and liganded forms of ERalpha and ERbeta in U2OS cells. Microarray data demonstrated that virtually no gene regulation occurred with unliganded ERalpha, whereas many genes were regulated by estradiol (E(2)). These results demonstrated that ERalpha requires a ligand to regulate a single class of genes. In contrast, ERbeta regulated three classes of genes. Class I genes were regulated primarily by unliganded ERbeta. Class II genes were regulated only with E(2), whereas class III genes were regulated by both unliganded ERbeta and E(2). There were 453 class I genes, 258 class II genes, and 83 class III genes. To explore the mechanism whereby ERbeta regulates different classes of genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing was performed to identify ERbeta binding sites and adjacent transcription factor motifs in regulated genes. AP1 binding sites were more enriched in class I genes, whereas ERE, NFkappaB1, and SP1 sites were more enriched in class II genes. ERbeta bound to all three classes of genes, demonstrating that ERbeta binding is not responsible for differential regulation of genes by unliganded and liganded ERbeta. The coactivator NCOA2 was differentially recruited to several target genes. Our findings indicate that the unliganded and liganded forms of ERbeta regulate three classes of genes by interacting with different transcription factors and coactivators."
https://openalex.org/W2078538657,"Versican/PG-M is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix, which is transiently expressed in mesenchymal condensation areas during tissue morphogenesis. Here, we generated versican conditional knock-out mice Prx1-Cre/Vcan(flox/flox), in which Vcan is pruned out by site-specific Cre recombinase driven by the Prx1 promoter. Although Prx1-Cre/Vcan(flox/flox) mice are viable and fertile, they develop distorted digits. Histological analysis of newborn mice reveals hypertrophic chondrocytic nodules in cartilage, tilting of the joint, and a slight delay of chondrocyte differentiation in digits. By immunostaining, whereas the joint interzone of Prx1-Cre/Vcan(+/+) shows an accumulation of TGF-beta, concomitant with versican, that of Prx1-Cre/Vcan(flox/flox) without versican expression exhibits a decreased incorporation of TGF-beta. In a micromass culture system of mesenchymal cells from limb bud, whereas TGF-beta and versican are co-localized in the perinodular regions of developing cartilage in Prx1-Cre/Vcan(+/+), TGF-beta is widely distributed in Prx1-Cre/Vcan(flox/flox). These results suggest that versican facilitates chondrogenesis and joint morphogenesis, by localizing TGF-beta in the extracellular matrix and regulating its signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2027128931,"The collagen framework of hyaline cartilages, including articular cartilage, consists largely of type II collagen that matures from a cross-linked heteropolymeric fibril template of types II, IX, and XI collagens. In the articular cartilages of adult joints, type III collagen makes an appearance in varying amounts superimposed on the original collagen fibril network. In a study to understand better the structural role of type III collagen in cartilage, we find that type III collagen molecules with unprocessed N-propeptides are present in the extracellular matrix of adult human and bovine articular cartilages as covalently cross-linked polymers extensively cross-linked to type II collagen. Cross-link analyses revealed that telopeptides from both N and C termini of type III collagen were linked in the tissue to helical cross-linking sites in type II collagen. Reciprocally, telopeptides from type II collagen were recovered cross-linked to helical sites in type III collagen. Cross-linked peptides were also identified in which a trifunctional pyridinoline linked both an alpha1(II) and an alpha1(III) telopeptide to the alpha1(III) helix. This can only have arisen from a cross-link between three different collagen molecules, types II and III in register staggered by 4D from another type III molecule. Type III collagen is known to be prominent at sites of healing and repair in skin and other tissues. The present findings emphasize the role of type III collagen, which is synthesized in mature articular cartilage, as a covalent modifier that may add cohesion to a weakened, existing collagen type II fibril network as part of a chondrocyte healing response to matrix damage."

Here, we have identified a protease-resistant core in wild-type as well as fALS-causing mutant SOD1 aggregates. Three different regions within an SOD1 sequence are found as building blocks for the formation of an aggregate core, and fALS-causing mutations modulate interactions among these three regions to form a distinct core, namely SOD1 aggregates exhibit mutation-dependent structural polymorphism, which further regulates biochemical properties of aggregates such as solubility.

Misfolding of a protein molecule often causes its insoluble aggregation, and formation of inclusion bodies containing protein aggregates is a major pathological change in conformational diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders (1.Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5136) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has suggested that structures/morphologies of protein aggregates affect disease phenotypes and that polymorphism of protein aggregates associates with phenotypic heterogeneity (2.Bruce M.E.

Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). SOD1 knock-out mice, however, show no fALS-like phenotypes, suggesting that an enzymatic role of SOD1 makes a minor contribution to neurodegeneration (9.Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K.

Instead, SOD1 has been considered to gain toxic properties by fALS mutations, and one of those is the increased propensity of protein misfolding and aggregation (10.Bruijn L.I. Miller T.M.

Lindberg M. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Brain. 2006; 129: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A pathogenic consequence common to all fALS mutations in SOD1 has hence been proposed to increase an intracellular fraction of a metal-free SOD1 without a disulfide (apo-SOD1SH), which is the most aggregation-prone state (13.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. O'Halloran T.V. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24167-24176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Overall structures of SOD1 appear to be preserved even after demetallation and disulfide reduction, but a significant structural disorder in the loop regions has been identified in soluble apo-SOD1SH (16.Hörnberg A. Logan D.T. Marklund S.L. Oliveberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Such increased mobility of the loop regions in the apo-SOD1SH state has been considered to promote non-native interactions between SOD1s (17.Teilum K. Smith M.H. Schulz E. Christensen L.C. Solomentsev G. Oliveberg M. Akke M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18273-18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), possibly leading to insoluble aggregation. During the aggregate formation, apo-SOD1SH has been predicted to undergo drastic structural changes, which include three-dimensional rearrangement of β-sheets called domain swapping (18.Khare S.D. Wilcox K.C. Gong P. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins. 2005; 61: 617-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, there is little experimental evidence to unveil the structure(s) that an SOD1 molecule adopts in the insoluble aggregates. In addition, less attention has been paid so far on any possible differences in structural properties among SOD1 aggregates with different fALS mutations. Given that aggregate polymorphism associates with different disease phenotypes in the other neurodegenerative disorders such as prion diseases (2.Bruce M.E. Fraser H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 172: 125-138PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), an assumption on a “mutation-independent” structure of SOD1 aggregates should now be carefully examined; indeed, phenotypic heterogeneity has been reported in fALS patients with different SOD1 mutations (19.Andersen P.M. Nilsson P. Keränen M.L. Forsgren L. Hägglund J. Karlsborg M. Ronnevi L.O. Gredal O. Marklund S.L. Brain. 1997; 120: 1723-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study, we have experimentally identified a protease-resistant core structure in the SOD1 aggregates and found that three different regions (amino acids 1–30, 90–120, and 135–153) within an SOD1 primary sequence form a scaffold of a core in the aggregates. Interestingly, fALS mutations in SOD1 can modulate interactions of those three scaffold regions in a core structure, which produces mutation-dependent structural polymorphism of SOD1 aggregates. Furthermore, such mutation-dependent core structures lead to distinct morphological and biochemical properties of fALS-mutant SOD1 aggregates. Based upon this study, we propose a new pathomechanism of fALS in which mutation-dependent structures of SOD1 aggregates can affect the disease phenotypes. WT and fALS-mutant SOD1 cDNA were cloned in a multiple cloning site of a plasmid, pET15b (Novagen), using NdeI and SalI sites, where a SalI site is introduced between BamHI and Bpu1102I sites. SOD1 proteins were obtained as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, Rosetta, transformed with the above plasmid after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 6 h and purified using Proteus Midi IMAC (Pro-Chem Inc.) in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Purified SOD1 proteins were refolded by 100-fold dilution in a buffer containing 100 mm Na-Pi, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (NNE buffer), with 5 mm DTT and stirred at 4 °C overnight. Refolded protein samples were concentrated and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. Protein concentration was spectroscopically determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (5,500 cm−1 m−1 of an extinction coefficient). An N-terminal His tag in SOD1 was removed by treatment with thrombin immobilized with agarose (Calbiochem) in an NNE buffer at 37 °C at 100 rpm for an hour. After removal of immobilized thrombin by filtration and ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min, the protein concentration in a supernatant fraction was checked spectroscopically. Removal of a His tag was confirmed by SDS-PAGE as well as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). To examine aggregation of SOD1 proteins, 100 μm SOD1 in an NNE buffer containing 5 mm DTT was set in a 96-well plate and shaken at 37 °C at 1,200 rpm. Turbidity was monitored in a plate reader (ARVO MX, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by measuring the absorbance around 405 nm. SOD1-insoluble aggregates were obtained as a pellet fraction after ultracentrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 110,000 × g for 30 min (supplemental Fig. S1H). For the analysis of ThT fluorescence, SOD1 aggregates were resuspended in water with ultrasonication, and aliquots were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (supplemental Fig. S2A); thereby we can estimate SOD1 concentration (at a monomer basis) in aggregates. Using a 96-well plate, 3 μm SOD1 aggregates were then mixed with 25 μm ThT in an NNE buffer, and the fluorescence was measured in a plate reader (ARVO MX) with a CW lamp filter (440-nm cutoff) and an emission filter (486-nm cutoff). To examine temperature dependence of solubility of SOD1 aggregates, 30 μm SOD1 aggregates were prepared in an NNE buffer containing 5 mm DTT and 1% Sarkosyl and incubated at either 37, 60, 80, or 100 °C for an hour. After ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min, a supernatant fraction was saved, and a pellet fraction was further redissolved in an NNE buffer with 2% SDS. Both fractions were then mixed with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5 mm TCEP, boiled, and loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and intensity of SOD1 bands was analyzed by an ImageJ software. Band intensities of soluble and insoluble fractions are denoted as Is and Ii, respectively, and the fraction solubilized, F (%), is calculated as Is/(Is + Ii) × 100. F is then plotted against incubation temperature, T, and estimation of T½ was performed by fitting the data (Fig. 5C) with a sigmoidal function using Igor Pro version 4.0 (Wavemetrics) as shown in Equation 1,F=1001+exp⁡(−T−T1/2a)(Eq. 1) where a is a coefficient. Experiments were repeated three times to estimate errors. To observe fibrillar morphologies of SOD1 aggregates with an electron microscope, we performed seeding reactions of SOD1 fibrillation, which can avoid shearing fibrils, namely 10 μm SOD1 aggregates were mixed with 100 μm soluble SOD1 and left at 37 °C for 3 days. Insoluble pellets were then collected by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in water. SOD1 aggregates were adsorbed on 400-mesh grids coated by a glow-charged supporting membrane. After washed with pure water, negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate was performed. Images were obtained using an electron microscope (1200EX, JEOL). The width of a fibrillar structure was measured using a Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe), and 10 different fibrils were examined to estimate errors. 22.5 μg of SOD1 aggregates were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, mixed with 5 μg of Pronase (Calbiochem) and incubated at 37 °C for an hour. After ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed once with 150 μl of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The final pellets were redissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 8.0, and desalted using NuTip C-18 (Glygen Co.). α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was chosen as a matrix, and MALDI-MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using a 4800plus MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Identification of peptides based upon the observed m/z values was performed using PAWS software (ProteoMetrics). For modifications of SOD1 aggregates with Alexa555, 60 μm SOD1 aggregate was mixed with 300 μm Alexa555 in an NNE buffer containing 5 mm TCEP and incubated at room temperature for an hour in the dark. After ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min, the pellets were washed once with an NNE buffer and resuspended and sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 4 m urea. Modifications of soluble SOD1 with Alexa555 were also performed by incubating 60 μm SOD1 with 300 μm Alexa555 in an NNE buffer containing 5 mm TCEP. Followed by addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid, which quenches the modification reaction, the sample solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were washed once with acetone and redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 4 m urea. To identify the modification sites in SOD1, 4.5 μg of soluble or aggregated SOD1 with or without Alexa555 modification was incubated with 0.1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 4 m urea. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for an hour, desalted/purified with NuTip C-18, and analyzed by a 4800plus MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer. Although a chemical structure of Alexa555-C2-maleimide has not been available, we determined its mass (m/z 955.3, monoisotopic) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

End-stage was determined by hindlimb paralysis so severe that the mouse could not right itself within 20 s when placed on its side, an end point frequently used for the mutant SOD1-expressing mice (20.Boillée S.

Detergent extraction of SOD1 aggregates from these murine lumbar spinal cords was performed as reported previously (23.Shaw B.F. Lelie H.L. Durazo A. Nersissian A.M. Xu G. Chan P.K. Gralla E.B.

In short, spinal cords were homogenized in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove initial debris. 1:10 volume of TEN buffer with 10% Nonidet P-40 was then added to the supernatant, which was further sonicated and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant pellets were resuspended and sonicated in TEN buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate and then ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min. Final pellets from lumbar spinal cords were resuspended and sonicated in 100 μl of pure water per mouse. Out of a total of 100 μl, 20 μl was used for Pronase digestion experiments, and 6 μl was used for solubility assay in the presence of 1% Sarkosyl. As shown in our recent studies (13.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. O'Halloran T.V. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24167-24176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), SOD1 forms fibrillar aggregates only when copper and zinc ions as well as a disulfide bond are absent (i.e. apo-SOD1SH). To prepare SOD1 fibrillar aggregates, 100 μm soluble apo-SOD1SH was agitated at 1,200 rpm at 37 °C, and the aggregation reaction was monitored by the increase of solution turbidity (see WT in supplemental Fig. S1D). After the turbidity change reached a plateau, a sample solution was separated by ultracentrifugation into supernatant and pellets. SOD1 was detected only in the pellet fraction (see WT in supplemental Fig. S1H), showing that all SOD1 molecules were converted into insoluble aggregates. Furthermore, SOD1-insoluble aggregates increase the ThT fluorescence (see WT in supplemental Fig. S2C) and red-shift the electronic absorption spectrum of Congo Red (supplemental Fig. S2D), both of which are typical tinctorial changes to indicate amyloid-like fibrillar structures in protein aggregates. These data thus confirm that apo-SOD1SH forms amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. In general, protein fibrillar aggregates are composed of protease-resistant “core” and the associated “fuzzy coat” that is a susceptible region for proteolysis (24.Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thøgersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Milstein C. Roth M. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). We next attempted to identify which region(s) of an SOD1 amino acid sequence constitutes the protease-resistant core of SOD1 fibrillar aggregates. Apo-SOD1SH aggregates prepared above were treated with a nonspecific protease, Pronase, to digest and remove the fuzzy coat regions, and the remaining insoluble pellets obtained by ultracentrifugation were supposed to be a protease-resistant core of SOD1 aggregates. Insoluble pellets after Pronase treatment were then solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and mass peaks were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S3A); in contrast, no mass peaks were observed (m/z 1500–30,000, data not shown) when experiments were done in soluble apo-SOD1SH. Based upon the observed mass with MS/MS analysis (supplemental Table S1), the peptides resistant to Pronase treatment are identified and mapped on an SOD1 primary sequence (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1A, multiple peptides are concentrated in one N-terminal (Ala1–Lys30, region A) and two C-terminal (Asp90–His120, region B; Thr135–Gln153, region C) regions. Soluble SOD1 has a three-dimensional structure with an immunoglobulin-fold comprising eight β-sheets, among which β1, β2, β6, β7, and β8 are involved in the formation of a core structure upon aggregation (Fig. 1B). To further test if these three regions are responsible for SOD1 aggregation, four overlapping SOD1 peptide fragments N-terminally fused with a His6 tag were prepared (Fig. 1A) as follows: Ala1–Ala55 (ex1–2), Glu24–Arg79 (ex2–3), Gly56–Val118 (ex3–4), and His80–Gln153 (ex4–5). Ex1–2 and ex4–5 peptides become insoluble after overnight agitation at 1,200 rpm, whereas ex2–3 and ex3–4 peptides remain in a supernatant fraction (Fig. 1C). Insoluble pellets of ex1–2 and ex4–5 but not a soluble form of these peptides increased the intensity of ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1D). By using an electron microscope, we have confirmed fibrillar morphology of ex1–2 and ex4–5 aggregates with ∼9 nm of its width (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken these results together, we have revealed that non-native interactions among regions A–C form a core structure of SOD1 fibrillar aggregates. We next asked whether pathogenic mutations affect a molecular structure of SOD1 aggregates. As performed in WT SOD1, aggregates of mutant SOD1 were prepared by constant agitation of 100 μm mutant apo-SOD1SH, and its aggregation reaction was monitored by the increase of solution turbidity (supplemental Fig. S1, D–G). Interestingly, not all of fALS mutations accelerate the reaction of aggregate formation. Given that SOD1 aggregation is significantly suppressed by the presence of copper and zinc ions as well as a disulfide bond (13.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. O'Halloran T.V. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24167-24176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), aggregation kinetics of apo-SOD1SH examined here (supplemental Fig. S1, D–G) will not correctly reflect that of SOD1 in the cellular environment where metal ions and disulfide bond could be introduced into mutant SOD1. Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize here that all mutant SOD1 proteins were eventually converted to insoluble aggregates when the turbidity change reached a plateau (supplemental Fig. S1H). We have further confirmed the amyloid-like properties of mutant SOD1 aggregates by ThT fluorescence assay. After quantification of SOD1 aggregates by an SDS-PAGE analysis (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), equal amounts of SOD1 aggregates were mixed with ThT (supplemental Fig. S2C). Although soluble SOD1 proteins showed no significant ThT fluorescence, all SOD1 aggregates tested here increased the intensity of ThT fluorescence, suggesting amyloid-like fibrillar structures in SOD1 aggregates. Furthermore, it is of note that each mutant SOD1 aggregate exhibits a distinct degree of the increase in the ThT fluorescence intensity (supplemental Fig. S2C). Given that the detailed mechanism of ThT binding to aggregates remains poorly understood, a molecular structure of the aggregate can hardly be inferred only from its ThT fluorescence intensity. These results, however, imply that each fALS-mutant SOD1 forms an insoluble aggregate with distinct structural/biochemical properties. To reveal mutational effects on a molecular structure of aggregated SOD1, we have again identified Pronase-resistant core structures in fALS-mutant SOD1 aggregates by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S3, B–K and supplemental Table S1). As summarized in Fig. 2, all mutant SOD1 aggregates contain an N-terminal region (region A) as a core structure, suggesting its primary role in SOD1 aggregation. This is consistent with a previous study showing that an SOD1 fragment from Ala1 to Lys36 fused C-terminally with a yellow fluorescent protein forms aggregates in chick embryo spinal cord neural cells (25.Ghadge G.D. Wang L. Sharma K. Monti A.L. Bindokas V. Stevens F.J. Roos R.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 21: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to such a common feature to all fALS-mutant SOD1s tested here, we noticed that a core structure in the aggregate is distinct among different fALS-mutant SOD1s and is classified into four types (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Type I includes WT and L144F, in which regions A–C include a core of aggregates. In A4V and G37R, which form type II aggregate, a core region is composed of regions A and C, but region B is not involved. G41D, G41S, and H46R can also be categorized as type II, in which the numbers of Pronase-resistant peptides covering region B were much less detected than those in the other types. Type III (G85R and G93R) shows a similar peptide map to type I, but a more extended C-terminal region participates in the formation of a core structure. In type IV (L126X and I149T), regions A and B but not C form a core in the aggregates. Although there may be more subtypes in the structural classification of SOD1 aggregates, our results have, for the first time, shown that fALS mutations can modulate non-native interactions among regions A–C to form distinct core structures in different mutant SOD1 aggregates.TABLE 1Properties of SOD1 aggregates are dependent upon fALS mutationsTypeWidth of fibrilsT½Average onset of diseaseaData are from Ref. 32.Average duration of diseaseaData are from Ref. 32.nm°CageyearsWTI7.7 ± 1.157 ± 3.2A4VII3.3 ± 0.448 ± 5.847.71.2G37RII3.1 ± 0.353 ± 1.936.917.0G41DIINDbData were not determined.63 ± 1.845.214.1G41SII3.0 ± 0.463 ± 1.847.91.0H46RIIND52 ± 2.745.617.6G85RIIIND60 ± 4.455.56.0G93RIII4.3 ± 0.462 ± 3.035.05.3L126XIV11 ± 1.143 ± 0.142.0cData are from Ref. 31.3.8cData are from Ref. 31.L144FI8.3 ± 1.468 ± 1.454.611.8I149TIV10 ± 0.942 ± 0.937.62.7a Data are from Ref. 32.Wang Q.

Open table in a new tab We have also characterized Pronase-resistant peptides in the SOD1 aggregates extracted from lumbar spinal cords of transgenic mice expressing human SOD1 with G37R, G85R, and G93A mutations (supplemental Fig. S3, L–O). It is confirmed that regions A and C are involved in the core of all three in vivo SOD1 aggregates (SOD1G37R, SOD1G85R, and SOD1G93A in Fig. 2). In addition, a few peptides covering region B have been detected as aggregate core regions in in vivo SOD1G85R and SOD1G93A but not in in vivo SOD1G37R (Fig. 2). It is notable that no involvement of region B in the Pronase-resistant core is also characteristic of the in vitro G37R aggregates (see G37R in Fig. 2). Although maps of Pronase-resistant peptides are not precisely the same between in vitro and in vivo SOD1 aggregates, our results support some resemblance in the core regions between in vivo and in vitro SOD1 aggregates. To get further insight into mutation-dependent structural polymorphism of SOD1 aggregates, we have tested reactivity of four Cys residues (Cys6, Cys57, Cys111, and Cys146) in soluble and aggregated SOD1 proteins toward chemical modifications. Compared with Cys residues in a fuzzy coat of aggregates, we suppose that Cys residues buried in an aggregate core are less reactive toward a thiol-specific modifier, Alexa Fluor 555-C2 maleimide (Alexa555), because of possible steric hindrance. Soluble or aggregated SOD1 with or without Alexa555 modifications was incubated in a buffer containing 4 m urea and 5 mm TCEP, where SOD1 aggregates are redissolved and any disulfide bonds are reduced. These SOD1 samples were then digested by lysyl endopeptidase and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among the mass peaks obtained, we have noted four proteolytic fragments, in particular Ala4–Lys23 (m/z 2115.1, monoisotopic, 2143.2 for A4V), Gly37–Lys70 (m/z 3592.9, average, 3692.1 for G37R), His71–Lys122 (m/z 5479.0, average), and Thr137–Gln153 (m/z 1587.8, monoisotopic, 1575.8 for I149T), for identification of Alexa555 modification at Cys6, Cys57, Cys111, and Cys146, respectively. Alexa555 modification adds 955.3 Da to the mass of the corresponding peptide. In soluble WT SOD1, mass peaks derived from the Alexa555-modified peptides (Gly37–Lys70, His71–Lys122, and Thr137–Gln153) were observed (left panels in Fig. 3, B–D), indicating that Alexa555 can access Cys57, Cys111, and Cys146. L126X, which is a truncated SOD1 at Leu126, does not produce a Thr137–Gln153 peptide (left panel in Fig. 3D). When WT SOD1 forms aggregates, the Alexa555-modified peptide spanning from Thr137 to Gln153 was no longer observed"
https://openalex.org/W1965286369,"Background Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have been implicated in diverse pathological settings including diabetes, inflammation and acute ischemia/reperfusion injury in the heart. AGEs interact with the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and transduce signals through activation of MAPKs and proapoptotic pathways. In the current study, adult cardiomyocytes were studied in an in vitro ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury model to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying RAGE-mediated injury due to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Methodology/Principal Findings Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult wild-type (WT), homozygous RAGE-null (RKO), and WT mice treated with soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were subjected to hypoxia for 30 minutes alone or followed by reoxygenation for 1 hour. In specific experiments, RAGE ligand carboxymethyllysine (CML)-AGE (termed “CML” in this manuscript) was evaluated in vitro. LDH, a marker of cellular injury, was assayed in the supernatant in the presence or absence of signaling inhibitor-treated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte levels of heterogeneous AGEs were measured using ELISA. A pronounced increase in RAGE expression along with AGEs was observed in H/R vs. normoxia in WT cardiomyocytes. WT cardiomyocytes after H/R displayed increased LDH release compared to RKO or sRAGE-treated cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed significant increases in phospho-JNK in WT cardiomyocytes after H/R. In contrast, neither RKO nor sRAGE-treated cardiomyocytes exhibited increased phosphorylation of JNK after H/R stress. The impact of RAGE deletion on GSK-3β phosphorylation in the cardiomyocytes subjected to H/R revealed significantly higher levels of phospho-GSK-3β/total GSK-3β in RKO, as well as in sRAGE-treated cardiomyocytes versus WT cardiomyocytes after H/R. Further investigation established a key role for Akt, which functions upstream of GSK-3β, in modulating H/R injury in adult cardiomyocytes. Conclusions/Significance These data illustrate key roles for RAGE-ligand interaction in the pathogenesis of cardiomyocyte injury induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation and indicate that the effects of RAGE are mediated by JNK activation and dephosphorylation of GSK-3β. The outcome in this study lends further support to the potential use of RAGE blockade as an adjunctive therapy for protection of the ischemic heart."

IntroductionChemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for both early stage as well as metastatic tumors. The ultimate goal of successful chemotherapy is to strategically induce robust apoptosis with simultaneous suppression of survival signaling circuitries in cancer cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Various chemotherapeutic agents induce cell death by halting cell cycle progression, enhancing expression of pro-apoptotic molecules whereas down-regulating survival molecules that impede apoptosis. However, beyond the provocation of death-inducing signals, chemotherapeutic drugs unfavorably up-regulate apoptosis-inhibitory molecules such as survivin and XIAP (1Peng X.H. Karna P. O'Regan R.M.

Although autophagy has recently gained much attention for its paradoxical roles in cell survival and cell death, the true identity of autophagy lies in its adaptive cellular homeostatic and housekeeping mechanisms (10Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Induction of autophagy thus constitutes a protective mechanism that renders tumor cells resistant to death (11Kroemer G. Levine B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar).Drug-induced autophagy is being increasingly implicated in modulating cell death responses. When considering treatment options, it is conceivable that autophagy could limit the effects of cytotoxic anticancer drugs through its ability to clear damaged organelles and proteins. It may also help cancer cells to survive chemotherapy-induced stress. In these scenarios, inhibiting autophagy would be beneficial to treatment outcome. Equally plausible, however, is the notion that drug-induced autophagy might contribute to tumor cell demise and in this case inhibition of autophagy would lead to enhanced tumor growth. Several anticancer agents that induce autophagy include tamoxifen, arsenic trioxide, temozolomide, HDAC inhibitors, etoposide, vitamin D analogs, and tubulin-binding drugs (paclitaxel and 2-methoxyestradiol) (12Høyer-Hansen M.

In these examples, autophagy has been shown to be pro-survival or death inducing in a context-dependent manner. Thus, manipulation of autophagy in favor of death induction in cancer cells would be contingent on context, such as cell-type, nature, and duration of stress etc.Ongoing efforts in our laboratory are actively focused on expansion of a novel class of anticancer agents, noscapinoids, based upon the parent noscapine (18Aneja R. Lopus M. Zhou J. Vangapandu S.N. Ghaleb A. Yao J. Nettles J.H. Zhou B. Gupta M. Panda D. Chandra R. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3782-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Aneja R.

Unlike conventional tubulin-binding agents, these novel molecules are weak affinity tubulin binders, and subtly attenuate microtubule dynamics without appreciably perturbing the steady state monomer/polymer ratio of tubulin (22Zhou J. Gupta K. Aggarwal S. Aneja R. Chandra R. Panda D. Joshi H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol.

This unique property perhaps underlies the “kinder and gentler” nature of noscapine and its analogs and represents a unique edge over conventional anti-tubulin agents (24Heidemann S. Blood. 2006; 107: 2216-2217Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A novel noscapinoid, (R)-9-bromo-5-((S)-4,5-dimethoxy-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-1-yl)-4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]di-oxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline (hereon referred to as Red-Br-nos) has been shown to be significantly more potent than the founding molecule, noscapine (22Zhou J. Gupta K. Aggarwal S. Aneja R. Chandra R. Panda D. Joshi H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrate that Red-Br-nos arrests cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo without detectable toxicity (25Zhou J. Liu M.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The identity of key determinants that arbitrate life and death decisions upon Red-Br-nos exposure and contribute to the final outcome of cell death are still unknown.The present study reports a novel protective autophagic response in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells upon Red-Br-nos treatment. The induction of autophagy preceded the onset of apoptosis. Both opposing responses, autophagy and apoptosis, were ROS triggered. Attenuation of ROS reduced autophagic protection and enhanced apoptosis induction, suggesting that ROS production was upstream of these two events. Red-Br-nos directly affected the mitochondria that generates ROS to trigger a protective autophagic response that perhaps finally sets the stage for apoptosis in the presence of overwhelming damage. This is the first report to identify the induction of autophagy by a novel noscapine family member, as a protective defense mechanism against apoptotic cell death.RESULTSRed-Br-nos Induces Robust Autophagy in Prostate Cancer CellsFormation of Double Membranous Autophagosomes in Red-Br-nos-treated PC-3 CellsSeveral members of the noscapinoid family (EM011, EM015) activate a mitochondrially mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway to induce cell death in lymphoma and breast cancer cells (18Aneja R. Lopus M. Zhou J. Vangapandu S.N. Ghaleb A. Yao J. Nettles J.H. Zhou B. Gupta M. Panda D. Chandra R. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3782-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Aneja R.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because mitochondrial damage has been widely implicated in the induction of autophagy, we asked if Red-Br-nos can also induce autophagy. Classically, electron microscopy has been considered as the gold standard to demonstrate autophagosomes in cells (28Kondo Y. Kondo S. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, the ultrastructure of control and 25 μm Red-Br-nos-treated PC-3 cells was first examined using transmission electron microscopy. The choice of drug concentration (25 μm) was based upon dose response (supplemental Fig. S1) and time course (supplemental Fig. S2) flow cytometric experiments that determined the sub-G1 population that is indicative of apoptosis. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, PC-3 cells treated with Red-Br-nos revealed the appearance of large double-membranous cytoplasmic vacuoles (black arrowheads) as early as 12 h that progressively accumulated upon increasing the drug exposure time. These vacuoles resembled autophagosomes and several of them showed entrapped intracellular organelles such as mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum, and digested residual material (Fig. 1A, black arrows). On the contrary, control PC-3 cells displayed large nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin material surrounded by cytoplasm with a normal complement of healthy looking mitochondria at all time points (12, 24, and 48 h) studied. After 48 h of drug exposure, cells with fragmented nuclei were observable indicating induction of apoptosis (data not shown). These results indicated that Red-Br-nos treatment caused formation of autophagosome-like structures and this cellular response preceded the onset of apoptosis in PC-3 cells.Recruitment of LC3-II into Autophagolysosomes and Up-regulation of Beclin-1 ExpressionMore recently, the microtubule-associated protein-1 LC3 has been used as a marker of autophagy. LC3 exists in two forms, an 18-kDa cytosolic protein (LC3-I) and a processed 16-kDa form (LC3-II) that is membrane-bound and increased during autophagy by conversion from LC3-I (28Kondo Y. Kondo S. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the mechanism of Red-Br-nos-induced autophagy, we examined drug effects on LC3, the mammalian homolog of the yeast autophagy protein Apg8/Aut7p (29Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar, 30Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Red-Br-nos treatment caused processing of full-length LC3-I (18 kDa) to LC3-II (16 kDa) as evident by immunoblotting data using lysates from PC-3 cells treated with either DMSO (control) or 25 μm Red-Br-nos for the indicated time points (Fig. 1B, i). An immunoreactive band corresponding to processed LC3-II (16 kDa) was present with a weak intensity (3 and 6 h) in drug-treated lysates. However, at 12 h, LC3-II levels were increased by ∼6-fold compared with controls, suggesting induction of LC3-II, the form that is recruited to autophagosomes (Fig 1B, i). The autophagic response was not restricted to the lower drug concentration of 25 μm. Higher dose levels of Red-Br-nos (50 and 100 μm) also showed induction of autophagy as seen by increased LC3-II expression at 24 h post-treatment (supplemental Fig. S3).Next, we confirmed autophagy by quantifying GFP-LC3-tagged compartments by fluorescence microscopy. To this end, transient transfectants of PC-3 cells expressing GFP-LC3 were generated. Although there was a diffused localization of GFP-LC3 in control cells (Fig. 1B, ii), treatment of cells with Red-Br-nos for 24 h produced a punctate pattern for GFP-LC3 fluorescence, indicating recruitment of LC3 to autophagosomes during Red-Br-nos-induced autophagy (Fig. 1B, ii). GFP-LC3 compartments at 24 h post-treatment were quantified by counting GFP-LC3 dots in control and Red-Br-nos-treated cells (Fig. 1B, iii). Our results show that there was a significant increase in the number of GFP-LC3 dots by ∼80% in 24-h drug-treated cells compared with controls (Fig. 1B, ii). This clearly suggested increased induction of autophagy over time following Red-Br-nos treatment.An essential autophagy effector, beclin-1, is a central player in autophagosome formation (31Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting data showed a time-dependent increase of beclin-1 expression upon drug exposure suggesting autophagic induction (Fig. 1C, i). Quantitation of Western data using ImageJ revealed a ∼3-fold increase in beclin-1 expression at 12 h compared with controls. There was an increase of beclin-1 positive cells by ∼3.7-fold at 24 h post-treatment as revealed by quantitation of at least 200 cells from random fields (Fig. 1C, iii).Red-Br-nos Causes Formation of AVOsYet another characteristic feature of cells engaged in autophagy is the formation of AVOs following treatment with different stimuli (32Daido S. Kanzawa T. Yamamoto A. Takeuchi H. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4286-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 33Paglin S. Hollister T. Delohery T. Hackett N. McMahill M. Sphicas E. Domingo D. Yahalom J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 439-444PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we visualized the effect of Red-Br-nos treatment on formation of AVOs in PC-3 cells using fluorescence microscopy upon staining with the lysosomotropic agent AO (Fig. 2A). Essentially, AO is a weak base that traverses freely across biological membranes in an uncharged state characterized by green fluorescence. Its protonated form accumulates as aggregates in acidic compartments characterized by red fluorescence. As is visually evident in Fig. 2A, control cells primarily displayed green fluorescence with minimal red fluorescence, indicating a lack of AVOs. On the other hand, drug-treated PC-3 cells showed a ∼3.2-fold increase in red fluorescent AVOs at 24 h post-treatment compared with controls (Fig. 2B). We also quantitated AO fluorescence using flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). Histogram profiles show the mean fluorescence intensity of unstained cells (no AO, blue profile), control cells (AO, green profile), and drug-treated cells (profile), and drug-treated cells (AO, red profile) (Fig. 2C). There was an increase in red fluorescence intensity upon drug treatment indicating an enhancement of AVOs. Fig. 2D is a bar graph quantitation showing a ∼78% increase in red fluorescent cells upon drug treatment for 24 h compared with controls. These results provided further evidence to conclude that Red-Br-nos treatment induced autophagy in PC-3 cells.FIGURE 2Panel A, immunofluorescence microscopy of acridine orange-stained PC-3 cells treated for 24 h with DMSO (control) or 25 μm Red-Br-nos.

To test whether Red-Br-nos induced ROS production, we stained cells using DCFDA and read them flow cytometrically (Fig. 3A, i). DCFDA is cell permeable, cleaved by nonspecific cellular esterases, and reacts mainly with H2O2 and other peroxides to yield fluorescent DCF (35Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal.

Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Red-Br-nos-treated PC-3 cells (red profile) exhibited a statistically significant increase in DCF mean fluorescence intensity by ∼1.8-fold compared with controls (blue profile) (Fig. 3A, i and ii). Microscopic inspection of DCFDA-stained drug-treated cells showed a significant increase in intensity of DCF staining compared with controls (Fig. 3A, iii). The increase in DCF fluorescence was also measured fluorimetrically using excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 535 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, iv, drug treatment resulted in a ∼28% increase of fluorescence signal compared with controls, at 24 h post-treatment.FIGURE 3Red-Br-nos-triggered ROS generation in PC-3 cells.

Flow cytometry data showed a ∼1.6-fold increase of mean fluorescence intensity of EtBr upon drug treatment (red profile) compared with controls (blue profile) (Fig. 3B, i and ii). Indeed, upon drug treatment, nuclear staining with ethidium bromide was evident microscopically, indicating that PC-3 cells accumulated peroxides (Fig. 3A, iii). Fluorimetric data also showed an enhanced fluorescence emission at 580 nm correlating with a ∼27% increase of EtBr-stained cells at 24 h post-treatment compared with controls (Fig. 3B, iv).Red-Br-nos-induced ROS Triggers AutophagyROS serve as signaling molecules in many cellular processes including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (37Scherz-Shouval R. Shvets E. Fass E. Shorer H. Gil L. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 38Azad M.B. Chen Y. Gibson S.B. Antioxid.

ROS specifically, H2O2, and superoxide anion O2̇̄ have been reported to induce autophagy (37Scherz-Shouval R. Shvets E. Fass E. Shorer H. Gil L. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 39Wu W.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 40Scherz-Shouval R. Elazar Z.

Having identified that Red-Br-nos induced generation of ROS, we next asked if ROS triggered autophagy in PC-3 cells. To investigate a functional link between ROS production and autophagy induction, we used tiron, a ROS scavenger, and examined its effect on AVO formation and beclin-1 expression over the Red-Br-nos treatment time. Attenuation of ROS levels by tiron significantly decreased the number of AVOs upon Red-Br-nos treatment (Fig. 3C, i). This was in contrast to Red-Br-nos treatment alone that caused a significant induction of cells with AVOs (Fig. 2A, i). In addition, treatment with tiron in the absence or presence of Red-Br-nos did not induce ROS production as evident by DCF staining (supplemental Fig. S4). Furthermore, there was an absence of drug-induced beclin-1 expression upon drug treatment in the presence of tiron as seen by immunoblotting methods (Fig. 3C, ii). Taken together, these data suggested ROS-mediated induction of autophagy in PC-3 cells.Red-Br-nos Induces ROS-dependent Apoptosis That Is Caspase-independentSeveral tubulin-binding drugs recruit mitochondrially mediated ROS signaling to induce apoptotic cell death (41Mizumachi T. Suzuki S. Naito A. Carcel-Trullols J. Evans T.T. Spring P.M. Oridate N. Furuta Y. Fukuda S. Higuchi M. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of ROS in Red-Br-nos-induced cell death, we monitored the drug-induced sub-G1 population (an indicator of cell death) in the absence or presence of tiron using flow cytometry. Fig. 3C, iii, is a three-dimensional representation of cell-cycle profiles of PC-3 cells that were treated with drug in the absence or presence of tiron. Quantitation data showed that there was a decline in the drug-induced sub-G1 population by ∼2.7-fold when ROS was inhibited by tiron, suggesting that ROS played a crucial role in induction of cell death (Fig. 3C, iv). Because caspase activation is a hallmark of classical apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3 expression was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C, v). There was an absence of cleaved caspase-3 expression upon drug treatment over time (Fig. 3C, v). Furthermore, we also measured caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h of drug treatment (Fig. 3C, vi). Docetaxel was included as a positive control. We found that there were no changes in caspase-3/7 activity patterns in drug-treated cells compared with controls (Fig. 3C, vi). However, 2 nm docetaxel increased caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3C, vi). In addition, there was an absence of activated caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-2 upon a 48-h Red-Br-nos treatment (supplemental Fig. S5). Docetaxel treatment, however, showed an increase of activated caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 compared with controls (supplemental Fig. S5).

https://openalex.org/W2000931014,"Synaptic activity and the generation of nuclear calcium signals promote neuronal survival through a transcription-dependent process that is not fully understood. Here we show that one mechanism of activity-induced acquired neuroprotection involves the Forkhead transcription factor, FoxO3a, which is known to induce genomic death responses upon translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Depletion of endogenous FoxO3a using RNA interference renders hippocampal neurons more resistant to excitotoxic cell death. Using a FoxO3a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein to monitor in real time the localization of FoxO3a in hippocampal neurons, we found that several cell death inducing stimuli, including the stimulation of extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, growth factor withdrawal, and oxygen-glucose deprivation, caused a swift translocation of FoxO3a-GFP from the cytosol to the cell nucleus. This translocation was inhibited in hippocampal neurons that had undergone prolonged periods of synaptic activity before exposure to cell death-inducing conditions. The activity-dependent protection from death signal-induced FoxO3a-GFP nuclear translocation required synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and was dependent on nuclear calcium signaling and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV. The modulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO3a may represent one mechanism through which nuclear calcium-induced genomic responses affect cell death processes."
https://openalex.org/W2045325185,"In defense of deleterious retrotransposition of intracisternal A particle (IAP) elements, IAP loci are heavily methylated and silenced in mouse somatic cells. To determine whether IAP is also repressed in pluripotent stem cells by DNA methylation, we examined IAP expression in demethylated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and epiblast-derived stem cells. Surprisingly, in demethylated ESC cultures carrying mutations of DNA methyltransferase I (Dnmt1), no IAP transcripts and proteins are detectable in undifferentiated Oct4+ ESCs. In contrast, ∼3.6% of IAP-positive cells are detected in Oct4− Dnmt1−/− cells, suggesting that the previously observed increase in IAP transcripts in the population of Dnmt1−/− ESCs could be accounted for by this subset of Oct4− Dnmt1−/− ESCs undergoing spontaneous differentiation. Consistent with this possibility, a dramatic increase of IAP mRNA (>100-fold) and protein expression was observed in Dnmt1−/− ESC cultures upon induction of differentiation through the withdrawal of leukemia-inhibitory factor for 6 or more days. Interestingly, both mRNAs and proteins of IAP can be readily detected in demethylated Oct4+ epiblast-derived stem cells as well as differentiated mouse embryo fibroblasts, neurons, and glia upon conditional Dnmt1 gene deletion. These data suggest that mESCs are a unique stem cell type possessing a DNA methylation-independent IAP repression mechanism. This methylation-independent mechanism does not involve Dicer-mediated action of microRNAs or RNA interference because IAP expression remains repressed in Dnmt1−/−; Dicer−/− double mutant ESCs.

Many retrotransposable repetitive elements are heavily methylated, and current evidence supports a causal relationship between DNA methylation and repression of retrotransposons (7Walsh C.P.

Intracisternal A particles (IAPs) are murine endogenous retroviral repetitive elements, with an estimation of over 1000 copies across the haploid murine genome (10Heidmann O. Heidmann T.

Germ line mutations due to IAP retrotransposition most often occur at intronic sites, disrupting gene expression through premature termination, aberrant splicing, or viral LTR-driven transcription (13Whitelaw E. Martin D.I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insertional mutagenesis of IAP elements is noted in various murine cancer cell lines with subsequent activation of oncogenes or cytokine genes (14Ukai H. Ishii-Oba H. Ukai-Tadenuma M.

When expressed, IAP proteins are non-infectious viral particles that are retained in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Kuff E.L. Wivel N.A. Lueders K.K.

Genomics. 2003; 82: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In established lines of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the inner cell mass, IAP elements are already heavily methylated with little detectable IAP expression (21Ramírez M.A. Pericuesta E. Fernandez-Gonzalez R. Moreira P. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2006; 4: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we examine expression of IAP proteins in control and demethylated somatic cells, EpiSCs, and mESCs. Using a previously generated antibody against IAP protein (p73) (22Kuff E.L. Callahan R. Howk R.S. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as our polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant IAP gag protein (9Hutnick L.K. Golshani P. Namihira M. Xue Z.

Virol. 1987; 61: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we mapped changes in IAP protein levels after Dnmt1 gene deletion in floxed (Dnmt12lox/2lox) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using virus-mediated cre recombinase. Unexpectedly, we found that IAP mRNA and protein levels are not detected in Oct4+ Dnmt1−/− ESCs but are dramatically increased in demethylated mESC cultures upon in vitro differentiation, suggestive of the presence of DNA methylation-independent repression mechanism(s) in silencing IAP expression in undifferentiated mESCs. Sequence from plasmid M1A14 (23Mietz J.A. Grossman Z. Lueders K.K. Kuff E.L. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to clone the IAP2 fragment (amino acids 250–750) into pGEX4T3 vector (Fig. 1) (9Hutnick L.K. Golshani P. Namihira M. Xue Z. Matynia A. Yang X.W. Silva A.J. Schweizer F.E. Fan G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, bacteria were harvested, and the IAP2-GST fusion protein was purified with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). After evaluation of the thrombin-cut eluate, antigen was shipped to PickCell Laboratories for rabbit immunoinjection. Rabbit polyclonal serum was tested and evaluated before purification. Briefly, GST-IAP2 fusion protein was adsorbed onto glutathione beads (Roche Applied Science), fixed by 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate in 200 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.5, and terminated in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3. Antibody bound to IAP2-GST fusion protein was washed with Tris-buffered saline and eluted by 200 mm glycine (pH 2) followed by neutralization with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, buffer to pH 7.4. Eluates were examined by immunoblotting at different dilutions in three independent trials to verify specificity. MSCV-Cre-GFP and MSCV-GFP were generated in HEK 293T cells via calcium phosphate transfection. For viral infection, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 1 ml of cell medium (90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine) with Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Cells in suspension were incubated with titered virus. After 30 min, the infected cells were added to gelatinized wells and coverslips. Medium was changed after 6–8 h. During the time course, corresponding wells were harvested for DNA, RNA, and protein. Coverslips were retrieved and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature for immunocytochemistry. Lentivirus (LV-Cre-GFP) was generated by the UCLA Department of Medicine VectorCore with a concentration of 1.6 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. cre recombinase activity was verified by infecting fibroblasts generated from the R26R βgeo line (24Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). To infect mESCs, cells were grown feeder-free for two passages, and after trypsinization, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of LV-Cre supernatant plus 8 μg/ml Polybrene and rotated in Eppendorf tubes for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with medium, and plated at low density onto feeders with coverslips to monitor acute infection. For subcloning analysis, infected single cells were enriched using flow cytometry sorting (FACsVantage, UCLA JCCC Flow Cytometry Core) and plated at low density, and individual colonies were picked and expanded for DNA, RNA, and immunohistochemistry. Dnmt12lox/2lox mice were mated, and at E5.5, postimplantation embryos were dissected and cultured as described with minor modifications to the protocol (25Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A.

EpiSC cultures were maintained on γ-irradiated feeders in EpiSC medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 7 μg/ml insulin, 15 μg/ml transferrin, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12 ng/ml FGF-2, 20 ng/ml activin A, 1000 units/ml LIF, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 450 μm monothioglycerol). EpiSCs were passaged using collagenase dispase dissociation into small colonies. For lentiviral infection, EpiSCs were dissociated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, preplated to remove feeders, and infected using the above described procedure. Wild type control (J1 cells), Dnmt1−/− (c/c) ESCs (27Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E.

For partial differentiation, mouse ESCs were plated on 0.2% gelatin B-coated plates and coverslips. After 24 h (Day 0 time point), medium was changed to LIF− differentiation medium (90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine). Medium was changed every day, with corresponding wells harvested for DNA, RNA, protein, and coverslips over the time course (Days 0–12). The immunoblotting procedure was performed as described previously (29Fan G. Martinowich K. Chin M.H. He F. Fouse S.D. Hutnick L. Hattori D. Ge W. Shen Y. Wu H. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Sun Y.E. Development. 2005; 132: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The original IAP antibody (anti-p73, clone 37.11X from Dr. Kira Lueders) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated overnight at room temperature. Our IAP2 antibody was used at a 1:2000 dilution for Western blots. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam; 1:5000) was used as loading control. Total RNA was harvested by TRIzol as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript reaction kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Bio-Rad MyCycler and SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Results were normalized to 18 S values expressed as -fold change relative to corresponding control values (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116537) Google Scholar). p values were assessed using Student's t test (two-tailed, paired). Forward and reverse primers were as follows: IAP forward, AAG CCC TTT TGT TCC TTT TCA; IAP reverse, ACC CTT GGA AAG GCC TGT AT; 18 S forward, GCC CTG TAA TTG GAA TGA GTC CAC TT; 18 S reverse, CTC CCC AAG ATC CAA CTA CGA GCT TT. IAP2 (amino acids 250–700) sequence was PCR-amplified from the MIA14 plasmid gel purified (Promega). 100 ng of IAP2 template was used to generate a Cy3-labeled cDNA probe using the Bioprime kit (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. FISH was carried out as previously described (31Shen Y. Matsuno Y. Fouse S.D. Rao N. Root S. Xu R. Pellegrini M. Riggs A.D. Fan G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4709-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The same amplified region was used to create a Northern probe. Northern blot analysis was performed using the standard procedure in our previous publication (29Fan G. Martinowich K. Chin M.H. He F. Fouse S.D. Hutnick L. Hattori D. Ge W. Shen Y. Wu H. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Sun Y.E. Development. 2005; 132: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Coverslips were picked and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed three times (5 min each) with 1× PBS. Blocking and permeabilization were carried out for 1 h with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS plus 10% normal goat serum. Primary antibody diluted in PBS plus 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to coverslips and incubated overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were the following: anti-IAP2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) and anti-Oct 3/4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; mouse monoclonal, 1:20). Anti-H4K20 3me (Millipore; mouse monoclonal, 1:500) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were washed, and secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) diluted in PBS plus 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added for 1 h. Section immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (32Fan G. Beard C. Chen R.Z. Csankovszki G. Sun Y. Siniaia M. Biniszkiewicz D. Bates B. Lee P.P. Kuhn R. Trumpp A. Poon C. Wilson C.B. Jaenisch R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 788-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The original anti-IAP (p73) antibody was diluted (1:500) in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.25% Triton X-100 overnight at room temperature. Our IAP2 antibody was used at 1:1000 in PBS plus 5% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X. The next day, the sections were washed in 1× PBS three times for 10 min each, and then secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) was applied for 2 h at room temperature. Images were taken at ×63 magnification using Leica confocal software on a Leica TCS-SP MP Confocal and Multiphoton Inverted Microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an argon laser (488-nm blue excitation, JDS Uniphase), a 561-nm (green) diode laser (DPSS, Melles Griot), a 633-nm (red) helium-neon laser, and a two-photon laser setup consisting of a Spectra-Physics Millenia X 532-nm green diode pump laser and a Tsunami Ti-Sapphire picosecond pulsed infrared laser tuned at 768 nm for UV excitation. Given that IAP repeats are heavily methylated by Dnmt1, we asked whether IAP protein could be detected in DNA demethylation models. The original p73 antiserum also recognizes other proteins containing partial products of IAP coding regions (23Mietz J.A. Grossman Z. Lueders K.K. Kuff E.L. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). For specific recognition of IAP gag protein product, we created a recombinant protein fusing GST to a partial fragment of IAP gag protein (IAP2, amino acids 251–699) (Fig. 1A). Once purified over IAP2-GST columns, the original serum yielded a clean p73 band via immunoblot in tissue possessing over 95% Dnmt1−/− cells in the central nervous system (32Fan G. Beard C. Chen R.Z. Csankovszki G. Sun Y. Siniaia M. Biniszkiewicz D. Bates B. Lee P.P. Kuhn R. Trumpp A. Poon C. Wilson C.B. Jaenisch R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 788-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The purified serum was partially blocked by preadsorption against IAP2 peptide fragment, indicating the specificity of antiserum (data not shown). We used this recombinant IAP2 protein fragment to generate a separate polyclonal antibody for both immunoblotting and immunostaining assays to detect IAP protein expression (Fig. 1B). To examine the onset of IAP protein reactivation after Dnmt1 gene deletion, Dnmt12lox/2lox MEFs were infected with retrovirus containing cre recombinase fused to green fluorescent protein (MSCV-Cre-GFP) (33Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Significant genomic demethylation was detected after 4 days postinfection via Southern blotting for the IAP repeat probe (Fig. 2A). Because DNA methylation levels dropped after the deletion of Dnmt1, we found reactivation of IAP protein translation in infected cells starting 5 days postinfection via immunoblot (Fig. 2B). When individual cells were examined for IAP immunoreactivity, IAP protein was detectable in a minority of infected cells as early as 4 days postinfection (Fig. 2C). IAP expression was restricted to the Cre-GFP-infected cell population (Fig. 2C, arrows). Thus, the reactivation of IAP protein expression is tightly associated with the onset of genomic DNA demethylation caused by the deletion of Dnmt1. We next asked whether IAP protein could be used to detect demethylated cells at a single cell resolution in the developing nervous system after conditional Dnmt1 deletion in neural precursors. Using our anti-IAP2, IAP immunoreactivity was restricted to the zone of Dnmt1 deletion as dictated by the expression pattern of Emx1-Cre and Nestin-Cre (Fig. 3, A and B) (9Hutnick L.K. Golshani P. Namihira M. Xue Z. Matynia A. Yang X.W. Silva A.J. Schweizer F.E. Fan G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Fan G. Beard C. Chen R.Z. Csankovszki G. Sun Y. Siniaia M. Biniszkiewicz D. Bates B. Lee P.P. Kuhn R. Trumpp A. Poon C. Wilson C.B. Jaenisch R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 788-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Emx1-Cre-driven deletion of Dnmt1, no immunoreactivity for IAP was seen in control regions of striatum, thalamus, brain stem, or cerebellum, where DNA methylation is maintained (data not shown). The neuroblastoma cell line N2a, which is known to transcribe certain IAP-LTR-containing genes (34Connelly M.A. Grady R.C. Mushinski J.F. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Sugino H. Toyama T. Taguchi Y. Esumi S. Miyazaki M. Yagi T. Gene. 2004; 337: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), shows strong anti-IAP2 immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm with a characteristic juxtanuclear staining pattern for viral A particles (Fig. 3C). Endogenous IAP protein levels are strongly reactivated in N2a cultured cells, which correlates with the known hypomethylation of IAP elements in the N2a genome (35Sugino H. Toyama T. Taguchi Y. Esumi S. Miyazaki M. Yagi T. Gene. 2004; 337: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, IAP immunoreactivity is a very useful tool to locate demethylated cells in a variety of DNA demethylation models. Dnmt1−/− mESCs possess less that 22% normal genomic methylation levels and exhibit increased expression of IAP mRNAs (27Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Meissner A. Gnirke A. Bell G.W. Ramsahoye B. Lander E.S. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5868-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 36Biniszkiewicz D. Gribnau J. Ramsahoye B. Gaudet F. Eggan K. Humpherys D. Mastrangelo M.A. Jun Z. Walter J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2124-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when we performed Western blot analysis to assay IAP proteins, we could not detect IAP proteins in lysate from undifferentiated Dnmt1−/− mESC cultures (Fig. 4A). When we used IAP FISH to detect mRNA signal in the undifferentiated Dnmt−/− mESCs, we did not visualize increased IAP mRNA levels (Fig. 4E, Day 0). We then performed co-immunostaining of IAP and Oct3/4 to verify whether individual cells express IAP protein in the undifferentiated state. Only a small minority of IAP-positive cells existed in Dnmt1−/− cultures (3.6 ± 0.51%, mean ± S.E., n = 825 cells; Fig. 4D, Day 0), but all IAP positive cells were Oct3/4-negative, indicative of differentiation. IAP protein reactivation in this minor population may be below immunoblot detection levels, yet the level of IAP transcripts was elevated sufficiently in this differentiated subset to account for detection by more sensitive quantitative RT-PCR assay in the population of Dnmt1−/− ESCs. We next examined the time course of IAP immunoreactivity in demethylated mESCs after in vitro differentiation. Upon LIF withdrawal in the absence of feeder cells, Dnmt1−/− mESCs undergo a dramatic increase in IAP transcription and translation (Fig. 4, B and C). Quantitative RT-PCR reveals a 10-fold increase in IAP transcript levels 5 days after LIF withdrawal in Dnmt1−/− cells. Moreover, a similar profile of mRNA expression is detected using FISH labeling and Northern blot analysis specific for IAP2 (Fig. 4, E and F). After 6 days of LIF withdrawal, IAP protein is detectable in total cell lysate (Day 6 long exposure; Fig. 4C). By Day 9 of the LIF withdrawal time course, we see robust protein expression (Fig. 4C) and a corresponding 103 ± 29-fold relative increase of IAP transcription in Dnmt1−/− cultures (p < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). Z-stack confocal microscopy through individual colonies revealed IAP immunoreactivity present only in cells with low or no Oct3/4 immunoreactivity throughout the time course (Fig. 4D). Over the course of LIF withdrawal, the differentiated population increases dramatically (Fig. 4D), and only after a significant increase in this population was the threshold for immunoblot detection reached. To determine if the DNA methylation-independent mechanism in suppression of IAP elements is unique to pluripotent stem cells, such as mouse ESCs, we derived Dnmt12lox/2lox EpiSCs and examined the effect of DNA demethylation on IAP expression. EpiSCs are derived from the epiblast of the post-implantation embryo at E5.5, express pluripotent stem cell markers, such as Oct4 and Nanog, and form cells of the three germ layers in vitro and in vivo (25Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 26Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L. Nature. 2007; 448: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). However, distinct differences in morphology, culture conditions, and gene expression profiles set EpiSCs apart from mESCs. Because EpiSCs exhibit up-regulation of endodermal and ectodermal markers when compared with mESCs, EpiSCs are regarded as more lineage-committed in developmental pathways. Using lentivirus to deliver cre recombinase, we monitored infected Dnmt12lox/2lox EpiSCs for IAP protein reactivation. By 2 days postinfection, IAP protein was dramatically up-regulated in Oct3/4-positive cells (Fig. 5). IAP signal remained high in the infected (GFP+) EpiSCs and their derivatives in early passages. However, demethylated EpiSCs do not survive passaging 3L. K. Hutnick, X. Huang, T.-C. Loo, Z. Ma, and G. Fan, unpublished observations. and behave more like demethylated MEF cells (33Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Dnmt1−/− mESCs appear to possess an alternative mechanism unique to embryonic stem cells to silence IAP elements in the absence of DNA methylation. Inhibition of histone deacetylases shifts chromatin to a permissive state for transcription, relieving chromatin repression in mESCs(37Schuettengruber B. Chourrout D. Vervoort M. Leblanc B. Cavalli G. Cell. 2007; 128: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase inhibitors significantly increased the number of IAP-positive mESC colonies as well as increasing the number of IAP-positive cells per colony (Fig. 6). However, IAP-positive cells did not colocalize with strong Oct3/4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 6A); thus, cell differentiation, a known side effect of treatment with HDAC inhibitors, explains the increase in IAP immunoreactivity. The 20 S proteasome acts as a transcriptional silencer blocking nonspecific transcription initiation at intergenic and intragenic regions in mESCs (38Szutorisz H. Georgiou A. Tora L. Dillon N. Cell. 2006; 127: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the majority of IAP LTR insertions are intergenic, we investigated whether this mechanism controls unwanted transcription of IAP elements. After treatment with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 for 8 h, no colocalization of Oct3/4 and IAP immunostaining was seen in colonies examined (Fig. 6C); nor was a dramatic rise of IAP mRNA present in treated Dnmt1−/− mESCs (0.58 ± 0.17-fold change, p = 0.08). Because IAP reactivation was not seen in either wild type or demethylated mESCs after MG132 treatment, proteosome-mediated degradation of intergenic gene transcription probably is not the alternative mechanism. It has been postulated that Dicer protein-mediated RNA interference or microRNA production could be a potential mechanism to block IAP expression. Minor demethylation of IAP elements is detected in Dicer−/− mESCs (39Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). We therefore generated Dnmt1−/−; Dicer−/− double mutant ESCs using lentiviral cre recombinase and examined by immunocytochemistry for the colocalization of IAP and Oct4. Individual subclones were genotyped via PCR for 2lox versus 1lox detection at both loci, and quantitative RT-PCR verified the reduced expression of both Dnmt1 and Dicer (Fig. 7). Although IAP protein was strongly expressed in spontaneously differentiating cells (Oct3/4-negative), we failed to detect the co-localization of strong IAP signal with Oct3/4-positive cells (Fig. 7). It is of note that two clones showed a few cells (<0.2% of the counted colonies) with weak juxtanuclear staining (Fig. 7). Our results argue against the possibility that Dicer-mediated RNA interference or microRNAs would be the alternative mechanism in repressing IAP expression in undifferentiated mESCs. Host cell defensive strategies have evolved to counteract the deleterious consequences of IAP element reactivation. The best documented mechanism, DNA methylation of LTR promoters, can directly impede access of transcription factors or lead to an inactive form of chromatin at target loci (40Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). As the time course of Dnmt1 conditional deletion in MEF cells indicates, IAP protein expression is tightly correlated with genomic DNA methylation levels, making IAP protein reactivation a reliable indicator of global changes in DNA methylation levels in individual cells. Previous tools for examining global DNA hypomethylation levels relied on evaluating DNA or RNA extracted from a population of cells. Although these techniques are sensitive, no evaluation could be made for global DNA methylation changes in individual cells within tissue. As shown in Fig. 3, IAP immunohistochemistry allows for recognition of DNA demethylation at a cellular level in different tissue types. In cultured N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, a robust reactivation of IAP protein is present. Similarly, in hypomethylated neural lineage cells, IAP protein can be used to trace the demethylation status at the individual cell level. Thus, IAP antibodies are valuable reagents to detect demethylated cells in the murine system. Hypomethylated mESCs appear to possess an alternative mechanism for IAP silencing beyond the DNA methylation-mediated pathway. Interestingly, EpiSCs, which are also pluripotent yet differ from mESCs in both transcriptional networks and epigenetic modifications (25Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 26Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L. Nature. 2007; 448: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), show strong IAP protein reactivation after Dnmt1 deletion. Thus, a methylation-independent repressional mechanism is unique to mESCs. Further analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic profiles may highlight this unique repressional mechanism in mESCs. It can be potentially argued that DNA methylation directed by de novo methyltransferases in Dnmt1−/− mESCs silences IAP elements. We evaluated IAP protein expression levels in Dnmt1/Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b-deficient mESCs (TKO cells) (28Meissner A. Gnirke A. Bell G.W. Ramsahoye B. Lander E.S. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5868-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Under standard mESC culture conditions, the IAP-positive TKO cell population was not Oct4-positive (supplemental Fig. 1). Because TKO cells have less than 2% of the normal methylation levels (28Meissner A. Gnirke A. Bell G.W. Ramsahoye B. Lander E.S. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5868-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), we argue that mESCs possess an alternative mechanism in the absence of DNA methylation that mediates IAP gene silencing. We have considered the involvement of both transcriptional and translational mechanisms controlling IAP expression in demethylated mESCs. It is possible that redundant repressive mechanisms are present in mESCs that include DNA methylation and histone modifications, yet HDAC inhibitors did not induce IAP expression in demethylated Dnmt1−/− mESCs (Fig. 6). Furthermore, preliminary results showed that deficiency of either PRC2 (eed−/− mESCs) or PRC1 (Bmi−/− brain tissues) alone did not relieve IAP protein repression (data not shown). To definitively ascertain PcG complex involvement, deficiency of both polycomb complexes and DNA methylation in mESCs may be needed to trigger IAP protein expression. Small RNA-mediated silencing pathways have been reported to regulate retrotransposons. Presently, contradictory reports regarding Dicer involvement in IAP silencing appear in the literature. One group observed increased transcription from centromeric repeats, L1s, and IAPs (39Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar); however, other groups state that mammalian DICER and Eif2c2 (Ago2) have no roles in maintaining genomic methylation in mESCs, with direct evidence that the RISC complex does not repress IAP expression post-transcriptionally (41Murchison E.P. Partridge J.F. Tam O.H. Cheloufi S. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 42Morita S. Horii T. Kimura M. Goto Y. Ochiya T. Hatada I. Genomics. 2007; 89: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our double deletion model in mESCs reveals no large induction of IAP protein reactivation, arguing that Dicer-mediated transcriptional silencing is not strongly targeting IAP repression. Although we observed weak IAP immunostaining in a few Dnmt1−/−; Dicer−/− cells, this could be due to the fact that Dicer mutation dramatically increases Oct3/4 levels in mESCs (39Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 41Murchison E.P. Partridge J.F. Tam O.H. Cheloufi S. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The appearance of a few Oct3/4 immunopositive cells weakly co-stained for IAP could be explained by longer turnover of Oct3/4 protein; thus, cells undergoing early stages of spontaneous differentiation would retain residual Oct3/4 protein. While this manuscript was in preparation, two recent publications demonstrated that KAP1/Trim28 repressor protein coupled with histone lysine 9 methyltransferase KMT1E (ESET/SETDB1) is involved in repressed IAP gene transcription in mESCs (43Rowe H.M. Jakobsson J. Mesnard D. Rougemont J. Reynard S. Aktas T. Maillard P.V. Layard-Liesching H. Verp S. Marquis J. Spitz F. Constam D.B. Trono D.

Nature. 2010; 464: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a novel role of repressive histone modifications as an alternative transcriptional repressive mechanism independent of DNA methylation. Interestingly, in the absence of all three Dnmts in mESCs, Matsui et al. (44Matsui T. Leung D. Miyashita H. Maksakova I.A. Miyachi H. Kimura H. Tachibana M. Lorincz M.C. Shinkai Y. Nature. 2010; 464: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) reported that the KAP-repressive complex remains associated with IAP retrotransposon elements. Furthermore, KAP1/Trim28 acts synergistically with DNA methylation to repress IAP transcription (43Rowe H.M. Jakobsson J. Mesnard D. Rougemont J. Reynard S. Aktas T. Maillard P.V. Layard-Liesching H. Verp S. Marquis J. Spitz F. Constam D.B. Trono D. Nature. 2010; 463: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, neither of the two groups have examined whether IAP proteins are present in KAP1−/− mESCs. In our study, we found that IAP gene transcription is only moderately increased when compared with differentiated Dnmt1−/− cells. Furthermore, IAP protein is not detected in demethylated mESCs, consistent with an additional inhibitory mechanism that blocks IAP expression in undifferentiated mESCs. Based on the findings of this current study, we conclude that IAP protein expression can be used to detect DNA hypomethylation at the cellular level in murine cells ranging from epiblast-derived stem cells to adult neurons. Both IAP transcription and protein translation can be detected upon DNA hypomethylation in lineage-committed cells. However, in undifferentiated mESCs, there exists a compensatory mechanism(s) to repress retrotransposon elements independent of DNA methylation. The need for an alternative mechanism further highlights the importance of maintaining genomic stability to prevent insertional mutations in fast replicating mESCs.

https://openalex.org/W1995073945,"DNA synthesis during replication relies on RNA primers synthesised by the primase, a specialised DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that can initiate nucleic acid synthesis de novo. In archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, the primase is a heterodimeric enzyme resulting from the constitutive association of a small (PriS) and large (PriL) subunit. The ability of the primase to initiate synthesis of an RNA primer depends on a conserved Fe-S domain at the C-terminus of PriL (PriL-CTD). However, the critical role of the PriL-CTD in the catalytic mechanism of initiation is not understood.Here we report the crystal structure of the yeast PriL-CTD at 1.55 A resolution. The structure reveals that the PriL-CTD folds in two largely independent alpha-helical domains joined at their interface by a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The larger N-terminal domain represents the most conserved portion of the PriL-CTD, whereas the smaller C-terminal domain is largely absent in archaeal PriL. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal domain reveals a striking structural similarity with the active site region of the DNA photolyase/cryptochrome family of flavoproteins. The region of similarity includes PriL-CTD residues that are known to be essential for initiation of RNA primer synthesis by the primase.Our study reports the first crystallographic model of the conserved Fe-S domain of the archaeal/eukaryotic primase. The structural comparison with a cryptochrome protein bound to flavin adenine dinucleotide and single-stranded DNA provides important insight into the mechanism of RNA primer synthesis by the primase."
https://openalex.org/W1993452888,"Proteins bearing a SET domain have been shown to methylate lysine residues in histones and contribute to chromatin architecture. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) has emerged as an important player in the formation of heterochromatin, chromatin condensation, and transcriptional repression. Here, we have characterized a previously undescribed member of the histone H3K9 methyltransferase family named CLLD8 (or SETDB2 or KMT1F). This protein contributes to the trimethylation of both interspersed repetitive elements and centromere-associated repeats and participates in the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 to centromeres. Consistently, depletion in CLLD8/KMT1F coincides with a loss of CENP proteins and delayed mitosis, suggesting that this protein participates in chromosome condensation and segregation. Altogether, our results provide evidence that CLLD8/KMT1F is recruited to heterochromatin regions and contributes in vivo to the deposition of trimethyl marks in concert with SUV39H1/KMT1A.

Altogether, our results provide evidence that CLLD8/KMT1F is recruited to heterochromatin regions and contributes in vivo to the deposition of trimethyl marks in concert with SUV39H1/KMT1A. Deciphering the pathways that regulate chromatin architecture has been a major goal in the dissection of the histone code predicting that different modifications of specific amino acids in the tails of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are translated into distinct information (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). These tails that protrude from the nucleosome octamer are subject to various covalent post-translational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, and methylation catalyzed by specific enzymes. These signatures provide epigenetically heritable information that regulates transcription, replication, repair, and chromosome condensation through cell divisions. Among them, methylation is now recognized as a major change associated with both repression and activation of transcription (2Stewart M.D. Li J. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Reik W. Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Of the nine lysine positions that can be modified in the histone H3 amino terminus, five can display methylation. Methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 are marks of repressive chromatin, whereas methylation of H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 are found at transcriptionally active sites. The H3K9 and H3K27 residues can be mono, di-, or trimethylated, thereby extending the complexity of the epigenetic code associated with histone modifications. In general, H3K9 trimethylation is linked to chromosome condensation and is important for binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) 6The abbreviations used are: HP1heterochromatin protein 1HMTasehistone methyltransferaseMBDmethyl-binding domainDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolesiRNAsmall interfering RNA. to discrete regions, thereby regulating gene expression and heterochromatin spreading through self-association properties and association with the SUV39H histone methyltransferase (HMTase). The translation of this code can be affected by another adjacent modification on the same histone tail and the level of cytosine methylation of the underlying DNA. Thus, the combinatory use of different marks participates in the topology of the chromatin fiber and gives enormous potential for the variability of the biological response. In addition, the primary function of a particular modification within a single nucleosome might be modulated by another adjacent residue. For example, a cooperation between H3 and H4 methylation participates in the epigenetic regulation of many processes that include heterochromatin formation, X inactivation, imprinting, and transcriptional regulation. On the contrary, the phosphorylation of serine 10 alters the binding of HP1 to methylated H3K9, thereby regulating the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin during the M phase (4Fischle W. Tseng B.S.

Proteins implicated in either the establishment or the translation of this code have been the focus of intensive research. A common feature for HMTases is the presence of an evolutionarily conserved SET domain initially identified in the Drosophila suppressor of position effect variegation (Su(var)3–9), the polycomb group enhancer of zeste, and the trithorax protein. The homology between this SET domain and a plant enzyme, Rubisco large subunit lysine methyltransferase, further led to the characterization of a large family of proteins containing this motif. This family is divided into different subgroups according to amino acid identity within their SET domain (6Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 7Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. Pillus L. Reinberg D. Shi Y. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A.

In mammals, several HMTases able to methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 have been characterized. These enzymes, SUV39H1 and 2 (KMT1A and KMT1B), G9a (KMT1C), and ESET/SETDB1 (KMT1E) possess a SET domain and two adjacent cysteine-rich regions (pre-SET and post-SET) (7Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. Pillus L. Reinberg D. Shi Y. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. Workman J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2007; 131: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In addition to these enzymes, a database search revealed that other proteins with SET motifs but devoid of one or both of the flanking regions also exist in eukaryotes (6Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Only the SET domain is required for HMTase activity, and the function of the adjacent pre- and post-SET domains might be replaced by other motifs conferring specificity (8Yang L. Xia L. Wu D.Y.

Among these HMTases, KMT1F (or SETDB2 or CLLD8, named hereafter KMT1F), a candidate protein for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, has not been characterized so far. The corresponding gene, located on chromosome 13q14.3, spans 49 kb and consists of 15 exons. The coding region encodes a protein of 719 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 81.9 kDa (see Fig. 1A) (10Mabuchi H. Fujii H. Calin G. Alder H. Negrini M. Rassenti L. Kipps T.J. Bullrich F. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2870-2877PubMed Google Scholar). This putative protein contains a SET domain and the adjacent pre-SET cysteine-rich regions, together with a methyl-binding domain (MBD) also found in protein with affinity to methylated DNA. The SET domain is interrupted by a 218-amino acid insertion in the middle of the motif and presents 73% of similarity with the bifurcated ESET/SETDB1 domain (11Harte P.J. Wu W. Carrasquillo M.M. Matera A.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This evolutionarily conserved insertion suggests that the SET domain possesses functionally separable domains. The pre-SET, also known as the SAC domain (SET domain-associated cysteine-rich domain), might be involved in DNA binding (12Huang N. vom Baur E. Garnier J.M. Lerouge T. Vonesch J.L. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3398-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), whereas the post-SET might be implicated in substrate binding and catalysis. Alterations of the SET proteins are associated with a wide range of pathologies. For instance, the mammalian homolog of trx, mll/HRX, is frequently translocated in leukemia, resulting in a fusion protein that lacks the carboxyl-terminal SET domain (13Waring P.M. Cleary M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar). NSD1 has been associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (14Stec I. Wright T.J. van Ommen G.J. de Boer P.A. van Haeringen A. Moorman A.F. Altherr M.R. den Dunnen J.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas expression of ESET/SETDB1 is altered in Huntington disease (15Ryu H. Lee J. Hagerty S.W. Soh B.Y. McAlpin S.E. Cormier K.A. Smith K.M. Ferrante R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19176-19181Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 13q14.3 locus encoding CLLD8/KMT1F is frequently deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocyte leukemia, suggesting a role for KMT1F in pathology. In this report, we investigated the biological function of KMT1F in the methylation of histone H3K9 residues in human cells. We show that this member of the histone methyltransferase family participates in the distribution of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks and contributes to chromosome segregation during mitosis, suggesting that this previously uncharacterized protein might regulate the level of H3K9 trimethylation and genome stability in human cells. The conditions of the culture and transfection of the human embryonic kidney (293T) and epithelial cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cell lines are detailed in the supplemental information. Anti-KMT1F antibody was produced in collaboration with Abcam®. The peptide sequence DITKYREETPPRSR, corresponding to a short region of the bifurcated SET domain, was selected after a BLAST comparison of SET motifs in mouse, human, and rabbit for its immunogenicity potential. For detection of KMT1F and Lamins A/C, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Nuclear Extract KitTM, Active Motif) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and incubated with anti-KMT1F (1/200) or anti-Lamins A/C (1/1000, H110; Santa Cruz), probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma), detected with the ECL chemiluminescent kit, and visualized with Fujifilm LAS-3000 (Multi Gauge; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). After 2–6 days, the cells grown on coverslips were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min (16Wheatley S.P. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Small J.V. J.

Jenuwein) for 1 h at 37 °C. A secondary antibody directed against the rabbit primary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Molecular Probes) were used for detection. For antigen competition, anti-KMT1F was preincubated for 2 h either with a KMT1F or a control peptide at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) for fluorescence analysis and TOTO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) at 1–2 μm for confocal imaging, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and observed on an Axioplan-2 Imaging Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) equipped with Apochromat 63× and 100×/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objectives, Coolsnap HQ CCD camera, and Metamorph 7.5 software (Molecular Devices) for conventional microscopy and on a confocal Axioplan 2 equipped with Neofluar 100×/1.4 oil Ph3 objective using the LSM 510 v 3.2 software for confocal acquisitions. Z stacks were processed through Imaris 4.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland) for three-dimensional analyses. For CENP A and CENP B detection, 48 h after transfection, the cells were pre-extracted in 0.25% Triton X-100 buffered in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min and fixed for 10 min in 3.5% paraformaldehyde. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as previously described using either mouse anti-CENP A (1/250; Abcam), rabbit anti-CENP B (1/100; Abcam), or mouse anti-CENP C (1/250; Abcam) for 2 h. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were used for detection as previously described. The cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Imaging was performed using conventional microscopy. Stacks of 20 images every 0.2 μm were collected and analyzed in 30–50 mitosis cells. Student's t tests were performed using S-PLUS® 6.2 (Lucent Technologies). HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure with pBOS-H2B-GFP (BD PharMingen) 16 h before KMT1F siRNA (SiRKMT1F-3) transfection. Imaging was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences UltraView RS Nipkow-Disk system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a times 63/1.4NA objective. Stacks of 14 images every 1.5 μm were collected every 90 s with a cooled CCD Hamamatsu ORCA II ER camera, and maximum intensity Z projections were done for each time point using an ImageJ grouped Z projector plug-in. In vivo protein DNA cross-linking was carried out as described (18Magdinier F. Yusufzai T.M. Felsenfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25381-25389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for total H3 (Abcam), H3K9me3 (Upstate), or IgG (Sigma) were incubated with protein A-clarified chromatin overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. DNA samples were quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Real-time PCR experiments were performed with a LightCycler and Stratagene systems and using either the Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Roche Diagnostics) or a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fold enrichment of target sequence from antibody-bound chromatin DNA (immunoprecipitation (IP)) compared with input (Ref) was calculated using the equation, 2ΔCt(IP)−Ct(Ref). The sequence of the primers are available upon request. The classification of KMT1F as a member of the histone H3K9 HMTase family (6Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) prompted us to test its function on the methylation of histone H3 in human cells. For this purpose, we raised a polyclonal antibody by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the nonconserved region of the bifurcated SET motif (Fig. 1A). Indirect immunofluorescence experiments performed with this antibody in 293T interphase cells reveal a diffuse nuclear signal with intense foci as well as larger and more diffuse ones (Fig. 1B) that overlap with DAPI-intense regions in interphase nuclei but are not associated with chromosomes at mitosis (Fig. 1D and supplemental Figs. S1A and S3B). The absence of intense foci when immunofluorescence was performed in the presence of the peptide used for the immunization confirms the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 1B) and the enrichment of KMT1F at nuclear foci. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that the antibody recognizes a 84-kDa product corresponding to the expected size of the endogenous KMT1F protein (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and a transiently expressed flagged form of KMT1F (supplemental Fig. S1B). To investigate the biological function of KMT1F, we designed three small interfering duplex RNAs targeting different parts of the KMT1F mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1C). The levels of KMT1F mRNA (Fig. S1D) and protein (Fig. 1C, rows 1–3 for cells transfected with SiRKMT1F and supplemental Fig. S1B) were significantly decreased after transient transfection of these siRNA in 293T cells. The siRNA at position 1851 (SiRKMT1F-3) gives a reduction of 75–80% in the level of KMT1F mRNA (supplemental Figs. S1D and S2A) and was selected for further analysis. Also, transfection of the different siRNAs decreases the signal corresponding to the endogenous KMT1F protein after immunofluorescent labeling (Fig. 1D), showing that KMT1F is a detectable nuclear protein that can be efficiently depleted to be further analyzed by different methods using the antibody that we developed. We next investigated the involvement of KMT1F in the distribution of H3K9 methylation. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with either a negative control siRNA or the SiRKMT1F-3, and the distribution of H3K9 methylation was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B) and Western blot (supplemental Fig. S2B). KMT1F depletion does not affect mono- and dimethylation of H3K9 residues as seen by indirect immunofluorescence at different stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A) or by Western blot (supplemental Fig. S2B). In cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2B), H3K9me3 can be detected as a diffuse signal with a few intense foci in interphase cells (Fig. 2B) that overlap with DAPI-intense regions during mitosis. In cells transfected with KMT1F siRNA (Fig. 2B), H3K9me3 staining remains diffuse during interphase, whereas it is significantly reduced upon KMT1F depletion in metaphasic cells (Fig. 2B). This effect is reproducibly observed with each of the three KMT1F-specific siRNAs by Western blotting, ruling out an off target effect of the siRNA transfection. These results indicate that KMT1F depletion is not associated with global changes in the level of H3K9 methylation (mono- and di-) but rather specifically implicated in the trimethylation of histone H3K9 residues with a more pronounced effect for metaphase chromosomes. Confirming the prediction made from sequence analysis of SET proteins (6Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), in vitro experiments indicate that the full-length KMT1F or the SET domain immunoprecipitated from 293T cells can catalyze the trimethylation of purified substrate (Fig. 1E) and suggest that KMT1F/SETDB2/CLLD8 is a functional member of the HMTase family. To further investigate the biological function of this protein and compare it with SUV39H1, another HMTase involved in chromosome condensation, we transiently reduced the expression of either KMT1F or SUV39H1 by transient transfection of different siRNA. The efficiency of SUV39H1 depletion was determined by reverse transcription real-time PCR detection and reaches 75% but does not affect KMT1F expression (supplemental Fig. S2A). Depletion in any or both of these two proteins decreases the level of H3K9me3 (supplemental Fig. S2B) but has little effect on mono- and dimethylation, suggesting that both are implicated in the trimethylation of H3K9. We then evaluated the distribution of H3K9me3 for different repetitive DNA elements by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2C). In control cells, as expected, we observed a significant enrichment of histone trimethylation for different classes of DNA repeats such as interspersed (LINE 1, AluY subclass), pericentric (Satellite 2), and centromeric repeats (α-Satellite). This enrichment is clearly decreased at pericentromeres and interspersed LINE 1 sequences when the expression of KMT1F or SUV39H1 is impaired, whereas the effect is more moderate for the other sequences analyzed (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we propose that KMT1F plays a role in defining the higher order chromatin structure, together with SUV39H1. However, consistent with the changes of the methylation pattern of repetitive sequences dispersed throughout the genome (AluY and LINE 1), our results do not rule out a broader activity at euchromatic loci. The H3K9me3 is a constitutive mark of condensed chromatin and regulates the distribution of the heterochromatin proteins HP1 (19Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat.

Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized a role for KMT1F in the formation of heterochromatin and examined the colocalization of KMT1F with HP1α foci by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. S3A). In control cells, we observed that large HP1 foci (>1 μm) are always associated with KMT1F staining (average of 3.7 colocalizations/cell in >1-μm foci, 50 cells), suggesting that both proteins might be targeted to constitutive heterochromatin. The overexpression of KMT1F (pKMT1F) results in an intense diffuse nuclear signal for both HP1 and KMT1F, whereas inhibition of either KMT1F or SUV39H1 expression disorganizes HP1 dots, suggesting a close connection between these two proteins and HP1 in interphase (supplemental Fig. S3A). Thus, at this step, we conclude that KMT1F participates in the distribution of H3K9me3 on repetitive DNA and recruitment of HP1, thereby contributing to chromatin organization. The transient accumulation of KMT1F at a DAPI-intense region and the effect of KMT1F depletion on histone methylation of different classes of repeated elements, especially at centromeres and pericentromeres, suggest that this protein might participate in chromosome condensation and consequently influence mitosis. Indeed, the constitutive heterochromatin formed at centromeres epigenetically regulates their function, and perturbation of proper condensation of these regions can lead to aberrant gene expression and defective chromosome segregation (22Melcher M. Schmid M. Aagaard L. Selenko P. Laible G. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3728-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis, we first analyzed the distribution of the centromeric specific proteins CENP A, B, and C using CREST antibody and H3K9me3 after knockdown of either KMT1F, SUV39H1, or both in 293T cells (supplemental Fig. S3B). Inhibition of the two SET proteins results in a massive loss of the CREST signal, suggesting that inhibition of histone H3 methylation affects the assembly of centromeric heterochromatin and kinetochore. We then used different antibodies against individual CENP proteins and showed that CENP A, B, and C signals are decreased by either KMT1F or SUV39H1 transiently knocked down with a higher effect for CENP B and C staining at mitotic chromosomes (p < 0.001; Fig. 3). We then reasoned that the reduced methylation of constitutive heterochromatin after KMT1F knockdown might lead to cell cycle defects, and we followed the progression of the cells throughout the cycle by live cell confocal imaging after transient transfection of siRNA against KMT1F in HeLa cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Prior to these experiments, KMT1F staining was verified in this cell line, and similar results were observed compared with 293T cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). Then we observed that mitotic progression from prophase to anaphase was delayed in HeLa cells transfected with KMT1F siRNA (from 24 to 70 min in control and KMT1F-depleted cells, respectively; Fig. 4B and supplemental movie) and was associated with the presence of lagging chromosomes (at 24 and 27 min; Fig. 4A), suggesting that reduction in the level of KMT1F affects progression into mitosis as previously observed for SUV39H1 (21Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schöfer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In addition, inspection of mitoses in cells with a reduced level of KMT1F revealed a global disorganization of the tubulin pattern (Fig. 4C) and a significant increase in mitotic cells with abnormal spindle (Fig. 4D), suggesting a key role for KMT1F in the regulation of cell cycle progression. However, no overlap was seen between KMT1F and H3K9me3 staining during mitosis (supplemental Fig. S4B).FIGURE 4KMT1F depletion delays mitosis.

D, histograms represent the rate of mitotic figures with either normal or abnormal spindle in 293T cells transfected with a control siRNA (3250 cells analyzed, n = 100 cells in metaphasis, 1.53% of necrotic cells), SiRKMT1F-1 (1386 cells analyzed, n = 6 cells in metaphases, 58% of necrotic cells), and SiRKMT1F-3 (852 cells analyzed, n = 55 cells in metaphasis, 2% of necrotic cells). The significant differences are indicated with asterisks (*, p < 0.001). The p values were calculated using a t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the long term consequence of KMT1F inhibition, we stably integrated a Tet-inducible short hairpin RNA against KMT1F into 293T cells (Fig. 5A). Several clones were selected and characterized, and short hairpin RNA production was induced for several days (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5A). Again, the inhibition of KMT1F confirms the importance of this protein in the regulation of the cell cycle as shown by the increase in cells with abnormal metaphases (Fig. 5B) and multinucleated cells after induction (7.56% versus 1.23% for A7 clone, p < 0.001 and 5.6% versus 0% for A9, p < 0.001 in induced versus noninduced cells; p value was determined by a t test). Moreover, consistent with the delayed anaphase transition and lagging chromosomes detected in transiently transfected cells, the presence in doxycyclin-induced cells of hyperploidy (12% of polyploid cells, 6 days after induction of KMT1F short hairpin RNA compared with 4% in mock-treated cells) and micronuclei, indicative of aberrant segregation, supports the conclusion that the KMT1F defect alters cell cycle progression (Fig. 5C). Collectively, our data show that mitosis is impaired in KMT1F-depleted cells, resulting in delayed chromosome congression and segregation and, consequently, increased polyploidy in daughter cells, suggesting the involvement of this protein in the regulation of the cell cycle, probably through the methylation of histone H3. The neighbor-joining tree of SET domain proteins present in public databases assigned KMT1F (or SETDB2 or CLLD8) as the closest homolog to ESET/SETDB1 (6Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 7Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. Pillus L.

The type and position of domains along both proteins suggest that they belong to the HMTase family. In agreement with previous studies showing that the SET and bifurcated SET can be a signature for lysine methyltransferase, we provide the first evidence that KMT1F is indeed a functional member of the HMTase family and harbors a modest but significant HMTase activity compared with the SET domains of SUV39H1 and G9a (p < 0.005). We also show that KMT1F specifically regulates the levels of H3K9me3 in human cells. KMT1F transiently accumulates at DAPI-intense regions and colocalizes with HP1 foci, suggesting a close connection between this protein and formation of constitutive heterochromatin. Depletion of KMT1F results in the loss of HP1 and H3K9me3 enrichment and alters CENP epitope (CREST) staining by decreasing the association of the α-satellite-bound CENP B and CENP C distribution and CENP A. Moreover, KMT1F-dependent reduction in H3K9me3 delays mitosis likely because of a defect in chromosome segregation. Similar phenotypes have been described for SUV39H1 (21Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schöfer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3728-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or after depletion of the yeast homolog, Clr4 (23Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J.P. Borgstrøm B. Egel R. Cranston G. Allshire R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2637-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a functional redundancy between SUV39H1 and KMT1F (supplemental Table S1). SUV39H1 is localized at centromeres throughout metaphase and could participate in the recruitment of HP1α, which modulates the targeting of the INCENP complex during mitotic spindle formation (24Ainsztein A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Mackay A.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The defect in chromosome segregation observed upon KMT1F depletion might also result from an impaired sister chromatin cohesion. Therefore, we propose that together with SUV39H1, the KMT1F-dependent H3K9 methylation participates in heterochromatin formation and that this previously uncharacterized protein contributes to centromere and pericentromere organization and mitotic chromosome functions. However, consistent with the modification of histone methylation pattern at Alu and LINE interspersed repetitive DNA, the resolution of our immunofluorescence analysis does not rule out a genome-wide activity. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been recently shown that KMT1F associates with SETDB1 and contributes to the methylation of the TAT protein from human immunodeficiency virus (25Van Duyne R.

Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein regulates methylation at different levels. Interestingly, if SUV39h1 invalidation does not completely abrogate H3K9 trimethylation, it results in a more diffuse and modified pattern in mouse cells (26Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19489-19500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, SETDB1/KMT1E, which is mainly involved in the regulation of euchromatic sequence and associates with corepressors at silenced promoters (29Li H. Rauch T. Chen Z.X. Szabó P.E. Riggs A.D. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19489-19500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was also found to modulate H3K9 trimethylation at pericentric heterochromatin and to interact with HP1 (30Lee J.

Brown J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may also contribute to heterochromatin formation. Thus, the mechanism by which KMT1F modulates histone methylation is currently unknown, but despite the fact that SUV39H, G9a, and KMT1F modify the same residue, they may also play unique roles in the distribution of H3K9me3 and/or involve different protein complexes or noncoding RNAs (28Wu R. Terry A.V. Singh P.B. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Kourmouli N. Sun Y.M. van der Sar S. Singh P.B. Brown J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These last 10 years, a direct link between DNA methylation and organization of the chromatin fiber has been clearly demonstrated by the identification of large complexes containing proteins with affinity for methylated DNA, histones deacetylases, and HMTases. Thus, it became apparent that histone modification has an important role in regulating methylated DNA. The fact that KMT1F, like ESET/SETDB1, contains a MBD raises the possibility that histone methylation functions in concert with DNA methylation. Enzymes like SUV39H1 might be involved in the writing of the epigenetic mark by methylating lysine 9 residues, whereas enzymes containing MBD motifs are involved in the reading of the methylation marks at CpG sites. One can speculate that the MBD of KMT1F would serve as a platform for the subsequent methylation of H3K9 and then HP1 binding. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the mouse pericentric regions (32Lehnertz B. Ueda Y. Derijck A.A. Braunschweig U. Perez-Burgos L. Kubicek S. Chen T. Li E. Jenuwein T. Peters A.H. Curr.

Recent studies have suggested that Wnt signaling may be essential for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. However, the direct effect of a Wnt protein on synaptic transmission had not been demonstrated. Here we show that nanomolar concentrations of purified Wnt3a protein rapidly increase the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents in embryonic rat hippocampal neurons through a mechanism involving a fast influx of calcium from the extracellular space, induction of post-translational modifications on the machinery involved in vesicle exocytosis in the presynaptic terminal leading to spontaneous Ca(2+) transients. Our results identify the Wnt3a protein and a member of its complex receptor at the membrane, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) coreceptor, as key molecules in neurotransmission modulation and suggest cross-talk between canonical and Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling in central neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2070664727,"Oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria requires the synthesis of proteins encoded in the mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial translation machinery differs significantly from that of the bacterial ancestor of the organelle. This is especially evident from many mitochondria-specific ribosomal proteins. An important site of the ribosome is the polypeptide tunnel exit. Here, nascent chains are exposed to an aqueous environment for the first time. Many biogenesis factors interact with the tunnel exit of pro- and eukaryotic ribosomes to help the newly synthesized proteins to mature. To date, nothing is known about the organization of the tunnel exit of mitochondrial ribosomes. We therefore undertook a comprehensive approach to determine the composition of the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal tunnel exit. Mitochondria contain homologues of the ribosomal proteins located at this site in bacterial ribosomes. Here, we identified proteins located in their proximity by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed a complex network of interacting proteins including proteins and protein domains specific to mitochondrial ribosomes. This network includes Mba1, the membrane-bound ribosome receptor of the inner membrane, as well as Mrpl3, Mrpl13, and Mrpl27, which constitute ribosomal proteins exclusively found in mitochondria. This unique architecture of the tunnel exit is presumably an adaptation of the translation system to the specific requirements of the organelle."

IntroductionEndochondral ossification, one of the two major modes of bone formation, is responsible for the formation of limb bones (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 2Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Within developing limb buds, mesenchymal progenitor cells form condensations, in which chondrocytes and perichondrial cells differentiate in the core and in the periphery, respectively. Hypertrophic chondrocytes direct perichondrial cell differentiation into osteoblasts, whereas perichondrial cell signaling regulates proliferation and hypertrophic changes in chondrocytes. These differentiation processes are governed by an intricate signaling network involving secreted morphogens and growth factors, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenic proteinHSheparan sulfateHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanMHEmultiple hereditary exostoses. fibroblast growth factors, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), parathyroid hormone-related hormone, and WNT proteins (1Kronenberg H.M.

Biochem. 2005; 95: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play critical roles in many developmental processes. Many growth factors and morphogens, including those that play a role in skeletal development, exhibit affinities for the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs (4Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 5Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of HS in skeletal development is also illustrated by the presence of a human bone disorder caused by genetic defects in enzymes involved in HS synthesis. Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of multiple osteochondromas as well as by limb bone deformity and is caused by hemizygous mutation of Ext1, which encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for HS synthesis (6Duncan G. McCormick C. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutations of Ext2, which encodes an EXT1-related protein that forms heterodimers with EXT1, also cause MHE.To determine the molecular mechanism of HS action in skeletal development, we ablated HS synthesis in the limb skeletal system using the conditional Ext1flox allele (8Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1044-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the Prx1-Cre transgene (9Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis of conditional Ext1 mutants and in vitro experiments using Ext1-deficient mesenchymal cells reveal that HS is essential for normal development of the limb skeleton, especially in the context f the development and patterning of mesenchymal condensations. Our result suggests that BMP signaling is one of the focal points of HS involvement in this developmental process.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the use of the conditional Ext1 null allele and the Prx1-Cre transgene to determine the role of HS in skeletal development. The phenotype of conditional Ext1 mutants was significantly different from that of mice homozygous for the gene-trapped Ext1Gt allele (20Koziel L. Kunath M. Kelly O.G. Vortkamp A. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 801-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), especially in terms of the penetrance and expressivity of phenotypes. The variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of phenotypes in Ext1Gt/Gt mutants are likely attributable to alternative splicing around the insertion site (28Stanford W.L. Cohn J.B. Cordes S.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 756-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In contrast, Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mutants invariably survive until birth, exhibiting complete penetrance and consistent expressivity of skeletal phenotypes (see Table 1). These features of the conditional Ext1 ablation model reveal that the role of HS in skeletal development is more extensive than that deduced from the analysis of Ext1Gt/Gt mutants. Our data indicate that at least three aspects of limb skeletal development require normal expression of HS, namely development of mesenchymal condensations, patterning of digits, and joint development. Considering the known role of HS in morphogen binding, it is likely that the absence of HS disrupts some aspect(s) of morphogen signaling that is critical for each of these developmental processes.Our phenotypic analysis suggests that abnormal patterning and development of mesenchymal condensations provide the primary basis for the severely shortened and malformed limb bones of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice. It has been shown that BMP signaling plays a major role in the development of mesenchymal condensations (22Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 24Yoon B.S. Ovchinnikov D.A. Yoshii I. Mishina Y. Behringer R.R. Lyons K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our analyses with the anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibody indicate that the robustness and spatial range of BMP signaling in developing condensations is indeed compromised in the absence of HS, demonstrating the physiological importance of HS in BMP function during this developmental process.To further understand the physiological importance of HS in BMP signaling, it is of interest to compare the phenotype of Ext1 mutant mice with those of other mutant mice. Notably, the phenotypes of mice with mutations in several other morphogenic signaling pathways, including the fibroblast growth factor, Ihh, Wnt, and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways, are distinct from that of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice (21St-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 32Li C. Xu X. Nelson D.K. Williams T. Kuehn M.R. Deng C.X.

Development. 2004; 131: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice with mutations in the BMP pathway share interesting phenotypic similarities with Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice, especially in terms of the development of condensations. Conditional knock-out of two of the BMP receptor genes, Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b, almost completely inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of condensations (24Yoon B.S. Ovchinnikov D.A. Yoshii I. Mishina Y. Behringer R.R. Lyons K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5062-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The level of inhibition of chondrogenesis and the resulting skeletal phenotype of these Bmpr1a/Bmpr1b compound mutant mice are much more severe than that of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice. On the other hand, chondrogenesis proceeds with a slight delay even in the absence of Bmp2 and Bmp4, the two major BMP species expressed in the developing limb skeletal elements (37Bandyopadhyay A. Tsuji K. Cox K. Harfe B.D. Rosen V. Tabin C.J. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e216Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This phenotype of Bmp2/Bmp4 compound mutants resembles that of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice, in which chondrogenesis is also delayed but eventually achieved (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, Bmp2/Bmp4 compound mutants are not reported to have the abnormal condensation morphology observed in Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice. It is somewhat surprising that the absence of both BMP2 and BMP4 does not produce a more severe phenotype than the absence of HS. This may be due to the action of other BMPs, such as BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 (37Bandyopadhyay A. Tsuji K. Cox K. Harfe B.D. Rosen V. Tabin C.J. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e216Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Such a scenario would also suggest that the regulatory role of HS extends to multiple BMP species. Another possibility that cannot be entirely ruled out is that the condensation phenotype of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice includes the effect of HS elimination on signaling pathway(s) other than the BMP pathway.HS is thought to regulate signaling by a number of HS-binding morphogens and growth factors by diverse, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms. In the cases of FGF2 and netrin-1, HS acts as an essential coreceptor, for ligand interaction with the cognate receptors that activate downstream signaling (38Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 39Matsumoto Y. Irie F. Inatani M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our analysis of mutant limb buds and micromass cultures revealed that the intensity of BMP signaling is somewhat impaired, but not entirely abolished, in the absence of HS. These results are not consistent with the model in which HS acts as an obligatory coreceptor for BMPs. Rather, our results suggest that HS simply sequesters BMPs within and in close proximity to condensations without the necessity of HS interaction with cognate receptors for the ligands. This mechanism could serve to maintain high concentrations of BMPs near the cell surface to provide sustained, high intensity signals in developing tissues. The diffuse and weakened chondrogenesis of mutant condensations is likely to be due to the increased diffusion of BMPs in the absence of HS.One of the limitations of this study is that it does not allow precise dissection of the direct effect of HS on BMPs from indirect effects through Noggin, one of the BMP antagonists, which also binds HS (40Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that there is no indication, from either our in vivo or in vitro results, that BMP signaling is enhanced in the absence of HS. This observation does not appear to be consistent with the model that HS is required for BMP antagonism by Noggin, because loss of HS should reduce this antagonism.Although our results indicate that regulation of BMP signaling is an important role of HS during early skeletal development, the phenotype of Prx1-Cre;Ext1flox/flox mice suggests additional HS targets. First, a severe autopod phenotype suggests that HS plays a critical role in digit patterning. It is conceivable that cross-talk between the ectoderm and mesenchyme during the early phase of limb bud patterning, which is mediated by the HS-binding morphogens Shh and FGF4 (41Laufer E. Nelson C.E. Johnson R.L. Morgan B.A. Tabin C. Cell. 1994; 79: 993-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), is also physiologically regulated by HS. Second, the agenesis of joints suggests a pervasive role for HS in the signaling events that control joint formation. Wnt/catenin signaling, known to play a pivotal role in specifying joints (42Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 43Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), is a likely target of HS in this process, because Wnt proteins are bound to and modulated by HS (44Bradley R.S. Brown A.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 45Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Although HS deficiency due to mutation of Ext1 (or Ext2) is undoubtedly the primary cause of MHE, the molecular mechanism leading to the formation of osteochondromas remains elusive. In this vein, it is interesting to note that patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, which is caused by constitutively activating mutations in the BMP receptor AVCR1, often develop multiple osteochondromas that resemble those in MHE (46Deirmengian G.K. Hebela N.M. O'Connell M. Glaser D.L. Shore E.M. Kaplan F.S. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2008; 90: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This observation resonates with our present finding that the BMP signaling pathway is a major target of the regulatory function of HS during skeletal development. Dysregulation of BMP signaling may be a mechanism of osteochondroma formation in MHE. Further analyses of Ext1 conditional knock-out mice may shed light on the molecular mechanism of MHE pathogenesis. IntroductionEndochondral ossification, one of the two major modes of bone formation, is responsible for the formation of limb bones (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 2Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Within developing limb buds, mesenchymal progenitor cells form condensations, in which chondrocytes and perichondrial cells differentiate in the core and in the periphery, respectively. Hypertrophic chondrocytes direct perichondrial cell differentiation into osteoblasts, whereas perichondrial cell signaling regulates proliferation and hypertrophic changes in chondrocytes. These differentiation processes are governed by an intricate signaling network involving secreted morphogens and growth factors, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenic proteinHSheparan sulfateHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanMHEmultiple hereditary exostoses. fibroblast growth factors, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), parathyroid hormone-related hormone, and WNT proteins (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 3Colnot C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play critical roles in many developmental processes. Many growth factors and morphogens, including those that play a role in skeletal development, exhibit affinities for the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs (4Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 5Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of HS in skeletal development is also illustrated by the presence of a human bone disorder caused by genetic defects in enzymes involved in HS synthesis. Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of multiple osteochondromas as well as by limb bone deformity and is caused by hemizygous mutation of Ext1, which encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for HS synthesis (6Duncan G. McCormick C. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutations of Ext2, which encodes an EXT1-related protein that forms heterodimers with EXT1, also cause MHE.To determine the molecular mechanism of HS action in skeletal development, we ablated HS synthesis in the limb skeletal system using the conditional Ext1flox allele (8Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1044-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the Prx1-Cre transgene (9Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis of conditional Ext1 mutants and in vitro experiments using Ext1-deficient mesenchymal cells reveal that HS is essential for normal development of the limb skeleton, especially in the context f the development and patterning of mesenchymal condensations. Our result suggests that BMP signaling is one of the focal points of HS involvement in this developmental process."

Low circulating phosphate levels impair hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis, whereas treatment of these cells with phosphate activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Because phosphate-mediated apoptosis of chondrocytes is differentiation-dependent, studies were performed to identify factors that contribute to hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis.

Maturation of the growth of long bones is dependent upon the differentiation of proliferative chondrocytes into prehypertrophic and subsequently hypertrophic chondrocytes. Terminal differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes is characterized by the expression of signaling molecules that promote vascular invasion, apoptosis, and replacement of hypertrophic chondrocytes by osteoblasts that lay down the primary spongiosa of bone. Aberrant regulation of this developmental process results in growth plate disorders. Although calcium has been shown to play an important role in regulating chondrocyte maturation (1Chang W. Tu C. Pratt S. Chen T.H. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), apoptosis of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes is dependent upon normal levels of circulating phosphate (2Sabbagh Y.

In vivo investigations in genetically modified and dietary-manipulated mouse models demonstrate that hypophosphatemia is the underlying metabolic abnormality that impairs growth plate maturation in these disorders: low circulating phosphate levels result in impaired apoptosis of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, leading to rickets (2Sabbagh Y.

In vitro investigations demonstrate that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated by phosphate, resulting in caspase-9 cleavage and induction of hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. Treatment of wild-type mice with caspase-9 inhibitors confirmed a critical role for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis and growth plate maturation in vivo (2Sabbagh Y. Carpenter T.O. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).

Because proliferative chondrocytes are not susceptible to phosphate-mediated apoptosis, studies were performed to determine whether primary proliferating chondrocytes acquire an increased susceptibility to phosphate-induced apoptosis during differentiation and to identify pathways that contribute to activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by phosphate. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from ventral rib cages of newborn mice by sequential collagenase II digestions and plated onto gelatin-coated plates at a density of 3 × 105/cm2 as described previously (2Sabbagh Y.

Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the APO LOGIX JC-1 mitochondrial potential detection kit (Bachem). The cationic dye JC-1 accumulates and aggregates in intact mitochondria, emitting a bright red fluorescence. With disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial aggregates do not form, but rather the dye remains in monomeric form in the cytoplasm, emitting green fluorescence. Chondrocytes were incubated with JC-1 for 15 min in medium at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then placed on ice until being subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data analyses were performed using FlowJo v8.7.1 software. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine, which is externalized to the outer cell membrane in early apoptosis. Chondrocytes were treated overnight with control anion or phosphate prior to evaluation of annexin V binding using a Guava PCA system and Guava Nexin reagents. Chondrocytes were lysed in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles. Protein concentration was calculated using the BCA protein assay, following which 10 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Caspase-9 cleavage, Akt phosphorylation, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were visualized using primary polyclonal antibodies against caspase-9, phospho-Akt, Erk1/2, and phospho-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody and visualized using ECL PlusTM (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on an Opticon DNA engine (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The expression of the genes of interest was normalized to that of actin in each sample using the formula of Livak and Schmittgen (11Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Animals were maintained in a virus- and parasite-free barrier facility and exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle.

In situ hybridization was performed on fixed frozen or paraffin sections using 35S-UTP-labeled antisense RNA probes as described previously (4Donohue M.M. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3691-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The presence of endothelial cells was evaluated using an anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences). Metatarsals were isolated from day 15.5 post-coitum C57BL/6J embryos and cultured in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.25% defined fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, antibiotic/antimycotic, sodium pyruvate, and sodium phosphate at a final concentration of 1.25 mm (control) or 0.05 mm. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, RNA was isolated from six pooled metatarsals for each condition (RNeasy mini kit) (14Zalutskaya A.A. Cox M.K. Demay M.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 108: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to identify significant differences. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Previous investigations have demonstrated that neither 3T3 fibroblastic cells nor primary chondrocytes in the proliferative phase of differentiation are susceptible to caspase-9 activation by phosphate in vitro (2Sabbagh Y. Carpenter T.O. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine whether the susceptibility of hypertrophic versus proliferative chondrocytes to phosphate-mediated apoptosis was associated with a differentiation-dependent decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and/or a decrease in ΔΨ in response to phosphate, the percentage of cells with low ΔΨ was examined over the course of chondrocyte differentiation in vitro. Mitochondrial membrane integrity was evaluated using the cationic dye JC-1, a highly specific probe for detecting changes in mitochondrial ΔΨ. JC-1 forms red aggregates in intact mitochondria. However, permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane leads to a decrease in the electrochemical gradient across the membrane, resulting in the release of green fluorescent JC-1 monomers into the cytosol. A 3.2-fold increase in the percentage of cells with low ΔΨ was observed in chondrocytes cultured in differentiation medium for 5 versus 14 days (Fig. 1A, white bars). In addition, sodium phosphate treatment (Fig. 1A, black bars) significantly increased the percentage of cells with low ΔΨ cultured for 14 days, but not at earlier time points. To confirm that this was associated with apoptosis, annexin V binding was evaluated. Annexin binds to phosphatidylserine, which is exteriorized during apoptosis. The increase in the number of cells with low ΔΨ was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in annexin V-labeled cells in response to phosphate treatment at 14 days in culture (4.7 ± 0.3% to 8.6 ± 0.2%). Phosphate had no effect on annexin V binding by proliferative chondrocytes at 5 days in culture. To substantiate that these changes in JC-1 fluorescence and annexin V binding in response to phosphate treatment correlated with hypertrophic differentiation, RT-PCR analyses were performed to evaluate the expression of osteopontin, a marker of late hypertrophic chondrocytes. A significant increase in osteopontin expression was observed between 7 and 14 days in culture (Fig. 1B), correlating with an increase in the number of cells with low ΔΨ, their susceptibility to reduction in ΔΨ by phosphate, and the ability of phosphate to induce cleavage of caspase-9 (Fig. 1C). Chondrocytes cultured for 2 weeks under conditions that promote hypertrophic differentiation were then treated with control anion or sodium phosphate for a period of 30 min to 2 h to examine the time course of caspase-9 activation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, cleavage of caspase-9 was observed as early as 30 min post-exposure to 7 mm phosphate. Initial investigations examining phosphate-induced caspase-9 activation were performed with 7 mm phosphate, a level analogous to that in the circulation of the late gestational fetus (2Sabbagh Y. Carpenter T.O. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To examine whether lower levels of phosphate were also able to activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hypertrophic chondrocytes, dose-response studies were performed. These investigations demonstrated that caspase-9 was cleaved within 1 h of exposure to 5 mm phosphate and, to a lesser extent, to 3 mm phosphate (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Time course and dose response of phosphate-mediated hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. Hypertrophic chondrocytes were exposed to control anion (C; sodium chloride or sodium sulfate) or phosphate (Pi; sodium phosphate) prior to evaluation of caspase-9 activation by Western analyses. A, cells were treated with control anion or phosphate at a concentration of 7 mm for 30 min to 2 h. B, cells were treated for 1 h with 3, 5, or 7 mm control anion or phosphate. Upper bands represent total caspase-9, and the arrows to the bands representing cleaved caspase-9. Data are representative of those obtained from three independent chondrocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the rapid activation of caspase-9 following treatment of hypertrophic chondrocytes with phosphate, studies were performed to determine whether a specific signal transduction pathway could be implicated in this process. Studies by other investigators have demonstrated activation of Erk1/2 upon exposure of clonal and primary murine chondrocytes to 10 mm phosphate (15Julien M. Magne D. Masson M. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Chassande O. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Cherel Y. Weiss P. Guicheux J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the doses of phosphate capable of activating caspase-9 could reproduce this effect or activate alternative signaling pathways, hypertrophic chondrocytes were treated with 7 mm sodium phosphate or control anion for 60 min. Although phosphate treatment did not alter Akt phosphorylation, Erk phosphorylation was markedly induced by phosphate (Fig. 3A). Phosphate treatment of proliferative chondrocytes did not induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Time course studies demonstrated that Erk phosphorylation was induced in hypertrophic chondrocytes as early as 5 min post-exposure to phosphate, peaked at 15 min, and was sustained for 2 h (Fig. 3C). To determine whether Erk activation could be implicated in the apoptotic process, cells were pretreated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 prior to exposure to phosphate. As shown in Fig. 3D, a 1-h pretreatment of chondrocytes with 30 μm U0126, a dose previously shown to inhibit Erk1/2 phosphorylation and phosphate-induced matrix Gla protein mRNA expression (15Julien M. Magne D. Masson M. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Chassande O. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Cherel Y. Weiss P. Guicheux J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), prevented caspase-9 cleavage in response to 3 and 5 mm phosphate and markedly impaired caspase-9 activation in response to 7 mm phosphate. To investigate the relevance of these data to in vivo maturation of the growth plate, Erk phosphorylation was inhibited by treating wild-type mice twice daily for 4 days with U0126 or vehicle. This resulted in a decrease in phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity in the growth plate associated with expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, characterized by an increase in the region of collagen type X- and vascular endothelial growth factor-expressing chondrocytes. Impairment of Erk1/2 phosphorylation did not alter blood vessel invasion based on immunohistochemistry for the endothelial cell marker CD31 (Fig. 4B). However, a decrease in apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes as assessed by TUNEL labeling (Fig. 4B, middle panels, arrowheads) and cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed. Thus, these data confirm that Erk phosphorylation is required for normal growth plate maturation, including hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. Characterization of the growth plate of mice killed 10 days post-U0126 treatment demonstrated reversal of this phenotype. To address whether impaired Erk1/2 phosphorylation could be implicated in the rachitic phenotype observed in hypophosphatemic states, studies were performed to address the effect of phosphate restriction on Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Cultured metatarsals from day 15.5 mouse embryos have been used by numerous investigators to characterize factors that regulate endochondral bone formation. Metatarsal elements were therefore isolated from wild-type embryos and cultured for 24 h under control (1.25 mm) or phosphate-restricted (0.05 mm) conditions. As shown in Fig. 5A, metatarsals cultured under control conditions demonstrated significant phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity in the region of hypertrophic chondrocytes (bracketed region, shown externally in high power). However, phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity was markedly attenuated under phosphate-restricted conditions. A number of signaling molecules have been shown to regulate the maturation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes. Although Erk phosphorylation associated with activation of FGFR3 impairs chondrocyte differentiation, lack of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) leads to increased Erk phosphorylation and apoptosis (16Amizuka N. Henderson J.E. Hoshi K. Warshawsky H. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5055-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies were undertaken to address whether alterations in PTHrP expression could be implicated in the chondrocyte phenotype observed with phosphate restriction. RNA was isolated from three independent pools of six metatarsals for each condition and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5B, phosphate restriction led to a 2.5-fold increase in PTHrP mRNA levels but did not alter expression of the mRNAs encoding BMP2 or FGF18 (data not shown). To address whether impaired Erk1/2 phosphorylation in hypertrophic chondrocytes is observed under hypophosphatemic conditions in vivo, the growth plates of 1-week-old hyp and wild-type mice were examined. hyp mice are the murine model of the human disorder X-linked hypophosphatemia. These mice exhibit hypophosphatemia by 1 week of age and rickets associated with impaired hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis (2Sabbagh Y. Carpenter T.O. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In contrast to the prominent phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity observed in the growth plates of the wild-type mice, a marked reduction in phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity was observed in the hyp growth plates, consistent with the role of phosphate in activating Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). This was associated with an increase in PTHrP mRNA expression in the periarticular region of the growth plate of the hyp mouse (Fig. 5D). The underlying basis for the susceptibility of hypertrophic chondrocytes to phosphate-mediated apoptosis has led to numerous investigations in cellular models. Chondrocyte hypertrophy in chicken growth plates is accompanied by a loss of thiol, which is thought to increase susceptibility to apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (17Teixeira C.C. Mansfield K. Hertkorn C. Ischiropoulos H. Shapiro I.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C833-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Teixeira C.C. Rajpurohit R. Mansfield K. Nemelivsky Y.V. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner Res. 2003; 18: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Studies in chicken growth plates also demonstrated a maturation-dependent change in mitochondrial morphology accompanied by a decrease in staining with rhodamine 123, a fluorescent dye that binds to the mitochondrial membrane and inhibits transport (19Pucci B. Adams C.S. Fertala J. Snyder B.C. Mansfield K.D. Tafani M. Freeman T. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate a differentiation-dependent decrease in ΔΨ in primary murine chondrocyte cultures based on an increased percentage of JC-1 monomers associated with acquisition of the differentiated phenotype, characterized by nodule formation and expression of osteopontin mRNA. In addition, our investigations demonstrate that exposure of these differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes, but not proliferative chondrocytes, to phosphate causes a further increase in the number of cells with low ΔΨ, confirming that this change in ΔΨ is an important determinant of the susceptibility of hypertrophic chondrocytes to phosphate-mediated apoptosis. Modulation of phosphate-induced apoptosis by Bcl family members also plays a critical role in the susceptibility of hypertrophic chondrocytes to this apoptotic stimulus. Mice with chondrocyte-specific ablation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x demonstrate growth retardation associated with reduction in the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, which is postulated to be due to enhanced apoptosis of these cells (9Oshima Y. Akiyama T. Hikita A. Iwasawa M. Nagase Y. Nakamura M. Wakeyama H. Kawamura N. Ikeda T. Chung U.I. Hennighausen L. Kawaguchi H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26499-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although Bcl-x expression levels are not altered during chondrocyte differentiation, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bnip3 increases with chondrocyte hypertrophy. Thus, the increase in expression of Bnip3 is thought to impair the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-x in hypertrophic chondrocytes, contributing to their susceptibility to phosphate-mediated apoptosis (9Oshima Y. Akiyama T. Hikita A. Iwasawa M. Nagase Y. Nakamura M. Wakeyama H. Kawamura N. Ikeda T. Chung U.I. Hennighausen L. Kawaguchi H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26499-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-9 as early as 1 h after exposure of hypertrophic chondrocytes to phosphate led us to investigate potential signal transduction pathways that could contribute to phosphate-mediated apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Although phosphorylation of Akt was not altered by phosphate, Erk phosphorylation was induced in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in hypertrophic, but not proliferative, chondrocytes. Although it has been shown that induction of matrix Gla protein mRNA expression in chondrocytes in response to 10 mm phosphate requires activation of Erk, the role of Erk phosphorylation in hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis had not been addressed previously. Our investigations, both in vitro in primary murine chondrocytes and in vivo in wild-type mice treated with a MEK1/2 inhibitor that blocks Erk phosphorylation, demonstrate that activation of Erk is required for phosphate-mediated hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate a reduction in phospho-Erk in the growth plates of mice with X-linked hypophosphatemia. Interestingly, studies in murine metatarsal cultures also demonstrate that Erk phosphorylation is associated with hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation (13Provot S. Nachtrab G. Paruch J. Chen A.P. Silva A. Kronenberg H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our studies extend these observations, demonstrating that phosphate restriction leads to an increase in PTHrP mRNA expression and a decrease in Erk phosphorylation in this model of endochondral bone formation. Thus, the role of phospho-Erk in growth plate maturation may be 2-fold: first, to promote chondrocyte differentiation, and second, to promote phosphate-mediated apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes. The observation that PTHrP prevents Erk phosphorylation suggests that the growth plate phenotype of PTHrP-null mice may be due in part to enhanced Erk activation, leading to premature hypertrophy and enhanced apoptosis. Notable in this respect, the hypertrophic chondrocyte region of the PTHrP-null growth plate exhibits evidence of programmed cell death (16Amizuka N. Henderson J.E. Hoshi K. Warshawsky H. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5055-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and PTHrP-null chondrogenic cells have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to apoptosis (20Okoumassoun L.E. Russo C. Denizeau F. Averill-Bates D. Henderson J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 212: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although Erk activation has not been examined in hypertrophic chondrocytes lacking PTHrP, PTHrP has been shown to increase the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, delaying hypertrophy as well as apoptotic cell death in normal mice (21Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and in mice with constitutive activation of FGFR3 (22Ueda K. Yamanaka Y. Harada D. Yamagami E. Tanaka H. Seino Y. Bone. 2007; 41: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These investigations confirm the critical role for phosphate ions in the regulation of growth plate maturation. Although the precise mechanism underlying the rapid activation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by phosphate remains to be elucidated, our studies point to an important role for phosphate in modulation of mitochondrial ΔΨ and of the PTHrP signaling pathway as well as in promoting hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026477507,"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2, Abcc2) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter localized at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes that plays an important role in bile formation and detoxification. Prior in vitro studies suggest that Mrp2 can bind to Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1), a PDZ protein that cross-links membrane proteins to actin filaments. However the role of NHERF-1 in the expression and functional regulation of Mrp2 remains largely unknown. Here we examine the interaction of Mrp2 and NHERF-1 and its physiological significance in HEK293 cells and NHERF-1 knock-out mice. Mrp2 co-precipitated with NHERF-1 in co-transfected HEK293 cells, an interaction that required the PDZ-binding motif of Mrp2. In NHERF-1(-/-) mouse liver, Mrp2 mRNA was unchanged but Mrp2 protein was reduced in whole cell lysates and membrane-enriched fractions to approximately 50% (p < 1 x 10(-6)) and approximately 70% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that the down-regulation of Mrp2 expression was caused by post-transcriptional events. Mrp2 remained localized at the apical/canalicular membrane of NHERF-1(-/-) mouse hepatocytes, although its immunofluorescent labeling was noticeably weaker. Bile flow in NHERF-1(-/-) mice was reduced to approximately 70% (p < 0.001) in association with a 50% reduction in glutathione excretion (p < 0.05) and a 60% reduction in glutathione-methylfluorescein (GS-MF) excretion in isolated mouse hepatocyte (p < 0.01). Bile acid and bilirubin excretion remained unchanged compared with wild-type mice. These findings strongly suggest that NHERF-1 binds to Mrp2, and plays a critical role in the canalicular expression of Mrp2 and its function as a determinant of glutathione-dependent, bile acid-independent bile flow."
https://openalex.org/W1991269237,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) results from mutations in tumor suppressor gene Men1, which encodes nuclear protein menin. Menin up-regulates certain cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors through increasing histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation and inhibits G(0)/G(1) to S phase transition. However, little is known as to whether menin controls G(2)/M-phase transition, another important cell cycle checkpoint. Here, we show that menin expression delays G(2)/M phase transition and reduces expression of Ccnb2 (encoding cyclin B2). Menin associates with the promoter of Ccnb2 and reduces histone H3 acetylation, a positive chromatin marker for gene transcription, at the Ccnb2 locus. Moreover, Men1 ablation leads to an increase in cyclin B2 expression, histone H3 acetylation at the Ccnb2 locus, and G(2)/M transition. In contrast, knockdown of cyclin B2 diminishes the number of cells at M phase and reduces cell proliferation. Furthermore, menin interferes with binding of certain positive transcriptional regulators, such as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), E2 factors (E2Fs), and histone acetyltransferase CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) to the Ccnb2 locus. Notably, MEN1 disease-related mutations, A242V and L22R, abrogate the ability of menin to repress cyclin B2 expression and G(2)/M transition. Both of the mutants fail to reduce the acetylated level of the Ccnb2 locus. Together, these results suggest that menin-mediated repression of cyclin B2 is crucial for inhibiting G(2)/M transition and cell proliferation through a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism for menin-induced suppression of MEN1 tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2118789657,"The mechanisms of hypertrophic scar formation are not fully understood. We previously screened the differentially expressed genes of human hypertrophic scar tissue and identified P311 gene as upregulated. As the activities of P311 in human fibroblast function are unknown, we examined the distribution of it and the effects of forced expression or silencing of expression of P311. P311 expression was detected in fibroblast-like cells from the hypertrophic scar of burn injury patients but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, epidermal cells or normal skin dermal cells. Transfection of fibroblasts with P311 gene stimulated the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), TGF-β1 and α1(I) collagen (COL1A1), and enhanced the contraction of fibroblast populated collagen lattices (FPCL). In contrast, interference of fibroblast P311 gene expression decreased the TGF-β1 mRNA expression and reduced the contraction of fibroblasts in FPCL. These results suggest that P311 may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar via induction of a myofibroblastic phenotype and of functions such as TGF-β1 expression. P311 could be a novel target for the control of hypertrophic scar development."

We further demonstrate an inverse correlation between the binding levels of p53 and Bim to Mcl-1. Thus, enhanced binding of p53 to Mcl-1 involves the disruption of existing complexes between Mcl-1 and Bim.

https://openalex.org/W2085982747,"Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which regulate cell adhesion and migration through their control of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho-GTPases are structurally very similar, with the exception of a hypervariable domain in the C terminus. Using peptide-based pulldown assays in combination with mass spectrometry, we previously showed that the hypervariable domain in Rac1 mediates specific protein-protein interactions. Most recently, we found that the Rac1 C terminus associates to the ubiquitously expressed adapter protein CMS/CD2AP. CD2AP is critical for the formation and maintenance of a specialized cell-cell contact between kidney podocyte foot processes, the slit diaphragm. Here, CD2AP links the cell adhesion protein nephrin to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, CMS/CD2AP binds actin-regulating proteins, such as CAPZ and cortactin, and has been implicated in the internalization of growth factor receptors. We found that CD2AP specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of Rac1 but not with that of other Rho family members. Efficient interaction between Rac1 and CD2AP requires both the proline-rich domain and the poly-basic region in the Rac1 C terminus, and at least two of the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP. CD2AP co-localizes with Rac1 to membrane ruffles, and small interfering RNA-based experiments showed that CD2AP links Rac1 to CAPZ and cortactin. Finally, expression of constitutive active Rac1 recruits CD2AP to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells, where we found CD2AP to participate in the control of the epithelial barrier function. These data identify CD2AP as a novel Rac1-associated adapter protein that participates in the regulation of epithelial cell-cell contact."

Although it has long been hypothesized that these mutations might enhance the populations of marginally-stable aggregation-prone species responsible for cellular toxicity, there has been little quantitative evidence to support this notion. Perturbations of the folding free energy landscapes of metal-free versions of five ALS-inducing variants, A4V, L38V, G93A, L106V and S134N SOD1, were determined with a global analysis of kinetic and thermodynamic folding data for dimeric and stable monomeric versions of these variants. Utilizing this global analysis approach, the perturbations on the global stability in response to mutation can be partitioned between the monomer folding and association steps, and the effects of mutation on the populations of the folded and unfolded monomeric states can be determined. The 2- to 10-fold increase in the population of the folded monomeric state for A4V, L38V and L106V and the 80- to 480-fold increase in the population of the unfolded monomeric states for all but S134N would dramatically increase their propensity for aggregation through high-order nucleation reactions. The wild-type-like populations of these states for the metal-binding region S134N variant suggest that even wild-type SOD1 may also be prone to aggregation in the absence of metals."

To identify the common epigenetic signatures of both the individual matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the additional genes, the function of which is also linked to proteolysis, migration, and tumorigenesis, we performed epigenetic profiling of 486 selected genes in unrelated non-migratory MCF-7 breast carcinoma and highly migratory U251 glioma cells. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and microRNA analyses were used to support the results of our epigenetic studies. Transcriptional silencing in both glioma and breast carcinoma cells predominantly involved the repressive histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark. In turn, epigenetic stimulation was primarily performed through a gain in the histone H3 Lys-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) and H3 hyperacetylation and by a global reduction of H3K27me3.

In malignancies, DNA methylation is frequently dysregulated. By interfering with the transcription initiation, methylation of the CpG islands (CpGi) inhibits transcription and represses tumor suppressor genes. Acetylation of the core histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B is normally associated with the activation of gene transcription (7Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr.

Acetyl groups are added by a family of histone acetyltransferases and are removed by histone deacetylases. In turn, methylation of the lysine residues in the histone tails may lead to either transcriptional activation or repression. Methylation of histone lysines occurs in a form of mono-, di-, and trimethylation and is reversed by enzymatic demethylation (8Turner B.M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

A pri-miRNA is cleaved by DROSHA to a pre-miRNA. A pre-miRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 and next cleaved by Dicer to generate the mature miRNA duplexes. After a strand separation, the mature miRNA species binds an RNA-induced silencing complex and then represses protein synthesis either by blocking translation or by causing transcript degradation (19Lingel A.

To shed more light on the specific mechanisms of epigenetic control of pro-migratory genes in cancer, we used a multi-level microarray-based, proof-of-principal approach. For our epigenetic studies, we specifically selected non-migratory MCF7 breast carcinoma and super-migratory U251 glioma cells. As a result, we now determined for the first time the epigenetic profile of selected 486 pro-migratory genes that are independent of tissue type in highly migratory and non-migratory cancer cell lines. The genes we selected included MMPs themselves and also the genes that, according to the data mining in the bioinformatics databases, are functionally linked to MMPs. We also determined the profile of the 799 individual miRNAs in the cells. We believe that the approach we have developed here can and will be used in multiple cancer types and that it will lead to the identification of novel and promising drug targets. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to H3ac, H3K4me2, and H3K27me3 histones were purchased from Millipore. A murine monoclonal antibody against POL2 was from Covance. A rabbit MT1-MMP Ab815 antibody was from Chemicon. The antibodies to human nucleobindin 1, type I collagen, glial fibrillary acidic protein, βIII-tubulin, and Ki67 were purchased from Millipore, Novus Biologicals, DAKO, Covance, and Abcam, respectively. Human glioma/glioblastoma (GBM) U251 and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells (60–80% confluent) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were used in our experiments. Both cell lines were acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Microarray probes were designed using eArray software (Agilent). Unique DNA probes specific to 486 human genes from the high density ChIP Data base (Agilent) were included in each microarray. Microarray, 8 × 15K format, slides were custom manufactured by Agilent. Additional hybridization control probes (universal control grid LA577) were included in the arrays (Agilent). Each individual probe in the microarray was replicated 3–10 times. Cells were treated for 10 min with 1% p-formaldehyde and then with sodium glycine (100 mm) to inactivate p-formaldehyde. Cells were next washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached, and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and the Complete Proteinase Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Chromatin DNA was digested at 37 °C for 10 min using micrococcal nuclease (Roche Applied Science) to generate ∼80% mono-nucleosomal and 20% di-nucleosomal DNA fragments. The reactions were stopped using 5 mm EDTA. Digested chromatin was solubilized for 15 min on ice using 0.2% SDS. The pellet was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min). For each chromatin sample a corresponding control fraction of the input DNA was prepared as follows. Genomic DNA samples (50 μg each) were incubated for 16 h at 65 °C with 0.5 NaCl. RNA and proteins were digested using 10 μg/ml RNase A (37 °C; 15 min) and 1 mg/ml Proteinase K (50 °C; 1 h), respectively. DNA was purified using the DNA GenElute PCR Clean-up System. DNA fragmentation was confirmed using 2% agarose gel-electrophoresis. DNA concentration was measured at 260 nm. Chromatin samples (100 μg each) were diluted in 500 μl of ChIP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and the Complete Proteinase Inhibitor Mixture). The samples were pre-cleared by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of Protein G-coated magnetic Dynabeads suspension (Invitrogen). The H3ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me2, or H3K27me3 antibodies (10 μg each) and 50 μl of Protein G-coated magnetic Dynabeads suspension were then added to the pre-cleared samples. Non-immune rabbit IgG was used as a control. To reduce nonspecific binding, the beads were pretreated for 1 h with the sonicated salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml). The final volume of the samples was made 600 μl using the ChIP buffer. ChIP samples were prepared in triplicate. The samples that did not contain the antibody were used as a control. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 12 h on a rotating platform. The beads were captured using a magnetic rack (Qiagen) and washed 4 times in the ChIP buffer and twice in the ChIP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The bound material was eluted from the beads at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of 0.1% NaHCO3, 1% SDS. The soluble fraction was separated from the beads by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min). The soluble material was incubated at 68 °C for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. RNA and proteins were digested using 10 μg/ml RNase A (37 °C; 15 min) and 0.25 mg/ml Proteinase K (50 °C; 15 min), respectively. DNA was purified using the DNA GenElute PCR Clean-up System. DNA concentration was measured at 260 nm. The immunoprecipitated DNA samples (10 ng each) were amplified using the WGA2 whole genome amplification system. Amplification products were purified using the DNA GenElute PCR Clean-up System. DNA concentration was measured at 260 nm. The quality of the amplified DNA samples was confirmed using 2% agarose gel-electrophoresis. The amplified IP DNA and WCE DNA samples (1 μg) were labeled with Cy5-dUTP and Cy3-dUTP, respectively, using the Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling kit (Agilent). Labeled DNAs were hybridized with custom microarrays for 40 h at 65 °C and then washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization images were obtained using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner, and intensity data were extracted using Feature Extraction software Version 10.5 (Agilent). Genomic regions enriched by ChIP were identified with a peak detection algorithm using DNA Analytics 4.0.76 software (Agilent). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells (1 × 107) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O to a final concentration 500 ng/μl. RNA integrity was validated using Experion automated electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Samples of total RNAs (0.5 μg) were labeled and hybridized to a HumanWG-6 BeadChip Version 3.0 (Illumina) according to manufacturer's protocol. Data were collected, and the initial analysis was performed using GeneSpring software (Agilent). Only the statistically significant data (p < 0.05) were analyzed further. Total RNA was purified from cells using the miRNA Mini system (Qiagen). The quality of the purified RNA samples was assessed using the Bio-Rad Experion system and by measuring the 260/280 nm and the 260/230 nm ratios. Total RNA (100 ng) was labeled with a cyanine 3-pCp reagent using the miRNA Complete Labeling and Hybridization HybKit (Agilent). The labeled samples were then hybridized for 20 h at 55 °C with Agilent Human miRNA Microarray Version 2 designed using Sanger Data base Version 10.1. Microarray slides were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and scanned using a DNA microarray scanner G2565CA (Agilent). The raw data were processed using Feature Extraction software Version 10.5 and normalized using DNA Analytics and GeneSpring 10 software (Agilent). Differentially expressed miRNAs with signal intensities higher than 2-fold than the background standard deviation were filtered by t test with p < 0.05. The heatmap charts were generated using GenePattern software (29Reich M. Liefeld T. Gould J. Lerner J. Tamayo P. Mesirov J.P. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Specific oligonucleotide primers (Eurogentec) for the RT-PCR analyses were designed using Primer 3 software (30Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S4). Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control. RT-PCR analysis was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR system (Qiagen). The 25-μl reactions each included total RNA (40 ng) and the respective primers (0.6 μm) designed to amplify the cDNA. After the completion of the first strand synthesis, RT-PCR reactions (35 cycles) were performed using denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. The products were separated by 2% agarose gel-electrophoresis. To generate the orthotopic glioma tumor xenografts, U251 cells (4 × 104) were microinjected into both cerebral ventricles of cryoanesthetized newborn (P0) SCID mice. In 4 weeks the mice were sacrificed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. The brains were frozen-sectioned. The sections were stained with the antibodies to human nucleobindin 1, type I collagen, glial fibrillary acidic protein, βIII-tubulin, and Ki67 followed by the Alexa 488 (green) - and Alexa-594 (red)-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a BX51 fluorescent microscope equipped with a MagnaFIRE digital camera (Olympus). Images were processed with MagnaFIRE 2.1C software (Olympus). To generate the non-orthotopic glioma xenografts, U251 cells were xenografted subcutaneously into 4-week-old athymic female BALB/c nu/nu immunodeficient mice (Benton & Kingman) as described earlier (31Deryugina E.I. Soroceanu L. Strongin A.Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 580-588PubMed Google Scholar). At 45–55 days after the cell injection, tumors (∼1000 mm3 in size) were excised free of connective tissue, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cut, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. At the end of the experiments, mice were sacrificed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Frozen tumor samples (10–100 mg) were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted in 1 ml of TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using RNA (500 ng), random hexamer primers (100 ng), and the SuperScript First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Q-RT-PCR reactions (25 μl each) contained a Power SYBR green PCR mix (12.5 μl; Applied Biosystems), specific primers (10 pmol each, supplemental Table S4), and cDNA (2.5 ng). Each cDNA sample was analyzed in triplicate. Human GAPDH was used as a control. The PCR amplification was performed using an MX3000P thermocycler (Stratagene). ROX dye was used as an internal standard. Specific product amplification was monitored by measuring a melting curve of the PCR product. The amplified products were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The data were processed using MxPro software (Stratagene) to calculate the mean cycle threshold (ΔCt) values and p values. The list of 486 human genes of our custom-built ChIP-on-Chip microarray is shown in supplemental Table S1. The Agilent HD ChIP probe data base was used to select the individual hybridization probes. These probes were complimentary to the −5- to −3-kb regions of the respective gene promoter sequence (numbering starts from the transcription initiation site of the gene). As a result, 15,744 individual probes were arranged in an 8 × 14K microarray format. Each individual probe was present at least in triplicate in the microarray. Ten copies of the individual probes were included for each of the individual MMPs. Our custom microarray permits a simultaneous determination of the levels of the polymerase II Δ subunit (POL2) and the three histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3ac, and H3K4me2) under the same experimental conditions. We have specifically selected these three histone modifications for our analysis because according to our studies and those by others (25Chernov A.V. Sounni N.E. Remacle A.G. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

POL2 was included in the microarray as a reliable indicator of the transcriptionally active genes. The microarray we designed allowed us to profile the genes encoding 23 MMPs and their natural protein inhibitors (four TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4) and RECK (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs)), and FUR (furin, a common activator of the multiple individual MMPs) and additional 416 genes. According to the data mining in the bioinformatics databases, including Ingenuity, NextBio, and AmiGO, these 445 genes were linked to cell migration, invasion, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis (supplemental Table S1). Additional 41 genes we included in the array represented the known human histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and histone demethylases. There were also a number of the required control loci with the previously determined epigenetic characteristics, including GAPDH, in the array. As a result of this custom design, our microarray allowed us to accomplish the proof-of-principal profiling of 486 individual genes in non-migratory breast carcinoma MCF-7 and highly migratory U251 glioma cells and obtain volumes of statistically significant information. As a first step, we performed gene expression profiling of the cells. The results for 486 genes included in our ChIP-on-Chip array were analyzed further (Fig. 1A; supplemental Tables S2 and S3). From these 486 genes, the expression of 57 genes was especially high in U251 cells. These genes included the ECM components (tenascin C (TNC), osteopontin (SPP1), osteonectin (SPARC), laminin B1 (LAMB1), versican (VCAN), thrombospondin-2 (THBS2), angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), and collagens (COL)), proteinases and their inhibitors (urokinase (PLAU), furin (FUR), MMPs, and TIMPs), growth factors and cytokines (CCL2, CTGF, TGFBI, TGFB2, CXCL14, IL8, FGF2, TRAIL, neuregulin 1 (NRG1), and BDNF), adhesion and signaling receptors (neuronal cadherins-2 (CDH2) and -6 (CDH6), sarcoglycan (SGCE), connexins-43 (GJA1) and -26 (GJB2), VCAM1, CD44, and integrin α4), metabolic enzymes (cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases A1 and 2), and transcription regulators (PAX6, RORB and HEY1). Conversely, from 489 genes that were included in the ChIP-on-Chip array, the expression of 14 genes was especially high in MCF-7 cells. These genes included macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), MMP-9, TIMP-3, bone morphogenic protein BMP4, epithelial cadherin CDH1, PDZ-domain protein gene PARD6B, breast cancer-specific chemokine receptor CXCR4, metastasis suppressors MTSS1 and SYK, and transcription regulators ASCL1, ASCL2, HEY2, and HEYL (Fig. 1A). Most strikingly, multiple collagen genes (COL11A1, COL7A1, COL6A1, COL8A1, COL5A1, COL6A2, COL4A2, COL1A1, COL12A1, COL18A1, and COL14A1) were transcriptionally activated in U251 cells. Thus, the RT-PCR analysis of the selected collagen genes corroborated the gene expression profiling results (except COL18A1, the expression of which, according to the RT-PCR analysis, was similar in MCF-7 and U251 cells). RT-PCR confirmed high expression levels of COL11A1, COL7A1, COL8A1, and COL5A1, MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-7, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP), and TIMP-4 in U251 cells (Fig. 1B). The levels of MT2-MMP, MT4-MMP, and MT6-MMP were comparable in MCF-7 and U251 cells. Consistent with the microarray data, the results of RT-PCR showed that MCF-7 cells exhibited high levels of MIF. To elucidate the role the epigenetic mechanisms play in the regulation of pro-invasive genes, especially MMPs and collagens, the chromatin-associated DNA samples were isolated from U251 and MCF-7 cells and immunoprecipitated using the H3K27me3, H3K4me2, H3ac, and POL2 antibodies (25Chernov A.V. Sounni N.E. Remacle A.G. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12727-12734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The antibody-bound fractions were purified and then used for hybridization to the ChIP-on-Chip microarray. Quantitative-PCR with the MMP-2 specific primers was used to test the quality of immunoprecipitated samples (25Chernov A.V. Sounni N.E. Remacle A.G. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12727-12734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The hybridization signal was recorded, and the statistically significant data (p < 0.05) were analyzed further to calculate the enrichment value. The ratio of the immunoprecipitated DNA (IP) to the whole cell extract (WCE) DNA is shown in Fig. 2. The distribution parameters of the specifically precipitated DNA material relative to the whole cell DNA confirmed the specificity of the antibodies and the overall high quality of the samples we used in our further analysis. According to the results of our ChIP-on-Chip profiling, the multiple pro-invasive genes, the expression of which was up-regulated in highly migratory U251 cells, exhibited a number of the characteristic epigenetic parameters. These parameters included the global reduction of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and hyperacetylation of histone H3 (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The epigenetic parameters of 10 selected genes that are highly expressed and are silenced in U251 and MCF-7 cells, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3. Thus, high levels of the repressive H3K27me3 mark (2–8-fold higher relative to the median level) were a dominant feature of the silent loci in MCF-7 cells including CCL2, CTGF, TNC, SPARC, CDH2, LAMB1, CDH6, VCAN, SPP1, and ITGA4. Conversely, low levels of the repressive H3K27me3 mark correlated well with the enhanced transcriptional activity of the invasion-related genes in U251 cells. On average, there also was a 16-fold enrichment in H3ac in the transcriptionally active gene promoters in U251 cells. In turn, the levels of H3ac were infrequently and modestly increased in MCF-7 cells (e.g. CTGF). The expression levels of the 14 transcriptionally activ"

They both are present at the dentin-enamel boundary (DEB), a remarkably robust interface holding dentin and enamel together. It is believed that interactions of dentin and enamel protein assemblies regulate growth and structural organization of mineral crystals at the DEB, leading to a continuum at the molecular level between dentin and enamel organic and mineral phases. To gain insight into the mechanisms of the DEB formation and structural basis of its mechanical resiliency we have studied the interactions between collagen fibrils, amelogenin assemblies, and forming mineral in vitro, using electron microscopy. Our data indicate that collagen fibrils guide assembly of amelogenin into elongated chain or filament-like structures oriented along the long axes of the fibrils. We also show that the interactions between collagen fibrils and amelogenin-calcium phosphate mineral complexes lead to oriented deposition of elongated amorphous mineral particles along the fibril axes, triggering mineralization of the bulk of collagen fibril. The resulting structure was similar to the mineralized collagen fibrils found at the DEB, with arrays of smaller well organized crystals inside the collagen fibrils and bundles of larger crystals on the outside of the fibrils. These data suggest that interactions between collagen and amelogenin might play an important role in the formation of the DEB providing structural continuity between dentin and enamel.

These data suggest that interactions between collagen and amelogenin might play an important role in the formation of the DEB providing structural continuity between dentin and enamel. Dentin and enamel, the two mineralized tissues that comprise a tooth crown, are strikingly different in terms of their compositional, structural, and mechanical properties (1Nanci A. Ten Cate's Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. Mosby, St. Louis, MO2007Google Scholar). Despite these differences, dentin and enamel work together for decades under severe mechanical stress, without delamination or catastrophic failure. Dentin is a mineralized tissue similar to bone, comprised primarily of fibrillar collagen type I, carbonated apatite and water (2Weiner S. Wagner H.D. Annu. Rev. Materials Sci. 1998; 28: 271-298Crossref Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). There are other so-called noncollagenous macromolecules present that, in total, represent less then 10% by mass of organic material, although they play important roles in the formation and function of these tissues. All bone materials share the same basic building block, a collagen fibril, in which plate-shaped apatitic crystals are organized in parallel arrays with their c-axes co-aligned with the long axis of the fibril (2Weiner S.

Each chain contains more than 1000 amino acids and is primarily composed of Gly-X-Y repeats, where amino acids proline (Pro) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) predominantly occupy X and Y positions. All three chains in the molecule adopt a polyproline II (PPII)-like structure, which is stabilized by direct and water mediated inter- and intra-chain hydrogen bonds (5Brodsky B. Ramshaw J.A.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 6Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Collagen fibrils form via a self-assembly process in which collagen triple helices aggregate with their long axes in parallel. Within the fibril there is a linear shift of some 67 nm (D-period) between neighboring molecules generating a periodic structure along the long axis of the fibril. This staggered fibril assembly leaves gaps of 0.6D between the ends of co-linear collagen molecules and an 0.4D overlap region for every 67-nm fibril repeat (7Chapman J.A. Connect.

It has been demonstrated in a number of reports that collagen fibrils alone do not affect the formation, morphology, and organization of calcium phosphate crystals (9Deshpande A.S. Beniash E. Cryst.

Furthermore, the noncollagenous proteins often bind to specific motifs on collagen molecules, and such interactions are believed to play important roles in the regulation of collagen mineralization (15Beniash E.

Mature enamel is the hardest tissue in the body, comprised of ∼95% apatitic mineral, 4% water and less than 1% of organic matrix. In contrast, in forming enamel the organic matrix comprises roughly 20% while mineral and water account for 30 and 50% respectively. The basic building block of enamel is an enamel rod, a dense array of needle-shaped carbonated apatite crystals, roughly 50 nm across and tens of microns long, with their c-axes co-aligned (1Nanci A. Ten Cate's Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. Mosby, St. Louis, MO2007Google Scholar). These mineral rods form an intricate three-dimensional interwoven microstructure, which contributes to the high fracture resistance of enamel. A number of proteins were identified in the transient enamel matrix, with amelogenin constituting more than 90% of the enamel matrix. Amelogenin is a fairly hydrophobic protein comprised of N-terminal tyrosine-rich domain (TRAP), central proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal hydrophilic telopeptide (19Margolis H.C. Beniash E. Fowler C.E. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Amelogenin monomers adopt an extended conformation in solution with a large fraction of PPII type helix (20Delak K. Harcup C. Lakshminarayanan R. Sun Z. Fan Y. Moradian-Oldak J. Evans J.S.

DEB is a part of a much broader transitional zone, called Dentino-Enamel Junction (DEJ). The DEJ is a several hundred micron thick layer with graded mechanical properties. Its main function is the transfer of mechanical forces from the hard and brittle enamel layer to tough and soft dentin (35Zaslansky P. Friesem A.A. Weiner S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Wang R.Z. Weiner S. J. Biomech. 1998; 31: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Structurally, the DEB can be identified as consisting of the outer portion of mantle dentin and the most basal layer of enamel, the so-called aprismatic enamel (34Veis A. Science. 2005; 307: 1419-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These two layers are distinctly different from the bulk of their corresponding tissues. Mantle dentin is a 10–20-μm thick layer adjacent to enamel. It contains bundles of mineralized collagen fibrils, oriented normal to the DEB plane, the so-called von Korff fibers, in contrast to the bulk of dentin tissue, in which collagen fibrils are oriented parallel to the DEB plane (15Beniash E. Traub W. Veis A. Weiner S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Zaslansky P. Friesem A.A. Weiner S. J. Struct.

Enamel adjacent to the mantle dentin lacks the typical prismatic architecture, and is comprised of mineral crystals also oriented normal to the DEB plane, as are the crystals in Von Korff collagen fibrils. dentin-enamel boundary phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin transmission electron microscopy selected area electron diffraction deionized distilled water. The DEB is the first structure formed during tooth development (1Nanci A. Ten Cate's Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. Mosby, St. Louis, MO2007Google Scholar). Before the onset of mineralization, odontoblasts and ameloblasts form two juxtaposed cell layers. Odontoblasts start to deposit organic matrix of the mantle dentin, which begins to mineralize soon after its deposition. The beginning of dentin mineralization triggers the enamel deposition by ameloblasts which start to withdraw from the mineralized dentin layer leaving behind nascent enamel crystals of aprismatic enamel embedded in a protein gel. The fact that dentin mineralization precedes enamel formation and that initial enamel crystals form on top of the mineralized dentin and have similar crystallographic orientation as the crystals in von Korff fibrils led to the hypothesis that the mineralized mantle dentin serves as a template for enamel crystals (38Arsenault A.L. Robinson B.W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Hayashi Y. J. Electron Microsc. 1992; 41: 387-391PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, other researchers have not found any evidence of epitaxial relationships between dentin and enamel mineral; instead it has been proposed that the dentin proteins or mineral crystals at the DEJ dictate the enamel matrix organization, which in turn influences crystal organization (40Bodier-Houllé P. Steuer P. Meyer J.M. Bigeard L. Cuisinier F.J.G. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Besides their distinct structural organization, mantle dentin and aprismatic enamel have unique protein compositions, different from the typical protein composition of bulk dentin and enamel tissues. Specifically, a number of enamel proteins including amelogenin, the major protein of forming enamel, is also expressed by odontoblasts at the onset of dentin formation and found in the mantle dentin (41Nanci A. Zalzal S. Lavoie P. Kunikata M. Chen W. Krebsbach P.H. Yamada Y. Hammarström L. Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. Smith C.E. J. Histochem.

Bone. 2003; 32: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), while the major non-collagenous dentin protein DSPP is transiently expressed by early ameloblasts (43Bègue-Kirn C. Krebsbach P.H. Bartlett J.D. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 44Bleicher F. Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Couble P. Magloire H. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Such unique extracellular matrix composition of mantle dentin and aprismatic enamel at the DEB is likely to be essential for the proper formation and function of this interface. This notion is supported by the studies of the hereditary tooth diseases in humans and experiments with animal models, which demonstrate that mutations in a number of extracellular tooth proteins lead to the weakening of the DEB and the breaking off of tooth enamel leading to exposure of the dentin surface (45Beniash E. Skobe Z. Bartlett J.D. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2006; 114: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 46Papagerakis P. Lin H.K. Lee K.Y. Hu Y. Simmer J.P. Bartlett J.D. Hu J.C.C. J. Dent.

Hence, it is essential to understand how the individual proteins present at this boundary, as well as more complex systems including multiple ECM components, affect calcium phosphate mineralization. In vitro mineralization experiments are widely used to understand the functional properties of proteins involved in mineralization (51George A. Veis A. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 4670-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 52Silverman L. Boskey A.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These in vitro systems are powerful research tools and have numerous advantages, such as the ability to carry out experiments in a systematic manner and under controlled conditions. Such analytical approaches allow for the study of one or more individual elements of a mineralization system in isolation. At the same time, these in vitro systems, by their nature, are less complex than the in vivo environment, which involve multiple interactions which are extremely difficult to reproduce in vitro. Nevertheless, synthesis of the data obtained in in vitro experiments and in vivo observations can lead to better understanding of complex biomineralization systems such as that associated with the DEB. To provide new insights into the supramolecular protein assemblies and forming mineral at initial stages of tooth formation at the DEB we set out to study interactions between collagen and amelogenin, two major matrix proteins in a developing tooth, and the effects of these interactions on calcium phosphate mineralization in vitro. The collagen purification was carried out in accordance with well established published procedures (9Deshpande A.S. Beniash E. Cryst. Growth Des. 2008; 8: 3084-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 53Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Acidic solution of type I collagen was obtained from rat-tail tendon. The tendons were collected from 4–8-week-old rats and washed in protease inhibitor buffer. Then the tendons were briefly rinsed in deionized water, homogenized, and solubilized in 2 mm HCl (pH 2.8). The collagen solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g to remove aggregates. Collagen was then purified by several cycles of selective salt precipitation followed by acid dissolution as reported elsewhere (9Deshpande A.S. Beniash E. Cryst. Growth Des. 2008; 8: 3084-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 53Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The quality and purity of the preparation was verified by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S1). High purity CaCl2·2H2O, Na2HPO4·7H2O, NaH2PO4·2H2O, KH2PO4, and NaOH were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. A 10× PBS buffer with 10.58 mm KH2PO4, 29.66 mm Na2HPO4·7 H2O, and 1551.72 mm NaCl was prepared in deionized distilled water (DDW) with the resistivity of 18.2 mΩ cm. The pH of this buffer solution was adjusted to 7.2 (pH 7.8 at 1× dilution) using NaOH. Stock solutions of CaCl2 (6.68 mm) Na2HPO4·2 H2O (4 mm) and NaOH (5 mm) were prepared using DDW. Lyophilized recombinant protein rM179 was dissolved in filtered DDW to give a concentration 2 mg/ml. the solution was maintained at 4 °C for 48 h to facilitate dissolution. rM179 was prepared and purified as previously described (54Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To achieve effective removal of cross-linked collagen and to obtain collagen fibrils with larger diameters, additional steps were taken prior to the assembly of collagen fibrils on TEM grids. Typically, 9 ml of acidic collagen solution and 1 ml of 10× PBS solution were mixed together to obtain 0.1–0.2% collagen solution in 1× PBS. This solution was incubated in a closed vial at 37 °C for 3 h. The incubation resulted in a gel of self-assembled collagen fibrils. The resultant gel was stored at 4 °C for typically 1 week upon which the gel resolves into a clear solution. This solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at 4 °C. To obtain a thin layer of collagen fibrils, a 20-μl droplet of this mixed solution was placed on an inert polyethylene substrate in a humidity chamber, and a carbon coated Ni grid (EMS, Hatfield, PA) was placed on top of the droplet. The humidity chamber was sealed and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After the incubation, the grid was quickly washed with DDW and blotted against a filter paper and air-dried. Recombinant full-length mouse amelogenin rM179 was produced and purified according to an established protocol (54Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of rM179 and NaOH were mixed together to obtain solution of 0.5 mg/ml amelogenin in 1.25 mm NaOH. A 20-μl droplet of this solution was placed on an inert polyethylene substrate in a humidity chamber. A TEM grid-coated with thin layer of collagen fibrils as obtained above was placed on top of this droplet. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4–16 h. After the incubation, the grid were quickly washed with DDW, blotted against a filter paper and air-dried. For TEM analysis, the grids were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Immunogold labeling was carried out on samples with amelogenin assembled in the presence of collagen fibrils to localize amelogenin with respect to collagen fibrils and to rule out possibility of physical adsorption or drying artifacts in negatively stained samples. The TEM grids as prepared above were incubated for 1 h with a solution containing rabbit anti-mouse amelogenin antibodies. The original antiserum was diluted 30× in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The grids were then washed for 3 min with 0.5% BSA in PBS, and the washes were repeated four times. They were then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with 5-nm gold particles after the original solution was diluted 25 × with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The grids were washed five times, as described above. Finally the grids were washed with DDW, blotted against a filter paper, and air-dried. To 5 μl of 4 mm Na2HPO4 ·2H2O solution, 5 μl each of 5 mm NaOH, 2 mg/ml amelogenin, and 6.68 mm CaCl2·2H2O were, respectively, to achieve final concentrations of 1.25 mm NaOH, 1.67 mm C CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.5 mg/ml amelogenin. pH of the mineralization solution was adjusted to pH 8.2. A 20-μl droplet of this solution was place in humidity chamber and a TEM grid-coated with thin layer of collagen fibrils as obtained above was placed on top of this droplet. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2, 3, 4, and 16 h. After incubation, the grid were quickly washed with DDW, blotted against a filter paper, and air-dried. pH measurements of the mineralization solutions were taken before and after the experiments, using a MI-414 6 cm combination microelectrode (Microelectrodes, Bedford, NH). A JEOL 1210 TEM microscope operated at 100 kV and JEOL 2000EX operated at 200 kV were used to study TEM and SAED of all samples. The micrographs were recorded using an AMT CCD camera (AMT, Danvers, MA). An aluminum film coated TEM grid (EMS Hatfield, PA) were used as a standard to calibrate SAED patterns for d-spacing calculations. The micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ 1.38× image processing software (Bethesda, MD). For statistical analyses of dimensions of the protein assemblies and mineral particles, at least 50 measurements were performed in each case. Tomography tilt series of mineralized samples were acquired at nominal magnifications of × 23000 to 26,000, using Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with a LaB6 filament at 120 KV. The micrographs were recorded automatically using bottom mounted Gatan 2000 CCD camera. The micrographs were taken in a tilt range from −60° to +60° with of 1° increment from −45° to 45° and 0.5° increment from −60° to −45°and from 45° to 60°. Because of the strong contrast of mineralized samples, the images were aligned using fiducial-less procedure in IMOD reconstruction package (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) (56Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3667) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional density maps were reconstructed from the tilt series images using Chimera software (University of California, San Francisco, CA (57Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar)). The collagen assembly was carried out at 37 °C on the carbon-coated TEM grids as described elsewhere (9Deshpande A.S. Beniash E. Cryst. Growth Des. 2008; 8: 3084-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The collagen fibrils were several microns long and had an average diameter of 162 ± 37 nm. Negatively stained fibrils showed a banding pattern with periodicity of ∼67 nm, characteristic of collagen type I D-spacing (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2). After the deposition of collagen fibrils, amelogenin assembly was carried out on the same grid at a pH adjusted to 8.0–8.3. The TEM studies of negatively stained samples revealed two populations of amelogenin self-assemblies: homogeneous amelogenin assemblies and assemblies associated with collagen fibrils. Amelogenin not associated with collagen fibrils self-assembled into individual nanospheres of average diameter 17.6 ± 2.6 nm with very few larger aggregates (Fig. 1A), which is in an agreement with literature reports of amelogenin self-assembly at pH 8.0 and above (25Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and our control amelogenin self-assembly experiments without collagen fibrils (supplemental Fig. S3). At the same time, long chains of nanospheres, 12 ± 2.3 nm in diameter were observed in association with collagen fibrils. These chains were aligned with the long axis of the fibril, in many instances the individual nanospheres in the chains fused together, forming filamentous structures (Fig. 1, B and C). We have also performed immunogold labeling of the samples using murine amelogenin antibodies, to further confirm that amelogenin binds to collagen fibrils (Fig. 2). The average density of the gold particles on the grid was 397.2 (S.D. = 94.84) p/μm2, while on the carbon grid it was 67.8 (S.D. = 33.75) p/μm2. The difference was significant (p = 0.0007) suggesting that amelogenin preferably binds to collagen fibrils. In the control samples containing collagen fibrils without amelogenin there were very few gold particles, which were randomly distributed throughout the grid (supplemental Fig. S4A), indicating that the observed preferential binding was not due to the cross-reactivity of amelogenin antibodies with collagen fibrils. As an additional control, we performed immunolabeling with amelogenin assembled on the grid. In this case, a high density of randomly distributed gold particles was observed (supplemental Fig. S4B). When collagen fibrils were exposed to the mineralization solution without amelogenin, typical plate-like mineral crystals randomly distributed on the grid were observed. The reconstituted collagen fibrils alone did not have any effect on the distribution or organization of the mineral (supplemental Fig. S5). Calcium phosphate mineralization in the presence of rM179 (0.5 mg/ml) and reconstituted collagen fibrils was studied as a function of incubation time. The samples were analyzed after 2, 3, 4, and 16 h from the beginning of the reaction. P"
https://openalex.org/W2065943272,"Fibrillin microfibrils are polymeric structures present in connective tissues. The importance of fibrillin microfibrils to connective tissue function has been demonstrated by the multiple genetic disorders caused by mutations in fibrillins and in microfibril-associated molecules. However, knowledge of microfibril structure is limited, largely due to their insolubility. Most previous studies have focused on how fibrillin-1 is organized within microfibril polymers. In this study, an immunochemical approach was used to circumvent the insolubility of microfibrils to determine the role of fibrillin-2 in postnatal microfibril structure. Results obtained from studies of wild type and fibrillin-1 null tissues, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with defined epitopes, demonstrated that N-terminal fibrillin-2 epitopes are masked in postnatal microfibrils and can be revealed by enzymatic digestion or by genetic ablation of Fbn1. From these studies, we conclude that fetal fibrillin polymers form an inner core within postnatal microfibrils and that microfibril structure evolves as growth and development proceed into the postnatal period. Furthermore, documentation of a novel cryptic site present in EGF4 in fibrillin-1 underscores the molecular complexity and tissue-specific differences in microfibril structure.

In contrast, expression of Fbn2 and Fbn3 is largely limited to fetal development (2Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Corson G.M. Charbonneau N.L. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y.

In the mouse, there are only two Fbn genes, Fbn1 and Fbn2, because Fbn3 was inactivated during chromosomal evolution (3Corson G.M. Charbonneau N.L. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 2004; 83: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments have shown that mice without Fbn2 are viable and fertile but are born with syndactyly and joint contractures (6Arteaga-Solis E. Gayraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whereas mice without Fbn1 die in the early postnatal period (∼P14) from aortic rupture (7Carta L. Pereira L. Arteaga-Solis E. Lee-Arteaga S.Y. Lenart B. Starcher B. Merkel C.A. Sukoyan M. Kerkis A. Hazeki N. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8016-8023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that fibrillin-1 can compensate for the most part for the absence of fibrillin-2 and that fibrillin-2 can compensate for fibrillin-1 during development but not after P14, when expression levels of Fbn2 are very low. Fibrillin-containing microfibrils are polymeric structures that have been best defined by their ultrastructural appearance, described as the small diameter nonstriated fibrils associated with elastic fibers or with basement membranes (8Low F.N. Anat. Rec. 1962; 142: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and as beaded strings, after liberation from tissues and rotary shadowing electron microscopy (9Keene D.R. Maddox B.K. Kuo H.J. Sakai L.Y. Glanville R.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Most structural studies of fibrillin-containing microfibrils have focused on the contributions of fibrillin-1 (10Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Stuart D.I. Handford P.A. Structure. 2004; 12: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), leaving the role of fibrillin-2 largely undetermined. However, some progress has been made using an immunochemical approach. Antibodies specific for fibrillin-1 and -2 showed that fetal microfibrils are heteropolymeric, containing both fibrillin-1 and -2 in tissues and in the same beaded strings (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because little is known about fibrillin-2 in microfibrils, it is possible that the structure of microfibrils may be more complex than the models based on fibrillin-1 as the major structural component. Two conclusions can be drawn from published results. First, during the assembly of heteropolymeric microfibrils, regions of fibrillin-2 are masked. This conclusion is based on findings from epitope-mapped monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaypAbpolyclonal antibodyrFrecombinant fibrillin. specific for human fibrillin-2. These mAbs previously showed that the first 8-cysteine domain in fibrillin-2 is exposed and available for antibody binding within microfibril polymers. However, a domain adjacent to the first 8-cysteine domain and domains flanking the second hybrid domain in fibrillin-2 were found to be cryptic in polymerized microfibrils (15Charbonneau N.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polyclonal antibody recombinant fibrillin. Second, functional roles for fibrillin-2 in postnatal tissues are not well understood. Both expression of Fbn2 (5Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and immunostaining of fibrillin-2 protein (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) are minimal in postnatal tissues, suggesting that fibrillin-2 may not perform important functions after the early postnatal period. However, genetic evidence in humans and in mice indicates that mutations in fibrillin-2 affect postnatal skeletal growth. Mutations in FBN2 cause congenital contractural arachnodactyly in humans (OMIM 121050), and Fbn2 null mice demonstrate bone and tendon defects (17Boregowda R. Paul E. White J. Ritty T.M. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To better determine the contribution of fibrillin-2 to microfibril structure and to provide a better basis for elucidating mechanisms by which mutant fibrillin-2 contributes to skeletal abnormalities, we have performed additional immunochemical investigations of fibrillin-2 in postnatal microfibrils. Using this approach, we report results that demonstrate that fibrillin-2 is present, but masked, in postnatal tissues. Moreover, results obtained using Fbn1 null mice suggest a new model of microfibril structure in which fibrillin-2 forms a core within the microfibril, a core that is overlaid at least by fibrillin-1. In addition, we show that masked epitopes in fibrillin-1 and in fibrillin-2 are differentially masked or available, depending on the type of tissue. These are the first results that demonstrate tissue-specific differences in microfibril structure. From these data, new concepts of microfibril structure have emerged. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) as well as mAbs specific for fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, and fibrillin-3 have been described previously (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

Heterozygous mice with a targeted disruption in the Fbn2 gene (6Arteaga-Solis E. Gayraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) were bred to yield all genotypes as well. Wild type and heterozygous littermates were used as controls for the homozygous null animals. All experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Oregon Health and Science Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Various recombinant peptides (2 μg/ml in 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.2; 100 μl/well) were used to coat ELISA plates. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, wells were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.025% Tween 20 (TBS-T) (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 100 μl of 4% powdered milk in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were washed again with TBS-T and incubated at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in milk/TBS-T. Dilutions started at 1:50 of a 1 mg/ml solution and continued 2-fold to 1:52,600. Plates were incubated at room temperature on a nutating platform for 3 h, washed with TBS-T, and incubated with secondary GAM-HRP (Sigma), diluted 1:1000 in milk/TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature on a nutating platform. After washing, wells were incubated with TMB substrate (Sigma) for 5 min. Color reaction was stopped with 2 n H2SO4, and absorbance was determined at 450 nm using a Molecular Devices Emax microplate reader. ELISAs were also performed using microfibrils extracted from human amnion. Conditions used were as described previously (16Kuo C.L. Isogai Z. Keene D.R. Hazeki N. Ono R.N. Sengle G. Bächinger H.P.

Whole-mount staining was performed using mAb 201 (specific for fibrillin-1) (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), JB3 (specific for fibrillin-2) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), and mAb 129 (3Corson G.M.

Supranummary digits were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin after surgical removal from children (17 and 21 months of age). Standard immunohistochemical studies were performed on slides from paraffin-embedded tissues using a modified avidin-biotin (ABC) immunoperoxidase method. After clearing the slides with xylene and alcohols, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Pretreatment to enhance antigen retrieval is listed in Table 1 along with the concentrations and dilutions of the primary antibodies. Primary antibodies for fibrillin-1–3 were all previously described mouse mAbs (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

Secondary horse anti-mouse antibodies were utilized, and the tertiary antibody 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine chromagen complex in the Vectastain ABC kit for Elite PK-6100 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was employed. Control slides using phosphate-buffered saline in place of primary antibody were processed concurrently with the slides stained with primary antibodies. Immunostaining results were evaluated using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and digital photographs were taken of representative areas.TABLE 1Conditions for epitope retrieval of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sectionsAntibody targetClone no.ConcentrationWorking dilutionPretreatmentmg/mlFibrillin-1mAb 1511:500015-Min microwave retrieval in citrate (10 mm) bufferFibrillin-2mAb 4811:20010-Min Pronase digestion and 10-min microwave retrieval in citrate (10 mm) bufferFibrillin-3mAb 1291.491:20010-Min Pronase digestion and 10-min microwave retrieval citrate in (10 mm) buffer Open table in a new tab Tissues were snap-frozen, and 4-μm sections were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (19Ono R.N.

Prior to incubation with primary antibodies, sections were treated for 20 min with titrated solutions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/ml) of crude collagenase (Sigma), dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, or with buffer without collagenase. Sections were washed and then incubated with primary antibodies, followed by washing and incubation with secondary antibodies. Affinity-purified pAb 9543 (anti-fibrillin-1), affinity-purified pAb 0868 (anti-fibrillin-2), and indicated mAbs were used as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 anti-rabbit, Alexa 488 anti-mouse, and Alexa 568 anti-rabbit (Invitrogen). Double immunofluorescence was performed using pAb 9543 and fibrillin-2 mAbs. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with AxioVision software (version 4.5) and Apotome optical sectioning. Section-surface and en bloc diffusion immunolabeling experiments were performed as described previously (20Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy and whole-mount antibody staining of 6-day-old embryonic avian autopods revealed abundant fibrillin-2 and -3 staining that was primarily associated with the interdigital connective tissue space. Fibrillin-2 and -3 fibrils looked like guide wires, extending from the ectoderm (arrowhead) and connecting the interdigital space to the leading edges of the forming digit cartilages (asterisk) (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, fibrillin-1 staining yielded only very limited, if any, signals that were restricted to areas immediately adjacent to the developing digit cartilage (Fig. 2A), and the guide wires were not stained. The interdigital connective tissue is the first known example of a tissue that is structured with little to no apparent contribution from fibrillin-1. To investigate the contributions of fibrillins in postnatal digits, conditions were first established for immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Previously, immunofluorescence experiments using postnatal tissues were complicated by the autofluorescence of elastin, which made documentation of fibrillin immunostaining difficult in elastin-rich tissues like the perichondrium. Therefore, an alternative staining method (immunoperoxidase) was employed. Because fetal tissues are known to contain all three fibrillins, sections of human fetal tissues were analyzed first. Positive immunostainings (data not shown) for fibrillin-specific mAbs were achieved using the conditions shown in Table 1. These conditions were then used to stain sections obtained from surgically removed extra digits. Immunohistochemical analyses of postnatal digit tissues revealed new information. First, both fibrillin-1 and -2 are present in bone marrow stromal matrix as well as in areas around woven bone (Fig. 3, A–C). Second, both fibrillin-1 and -2 are present in the fibrous perichondrium (Fig. 3, D–F). Third, although all of the juxta-articular soft tissues surrounding the cartilage, including joint capsule, demonstrated abundant fibrillin-1 staining (Fig. 3, H and K), fibrillin-2 staining was pronounced only around peripheral nerves, with fainter staining apparent in the surrounding perichondrium and skeletal muscle in the 17-month-old sections (Fig. 3I). However, this faint staining of surrounding tissues appeared to be lost by 21 months of age (Fig. 3L). Fibrillin-3 staining of postnatal digits was negative, even though conditions were used that resulted in clearly positive immunostaining of similar fetal tissues (data not shown). A drawing of fibrillin-2 domain structure with mapped epitopes for previously characterized mAbs (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. We previously found that all fibrillin-2 mAbs recognized monomeric fibrillin-2 secreted by cells into the culture medium and analyzed by Western blotting. However, we found that only the epitopes recognized by mAb 48 and mAb 143 were available for binding in microfibrils present in fetal tissues or in cell culture extracellular matrix. All other epitopes were cryptic. Based on these data, we concluded that certain regions of fibrillin-2 are masked in matrix microfibrils (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that microfibrils in all fetal connective tissues examined were well labeled with mAb 48 and mAb 143 and were likely to be heteropolymers of fibrillin-1 and -2 (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, postnatal tissues, with the exception of peripheral nerves, were nonreactive or poorly immunofluorescent with mAb 48 or mAb 143 (15Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we confirmed and extended previous observations in postnatal digit tissues using immunoperoxidase staining rather than immunofluorescence to exclude complications due to autofluorescence. To explain the difference between ubiquitous fibrillin-2 mAb 48 and mAb 143 immunoreactivity in fetal tissues and limited immunoreactivity in postnatal tissues, we hypothesized that fetal heteropolymeric microfibrils are masked in postnatal tissues by proteins that further elaborate microfibril structure. To test this hypothesis, we performed enzymatic digestions of tissue sections to unmask fibrillin-2 epitopes. Human amnion was stained with mAbs specific for fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, and elastin. Elastin staining was negative, and electron microscopic examination of amnion showed no accumulation of amorphous elastin (data not shown). Microfibrils in the amnion were stained with antibodies to fibrillin-1 (Fig. 4A). However, fibrillin-2 appeared to be absent in the microfibril bundles and present only in limited amounts in the amniotic basement membrane, after staining with mAb 143 (Fig. 4C). When amnion sections were treated with crude collagenase, mAb 143 stained the microfibril bundles as well as the amniotic basement membrane (Fig. 4D). Similarly, other fibrillin-2 epitopes, for example the one recognized by mAb 60, were revealed after enzymatic treatment (Fig. 4, F compared with E), whereas others remained masked (Fig. 4, G and H). Fibrillin-2 epitopes recognized by mAbs 48, 143, 60, 139, and 171 were revealed in these experiments, whereas epitopes recognized by mAbs 72 and 205 remained masked (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Similar results were obtained when a 20-month supranummary digit was stained after digestion with crude collagenase. In the skin, fibrillin-2 epitopes were masked (Fig. 5A) and could be revealed differentially using increasing concentrations of crude collagenase. Cryptic mAb 60 (data not shown), mAb 139 (Fig. 5B), and mAb 171 (Fig. 5C) were revealed with 0.2 mg/ml crude collagenase, although staining with cryptic mAbs 72 and 205 remained negative (data not shown). A higher concentration of crude collagenase (0.4 mg/ml) was required to reveal mAb 72 (Fig. 5D) and mAb 205 (data not shown). Double immunofluorescence labeling with fibrillin-2 mAbs in combination with fibrillin-1 pAb 9543 documented the presence of fibrillin-2 and fibrillin-1 in the same microfibril bundles (Fig. 5). In addition, a decrease in fibrillin-1 immunostaining was observed at the highest concentrations of crude collagenase (Fig. 5D). To determine whether fibrillin-2 epitopes could be revealed by removal of noncovalently bound microfibril components, we tested microfibrils after extraction from human amnion with 6 m guanidine (16Kuo C.L. Isogai Z. Keene D.R. Hazeki N. Ono R.N. Sengle G. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4007-4020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Guanidine-extracted microfibrils were adsorbed to ELISA plates. Fibrillin-2 mAbs 48, 143, 60, 72, 139, 171, and 205 were titrated and tested for reactivity. Fibrillin-1 mAb 201 was titrated and used as a control. Guanidine-extracted microfibrils reacted well with both mAb 201 and mAb 48 and weakly with mAb 143, whereas other fibrillin-2 mAbs were unreactive (Fig. 6). These data suggest that certain fibrillin-2 epitopes masked in amnion tissue (mAb 48 and mAb 143) may be unmasked by removing noncovalently bound microfibril-associated proteins and/or by altering the quaternary structure of the microfibril with denaturants. However, all other fibrillin-2 epitopes remained masked in the presence of 6 m guanidine. Because multiple fibrillin-1 epitopes were previously shown to be retained in guanidine-extracted microfibrils (16Kuo C.L. Isogai Z. Keene D.R. Hazeki N. Ono R.N. Sengle G. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4007-4020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we interpret these results to indicate that the cryptic fibrillin-2 epitopes are masked by the structure of the microfibril. Microfibrils in postnatal wild type mouse tissues, as in human tissues, were not well stained with pAb 0868, specific for fibrillin-2 domains contained in rF37 (Fig. 1). In a second approach to determine the postnatal fate of fibrillin-2, we examined Fbn1 null mouse tissues. In contrast to wild type littermate mouse tissues, abundant pAb 0868 immunoreactive fibrillin-2 microfibrils were observed in all newborn and early postnatal Fbn1 null tissues. Fig. 7 shows that fibrillin-2 microfibril staining is revealed in the skin, skeletal muscle, tendon, and perichondrium of P8 Fbn1 null mice, compared with wild type littermate control sections. These results indicate that fibrillin-1 molecules or fibrillin-1-associated molecules mask fibrillin-2 epitopes in postnatal tissues. mAb 689 was generated using rF301 (depicted in Fig. 1), a recombinant human fibrillin-3 polypeptide that spans cbEGF1, the first 8-cysteine domain, the proline/glycine-rich region, and EGF4 (3Corson G.M. Charbonneau N.L. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 2004; 83: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). mAb 689 recognizes rF301 as well as polypeptides containing the homologous region from fibrillin-1 and -2. These include rF23 and rF30 (fibrillin-1) and rF86 and rF32 (fibrillin-2) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8A, and data not shown). Using additional polypeptides (depicted in Fig. 1) as coated substrates, we performed ELISAs to map more precisely the epitope recognized by mAb 689. Fig. 8A shows that mAb 689 binds to peptides containing the fourth epidermal growth factor-like domain, but not to peptides that lack this domain. mAb 689 reacted well with the fibrillin-1 peptide rF20 (data not shown) and the fibrillin-2 peptide rF47 (Fig. 8A), which contain EGF4 but lack the preceding domains. Based on these data, we conclude that mAb 689 is a pan-fibrillin antibody that binds to an epitope contained largely in EGF4. In addition to human fibrillin, mAb 689 recognizes mouse fibrillin (FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10). The primary structure of human and mouse fibrillin-1 EGF4 is identical, as is the primary structure of human and mouse fibrillin-2 EGF4. However, only 25 of the 41 residues are identical in fibrillin-1 and -3 EGF4, whereas 31 of the 41 residues are identical in fibrillin-2 and -3. 22 residues are identical in all three fibrillins. Fig. 8B shows the region of identity in the EGF4 sequence. This region of identity clusters around the residues predicted to form the second strand of an anti-parallel β-sheet, which likely forms the core structure of EGF4.

https://openalex.org/W2052138740,"A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells respond to treatment with the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR) with the production of dihydroceramide and with a concomitant reduction of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The derived HPR-resistant clonal cell line, A2780/HPR, is less responsive to HPR in terms of dihydroceramide generation. In this report, we show that the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is significantly higher in A2780/HPR versus A2780 cells due to an increased sphingosine kinase (SK) activity and SK-1 mRNA and protein levels. Treatment of A2780 and A2780/HPR cells with a potent and highly selective pharmacological SK inhibitor effectively reduced S1P production and resulted in a marked reduction of cell proliferation. Moreover, A2780/HPR cells treated with a SK inhibitor were sensitized to the cytotoxic effect of HPR, due to an increased dihydroceramide production. On the other hand, the ectopic expression of SK-1 in A2780 cells was sufficient to induce HPR resistance in these cells. Challenge of A2780 and A2780/HPR cells with agonists and antagonists of S1P receptors had no effects on their sensitivity to the drug, suggesting that the role of SK in HPR resistance in these cells is not mediated by the S1P receptors. These data clearly demonstrate a role for SK in determining resistance to HPR in ovarian carcinoma cells, due to its effect in the regulation of intracellular ceramide/S1P ratio, which is critical in the control of cell death and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2143210433,"The 12-kDa FK506-binding proteins (FKBP12 and FKBP12.6) are regulatory subunits of ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca(2+) release channels. To investigate the structural basis of FKBP interactions with the RyR1 and RyR2 isoforms, we used site-directed fluorescent labeling of FKBP12.6, ligand binding measurements, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Single-cysteine substitutions were introduced at five positions distributed over the surface of FKBP12.6. Fluorescent labeling at position 14, 32, 49, or 85 did not affect high affinity binding to the RyR1. By comparison, fluorescent labeling at position 41 reduced the affinity of FKBP12.6 binding by 10-fold. Each of the five fluorescent FKBPs retained the ability to inhibit [(3)H]ryanodine binding to the RyR1, although the maximal extent of inhibition was reduced by half when the label was attached at position 32. The orientation of FKBP12.6 bound to the RyR1 and RyR2 was examined by measuring FRET from the different labeling positions on FKBP12.6 to an acceptor attached within the RyR calmodulin subunit. FRET was dependent on the position of fluorophore attachment on FKBP12.6; however, for any given position, the distance separating donors and acceptors bound to RyR1 versus RyR2 did not differ significantly. Our results show that FKBP12.6 binds to RyR1 and RyR2 in the same orientation and suggest new insights into the discrete structural domains responsible for channel binding and inhibition. FRET mapping of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 is consistent with the predictions of a previous cryoelectron microscopy study and strongly supports the proposed structural model."

Importantly, the effect of Trp<sup>215</sup> replacement is context dependent. Mutant W215E is 10-fold more specific for protein C than fibrinogen and PAR1, which represents a striking shift in specificity relative to wild-type that is 100-fold more specific for fibrinogen and PAR1 than protein C. However, when the W215E mutation is combined with deletion of nine residues in the autolysis loop, which by itself shifts the specificity of the enzyme from fibrinogen and PAR1 to protein C, the resulting construct features significant activity only toward PAR1. These findings demonstrate that thrombin can be re-engineered for selective specificity toward protein C and PAR1.

https://openalex.org/W2160202517,"Heparinase II (HepII) is an 85-kDa dimeric enzyme that depolymerizes both heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans through a beta-elimination mechanism. Recently, we determined the crystal structure of HepII from Pedobacter heparinus (previously known as Flavobacterium heparinum) in complex with a heparin disaccharide product, and identified the location of its active site. Here we present the structure of HepII complexed with a heparan sulfate disaccharide product, proving that the same binding/active site is responsible for the degradation of both uronic acid epimers containing substrates. The key enzymatic step involves removal of a proton from the C5 carbon (a chiral center) of the uronic acid, posing a topological challenge to abstract the proton from either side of the ring in a single active site. We have identified three potential active site residues equidistant from C5 and located on both sides of the uronate product and determined their role in catalysis using a set of defined tetrasaccharide substrates. HepII H202A/Y257A mutant lost activity for both substrates and we determined its crystal structure complexed with a heparan sulfate-derived tetrasaccharide. Based on kinetic characterization of various mutants and the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex we propose residues participating in catalysis and their specific roles."

Cartilage cells, the chondrocytes, have adapted to this and actually use hypoxia to drive tissue-specific functions. We have previously shown that human chondrocytes enhance cartilage matrix synthesis in response to hypoxia specifically through hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α)-mediated up-regulation of master regulator transcription factor SOX9, which in turn drives expression of the main cartilage-specific extracellular matrix genes. HIF-α isoforms are themselves regulated by specific prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins, which target them for proteosomal degradation. In fact, prolyl hydroxylase domains are the direct oxygen sensors because they require molecular oxygen as a co-substrate. Here, we have identified PHD2 as the dominant isoenzyme regulating HIF-2α stability in human chondrocytes. Moreover, specific inhibition of PHD2 using RNA interference-mediated depletion caused an up-regulation of SOX9 and enhanced extracellular matrix protein production.

https://openalex.org/W1979926758,"Background N-myristoylation is a crucial covalent modification of numerous eukaryotic and viral proteins that is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). Prokaryotes are lacking endogeneous NMT activity. Recombinant production of N-myristoylated proteins in E. coli cells can be achieved by coexpression of heterologous NMT with the target protein. In the past, dual plasmid systems were used for this purpose. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a single vector system for efficient coexpression of substrate and enzyme suitable for production of co- or posttranslationally modified proteins. The approach was validated using the HIV-1 Nef protein as an example. A simple and efficient protocol for production of highly pure and completely N-myristoylated Nef is presented. The yield is about 20 mg myristoylated Nef per liter growth medium. Conclusions/Significance The single vector strategy allows diverse modifications of target proteins recombinantly coexpressed in E. coli with heterologous enzymes. The method is generally applicable and provides large amounts of quantitatively processed target protein that are sufficient for comprehensive biophysical and structural studies."

In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that bis(propyl)-cognitin voltage-dependently, selectively, and moderately inhibited NMDA-activated currents. The inhibitory effects of bis(propyl)-cognitin increased with the rise in NMDA and glycine concentrations. Kinetics analysis showed that the inhibition was of fast onset and offset with an off-rate time constant of 1.9 s. Molecular docking simulations showed moderate hydrophobic interaction between bis(propyl)-cognitin and the MK-801 binding region in the ion channel pore of the NMDA receptor. Bis(propyl)-cognitin was further found to compete with [3H]MK-801 with a Ki value of 0.27 μm, and the mutation of NR1(N616R) significantly reduced its inhibitory potency. Under glutamate-mediated pathological conditions, bis(propyl)-cognitin, in contrast to bis(heptyl)-cognitin, prevented excitotoxicity with increasing effectiveness against escalating levels of glutamate and much more effectively protected against middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced brain damage than did memantine. More interestingly, under NMDA receptor-mediated physiological conditions, bis(propyl)-cognitin enhanced long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices, whereas MK-801 reduced and memantine did not alter this process.

https://openalex.org/W2002307677,"Stroke and peripheral limb ischemia are serious clinical problems with poor prognosis and limited treatment. The cytokines erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been used to induce endogenous cell repair and angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that the combination therapy of EPO and G-CSF exerted synergistic effects on cell survival and functional recovery from cerebral and peripheral limbs ischemia. We observed that even under normoxic conditions, G-CSF activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which then binds to the EPO promoter and enhances EPO expression. Serum EPO level was significantly increased by G-CSF injection, with the exception of Tg-HIF-1alpha(+f/+f) mice. The neuroplastic mechanisms exerted by EPO combined with G-CSF included enhanced expression of the antiapoptotic protein of Bcl-2, augmented neurotrophic factors synthesis, and promoted neovascularization. Further, the combination therapy significantly increased homing and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and intrinsic neural progenitor cells (INPCs) into the ischemic area. In summary, EPO in combination with G-CSF synergistically enhanced angiogenesis and tissue plasticity in ischemic animal models, leading to greater functional recovery than either agent alone."
https://openalex.org/W2005974685,"Delta-lactoferrin (DeltaLf) is a transcription factor that up-regulates DcpS, Skp1, and Bax genes, provoking cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is post-translationally modified either by O-GlcNAc or phosphate, but the effects of the O-GlcNAc/phosphorylation interplay on DeltaLf function are not yet understood. Here, using a series of glycosylation mutants, we showed that Ser(10) is O-GlcNAcylated and that this modification is associated with increased DeltaLf stability, achieved by blocking ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, demonstrating that O-GlcNAcylation protects against polyubiquitination. We highlighted the (391)KSQQSSDPDPNCVD(404) sequence as a functional PEST motif responsible for DeltaLf degradation and defined Lys(379) as the main polyubiquitin acceptor site. We next investigated the control of DeltaLf transcriptional activity by the O-GlcNAc/phosphorylation interplay. Reporter gene analyses using the Skp1 promoter fragment containing a DeltaLf response element showed that O-GlcNAcylation at Ser(10) negatively regulates DeltaLf transcriptional activity, whereas phosphorylation activates it. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that O-GlcNAcylation inhibits DNA binding. Deglycosylation leads to DNA binding and transactivation of the Skp1 promoter at a basal level. Basal transactivation was markedly enhanced by 2-3-fold when phosphorylation was mimicked at Ser(10) by aspartate. Moreover, using double chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the DeltaLf transcriptional complex binds to the DeltaLf response element and is phosphorylated and/or ubiquitinated, suggesting that DeltaLf transcriptional activity and degradation are concomitant events. Collectively, our results indicate that reciprocal occupancy of Ser(10) by either O-phosphate or O-GlcNAc coordinately regulates DeltaLf stability and transcriptional activity."

Folate deficiency (FD) has been shown to induce DNA damage repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We anticipated that FD and BER deficiency would interact to accelerate aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and tumor development in beta-pol haploinsufficient animals. FD resulted in a significant increase in ACF formation in wild type (WT) animals exposed to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, a known colon and liver carcinogen; however, FD reduced development of ACF in beta-pol haploinsufficient mice. Prolonged feeding of the FD diet resulted in advanced ACF formation and liver tumors in wild type mice. However, FD attenuated onset and progression of ACF and prevented liver tumorigenesis in beta-pol haploinsufficient mice, i.e. FD provided protection against tumorigenesis in a BER-deficient environment in all tissues where 1,2-dimethylhydrazine exerts its damage. Here we show a distinct down-regulation in DNA repair pathways, e.g. BER, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair, and decline in cell proliferation, as well as an up-regulation in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, proapoptotic genes, and apoptosis in colons of FD beta-pol haploinsufficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2082349351,"The conserved 11 zinc-finger protein CTCF is involved in several transcriptional mechanisms, including insulation and enhancer blocking. We had previously identified two composite elements consisting of a CTCF and a TR binding site at the chicken lysozyme and the human c-myc genes. Using these it has been demonstrated that thyroid hormone mediates the relief of enhancer blocking even though CTCF remains bound to its binding site. Here we wished to determine whether CTCF and TR combined sites are representative of a general feature of the genome, and whether such sites are functional in regulating enhancer blocking. Genome wide analysis revealed that about 18% of the CTCF regions harbored at least one of the four different palindromic or repeated sequence arrangements typical for the binding of TR homodimers or TR/RXR heterodimers. Functional analysis of 10 different composite elements of thyroid hormone responsive genes was performed using episomal constructs. The episomal system allowed recapitulating CTCF mediated enhancer blocking function to be dependent on poly (ADP)-ribose modification and to mediate histone deacetylation. Furthermore, thyroid hormone sensitive enhancer blocking could be shown for one of these new composite elements. Remarkably, not only did the regulation of enhancer blocking require functional TR binding, but also the basal enhancer blocking activity of CTCF was dependent on the binding of the unliganded TR. Thus, a number of composite CTCF/TR binding sites may represent a subset of other modular CTCF composite sites, such as groups of multiple CTCF sites or of CTCF/Oct4, CTCF/Kaiso or CTCF/Yy1 combinations."

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that common and rare variation in the GHSR locus are related to increased prevalence of obesity and overweight among Whites.In a population-based study sample of 15,854 unrelated, middle-aged Danes, seven variants were genotyped to capture common variation in an 11 kbp region including GHSR. These were investigated for their individual and haplotypic association with obesity. None of these analyses revealed consistent association with measures of obesity. A -151C/T promoter mutation in the GHSR was found in two unrelated obese patients. One family presented with complete co-segregation, but the other with incomplete co-segregation. The mutation resulted in an increased transcriptional activity (p<0.02) and introduction of a specific binding for Sp-1-like nuclear extracts relative to the wild type. The -151C/T mutation was genotyped in the 15,854 Danes with a minor allele frequency of 0.01%.

https://openalex.org/W1982465384,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the insular cortex (IC) represent two major areas for odor-taste associations, i.e. flavor integration. This learning may require the development of convergent odor and taste neuronal activation allowing the memory representation of such association. Yet identification of neurons that respond to such coincident input and the effect of flavor experience on odor-taste convergence remain unclear. In the present study we used the compartmental analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization for Arc (catFISH) to visualize odor-taste convergence onto single neurons in the BLA and in the IC to assess the number of cells that were co-activated by both stimuli after odor-taste association. We used a sucrose conditioned odor preference as a flavor experience in rats, in which 9 odor-sucrose pairings induce a reliable odor-taste association. The results show that flavor experience induced a four-fold increase in the percentage of cells activated by both taste and odor stimulations in the BLA, but not in the IC. Because conditioned odor preference did not modify the number of cells responding selectively to one stimulus, this greater odor-taste convergence into individual BLA neurons suggests the recruitment of a neuronal population that can be activated by both odor and taste only after the association. We conclude that the development of convergent activation in amygdala neurons after odor-taste associative learning may provide a cellular basis of flavor memory."

Although ultimately these diseases await the promise of a cure through gene therapy (21Bennett J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2483-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Simonelli F.

Consequently, understanding how genetic mutations lead to retinal degeneration is critical for the development of novel therapies. Studies in several laboratories and the establishment of ABCA4 screening consortiums have aided in the identification of over 500 mutations in the ABCA4 gene that are associated with a plethora of visual diseases. A genotyping microarray chip has been developed for the ABCA4 gene that can robustly identify >98% of the existing mutations (23Jaakson K. Zernant J. Külm M. Hutchinson A. Tonisson N. Glavac D. Ravnik-Glavac M. Hawlina M. Meltzer M.R. Caruso R.C. Testa F. Maugeri A. Hoyng C.B. Gouras P. Simonelli F. Lewis R.A. Lupski J.R. Cremers F.P. Allikmets R. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles have shown an extraordinary genetic heterogeneity. Some of these mutations map to the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), suggesting that the underlying defect has a basis in nucleotide hydrolysis and/or aspects of energy transduction related to transport. However, the fact that ABCA4 mutations occur throughout the entire open reading frame suggest that defects in ATP hydrolysis only are one of the causes of these diseases. At present, the biochemical basis of functional defects due to mutations in domains other than the NBDs remains refractory to biochemical analysis, primarily because these domains lack any known enzymatic function. Structural topology varies significantly between the eight subclasses of ABC transporters. In the ABCA subfamily, each half-transporter contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) composed of six membrane-spanning units, followed by a cytoplasmic or soluble domain. In addition, each ABCA half-transporter possesses a large extracellular loop, which is characteristic of this subfamily. In the case of ABCA4, several models of membrane topology have been proposed based on hydropathy profiles, and experimental data support the notion that two large extracellular domains (ECDs) are present (24Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The extracellular loops project from TMD1 for ECD1 and from TMD7 for ECD2; they represent significantly large polypeptide domains, with 603 residues for ECD1 (amino acids 43–646) and 285 residues for ECD2 (amino acids 1395–1680). The high degree of sequence conservation observed in the ECDs of vertebrate ABCA4 proteins suggests an important physiological significance (20Molday R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Yatsenko A.N. Wiszniewski W. Zaremba C.M. Jamrich M. Lupski J.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 60: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the absence of any known enzymatic or functional motif, it has been difficult to assess the significance of disease-associated mutations in the ECD domains of ABCA4. Expression and characterization of individual functional domains have been demonstrated to be a viable approach utilized by several laboratories working with other ABC proteins, such as the MDR1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator transporters (26Chen W. Bahl O.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Zhang G. Xi J. Wang X. Guo J. Zhang H. Yang Y. Qiao S. Wang L. Zhang H. He L. Zhu Y. J. Immunol.

ABCA4 is a particularly large membrane protein (∼220 kDa), which is fairly unstable as a recombinant whole molecule. Consequently, systematic analysis of the structure and function of each individual domain in recombinant form is a highly viable and specific approach, as demonstrated by our previous studies with the NBD1/NBD2 domains of ABCA4. Previously, we were able to delineate the structural and functional specificities of the individual nucleotide binding domains, which would not have been possible using the full-length ABCA4 protein (30Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Biswas-Fiss E.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10683-10696Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and CD spectroscopic methodologies have been utilized as valuable tools for the characterization of structure and function of a variety of proteins, including ABC transporters (33Massiah M.A. Ko Y.H. Pederson P.L. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol.

In this study, we have employed these techniques to elucidate the structural features and functional properties of the second extracellular loop of ABCA4 as well as to delineate the effects of disease-associated mutations in the ECD2 domain. The pRK5 plasmid containing the full-length, wild type cDNA of the human ABCA4 gene was obtained as a generous gift from Drs. J. Nathans and Michael Dean of The Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) and NCBI (Frederick, MD), respectively. The T7 expression system vector pET30b, Bug Buster protein extraction reagent, Benzonase® nuclease, and the S-protein-agarose affinity resin were from Novagen (EMD Sciences, Briggstown, NJ). All-trans retinal was from Sigma, and 11-cis-retinal was synthesized by Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada. Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Buffer C contained 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 2 mm EDTA. Buffer D contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m l-arginine, and 2 mm EDTA. Buffer E contained 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The ECD2 construct was amplified from full-length ABCA4 cDNA and cloned into pET30b T7 expression vector (EMD Sciences) using standard recombinant DNA technology (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 391Google Scholar). This domain corresponds to a 31.8-kDa (285 amino acids) polypeptide. The cloning was designed such that the polypeptide was produced as an S-tagged fusion protein, leading to a predicted mass of 34.4 kDa for the recombinant ECD2. For subsequent recombinant protein expression, the plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RILP competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (32Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the pET30-ECD2 plasmid as template. The complementary oligonucleotides were used as mutagenic primers to generate the mutant ECD2 proteins as detailed in Table 1. The authenticity of the mutations and the absence of other fortuitous mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by Eurofins MWG/Operon (Huntsville, AL).TABLE 1Stargardt disease-associated mutations occurring in the ECD2 domain investigated in this studyMutationBase changeMutagenesis primerR1443HCGC4328CAC5′-CAGGCTTTGGCAACCACTGAAGGAAGGGTGGCTTC-3′W1408LTGG4221TTG5′-ACCCTTCACCCCTTGATATGGGCAGCAGTACACCTTC-3′C1488RTGC4462CGC5′-AACCCTTCACCATCCCGCAGGTGCAGCACCAGGGAGAAG-3′ Open table in a new tab E. coli cells (strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RILP, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring pET30b-ECD2 plasmid were used to produce the recombinant ECD2 polypeptide following the manufacturer's instructions. The expressed recombinant polypeptide appeared to be of the anticipated size (34 kDa), as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Extraction and purification of wild type ECD2 protein carrying the S-tag using immobilized S-protein-agarose affinity resin (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) followed the manufacturer's recommendations as described previously (30Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Introduction of mutations into wild type ECD2 polypeptide appeared to decrease the solubility of the expressed proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot procedure (data not shown). Consequently, we explored the extraction of recombinant proteins (wild type and mutants) from the inclusion bodies followed by refolding (37Winterfeld S. Imhof N. Roos T. Bär G. Kuhn A. Gerken U. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This approach has been shown to be highly successful in the purification of a number of ABC transporters (32Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Booth C.L. Pulaski L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.

Microbiol. 2005; 156: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant ECD2 proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies using a protocol, which combines the use of BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI), to process the insoluble fraction and yield purified inclusion bodies, with the method described previously (32Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Booth C.L. Pulaski L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.

After harvesting the expressed proteins, the cell pellets were resuspended in room temperature BugBuster reagent, and protease inhibitors were added. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was centrifuged to collect purified inclusion bodies. Following cell lysis, the pellet of inclusion bodies was resuspended in Buffer B and centrifuged once more. The inclusion body proteins were solubilized in Buffer C. Protein refolding was achieved by rapid dilution in Buffer D. The renatured protein was sequentially dialyzed in Buffer E. After overnight dialysis, proteins were concentrated to ∼0.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon/Millipore). Overall, the inclusion body protein purification methodology described here yielded highly concentrated, purified, and homogeneous preparations of protein. The yield of ECD2 protein was >10 mg from 4 liters of induced cell culture. Purified proteins were stored at-80 °C until use. Spectra were collected on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (X-ray and Structure Core Facility, Thomas Jefferson University) using a 2-mm path length cell, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C, or the indicated temperature, using a Peltier controlled cuvette holder. Spectra were the average of five scans collected at a speed of 10 nm/min. Unless otherwise indicated, protein concentrations were 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl. Buffer spectra were always subtracted. CD spectra were analyzed using the K2D2 method with its associated web server to estimate protein secondary structure (42Perez-Iratxeta C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 43Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). For thermal melting experiments, the ellipticity at 220 nm was monitored over a temperature range of 20–80 °C, using a resolution of 0.2 °C, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a temperature gradient of 1 °C min−1. Global analysis of the data was conducted using the PRISM program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Fluorescence experiments were performed using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba Inc., Edison, NJ), and measurements were made in an L-format configuration of excitation and emission channels. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm to avoid excitation of either tyrosine or phenylalanine residues. Emission was scanned from 320 to 400 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 8 and 4 nm, respectively. The spectra of the ECD2 polypeptide were measured in a 0.1 mg/ml solution in Buffer E. Changes in steady-state fluorescence were used to monitor interaction with all-trans- and 11-cis retinal over a concentration range of 0–15 μm. Titrations with increasing amounts of all-trans-retinal were conducted, and emission scans from 320 to 400 nm were taken at each concentration. Fluorescence data were normalized to 0–100 arbitrary units for wild type ECD2 and each mutant. A semilog plot of emission at 333 nm versus log [all-trans-retinal] was fitted to the sigmoidal dose-response Equation 1,y=ymin+(ymax−ymin)/(1+10(log⁡Kd−X))(Eq. 1) where y is the fluorescence intensity, and x is the log of the all-trans-retinal concentration. To determine the appropriate emission/excitation parameters for anisotropy measurements involving all-trans-retinal, an emission scan following excitation at 310 nm was conducted. Following excitation of 100 nm all-trans-retinal at 310 nm, emission scans were collected over the range of 370–570 nm. The 100 nm solution of all-trans-retinal was then titrated with ECD2 polypeptide over the range of 0 to 0.1 mg/ml protein. Anisotropy measurements were made in an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer equipped with Glan Thompson polarizers (ISS Inc., Urbana-Champaign, IL). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a Peltier controlled cuvette holder. Anisotropy runs were collected in triplicate. Anisotropy values were expressed as millianisotropy, or mA (anisotropy divided by 1000). The standard error for the measured anisotropy values was ±3 mA. An anisotropy reading for each titration point was taken three times for 10 s and averaged. The total fluorescence intensity did not change significantly with an increase in the ECD2 concentration. Therefore, fluorescence lifetime changes, or the scattered excitation light, did not affect the anisotropy measurements. Anisotropy, A, is defined as shown in Equation 2,A=(Ivv−G/vh)/(lvv+2Gvh)(Eq. 2) where G is the instrumental correction factor for the fluorometer, and it is defined as follows: G = Ihv/Ihh, where, Ivv, Ivh, Ihv, and Ihh represent the fluorescence signal for excitation and emission with the polarizers set as follows: 0°, 0°; 0°, 90°; 90°, 0°; and 90°, 90°, respectively. The interaction of ECD2 with all-trans-retinal (ATR) can be represented as ECD2 + ATR ⇋ ECD2·ATR. At equilibrium, Ka, the equilibrium association constant, can be given as shown in Equations 3 and 4,Ka=(ECD2⋅ATR)/([ECD2][ATR])(Eq. 3) Ka⋅[ECD2][ATR]=[ECD2⋅ATR](Eq. 4) The fraction of the bound ligand, f, can be represented as shown in Equation 5,f=[ bound ligand ]/ total ligand ]=[ECD2⋅ATR]/([ATR]+[ECD2⋅ATR])(Eq. 5) Substituting for [ECD2] and rearranging Equation 5, we get Equations 6 and 7,f=Ka[ECD2]/(1+Ka[ECD2])(Eq. 6) f=[ECD2]/([ECD2]+1/Ka)(Eq. 7) Similarly, the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd can be expressed, substituting Kd for 1/Ka, as shown in Equation 8,f=[ECD2]/([ECD2]+Kd)(Eq. 8) At Af = 0.5, Kd = [ECD2]. Thus, Kd can be further defined as the protein concentration at which half of the sites are occupied when the ligand concentration is constant as in the present case or the ligand concentration at which half of the sites are occupied when the protein concentration is constant. Analysis of the data were conducted using PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). The Kd value, i.e. the concentration of ECD2 required to bind 50% of the ligands, was computed using Equation 9,Y=Amin+(Amax−Amin)/(1+10(log⁡KD−x)⋅napp)(Eq. 9) where Amin and Amax are the anisotropy values at the bottom and top plateaus, respectively; X represents the log of the ECD2 concentration; Kd is the X value when the response is halfway between the top and the bottom, and napp is the Hill coefficient. Routine protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and for the CD/fluorescence studies using molar extension coefficient measurements ϵECD2 = 49,180. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The long extracellular loops, or domains, are a distinctive topological feature of the ABCA subfamily of transporters, yet at the present time their structure and function remain unknown. Based on current models (Fig. 1), the ECD1 domain of ABCA4 is defined as projecting from TMD1 (amino acids 43–646), and ECD2 projects from TMD7 (amino acids 1395–1680). We have calculated the grand average of hydropathicity indexes (GRAVY) for ECD1 and ECD2. GRAVY analysis of the domains were found to be −0.294 and −0.356 for ECD1 and ECD2, respectively (ProtParam, ExPASy Proteomics Server). A negative value corresponds to a hydrophilic polypeptide, although a positive value corresponds to hydrophobic polypeptide, and thus the values are consistent with the postulated projection of these domains into the aqueous environment of the lumen of the rod outer segment discs (Fig. 1) (46Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the second extracellular loop of ABCA4 demonstrates that this domain is highly conserved. The ECD2 domain contains seven tryptophan residues, six of which are strictly conserved among the species examined (Fig. 2). Several macular degenerative disease-associated mutations map to the ECD2 domain of ABCA4 (13Briggs C.E. Rucinski D. Rosenfeld P.J. Hirose T. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Three ABCA4 mutations associated with Stargardt disease, W1408L, R1443H, and C1488R, were chosen for analysis in this study. These missense mutations have been observed to occur in patients as simple and/or compound heterozygotes (Table 1). Sequence alignments of the ECD2 domains of ABCA4 proteins were carried out to determine the degree of conservation of these specific amino acid residues among the ECDs of several organisms. All three of the mutations correspond to strictly conserved amino acids in vertebrate ABCA4 proteins (Fig. 2). The structural characteristics of native and refolded recombinant ECD2 polypeptides were evaluated by comparing their CD spectra in the far-ultraviolet region (200–250 nm). Highly purified homogeneous preparations of recombinant ECD2 protein were used for CD analysis (Fig. 3). Secondary structures were determined using K2D2 neural network-based analysis (42Perez-Iratxeta C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the native and refolded ECD2 polypeptides are presented in Fig. 4. The two spectra were essentially identical and were typical of structurally ordered proteins, containing α-helical, β-sheet, and extended coil structures. Both CD spectra had two minima observed at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of α-helical structure (Fig. 4). Nonlinear regression analysis of the CD spectra provided an estimation of ECD2 secondary structure, 25 ± 3% α-helix and 20 ± 3% β-sheet, respectively (Table 2). These results suggest that the structure of the refolded ECD2 polypeptide is essentially the same as that of the native ECD2 protein. We have analyzed changes in the conformation of ECD2 protein harboring disease-associated mutations W1408L, C1488R, and R1443H. The secondary structures of these proteins were then compared with the wild type polypeptide (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6).TABLE 2Summary of the secondary structure for ECD2 polypeptideECD2 proteinSecondary structureα-Helixβ-SheetExtended coilAffinity-purified0.270.200.53Refolded0.250.200.55 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Circular dichroism spectra of wild type and mutant ABCA4-ECD2 polypeptides as a function of temperature.

https://openalex.org/W1997930251,"Altered tumor suppressor p53 and/or CDKN2A as well as Ras genes are frequently found in primary and metastatic melanomas. These alterations were found to be responsible for acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential through their defective regulatory control of metalloproteinases and urokinase genes.Using primary human melanoma M10 cells with altered p53, CDKN2A and N-Ras genes, we found that inhibition of the proprotein convertases (PCs), enzymes involved in the proteolytic activation of various cancer-related protein precursors resulted in significantly reduced invasiveness. Analysis of M10 cells and their gastric and lymph node derived metastatic cells revealed the presence of all the PCs found in the secretory pathway. Expression of the general PCs inhibitor alpha1-PDX in these cells in a stable manner (M10/PDX) had no effect on the mRNA expression levels of these PCs. Whereas, in vitro digestion assays and cell transfection experiments, revealed that M10/PDX cells display reduced PCs activity and are unable to process the PCs substrates proIGF-1R and proPDGF-A. These cells showed reduced migration and invasion that paralleled decreased gelatinase MMP-2 activity and increased expression and secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2. Furthermore, these cells showed decreased levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of PCs activity results in decreased invasiveness of primary human melanoma cells despite their altered p53, CDKN2A and N-Ras genes, suggesting that PCs may serve as novel therapeutic targets in melanoma."

The DNA/RNA binding domain of B23 and the motor domain of Eg5 were found to be involved in their interaction. Both in vivo and in vitro evidences showed that B23 acts as an upstream regulator of Eg5 in promoting microtubule polymerization. Moreover, we further demonstrated that B23 regulates microtubule dynamics by directly inhibiting Eg5 ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2127562476,"Diphosphomevalonate (Mev·pp) is the founding member of a new class of potential antibiotics targeting the Streptococcus pneumoniae mevalonate (Mev) pathway. We have synthesized a series of Mev·pp analogues designed to simultaneously block two steps in this pathway, through allosteric inhibition of mevalonate kinase (MK) and, for five of the analogues, by mechanism-based inactivation of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (DPM-DC). The analogue series expands the C3-methyl group of Mev·pp with hydrocarbons of varying size, shape, and chemical and physical properties. Previously, we established the feasibility of a prodrug strategy in which unphosphorylated Mev analogues could be enzymatically converted to the active Mev·pp forms by the endogenous MK and phosphomevalonate kinase. We now report the kinetic parameters for the turnover of non-, mono-, and diphosphorylated analogues as substrates and inhibitors of the three mevalonate pathway enzymes. The inhibition of MK by Mev·pp analogues revealed that the allosteric site is selective for compact, electron-rich C3-subsitutents. The lack of reactivity of analogues with DPM-DC provided evidence, counter to the existing model, for a decarboxylation transition state that is concerted rather than dissociative. The Mev pathway is composed of three structurally and functionally conserved enzymes that catalyze consecutive steps in a metabolic pathway. The current work reveals that these enzymes exhibit significant differences in specificity toward R-group substitution at C3 and that these patterns are explained well by changes in the volume of the C3 R-group-binding pockets of the enzymes.

The current work reveals that these enzymes exhibit significant differences in specificity toward R-group substitution at C3 and that these patterns are explained well by changes in the volume of the C3 R-group-binding pockets of the enzymes."

A recent report suggests that Mal/SRF and an upstream regulator, Pico, are required for cell proliferation and tissue growth in Drosophila. I find otherwise. Mutation of Mal or SRF does not affect cell proliferation in the fly wing. Furthermore, I cannot reproduce the reported effects of Pico RNAi or Pico overexpression on body size. Nevertheless, I can confirm that overexpression of Pico or Mal causes tissue overgrowth specifically in the fly wing--where SRF is most highly expressed. My results indicate that Mal/SRF can promote tissue growth when abnormally active, but is not normally required for tissue growth during development."
