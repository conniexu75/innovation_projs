https://openalex.org/W2087545338,"There is emerging evidence that background exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are important in the development of conditions predisposing to diabetes as well as of type 2 diabetes itself. We recently reported that low dose POPs predicted incident type 2 diabetes in a nested case-control study. The current study examined if low dose POPs predicted future adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance among controls without diabetes in that study.The 90 controls were diabetes-free during 20 years follow-up. They were a stratified random sample, enriched with overweight and obese persons. POPs measured in 1987-88 (year 2) sera included 8 organochlorine (OC) pesticides, 22 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 1 polybrominated biphenyl (PBB). Body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and homeostasis model assessment value for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were study outcomes at 2005-06 (year 20). The evolution of study outcomes during 18 years by categories of serum concentrations of POPs at year 2 was evaluated by adjusting for the baseline values of outcomes plus potential confounders. Parallel to prediction of type 2 diabetes, many statistically significant associations of POPs with dysmetabolic conditions appeared at low dose, forming inverted U-shaped dose-response relations. Among OC pesticides, p,p'-DDE most consistently predicted higher BMI, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR and lower HDL-cholesterol at year 20 after adjusting for baseline values. Oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, and hexachlorobenzene also significantly predicted higher triglycerides. Persistent PCBs with ≥7 chlorides predicted higher BMI, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR and lower HDL-cholesterol at year 20 with similar dose-response curves.Simultaneous exposure to various POPs in the general population may contribute to development of obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, common precursors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although obesity is a primary cause of these metabolic abnormalities, POPs exposure may contribute to excess adiposity and other features of dysmetabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2094933901,"Innate immune responses to vaccine adjuvants based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, are driven by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and adaptor proteins including MyD88 and TRIF, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons, and chemokines. We report here on the characterization of a synthetic hexaacylated lipid A derivative, denoted as glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA). We assessed the effects of GLA on murine and human dendritic cells (DC) by combining microarray, mRNA and protein multiplex assays and flow cytometry analyses. We demonstrate that GLA has multifunctional immunomodulatory activity similar to naturally-derived monophosphory lipid A (MPL) on murine DC, including the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, DC maturation and antigen-presenting functions. In contrast, hexaacylated GLA was overall more potent on a molar basis than heterogeneous MPL when tested on human DC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). When administered in vivo, GLA enhanced the immunogenicity of co-administered recombinant antigens, producing strong cell-mediated immunity and a qualitative TH1 response. We conclude that the GLA adjuvant stimulates and directs innate and adaptive immune responses by inducing DC maturation and the concomitant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with immune cell trafficking, activities which have important implications for the development of future vaccine adjuvants."

https://openalex.org/W2008381613,"Background The development of insulin resistance (IR) in mouse models of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by progressive accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and subpopulations of T cells in the visceral adipose. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) may play a critical role in modulating tissue inflammation via their interactions with both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms. We hypothesized that an imbalance in Tregs is a critical determinant of adipose inflammation and investigated the role of Tregs in IR/obesity through coordinated studies in mice and humans. Methods and Findings Foxp3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) “knock-in” mice were randomized to a high-fat diet intervention for a duration of 12 weeks to induce DIO/IR. Morbidly obese humans without overt type 2 DM (n = 13) and lean controls (n = 7) were recruited prospectively for assessment of visceral adipose inflammation. DIO resulted in increased CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ cells in visceral adipose with a striking decrease in visceral adipose Tregs. Treg numbers in visceral adipose inversely correlated with CD11b+CD11c+ adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Splenic Treg numbers were increased with up-regulation of homing receptors CXCR3 and CCR7 and marker of activation CD44. In-vitro differentiation assays showed an inhibition of Treg differentiation in response to conditioned media from inflammatory macrophages. Human visceral adipose in morbid obesity was characterized by an increase in CD11c+ ATMs and a decrease in foxp3 expression. Conclusions Our experiments indicate that obesity in mice and humans results in adipose Treg depletion. These changes appear to occur via reduced local differentiation rather than impaired homing. Our findings implicate a role for Tregs as determinants of adipose inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2082445383,"Recent studies have shown that tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) are critical to antiviral host defense in peripheral tissues. This new appreciation of TRM that reside in epithelial tissues and mediate host defense has been studied most extensively in skin: adult human skin contains large numbers of functional TRM that express skin specific markers. Indeed, more than twice as many T cells reside in skin as in peripheral blood. This T cell population has a diverse T cell receptor repertoire, and can produce a broad array of cytokines. More recently, we have begun to examine other epithelial tissues for the presence of resident T cells. In the present study, we asked whether analogous populations of resident T cells could be found in human lung. We were able to demonstrate abundant resident T cells in human lung-more than 10 billion T cells were present. Lung T cells were largely of the effector memory T cell (TEM) phenotype, though small numbers of central memory T cells (TCM) and T regulatory cells (Treg) could be identified. Lung T cells had a diverse T cell receptor repertoire and subsets produced IL-17, IL-4, IFNγ, as well as TNFα. A significant number of lung TRM CD4+Th cells produced more than one cytokine, identifying them as “multifunctional” Th1 type cells. Finally, lung TRM, but not TRM resident to skin or T cells from blood, proliferated in response to influenza virus. This work suggests that normal human lung contains large numbers of TRM cells, and these cells are poised to respond to recall antigens previously encountered through lung mucosa. This population of T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other T cell mediated lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2086704388,"Animal cells secrete small vesicles, otherwise known as exosomes and microvesicles (EMVs). A short, N-terminal acylation tag can target a highly oligomeric cytoplasmic protein, TyA, into secreted vesicles (Fang, Y., Wu, N., Gan, X., Yan, W., Morell, J. C., and Gould, S. J. (2007) PLoS Biol. 5, 1267–1283). However, it is not clear whether this is true for other membrane anchors or other highly oligomeric, cytoplasmic proteins. We show here that a variety of plasma membrane anchors can target TyA-GFP to sites of vesicle budding and into EMVs, including: (i) a myristoylation tag; (ii) a phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding domain; (iii), a phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate-binding domain; (iv) a prenylation/palmitoylation tag, and (v) a type-1 plasma membrane protein, CD43. However, the relative budding efficiency induced by these plasma membrane anchors varied over a 10-fold range, from 100% of control (AcylTyA-GFP) for the myristoylation tag and PIP2-binding domain, to one-third or less for the others, respectively. Targeting TyA-GFP to endosome membranes by fusion to a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding domain induced only a slight budding of TyA-GFP, ∼2% of control, and no budding was observed when TyA-GFP was targeted to Golgi membranes via a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-binding domain. We also found that a plasma membrane anchor can target two other highly oligomeric, cytoplasmic proteins to EMVs. These observations support the hypothesis that plasma membrane anchors can target highly oligomeric, cytoplasmic proteins to EMVs. Our data also provide additional parallels between EMV biogenesis and retrovirus budding, as the anchors that induced the greatest budding of TyA-GFP are the same as those that mediate retrovirus budding.

https://openalex.org/W2078453780,"Background Frataxin, the mitochondrial protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is thought to be involved in multiple iron-dependent mitochondrial pathways. In particular, frataxin plays an important role in the formation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters biogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings We present data providing new insights into the interactions of mammalian frataxin with the Fe-S assembly complex by combining in vitro and in vivo approaches. Through immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that the main endogenous interactors of a recombinant mature human frataxin are ISCU, NFS1 and ISD11, the components of the core Fe-S assembly complex. Furthemore, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that mammalian frataxin interacts with the preformed core complex, rather than with the individual components. The quaternary complex can be isolated in a stable form and has a molecular mass of ≈190 kDa. Finally, we demonstrate that the mature human FXN81–210 form of frataxin is the essential functional form in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the interaction of frataxin with the core ISCU/NFS1/ISD11 complex most likely defines the essential function of frataxin. Our results provide new elements important for further understanding the early steps of de novo Fe-S cluster biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1991210241,"Autophagy has recently been implicated in both the prevention and progression of cancer. However, the molecular basis for the relationship between autophagy induction and the initial acquisition of malignancy is currently unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that autophagy is essential for oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasV12)-induced malignant cell transformation. Retroviral expression of K-RasV12 induced autophagic vacuole formation and malignant transformation in human breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy completely blocked K-RasV12-induced, anchorage-independent cell growth on soft agar. Both mRNA and protein levels of ATG5 and ATG7 (autophagy-specific genes 5 and 7, respectively) were increased in cells overexpressing K-RasV12. Targeted suppression of ATG5 or ATG7 expression by short hairpin (sh) RNA inhibited cell growth on soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Moreover, inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants clearly attenuated K-RasV12-induced ATG5 and ATG7 induction, autophagy, and malignant cell transformation. MAPK pathway components were activated in cells overexpressing K-RasV12, and inhibition of JNK blunted induction of ATG5 and ATG7 and subsequent autophagy. In addition, pretreatment with antioxidants completely inhibited K-RasV12-induced JNK activation. Our results provide novel evidence that autophagy is critically involved in malignant transformation by oncogenic K-Ras and show that reactive oxygen species-mediated JNK activation plays a causal role in autophagy induction through up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7.

Ras GTPases act as molecular switches to transduce extracellular signals to the nucleus, where they regulate an overlapping set of cellular responses. Uncontrolled Ras activation is one of the most common genetic alterations associated with human cancers. Point mutations of Ras genes abolish the GTPase-activating protein-dependent GTP hydrolysis activity of Ras, leading to a constitutively activated Ras protein. These mutations occur at high frequency in mammalian cells, resulting in malignant transformation and further progression to cancer. Such point mutations have been found in a broad spectrum of tumors; in fact, oncogenic Ras mutations are found in more than 30% of all human malignancies, suggesting that Ras plays an important role in tumor development (1Karnoub A.E.

Cellular homeostasis depends on a balance between the rates of synthesis and degradation of intracellular components. Eukaryotic cells primarily use two distinct mechanisms, the proteasome pathway and autophagy, for large scale degradation; however, only autophagy has the capacity to degrade entire organelles (7Levine B.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a dynamic process that prolongs survival for a short time under starvation conditions and is evolutionarily conserved among all eukaryotic cells, from yeast to mammals. It is a highly regulated cellular mechanism in which intracellular double membrane-bound structures, known as autophagosomes, sequester proteins and intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria, and fuse with a lysosome or vacuole. Organelle contents are subsequently degraded and recycled as part of a process that serves to maintain cell viability (9Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 10Lum J.J. DeBerardinis R.J. Thompson C.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies have focused on the importance of autophagy in cancer, but it is still not clear whether autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis or is a mechanism to rescue cancer cells under unfavorable conditions. Autophagy may be involved in regulating both the promotion and prevention of cancer, and its role may be altered during tumor progression. Inhibition of autophagy allows the continuous growth of precancerous cells (11Mathew R. White E. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Liang X.H. Jackson S.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), and defects in autophagy are associated with increased tumorigenesis (14Degenhardt K. Mathew R. Beaudoin B. Bray K.

Karantza-Wadsworth V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting that autophagy can act as a cancer suppressor. However, autophagy may have another role, as reflected in the correlation between autophagy and promotion of cell survival under stress. As a tumor grows, resident cancer cells may depend on autophagy to survive nutrient-limiting and low oxygen conditions, especially in the internal, poorly vascularized region of the tumor (16Todde V. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As a corollary, autophagy may favor tumor development, indicating that inhibition of autophagy might be required to block tumorigenesis. Thus, autophagy may be involved not only in the prevention of cancer but also in the initiation and/or promotion of cancer (17Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 18Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar, 19Ng G. Huang J. Mol.

However, the molecular basis for the regulatory relationship between autophagy and the initial acquisition of human malignancy has not yet been defined. In the present study, we investigated whether autophagy is involved in oncogenic K-Ras-induced malignant transformation and, if so, how the Ras signaling pathway is involved in the control of autophagy. We provide novel evidence that autophagy is an essential element in the induction of malignant transformation by oncogenic K-Ras and show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; DCFH-DA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ATG, autophagy-specific gene.-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation plays a causal role in autophagy induction through up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7 (autophagy-related genes 5 and 7). 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), actinomycin D, and DMSO were purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1, cycloheximide, PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem. LysoTracker Green DND-26 was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) (L-7526). Polyclonal antibodies to anti-K-Ras, ATG6 (Beclin 1), ATG7, caspase 8, caspase 9, phospho-ERK, and p38 MAPK were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-ATG5, LC3, and LAMP-1 were obtained from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to cleaved caspase 3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, ERK, JNK, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38 MAPK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-β-actin was obtained from Sigma. The normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. MCF10A cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3, pcDNA-ATG5, pcDNA-ATG7, or pcDNA-catalase using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) by following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. To generate MFG-K-RasV12, PCR fragments produced against pSPORT-K-RasV12 as templates were cloned into MFG retroviral vector derived from murine Moloney leukemia virus. For retrovirus production, a modified 293T cell line was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1 μg/ml tetracyclin, 2 μg/ml puromycin, and 0.6 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Calbiochem) and transfected with MFG-K-RasV12 using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h after the transfection, virus supernatant was harvested every day by replenishing with fresh medium for 5 days and passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral supernatant was frozen at −80 °C. The supernatant was used for infection after adding 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). MISSION shRNA plasmids (Sigma) encoding small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ATG5, ATG7, or control were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids (ATG5, TRCN0000150645; ATG7, TRCN0000000281; control, SHC202V) were effective in knocking down ATG5 or ATG7 expression. To standardize lentiviral transduction assays, viral titers were measured in an MCF10A cell line. For growth assays, titers corresponding to multiplicities of infection of 5 and 1 in MCF10A cells were employed. For ATG5 or ATG7 knockdown, cells were plated on day zero at 1 × 105 cells in a 60-mm dish. Cells were infected, and after 24 h, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml puromycin for 3 days to eliminate uninfected cells. Medium was replaced, and after 2 more days, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis (22Singh A. Greninger P. Rhodes D. Koopman L. Violette S. Bardeesy N. Settleman J.

Cells (1 × 105) were mixed with medium containing 0.4% agar and were spread on top of a bottom agar layer (0.8% agar in growth medium). Fresh layer of medium containing 0.4% agar was added weekly on top of the previous layer. Colonies greater than 50 mm in diameter were counted and were photographed after 2 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis using PI (2.5 μg/ml) staining detects cell death by means of the dye entering the cells along with changes in the target cell membrane and DNA damage. For the cell death assessment, the cells were plated in a 60-mm dish with a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/dish. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in PI for 5 min at room temperature. Then cells (10,000 cells/sample) were analyzed on a flow cytometric scan flow cytometer, using Cell Quest software. Briefly, cells were seeded individually onto plates at 20,000 cells. Cell counts were determined by counting the viable cells in a hemocytometer using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Every 24 h for 6 days, three dishes of each group were counted. All animal procedures and care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of Hanyang University. Tumors were formed by subcutaneous inoculation of 5 × 106 cells or into athymic BALB/c female nude mice (5 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories). Tumor size was measured with a caliper (calculated volume = shortest diameter2 × longest diameter/2) at 3-day intervals. Mice were sacrificed on day 27, and tumors were photographed and harvested immediately. Cells incubated as described above were pelleted and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 120 min, washed three times, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 60 min. The cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol battery ranging from 20 to 100% and were later placed in 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 ratios of propylene oxide or epon-812 resin for 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Ultrathin sections of 70 nm were made and impregnated with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. The sections were visualized in a Zeiss EM-900 transmission electron microscope at 50 kV and photographed. The negatives were scanned at 600 × 600 dpi resolution, and the images obtained were analyzed later with a PC-compatible computer using customized software. To visualize acidic vacuole in cells overexpressing K-RasV12, cells were stained with 50 nm LysoTracker Green DND-26 fluorescence dye for 10 min and washed with PBS and then changed to culture media. Cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy. MCF10A cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 to identify autophagosome and then infected with oncogenic K-RasV12. Punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence were imaged by fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins with lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Blots were developed with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedures (Amersham Biosciences), using the manufacturer's protocol. Total mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCRs were performed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of autophagy genes was determined by RT-PCR using the following primers: ATG5, 5′-AGCAACTCTGGATGGGATTG-3′ and 5′-CACTGCAGAGGTGTTTCCAA′; ATG6 (Beclin-1), 5′-GGCCAATAAGATGGGTCTGA-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTGTCCACTGCTCCTC-3′; ATG7, 5′-ACCCAGAAGAAGCTGAACGA-3′ and 5′-AGACAGAGGGCAGGATAGCA-3′; GAPDH, 5′-AAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATT-3′ and 5′-CCATGGGTGGAATCATATTGG-3′. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 μm 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 37 °C for 15 min and washed with PBS three times. DCFH-DA were analyzed by a flow cytometer with BD CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). All experimental data are reported as means ± S.E. (error bars). Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric Student's t test. MCF10A, a spontaneously immortalized, normal human breast epithelial cell line, infected with the constitutively active, oncogenic K-Ras mutant G12V (K-RasV12), exhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, forming foci in a monolayer (Fig. 1A), and induced tumor formation in nude mice (Fig. 1B). Transient overexpression of K-RasV12 also induced massive vacuole formation (Fig. 1C), stimulating the time-dependent accumulation of vacuolated cells. At 72 h after infection, at least one vacuole was present in more than 70% of K-RasV12-overexpressed cells. To determine whether vacuolation in cells overexpressing K-RasV12 was associated with autophagy, we first stained cells with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker Green. Staining of cells with LysoTracker followed by analysis by fluorescence microscopy revealed that oncogenic K-Ras induced extensive formation of LysoTracker-positive acidic vacuoles in normal human breast epithelial cell at 48 h after infection (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in cells transfected with a GFP-tagged version of the autophagosome marker, LC3, oncogenic K-Ras promoted an increase in the punctuate distribution of GFP-LC3 (Fig. 2B). Oncogenic K-Ras also induced an increase in LC3-II, a processed form of LC3 (Fig. 2B), indicating that oncogenic K-Ras-induced the accumulation of autophagic vesicles. To further detect lysosomal localization of LC3 protein, we examined co-localization of LC3 and the lysosome marker LAMP-1. As shown in Fig. 2C, infection of cells with oncogenic K-Ras induced co-localization of LC3 and LAMP-1, indicating lysosomal localization of LC3 protein. Electron microscopy of MCF-10A cells overexpressing K-RasV12 also clearly revealed the appearance of large membranous vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). The formation of these membranous vacuoles increased progressively with increasing duration of exposure to oncogenic K-Ras. Some of the vacuoles resembled autophagosomes and contained remnants of degraded organelles, including mitochondria. In addition, oncogenic K-Ras promoted an increase in the punctuate distribution of GFP-LC3 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and LC3-II, a processed form of LC3 (supplemental Fig. S1B) and induced malignant cell transformation (supplemental Fig. S1C) in normal Rat2 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. To demonstrate the involvement of the autophagic process in K-RasV12-induced cellular transformation, we pretreated cells that overexpressed oncogenic K-Ras with bafilomycin A1, a selective vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor, or with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), both of which are known to be involved in sequestration (i.e. the first step of autophagy). Pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 or 3-MA completely blocked both K-RasV12-induced anchorage-independent cell growth on soft agar (Fig. 3B) and formation of autophagy (Fig. 3A) in the MCF-10A normal human breast epithelial cell line. However, treatment of MCF-10A cells with either inhibitor did not cause significant changes in cell viability (supplemental Fig. S2A) and cell growth (supplemental Fig. S2B). In addition, bafilomycin A1 or 3-MA inhibited K-RasV12-induced autophagy (supplemental Fig. S3A) and cell transformation in Rat2 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S3B). These results indicate that autophagic vacuole formation may be critical for the induction of cellular transformation by oncogenic K-Ras. We further found that the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide significantly attenuated K-RasV12-induced autophagic vacuole formation (supplemental Fig. S4A), indicating a requirement for transcriptional induction and de novo protein synthesis. Autophagosome formation is mediated by a set of evolutionarily conserved ATG proteins, and studying the expression patterns of ATG genes under specific conditions has provided key information about the autophagic process (25Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev.

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analyses to examine changes in the level of ATG mRNA and protein expression, respectively, we found that ATG5 and ATG7 were induced at both the transcriptional and translational level in MCF10A cells overexpressing K-RasV12 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there were no changes in the levels of ATG6. Up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7 was also found in tumors from nude mice (Fig. 4B). Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG5 or ATG7 effectively attenuated K-RasV12-induced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as autophagic vacuole formation (Fig. 4C). To confirm the direct association between the malignant cell transformation and autophagic vacuole formation induced by oncogenic K-Ras, WT ATG5 or WT ATG7 was reintroduced into ATG5 or ATG7 knockdown cells, respectively, using a pcDNA vector carrying the ATG5 or ATG7 gene. As shown in Fig. 4D, the malignant cell transformation and autophagic vacuole formation were restored to a level similar to that of cells overexpressing K-RasV12. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG5 or ATG7 effectively attenuated K-RasV12-induced tumor formation in nude mice (Fig. 4E). In addition, treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide significantly inhibited K-RasV12-induced ATG5 and ATG7 expression (supplemental Fig. S4B). These data strongly indicate that up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7 is involved in both the malignant cell transformation and autophagic vacuole formation induced by oncogenic K-Ras. It has been shown that Ras plays a role in regulating the redox state of the cell and that constitutive production of ROS correlates with Ras-induced cell transformation (29Kopnin P.B. Agapova L.S. Kopnin B.P. Chumakov P.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Alexandrova A.Y. Kopnin P.B. Vasiliev J.M. Kopnin B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MCF10A cells overexpressing K-RasV12 induced ROS production, we measured intracellular ROS levels using the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. As shown in Fig. 5A, cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras exhibited a marked increase in fluorescence over time relative to control cells, indicating production of intracellular ROS. To determine whether this increase in ROS is essential for autophagy, we tested the effects of catalase, which specifically decomposes H2O2, and NAC, a chemical antioxidant, on the formation of autophagosomes using LC3 as a marker. Cells treated with these antioxidants did not generate ROS (Fig. 5B) and failed to form autophagosomes (Fig. 5C). Moreover, ectopic expression of catalase clearly attenuated K-RasV12-induced anchorage-independent cell growth on soft agar (Fig. 5D) and expression of ATG5 and ATG7 (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that ROS are critical regulators of K-RasV12-induced development of autophagy and malignant cell transformation. Members of the MAPK family of proteins can be phosphorylated and activated in response to various extracellular signals and are the best characterized effectors of Ras. In some cells, certain MAPK family members have been shown to possess ROS-sensitive kinase activity. To examine the potential involvement of MAPKs in K-RasV12-induced autophagy, we analyzed the activation status of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of these kinases. As shown in Fig. 6A, the phosphorylated forms of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK were up-regulated in cells overexpressing K-RasV12, indicating that these kinases are activated in response to oncogenic K-Ras. To further determine whether activation of MAPK might be required for K-RasV12-induced ROS generation and autophagy, we inhibited MAPK with specific pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 6B, pretreatment with a JNK inhibitor or siRNA-mediated JNK knockdown suppressed K-RasV12-induced ATG5 and ATG7 expression. siRNA targeting of JNK also inhibited autophagy and colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 6C) but did not block the associated generation of ROS (Fig. 6C). Moreover, inhibition of ROS by pretreatment with NAC, a general antioxidant, suppressed K-RasV12-induced JNK activation (Fig. 6D) but did not affect ERK or p38 MAPK activation. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK with a specific chemical inhibitor or p38 MAPK-siRNA markedly suppressed the generation of ROS in cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras (Fig. 6C). In addition, inhibition of p38 MAPK clearly suppressed K-RasV12-induced autophagic vacuole formation (Fig. 6C) and anchorage-independent cell growth (Fig. 6C) as well as JNK activation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that p38 MAPK signaling is involved in K-RasV12-induced ROS production and that JNK lies downstream of p38 MAPK-dependent ROS generation and plays a role in ATG5 and ATG7 up-regulation, autophagy, and malignant cell transformation. Recent evidence has indicated that autophagy is associated with both suppression and progression of cancer. However, what has not been clear is whether autophagy is involved in the acquisition of human malignancies in response to activated oncogenes. Here, we show that autophagy is associated with the malignant transformation of mammalian cells induced by oncogenic K-Ras and that cross-talk between ROS and MAPK signaling is required for ATG expression and autophagy induction in cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras. Autophagy has been shown to play important roles in sustaining cellular metabolism and nutrient homeostasis in both normal and tumor cells (7Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 8Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J.

Several recent studies have focused on the importance of autophagy in cancer, but it has remained unclear whether autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis or provides cancer cells with a mechanism for escaping unfavorable conditions. It has been shown that as a tumor grows, autophagy may provide the means for cancer cells to survive nutrient-limiting and low oxygen conditions, especially in internal, poorly vascularized regions of a tumor (16Todde V. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that autophagy may play a role in the promotion of cancer. In this study, we further investigated whether autophagy is involved in malignant cell transformation. We provided novel evidence that autophagy is critically involved in K-RasV12-induced malignant cell transformation. Autophagy was induced in cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras, and inhibition of autophagy with chemical inhibitors completely blocked K-RasV12-induced anchorage-independent cell growth on soft agar and development of autophagic vacuoles. The chemical inhibitors did not cause significant changes in cell viability and cell growth. These results indicate roles for autophagy in malignant cell transformation as well as cancer progression. The formation of autophagosomes is a complex process regulated by multiple molecules and mediated by a set of evolutionarily conserved proteins of the ATG family (25Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev.

An example of this is a conjugation system involving ATG3 and ATG7 that is responsible for the addition of a phospholipid moiety to LC3-I that triggers LC3-I membrane localization. In this study, we found that ATG5 and ATG7 mRNA and protein levels were increased in cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy with siRNAs targeting ATG5 or ATG7 attenuated K-RasV12-mediated cell growth on soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. siRNA against ATG5 or ATG7 did not significantly alter the cell growth and survival (data not shown). Overexpression of ATG alone did not induce anchorage-independent cell growth (i.e. cell transformation), indicating the collaborative involvement of other effector pathways; however, down-regulation of ATG expression clearly reduced tumorigenic growth. These results indicate that autophagy alone is not sufficient to induce malignant transformation but is absolutely necessary for the tumorigenic response to oncogenic K-Ras. However, we do not know how autophagy is involved in the regulation of cellular signaling associated with malignant transformation induced by oncogenic K-Ras. The precise molecular mechanisms governing the cross-talk between autophagy and cell transformation remain to be elucidated. Autophagy is a unique intracellular trafficking pathway activated in response to extracellular signals (31Botti J. Djavaheri-Mergny M. Pilatte Y. Codogno P. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Yang Y.P. Liang Z.Q.

Although many of the proteins involved in this process have been identified, the signaling pathway leading to activation of autophagy is not fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrated that ROS are involved as signaling molecules in K-RasV12-induced autophagy. Not only did overexpression of K-RasV12 in normal human breast epithelial cells induce a marked increase in intracellular ROS levels, but inhibition of ROS with antioxidants also clearly attenuated induction of autophagy and formation of anchorage-independent colonies on soft agar, suggesting that ROS are critical regulators of K-RasV12-induced autophagy and malignant cell transformation. These findings are in agreement with several recent reports implicating ROS in autophagosome formation and autophagic cell death in response to various stimuli (35Delgado M.A. Deretic V.

However, in the current study, we did not observe any changes in cell viability in K-RasV12-overexpressing MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells (supplemental Fig. S5). Numerous studies using various experimental systems have shown that MAPKs, particularly JNK and p38 MAPK, are strongly activated by ROS and play important roles in various ROS-related cellular events (46Sahu R.P.

Signal. 2004; 16: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the increase in intracellular ROS induced by oncogenic K-Ras was involved in the activation of JNK and that inhibition of JNK attenuated ATG5 and ATG7 expression, autophagy, and formation of colonies in soft agar. Interestingly, we further found that K-RasV12-induced increases in intracellular ROS were attenuated by p38 MAPK inhibition, which also suppressed autophagy and subsequent cellular transformation. Collectively, these results suggest that p38 MAPK signaling is involved in ROS production in response to oncogenic K-Ras and suggest that JNK acts downstream of ROS to play a functional role in K-RasV12-induced autophagy. In normal fibroblasts, Ras has shown to be involved in the negative control of autophagy through class I PI3K activation (50Furuta S. Hidaka E. Ogata A. Yokota S. Kamata T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3898-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we also found dramatic activation of PI3K in cells overexpressing oncogenic K-Ras (data not shown). However, inhibition of PI3K did not significantly affect ATG expression and autophagy induction. A possible explanation for this observation is that oncogenic K-Ras activates both positive (ROS-JNK) and negative (class I PI3K) signaling pathways that control autophagy, and that oncogenic Ras influences regulation of autophagy through either of these pathways dependent on the cell types. A recent study also provides evidence that oncogenic Ras-induced down-regulation of autophagy mediator Beclin-1 and is required for malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (51Yoo B.H. Wu X. Li Y. Haniff M. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Eskelinen E.L. Rosen K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5438-5449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, however, in breast epithelial cells, the expression level of Beclin-1 was not changed by overexpression of oncogenic K-Ras. Moreover, in contrast to the previous finding, we found that siRNA targeting of Beclin-1 effectively attenuated oncogenic K-Ras-induced cell transformation as well as autophagy (data not shown). The exact reason for the different observation between two studies is currently unknown. Cell type-specific activation of signaling pathways could explain the variability of the effect of oncogenic Ras on autophagy. In summary, our results provide novel evidence that autophagy is critically involved in malignant cell transformation by oncogenic K-Ras and show that ROS-mediated JNK activation plays a causal role in autophagy induction through up-regulation of ATG5 and ATG7. The molecular mechanisms that link oncogenic K-Ras to induction of autophagy and subsequent malignant transformation determined in this study may provide new insights into the relationship between autophagy and oncogenesis.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) coordinates the ability of a cell to respond to ER stress by altering protein translation, folding, and post-translational modification of all secreted and membrane proteins. Terminally unfolded proteins are retrotransported to the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation machinery for proteolysis by the proteasome. The ER is also the site of lipid biosynthesis and membrane expansion. These activities are linked physiologically to specialized secretory cells; however, depending on stress levels, the UPR can control cellular survival or death via autophagy and apoptosis (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). Tumors may utilize the UPR as a survival mechanism against nutrient-related stress as a result of poor vascularization and rapid growth (2Lee A.S. Hendershot L.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Secretion and membrane composition are balanced by the high caloric demand of these activities against the energy homeostasis of the cell (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar) and perturbations can result in activation of innate immunity and inflammation (3Kaufman R.J. Cao S. EMBO Mol.

Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is the most highly conserved signaling node of the unfolded protein response (5Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P.

Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A unique ER-resident transmembrane kinase with a novel C-terminal endoribonuclease domain, IRE1 is activated in part by the disassociation of BiP/GRP78 in the presence of unfolded protein in the ER lumen (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). The signal is transduced to the cytosol by the sequential dimerization/multimerization, trans-autophosphorylation, and activation of its endoribonuclease (7Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the endoribonuclease is responsible for the unconventional cytosolic splicing of HAC1 in yeast (7Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and excision of the 26-nucleotide intron of the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) transcription factor in metazoan organisms (8Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 9Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells IRE1 acts in concert with companion UPR signaling molecules: PKR-like ER resident kinase and ATF6 (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). In response to ER stress, the PKR-like ER resident kinase dimerizes in a manner similar to IRE1 to promote its autophosphorylation activity. Once activated, PKR-like ER resident kinase phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation factor eIF2α to reduce protein translation and translocation into the ER (10Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). This mechanism quickly relieves the load on the folding machinery in the ER allowing time to readjust and coordinate upstream activities by transcriptional induction. Highly specific translation of the ATF4 transcription factor during the eIF2α enforced state leads to up-regulation of ER resident chaperones, redox enzymes, and proapoptotic and autophagic factors such as CHOP and MAPKC3B, respectively (11Ye J. Koumenis C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2009; 9: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After experiencing ER stress, ATF6, the third UPR signaling regulator, is translocated to the Golgi and cleaved by the dual sterol regulatory element-binding protein proteases called site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). Release of the cytosolic portion produces the active ATF6 transcription factor, which targets transcriptional up-regulation of an overlapping and distinct set of ER resident chaperones such as GRP78/BiP and GRP94 (12Yamamoto K.

XBP-1 mRNA, a major substrate of the IRE1 endoribonuclease, is cleaved specifically at two conserved stem-loop sites. Each site is located 3′ to a mirrored guanosine residue in the 7-base loop (8Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

The resulting internal fragment, a 26-nucleotide intron, is removed and the two exon ends are ligated by an unknown mechanism in mammalian cells (14Harding H.P. Lackey J.G. Hsu H.C. Zhang Y. Deng J.

The rejoined mRNA shifts the open reading frame (ORF) and extends the C-terminal domain of XBP-1 from amino acid 164 with an alternative 212-amino acid reading frame producing the active “spliced” transcription factor, XBP-1s, which regulate a broad range of ER resident chaperones, ER translocon channels, ER-associated degradation components (16Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), and lipid metabolic enzymes (17Sriburi R. Bommiasamy H. Buldak G.L. Robbins G.R. Frank M.

The unspliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1u) is short lived and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (19Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this manner the activity of IRE1 can rapidly control downstream activities of the UPR. An emerging and important activity of IRE1 is the degradation of mRNAs encoding ER-targeted membrane and secreted proteins during stress analogous to the less discriminate activities of evolutionary homologue of the IRE1, RNase L (21Hollien J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). This activity in combination with expression of the XBP-1 has the potential to alter the surface composition of stressed cells and the extracellular proteome. The cytosolic portion of IRE1 contains an active kinase domain and a novel endoribonuclease (7Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar): the kinase-extension endoribonuclease (KEN) domain (22Lee K.P. Dey M. Neculai D. Cao C. Dever T.E.

The activation of IRE1 endoribonuclease is controlled by dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase. In yeast, ADP serves as a cofactor after activation, where binding to the kinase cleft promotes a closed conformation, which in turn stabilizes the dimer of the endoribonuclease KEN domain and promotes endoribonuclease activity (22Lee K.P. Dey M. Neculai D. Cao C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2008; 132: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Using a mutant yeast Ire1 Papa et al. (26Papa F.R. Zhang C. Shokat K. Walter P. Science. 2003; 302: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) showed that an ATP competitive drug could activate the endoribonuclease in an analogous manner. Additional studies confirmed that ATP competitive kinase inhibitors can act as yeast Ire1 endoribonuclease activators (23Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 2009; 457: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), a potential therapeutic modality to induce the cytoprotective activities of XBP-1s. Recent studies have demonstrated that small molecules such as quercetin can act as agonists by binding to sites remote from the ATP binding site of the kinase domain but still act by promoting dimerization (27Wiseman R.L.

In an attempt to discover inhibitors of XBP-1 mRNA splicing, we produced the soluble cytosolic fragment of human IRE1 (hIRE1α-cyto) as a GST fusion protein in insect cells. The purified and GST-free hIRE1α-cyto protein was active and cleaved XBP-1 substrates in a sequence-specific manner. We screened 220,000 compounds using a fluorescently labeled mini-XBP-1 stem-loop RNA substrate. One class of inhibitor found was salicylaldimine analogs. We found that the active component of these library compounds was the salicylaldehyde form of the salicylaldimine. These salicylaldehyde compounds were specific for inhibiting the IRE1 endoribonuclease activity, and were active in cells to inhibit XBP-1 splicing as well as in ER stress models in vivo. Expression of GST-hIRE1α-cyto was performed using the Bac-N-Blue Baculovirus system and SF9 insect cells essentially as described by the Bac-N-Blue transfection manual (Invitrogen). GST was fused to the N-terminal end of the cytosolic human IRE1α (amino acids 462–977) in the pBacPac4.5 transfer vector and included a PreScission Protease cleavage site in the linker. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by picking clear plaques after co-transfection of bacmid DNA and amplified 3 times to obtain high titer P3 stocks. Insect HiFive cells were infected at multiplicity of infections in the 2 to 5 range and were grown from a 500-ml shaking insect cell culture for 48 h at 28 °C. The insect cells were lysed by suspending the cells in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 10% sterile glycerol, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm NaVO4, 100 mm PMSF; 30 ml/500-ml culture), transferring the suspension to a high speed centrifuge tube, and sonicating the suspension on ice. The sonicated preparation was spun at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was combined with glutathione-Sepharose beads in a tube and gently mixed on a rotator for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the bead mixture was transferred to a PD-10 column from Amersham Biosciences. The column was washed five times with Buffer A followed by two washes with Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 10% sterile glycerol, 0.0025% Nonidet P-40). The GST tag was removed using Prescission protease (GE Healthcare) cleavage. Cleavage buffer (825 μl of Buffer B, 350 μl of sterile glycerol, and 35 μl of PreScission protease/ml of beads) was added to the column and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with tumbling. The final product was collected in the final eluate. hIREα-cyto preps were dialyzed in storage buffer (17.0 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 34.0 mm KCl, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm DTT, 0.0017% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol). Typically, 500-ml insect cell cultures produced roughly 0.5 mg of purified hIRE1α-cyto, which was concentrated, titrated for activity, pooled, re-aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Residues 333–651 of mouse RNase L was expressed as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion in Escherichia coli using the pPROX-HTA vector system (Invitrogen) and purified as described previously for the expression of yeast Ire1cyto for structural studies (22Lee K.P. Dey M. Neculai D. Cao C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2008; 132: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Endoribonuclease assays were performed as previously described for yeast (27Wiseman R.L. Zhang Y. Lee K.P. Harding H.P. Haynes C.M. Price J. Sicheri F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and human IRE1 (29Niwa M. Sidrauski C. Kaufman R.J. Walter P. Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were run in 10- or 20-μl volumes using IRE reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol) and various amounts of hIRE1α-cyto (typically 0.01 to 1 μm) and substrate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm at 30 °C. Fluorescently tagged RNA oligos were read using an Acquest 384 plate reader (LJL Biosystems). In addition, reaction products were visualized by denaturing 15% TBE urea in 12-well gels (Invitrogen) using a Bio-Rad molecular Imager FX. Unlabeled oligos were stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen). RNA oligos were purchased from IDT DNA Technologies. RNase A and T1 were purchased from Sigma. The MannKind chemical library of 220,000 individual compounds was screened in 384-well Greiner Bio-one polypropylene plates (Greiner). Columns 1 and 2 of each plate served as positive controls (no compound) and rows 23 and 24 as negative controls (no compound, no hIREα-cyto). First, the reaction buffer was loaded in plates using a Beckman-Coulter Biomek FX robot. Next, 25 nl of each compound from a 10 mm DMSO compound stock was pinned (using a V&P scientific pinhead on the Biomek FX pin tool) into the reaction mixture (final concentration = 20 μm) singly from the library stock plates stored at −20 °C. Next, 1 μl of hIREα-cyto was added to each reaction well using fresh tips. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min before adding 1 μl of Cy5-labeled (Fig. 1C) mini-XBP-1 stem-loop RNA. The final volume for each well was 10 μl. Buffer concentrations were the same as for the endoribonuclease assay except for the presence of 5% DMSO; the hIRE1α-cyto concentration was ∼10 nm and the RNA substrate was 100 nm. Plates were then placed in an incubator at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation, plates were immediately transferred to an Acquest 384-well plate reader with settings and filters for the Cy5 fluorophore. Data were acquired, transferred to an ActivityBase database, and analyzed using ActivityBase discovery software (IDBS). Activity was expressed as the percentage of the compound treated well minus the negative control divided by the positive control minus the negative control ((test − negative)/(positive − negative) × 100). The cut-off for hits was considered at 60% of positive control. Hits were confirmed in triplicate using the above procedure. If compounds remained active in two of three wells they were considered bona fide hits. The integrity of the hits was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010. Several salicylaldimine hit compounds were re-purchased from the library supplier (Maybridge, UK). Salicylaldehyde compounds described in this study were purchased from Sigma or Princeton Biomolecular Research. Compounds were resuspended to 10 mm in DMSO and stored at −20 °C as a stock solution. Compounds were diluted 1:3 in IRE1 reaction buffer 9 times, starting at 20 μm and down to 1 nm. Assays were run on triplicate plates and analyzed as described for HTS. IC50 values were calculated as the mean of 3 reactions that inhibited 50% of the positive control. In black clear bottom 384-well plates, 10 nm hIRE1α-cyto was combined with a range of compound concentrations (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nm) in IRE1 reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4% polyethylene glycol, 3 mm DTT), with a total volume of 10 μl. The plate was incubated at RT for 10 min, and the fluorescent substrate was added (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 μm). The plate was immediately read at 45-s kinetic reads for 1 h at 30 °C, excitation 620 nm and emission 680 nm on a FLUOstar OPTIMA plate reader (BMG LABTECH). Data were analyzed using Visual Enzymics software (SoftZymics Inc.). Protein (hIRE1α-cyto or RNase A) was immobilized with the sample chamber set at 4 °C and analysis chamber at 30 °C. A CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) was primed once with pure water and twice with IRE1 reaction buffer. Immobilization was performed using the amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare), following the manufacturer's instructions. All injections were at 10 μl/min. RNase A, used as a control, was injected to 3000 response units; hIRE1α-cyto to 12,000–15,000 response units. Immediately after the protein was bound, running buffer was switched to IRE1 reaction buffer plus 5% DMSO, the sample compartment was set at 25 °C and the analysis compartment at 30 °C, and the instrument was primed twice. The injection series was as follows: 6–8 startup cycles with buffer, followed by a solvent correction cycle and 2 DMSO only samples to stabilize baseline. Compounds were prepared so the final solution has 5% DMSO in IRE1 reaction buffer. Compounds were injected over the surface of the chip at 30 μl/min for 3 min. Between injections, compound bound to the chip was removed with a 50% DMSO regeneration solution. This procedures was performed the same as above except DMSO was not used; the running buffer was IRE1 reaction buffer. Two concentrations of substrate (0.8 and 4 μm) were diluted in IRE1 buffer and run on the chip. No solvent correction curve was run. The biotinylated RNA substrate was prepared as follows: RNA was diluted in RNA running buffer (10 mm Tri-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) to 1 μm and heated at 80 °C for 10 min, cooled to RT, then diluted 500 times in immobilization buffer (RNA RB plus 0.005% P-20, 62.5 μg/ml of BSA, 125 μg/ml of tRNA, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol). RNA was then bound to the streptavidin sensor chip at about 200 response units (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instructions. hIRE1α-cyto was diluted to 100 nm in IRE1 reaction buffer, and run over the surface of the chip at 100 μl/min for 2 min. Data analysis was performed using Biaevaluation software (GE Healthcare) and Excel. The procedure for substrate immobilization was the same as above. Compounds were injected over the surface of the chip at 30 μl/min for 3 min. Experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare); data analysis was performed using Biaevaluation software (GE Healthcare) and Excel for all of the above experiments. HEK293, MM1.s, and U266 cells were grown in monolayer culture using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), unless specified otherwise, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Salicylaldehyde compounds were kept as 10 mm stocks in DMSO at −20 °C and diluted in medium as indicated. Tunicamycin (Tm) and thapsigargin (Tg) were resuspended in DMSO and diluted in medium. DTT was made fresh in sterile deionized H2O as a 1 m stock. Procedures for measuring XBP-1s and XBP-1u mRNAs have been described previously (19Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was harvested from cells or tissue using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's procedures. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension of the RNA, RiboGreen (Invitrogen) was used to quantify the yield and normalize the RNA concentration in the source tube containing isolated RNA. RT-PCR was performed by Oligo(dT) priming, and SuperScript II (Invitrogen) transcription using the Amplitaq Gold Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Primers for human XBP-1 were 5′-CCTGGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAG-3′ (reverse), and for mouse were 5′-ACACGCTTGGGAATGGACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATGGGAAGATGTTCTGGG-3′. All DNA oligos were purchased from IDT DNA Technologies. PCR were run on a Bio-Rad PTC-100 96-well thermocycler with heating at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and polymerizing at 72 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles. Reactions were run on 4% precast NuSieve gels from Cambrex and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV excitation. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF, 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 20 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after solubilizing the samples by SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. A NuPAGE 12% Tris gel (Invitrogen) was used to separate the proteins. Proteins was transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with rabbit anti-hIRE1α-cyto polyclonal antibody (18Lee A.H. Scapa E.F. Cohen D.E. Glimcher L.H. Science. 2008; 320: 1492-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) or anti-hIRE1α phospho-specific (Ser-724) antibody (Novus Biologicals). Blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Anti-α-tubulin and anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma) were used to normalize the protein amount loaded on the gel. Pathogen-free 8–10-week-old female SCID CB17 mice (Taconic Farms, Oxnard, CA) were housed at MannKind Corporation according to IACUC guidelines. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by an IACUC institutional review committee. Mice were housed in HEPA-filtered cage racks, fed ad libitum, and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at the time of organ harvest at the end of the experimental treatment. Tm (Sigma) was made fresh before the experiment by dissolving in DMSO. Studies with yeast Ire1 have demonstrated that kinase inhibitors can act as allosteric agonists for the endoribonuclease (23Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Zhang C.

https://openalex.org/W2053482696,"Emerging evidence relates some nutritional factors to depression risk. However, there is a scarcity of longitudinal assessments on this relationship. Objective To evaluate the association between fatty acid intake or the use of culinary fats and depression incidence in a Mediterranean population. Material and Methods Prospective cohort study (1999–2010) of 12,059 Spanish university graduates (mean age: 37.5 years) initially free of depression with permanently open enrolment. At baseline, a 136-item validated food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate the intake of fatty acids (saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), trans unsaturated fatty acids (TFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and culinary fats (olive oil, seed oils, butter and margarine) During follow-up participants were classified as incident cases of depression if they reported a new clinical diagnosis of depression by a physician and/or initiated the use of antidepressant drugs. Cox regression models were used to calculate Hazard Ratios (HR) of incident depression and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for successive quintiles of fats. Results During follow-up (median: 6.1 years), 657 new cases of depression were identified. Multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for depression incidence across successive quintiles of TFA intake were: 1 (ref), 1.08 (0.82–1.43), 1.17 (0.88–1.53), 1.28 (0.97–1.68), 1.42 (1.09–1.84) with a significant dose-response relationship (p for trend = 0.003). Results did not substantially change after adjusting for potential lifestyle or dietary confounders, including adherence to a Mediterranean Dietary Pattern. On the other hand, an inverse and significant dose-response relationship was obtained for MUFA (p for trend = 0.05) and PUFA (p for trend = 0.03) intake. Conclusions A detrimental relationship was found between TFA intake and depression risk, whereas weak inverse associations were found for MUFA, PUFA and olive oil. These findings suggest that cardiovascular disease and depression may share some common nutritional determinants related to subtypes of fat intake."
https://openalex.org/W2050681642,"The function of chronic brain machine interfaces depends on stable electrical contact between neurons and electrodes. A key step in the development of interfaces is therefore to identify implant configurations that minimize adverse long-term tissue reactions. To this end, we here characterized the separate and combined effects of implant size and fixation mode at 6 and 12 weeks post implantation in rat (n = 24) cerebral cortex. Neurons and activated microglia and astrocytes were visualized using NeuN, ED1 and GFAP immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The contributions of individual experimental variables to the tissue response were quantified. Implants tethered to the skull caused larger tissue reactions than un-tethered implants. Small diameter (50 µm) implants elicited smaller tissue reactions and resulted in the survival of larger numbers of neurons than did large diameter (200 µm) implants. In addition, tethering resulted in an oval-shaped cavity, with a cross-section area larger than that of the implant itself, and in marked changes in morphology and organization of neurons in the region closest to the tissue interface. Most importantly, for implants that were both large diameter and tethered, glia activation was still ongoing 12 weeks after implantation, as indicated by an increase in GFAP staining between week 6 and 12, while this pattern was not observed for un-tethered, small diameter implants. Our findings therefore clearly indicate that the combined small diameter, un-tethered implants cause the smallest tissue reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2002670541,"Neuronal cell death, glial cell activation, retinal swelling and oxidative injury are complications in retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries. Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), extracts from the wolfberries, are good for “eye health” according to Chinese medicine. The aim of our present study is to explore the use of LBP in retinal I/R injury. Retinal I/R injury was induced by surgical occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Prior to induction of ischemia, mice were treated orally with either vehicle (PBS) or LBP (1 mg/kg) once a day for 1 week. Paraffin-embedded retinal sections were prepared. Viable cells were counted; apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL assay. Expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and nitrotyrosine (NT) were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The integrity of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) was examined by IgG extravasations. Apoptosis and decreased viable cell count were found in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the vehicle-treated I/R retina. Additionally, increased retinal thickness, GFAP activation, AQP4 up-regulation, IgG extravasations and PAR expression levels were observed in the vehicle-treated I/R retina. Many of these changes were diminished or abolished in the LBP-treated I/R retina. Pre-treatment with LBP for 1 week effectively protected the retina from neuronal death, apoptosis, glial cell activation, aquaporin water channel up-regulation, disruption of BRB and oxidative stress. The present study suggests that LBP may have a neuroprotective role to play in ocular diseases for which I/R is a feature."
https://openalex.org/W2036833378,"Cdc42 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in promoting cell polarity and is indispensable during epithelial morphogenesis. To further investigate the role of Cdc42, we have used a three-dimensional matrigel model, in which single Caco-2 cells develop to form polarized cysts. Using this system, we previously reported that Cdc42 controls mitotic spindle orientation during cell division to correctly position the apical surface in a growing epithelial structure. In the present study, we have investigated the specific downstream effectors through which Cdc42 controls this process. Here, we report that Par6B and its binding partner, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), are required to regulate Caco-2 morphogenesis. Depletion or inhibition of Par6B or aPKC phenocopies the loss of Cdc42, inducing misorientation of the mitotic spindle, mispositioning of the nascent apical surface, and ultimately, the formation of aberrant cysts with multiple lumens. Mechanistically, Par6B and aPKC function interdependently in this context. Par6B localizes to the apical surface of Caco-2 cysts and is required to recruit aPKC to this compartment. Conversely, aPKC protects Par6B from proteasomal degradation, in a kinase-independent manner. In addition, we report that depletion or inhibition of aPKC induces robust apoptotic cell death in Caco-2 cells, significantly reducing both cyst size and number. Cell survival and apical positioning depend upon different thresholds of aPKC expression, suggesting that they are controlled by distinct downstream pathways. We conclude that Par6B and aPKC control mitotic spindle orientation in polarized epithelia and, furthermore, that aPKC coordinately regulates multiple processes to promote morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1967640912,"Adiponectin is an adipokine playing an important role in regulating energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the effect of adiponectin on bone metabolism shows contradictory results according to different research studies. In this study femurs were isolated from genetically double-labeled mBSP9.0Luc/β-ACT-EGFP transgenic mice and were transplanted into adiponectin knock-out mice or wild type mice to investigate the effect of temporary exposure to adiponectin deficiency on bone growth and metabolism. We found that the growth of bone explants in adiponectin knock-out mice was significantly retarded. Histological analysis, microcomputed tomography analysis, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining revealed reduced trabecular bone volume, decreased cortical bone, and increased osteoclast number in bone explants in adiponectin knock-out mice. We then found that adiponectin inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis from RAW264.7 cells and down-regulates RANKL-enhanced expressions of osteoclastogenic regulators including NFAT2, TRAF6, cathepsin K, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Adiponectin also increases osteoclast apoptosis and decreases survival/proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells. Using siRNA specifically targeting APPL1, the first identified adaptor protein of adiponectin signaling, we found that the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on osteoclasts was induced by APPL1-mediated down-regulation of Akt1 activity. In addition, overexpression of Akt1 successfully reversed adiponectin-induced inhibition in RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1979978282,"Although consensus has now been reached on a general two-locus DNA barcode for land plants, the selected combination of markers (rbcL + matK) is not applicable for ferns at the moment. Yet especially for ferns, DNA barcoding is potentially of great value since fern gametophytes—while playing an essential role in fern colonization and reproduction—generally lack the morphological complexity for morphology-based identification and have therefore been underappreciated in ecological studies. We evaluated the potential of a combination of rbcL with a noncoding plastid marker, trnL-F, to obtain DNA-identifications for fern species. A regional approach was adopted, by creating a reference database of trusted rbcL and trnL-F sequences for the wild-occurring homosporous ferns of NW-Europe. A combination of parsimony analyses and distance-based analyses was performed to evaluate the discriminatory power of the two-region barcode. DNA was successfully extracted from 86 tiny fern gametophytes and was used as a test case for the performance of DNA-based identification. Primer universality proved high for both markers. Based on the combined rbcL + trnL-F dataset, all genera as well as all species with non-equal chloroplast genomes formed their own well supported monophyletic clade, indicating a high discriminatory power. Interspecific distances were larger than intraspecific distances for all tested taxa. Identification tests on gametophytes showed a comparable result. All test samples could be identified to genus level, species identification was well possible unless they belonged to a pair of Dryopteris species with completely identical chloroplast genomes. Our results suggest a high potential of the combined use of rbcL and trnL-F as a two-locus cpDNA barcode for identification of fern species. A regional approach may be preferred for ecological tests. We here offer such a ready-to-use barcoding approach for ferns, which opens the way for answering a whole range of questions previously unaddressed in fern gametophyte ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2088574208,"The Egyptian jackal (Canis aureus lupaster) has hitherto been considered a large, rare subspecies of the golden jackal (C. aureus). It has maintained its taxonomical status to date, despite studies demonstrating morphological similarities to the grey wolf (C. lupus). We have analyzed 2055 bp of mitochondrial DNA from C. a. lupaster and investigated the similarity to C. aureus and C. lupus. Through phylogenetic comparison with all wild wolf-like canids (based on 726 bp of the Cytochrome b gene) we conclusively (100% bootstrap support) place the Egyptian jackal within the grey wolf species complex, together with the Holarctic wolf, the Indian wolf and the Himalayan wolf. Like the two latter taxa, C. a. lupaster seems to represent an ancient wolf lineage which most likely colonized Africa prior to the northern hemisphere radiation. We thus refer to C. a. lupaster as the African wolf. Furthermore, we have detected C. a. lupaster individuals at two localities in the Ethiopian highlands, extending the distribution by at least 2,500 km southeast. The only grey wolf species to inhabit the African continent is a cryptic species for which the conservation status urgently needs assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2145869447,"The ability of tendons to glide smoothly during muscle contraction is impaired after injury by fibrous adhesions that form between the damaged tendon surface and surrounding tissues. To understand how adhesions form we incubated excised tendons in fibrin gels (to mimic the homeostatic environment at the injury site) and assessed cell migration. We noticed cells exiting the tendon from only the cut ends. Furthermore, treatment of the tendon with trypsin resulted in cell extravagation from the shaft of the tendons. Electron microscopy and immunolocalisation studies showed that the tendons are covered by a novel cell layer in which a collagen type IV/laminin basement membrane (BM) overlies a keratinised epithelium. PCR and western blot analyses confirmed the expression of laminin β1 in surface cells, only. To evaluate the cell retentive properties of the BM in vivo we examined the tendons of the Col4a1(+/Svc) mouse that is heterozygous for a G-to-A transition in the Col4a1 gene that produces a G1064D substitution in the α1(IV) chain of collagen IV. The flexor tendons had a discontinuous BM, developed fibrous adhesions with overlying tissues, and were acellular at sites of adhesion formation. In further experiments, tenotomy of wild-type mice resulted in expression of laminin throughout the adhesion. In conclusion, we show the existence of a novel tendon BM-epithelium that is required to prevent adhesion formation. The Col4a1(+/Svc) mouse is an effective animal model for studying adhesion formation because of the presence of a structurally-defective collagen type IV-containing BM."
https://openalex.org/W2116441954,"New human burials from northern Jordan provide important insights into the appearance of cemeteries and the nature of human-animal relationships within mortuary contexts during the Epipalaeolithic period (c. 23,000–11,600 cal BP) in the Levant, reinforcing a socio-ideological relationship that goes beyond predator-prey. Previous work suggests that archaeological features indicative of social complexity occur suddenly during the latest Epipalaeolithic phase, the Natufian (c. 14,500–11,600 cal BP). These features include sedentism, cemeteries, architecture, food production, including animal domestication, and burials with elaborate mortuary treatments. Our findings from the pre-Natufian (Middle Epipalaeolithic) cemetery of ‘Uyun al-Hammam demonstrate that joint human-animal mortuary practices appear earlier in the Epipalaeolithic. We describe the earliest human-fox burial in the Near East, where the remains of dogs have been found associated with human burials at a number of Natufian sites. This is the first time that a fox has been documented in association with human interments pre-dating the Natufian and with a particular suite of grave goods. Analysis of the human and animal bones and their associated artefacts provides critical data on the nature and timing of these newly-developing relationships between people and animals prior to the appearance of domesticated dogs in the Natufian."
https://openalex.org/W2085648696,"Malectin is a conserved, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident lectin that recognizes high mannose oligosaccharides displaying terminal glucose residues. Here we show that Malectin is an ER stress-induced protein that selectively associates with glycopolypeptides without affecting their entry and their retention in the Calnexin chaperone system. Analysis of the obligate Calnexin client influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) revealed that Calnexin and Malectin associated with different timing to different HA conformers and that Malectin associated with misfolded HA. Analysis of the facultative Calnexin clients NHK and α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) revealed that induction of Malectin expression to simulate conditions of ER stress resulted in persistent association between the ER lectin and the model cargo glycoproteins, interfered with processing of cargo-linked oligosaccharides and reduced cargo secretion. We propose that Malectin intervention is activated upon ER stress to inhibit secretion of defective gene products that might be generated under conditions of aberrant functioning of the ER quality control machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2060168918,"APOBEC3G is a single-stranded (ss) DNA deaminase that restricts replication of HIV-1 by inducing viral genome mutagenesis through deamination of cytosine to uracil on HIV-1 cDNA. APOBEC3G has polydisperse oligomeric states and deaminates ssDNA processively through jumping and sliding. APOBEC3G has a catalytically inactive N-terminal CD1 domain that mediates processivity and an active C-terminal CD2 domain that catalyzes deaminations. Here, we assess the determinants of APOBEC3G deamination efficiency mediated by the CD1 domain by comparing native APOBEC3G and two CD1 mutants, a monomeric mutant (F126A/W127A) and a clinical mutant associated with high viral loads (H186R). Biochemical assays on ssDNA or partially dsDNA and with a reconstituted HIV replication system demonstrate that both mutants of Apo3G have altered DNA scanning properties in either jumping (F126A/W127A) or sliding (H186R), which results in decreased abilities to induce mutagenesis during reverse transcription. The data reveal a functionality for Apo3G oligomers in deamination and provide the first biochemical characterization of the clinical mutant H186R. The data demonstrate that the balance between the jumping and sliding of Apo3G is needed for efficient mutational inactivation of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2166616921,"Although the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one sphingolipid class with a head group based on phosphoinositol, the yeast Pichia pastoris as well as many other fungi have a second class, glucosylceramide, which has a glucose head group. These two sphingolipid classes are in addition distinguished by a characteristic structure of their ceramide backbones. Here, we investigate the mechanisms controlling substrate entry into the glucosylceramide branch of the pathway. By a combination of enzymatic in vitro studies and lipid analysis of genetically engineered yeast strains, we show that the ceramide synthase Bar1p occupies a key branching point in sphingolipid biosynthesis in P. pastoris. By preferring dihydroxy sphingoid bases and C(16)/C(18) acyl-coenzyme A as substrates, Bar1p produces a structurally well defined group of ceramide species, which is the exclusive precursor for glucosylceramide biosynthesis. Correlating with the absence of glucosylceramide in this yeast, a gene encoding Bar1p is missing in S. cerevisiae. We could not successfully investigate the second ceramide synthase in P. pastoris that is orthologous to S. cerevisiae Lag1p/Lac1p. By analyzing the ceramide and glucosylceramide species in a collection of P. pastoris knock-out strains in which individual genes encoding enzymes involved in glucosylceramide biosynthesis were systematically deleted, we show that the ceramide species produced by Bar1p have to be modified by two additional enzymes, sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase and fatty acid α-hydroxylase, before the final addition of the glucose head group by the glucosylceramide synthase. Together, this set of four enzymes specifically defines the pathway leading to glucosylceramide biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990218993,"Obesity is a hallmark of aging in many Western societies, and is a precursor to numerous serious age-related diseases. Ghrelin (Ghrl), via its receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R), is shown to stimulate GH secretion and appetite. Surprisingly, our previous studies showed that Ghrl(-/-) mice have impaired thermoregulatory responses to cold and fasting stresses, while Ghsr(-/-) mice are adaptive.To elucidate the mechanism, we analyzed the complete metabolic profiles of younger (3-4 months) and older (10-12 months) Ghrl(-/-) and Ghsr(-/-) mice. Food intake and locomotor activity were comparable for both null mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts, regardless of age. There was also no difference in body composition between younger null mice and their WT counterparts. As the WT mice aged, as expected, the fat/lean ratio increased and energy expenditure (EE) decreased. Remarkably, however, older Ghsr(-/-) mice exhibited reduced fat/lean ratio and increased EE when compared to older WT mice, thus retaining a youthful lean and high EE phenotype; in comparison, there was no significant difference with EE in Ghrl(-/-) mice. In line with the EE data, the thermogenic regulator, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), was significantly up-regulated in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Ghsr(-/-) mice, but not in Ghrl(-/-) mice.Our data therefore suggest that GHS-R ablation activates adaptive thermogenic function(s) in BAT and increases EE, thereby enabling the retention of a lean phenotype. This is the first direct evidence that the ghrelin signaling pathway regulates fat-burning BAT to affect energy balance during aging. This regulation is likely mediated through an as-yet-unidentified new ligand of GHS-R."
https://openalex.org/W1984895796,"The persistence of biological systems requires evolved mechanisms which promote stability. Cohesive primate social groups are one example of stable biological systems, which persist in spite of regular conflict. We suggest that genetic relatedness and its associated kinship structure are a potential source of stability in primate social groups as kinship structure is an important organizing principle in many animal societies. We investigated the effect of average genetic relatedness per matrilineal family on the stability of matrilineal grooming and agonistic interactions in 48 matrilines from seven captive groups of rhesus macaques. Matrilines with low average genetic relatedness show increased family-level instability such as: more sub-grouping in their matrilineal groom network, more frequent fighting with kin, and higher rates of wounding. Family-level instability in multiple matrilines within a group is further associated with group-level instability such as increased wounding. Stability appears to arise from the presence of clear matrilineal structure in the rhesus macaque group hierarchy, which is derived from cohesion among kin in their affiliative and agonistic interactions with each other. We conclude that genetic relatedness and kinship structure are an important source of group stability in animal societies, particularly when dominance and/or affilative interactions are typically governed by kinship."

Cirrhosis decedents are more likely to be recorded as American Indian on their death certificates, and homicide victims are more likely to be recorded as Black; these results remain net of controls for followback survey racial classification, indicating that the relationship we reveal is not simply a restatement of the fact that these causes of death are more prevalent among certain groups. Our findings suggest that seemingly non-racial characteristics, such as cause of death, affect how people are racially perceived by others and thus shape U.S. official statistics."
https://openalex.org/W2084070758,"Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been linked with the onset and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel diseases. The AIEC strain LF82 was originally isolated from an ileal biopsy from a patient with Crohn's disease. The pathogenesis of LF82 results from its abnormal adherence to and subsequent invasion of the intestinal epithelium coupled with its ability to survive phagocytosis by macrophages once it has crossed the intestinal barrier. To gain further insight into AIEC pathogenesis we employed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo infection model. We demonstrate that AIEC strain LF82 forms a persistent infection in C. elegans, thereby reducing the host lifespan significantly. This host killing phenotype was associated with massive bacterial colonization of the nematode intestine and damage to the intestinal epithelial surface. C. elegans killing was independent of known LF82 virulence determinants but was abolished by deletion of the LF82 hfq gene, which encodes an RNA chaperone involved in mediating posttranscriptional gene regulation by small non-coding RNAs. This finding reveals that important aspects of LF82 pathogenesis are controlled at the posttranscriptional level by riboregulation. The role of Hfq in LF82 virulence was independent of its function in regulating RpoS and RpoE activity. Further, LF82Δhfq mutants were non-motile, impaired in cell invasion and highly sensitive to various chemical stress conditions, reinforcing the multifaceted function of Hfq in mediating bacterial adaptation. This study highlights the usefulness of simple non-mammalian infection systems for the identification and analysis of bacterial virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W1979792723,"Eukaryotic circadian clocks employ autoregulatory negative feedback loops to control daily rhythms. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora, FRQ, FRH, WC-1, and WC-2 are the core components of the circadian negative feedback loop. To close the transcription-based negative feedback loop, the FRQ-FRH complex inhibits the activity of the WC complex in the nucleus by promoting the casein kinases-mediated WC phosphorylation. Despite its essential role in the nucleus, most FRQ is found in the cytoplasm. In this study, we mapped the FRQ regions that are important for its cellular localization. We show that the C-terminal part of FRQ, particularly the FRQ-FRH interaction domain, plays a major role in controlling FRQ localization. Both the mutation of the FRQ-FRH interaction domain and the down-regulation of FRH result in the nuclear enrichment of FRQ, suggesting that FRH regulates FRQ localization via a physical interaction. To study the role of FRQ phosphorylation, we examined the FRQ localization in wild-type as well as an array of FRQ kinase, FRQ phosphatase, and FRQ phosphorylation site mutants. Collectively, our results suggest that FRQ phosphorylation does not play a significant role in regulating its cellular localization. Instead, we find that phosphorylation of FRQ inhibits its transcriptional repressor activity in the circadian negative feedback loop. Such an effect is achieved by inhibiting the ability of FRQ to interact with WCC and casein kinase 1a. Our results indicate that the rhythmic FRQ phosphorylation profile observed is an important part of the negative feedback mechanism that drives robust circadian gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2104312548,"Phenotypic variation in human intellectual functioning shows substantial heritability, as demonstrated by a long history of behavior genetic studies. Many recent molecular genetic studies have attempted to uncover specific genetic variations responsible for this heritability, but identified effects capture little variance and have proven difficult to replicate. The present study, motivated an interest in ""mutation load"" emerging from evolutionary perspectives, examined the importance of the number of rare (or infrequent) copy number variations (CNVs), and the total number of base pairs included in such deletions, for psychometric intelligence. Genetic data was collected using the Illumina 1MDuoBeadChip Array from a sample of 202 adult individuals with alcohol dependence, and a subset of these (N = 77) had been administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). After removing CNV outliers, the impact of rare genetic deletions on psychometric intelligence was investigated in 74 individuals. The total length of the rare deletions significantly and negatively predicted intelligence (r = -.30, p = .01). As prior studies have indicated greater heritability in individuals with relatively higher parental socioeconomic status (SES), we also examined the impact of ethnicity (Anglo/White vs. Other), as a proxy measure of SES; these groups did not differ on any genetic variable. This categorical variable significantly moderated the effect of length of deletions on intelligence, with larger effects being noted in the Anglo/White group. Overall, these results suggest that rare deletions (between 5% and 1% population frequency or less) adversely affect intellectual functioning, and that pleotropic effects might partly account for the association of intelligence with health and mental health status. Significant limitations of this research, including issues of generalizability and CNV measurement, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1967497739,"Membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases and related enzymes play a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of unsaturated and various unusual fatty acids. Structural insights into the remarkable catalytic diversity and wide range of substrate specificities of this class of enzymes remain limited due to the lack of a crystal structure. To investigate the structural basis of the double bond positioning (regioselectivity) of the desaturation reaction in more detail, we relied on a combination of directed evolution in vitro and a powerful yeast complementation assay to screen for Δx regioselectivity. After two selection rounds, variants of the bifunctional Δ12/Δ9-desaturase from the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) exhibited increased Δ9-desaturation activity on shorter chain fatty acids. This change in specificity was the result of as few as three mutations, some of them near the putative active site. Subsequent analysis of individual substitutions revealed an important role of residue Phe-52 in facilitating Δ9-desaturation of shorter chain acyl substrates and allowed for the redesign of the cricket Δ12/Δ9-desaturase into a 16:0-specific Δ9-desaturase. Our results demonstrate that a minimal number of mutations can have a profound impact on the regioselectivity of acyl-CoA fatty acid desaturases and include the first biochemical data supporting the acyl-CoA acyl carrier specificity of a desaturase able to carry out Δ12-desaturation."

Thus, understanding oligodendrocyte death at the molecular level is important to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat the disease.

In turn, Dusp6 is overexpressed in optic nerves from multiple sclerosis patients before the appearance of evident damage in this structure. We further analyzed the role of Dusp6 and ERK signaling in excitotoxic oligodendrocyte death and observed that AMPA receptor activation induces a rapid increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Blocking Dusp6 expression, which enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation, significantly diminished AMPA receptor-induced oligodendrocyte death. In contrast, MAPK/ERK pathway inhibition with UO126 significantly potentiates excitotoxic oligodendrocyte death and increases cytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization, and mitochondrial calcium overload produced by AMPA receptor stimulation. Upstream analysis demonstrated that MAPK/ERK signaling alters AMPA receptor properties. Indeed, Dusp6 overexpression as well as incubation with UO126 produced an increase in AMPA receptor-induced inward currents and cytosolic calcium overload.

Ncb5or−/− β-cells exhibit increased susceptibility to the diabetogenic effects of the oxidant streptozotocin in vivo (3Xie J. Zhu H. Larade K. Ladoux A. Seguritan A. Chu M. Ito S. Bronson R.T.

Bunn H.F. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-cells from 12-week-old (diabetic) Ncb5or−/− mice have mitochondrial hypertrophy and hyperplasticity (3Xie J. Zhu H. Larade K. Ladoux A. Seguritan A. Chu M. Ito S. Bronson R.T. Leiter E.H. Zhang C.Y. Rosen E.D. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10750-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ncb5or−/− mice also develop lipoatrophy independently of diabetes. Ncb5or−/− mice that receive islet transplants from wild-type (WT) mice at 7 weeks remain normoglycemic until age 12 weeks but still have greatly reduced triacylglycerol (TAG) stores, increased hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression, and a reduced monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) to a saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio in hepatic TAG, diacylglycerols, and free fatty acids (FFA) (6Larade K. Jiang Z. Zhang Y. Wang W. Bonner-Weir S. Zhu H. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29285-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The loss of adiposity and the impaired fatty acid desaturation in Ncb5or−/− mice is similar to that seen in mice lacking stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which converts palmitic and stearic acids to palmitoleic and oleic acids, respectively (7Miyazaki M.

Ncb5or−/− hepatocytes are more sensitive than WT cells to palmitate-induced cytotoxicity, as reflected by ER stress marker expression and cell death (4Zhang Y. Larade K. Jiang Z.G. Ito S. Wang W.

In vitro reconstitution experiments show that the Ncb5or homolog microsomal cytochrome b5 (Cyb5A) and its cognate reductase Cyb5R3 provide electrons for the SCD reaction (8Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mice with global or hepatocyte-restricted Cyb5A deficiency exhibit only a mild deficiency of SCD products in hepatic lipids (9Finn R.D. McLaughlin L.A. Ronseaux S. Rosewell I.

Henderson C.J. Roland Wolf C. Transgenic Res. 2010; ([Epub ahead of print])PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that another electron donor(s) may contribute to the SCD reaction in vivo. Ncb5or readily reduces a variety of artificial substrates in vitro in the presence of excess NADH or NADPH, as does the Cyb5A·Cyb5R3 complex (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H.W. Huang S. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl.

Ncb5or is a more potent electron donor than Cyb5A because of the lower redox potential (E0 = −108 mV) in the Ncb5or heme center (11Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A. Acker H. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Fandrey J. Cross A.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Benson D.R. Zhu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30181-30191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of four recognized missense mutations in the human Ncb5or gene, two (Q187R and H223R) are found in a cohort with non-autoimmune diabetes (14Andersen G. Wegner L. Rose C.S. Xie J. Zhu H. Larade K.

The other two (D371Y and L424M) occur at conserved residues in the b5R domain and are found as somatic mutations in 7% of human breast cancers (15Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J.

It is not yet known how these Ncb5or mutations affect its structure and function or contribute to disease pathogenesis. To clarify the molecular bases of Ncb5or−/− cell hypersensitivity to cytotoxic effects of oxidants and of SFA and the potential role of Ncb5or in fatty acid desaturation, we have examined early molecular events and biochemical processes in the livers of prediabetic Ncb5or−/− mice at ages up to 5 weeks. We find that, starting early in neonatal development, livers of Ncb5or−/− mice exhibit increased expression of genes involved in uptake, synthesis, and desaturation of fatty acids and in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress responses. There are corresponding increases in mitochondrial content, fatty acid catabolism, and reactive oxygen species production. Ncb5or−/− hepatocytes incorporate fatty acids readily into TAG but accumulate more FFA and exhibit reduced content of MUFA relative to SFA at a given level of SCD expression, suggesting impaired SCD function. These defects in Ncb5or−/− cells appear to be responsible for their enhanced susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of oxidants and palmitic acid. Ncb5or−/− mice were generated as previously described (3Xie J. Zhu H. Larade K. Ladoux A. Seguritan A. Chu M. Ito S. Bronson R.T. Leiter E.H. Zhang C.Y. Rosen E.D. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10750-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and backcrossed into C57BL/6 for >12 generations. All experiments were performed in males as specified in a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Ncb5or−/− and WT mice were generated from heterozygous crosses and maintained in a pathogen-free facility at 24 °C under a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to food and water. Standard rodent chow (Purina 5015 from LabDiet, St. Paul, MN) was used in all studies except the 10-day high fat diet feeding protocol in which the high fat diet (F5194 from BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) was initiated immediately after weaning and continued for 10 days. The chow diet contains 3.8 kcal/g, 11% fat by weight, and a composition of 33% SFA, 35% MUFA, and 32% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), all of which in the form of TAG, in comparison to 5.1 kcal/g, 35% fat by weight with a composition of 40% SFA, 50% MUFA, and 10% PUFA in the high fat diet. Mice were sacrificed in the morning, and plasma and tissues were collected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Indirect calorimetry was conducted in a 4-chamber OxyMax System from Columbus Instruments (Columbus, OH). The O2 and CO2 gas fractions were monitored at both the inlet and output ports with a flow rate of 0.4 liter/min. These measurements were used to compute VO2 and VCO2 values (10 min per data point) in units of ml/kg/h. Respiratory exchange rate (RER) was calculated as VCO2/VO2 and used to predict the likely fuel source, i.e. RER = 1.0 (carbohydrates), 0.7 (fat), or 0.85 (proteins or a combination of carbohydrates and fats). Transmission electron microscopy was performed in the Electron Microscopy core facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Fresh liver pieces ∼1 mm3 in size were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer overnight before being processed and embedded in EPON. Micrographs were obtained with a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) 100 CXII transmission electron microscope operated at 80 KV. The NIH Image J software was used for counting mitochondrial and cytoplasmic area. Total RNA was prepared from livers or hepatocytes of WT and Ncb5or−/− mice using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was assessed by determining absorbance of UV light at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths, with A260 for quantity and A260/A280 ratio for quality. Two μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen), and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for quantitative PCR. Reactions, 10 μl each in a 384-well, were performed in duplicate for 40 cycles according to a 2-step protocol (92 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min) on a Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target mRNA was calculated with the comparative CT method and then normalized to that of 18 S rRNA. Primer Express 2.0 was used to design primers that span introns. Primer sequences are available upon request. Quantitative PCR was performed as above to determine the relative copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) in livers from 5-week-old WT and Ncb5or−/− mice. Each reaction (10 μl) contained genomic DNA (100 ng) and forward and reverse primers (0.6 μm each). Hexokinase 2 (intron 9) and 16 S rRNA were used as nDNA- and mtDNA-specific targets, respectively, as described (16Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. Geny B. Laakso M. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Cell. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). A standard dilution series was used to confirm the efficiency of exponential amplification for each primer pair. The mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio in each sample was calculated by dividing the value for 16 S by that for hexokinase 2. Small pieces (∼50 mg) of mouse livers were homogenized in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm glycerol phosphate, and 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate) with inhibitors of phosphatases (PhosSTOP from Roche Applied Science) and proteases (SigmaFAST from Sigma). The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Total protein content was determined with Coomassie Plus reagents (Pierce). Proteins (∼50 μg) were loaded into each lane on a 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, each gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) and subjected to immunoblotting with primary antibodies against total and phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), PGC-1α (Calbiochem), SCD1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and GAPDH (Sigma). Signals were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The Adobe Photoshop software was used to quantify intensity of signals. Frozen liver tissues (50–100 mg) or hepatocytes (5 × 105) were homogenized in lysis buffer (18 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EGTA, 300 mm mannitol, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Internal standards consisting of heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) and corresponding to each class of lipid species of interest was added at this step for quantification. Total lipids in liver homogenate or plasma (100–200 μl) were extracted by the method of Folch et al.(17Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using chloroform and methanol (2:1) that contained 0.1% butylhydroxytoluene to prevent lipid oxidation. TAG and FFA were separated by TLC on silica gel plates using a solvent system of hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1), and the separated classes were recovered from the plates and subjected to transmethylation as described (18Morrison W.R. Smith L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 600-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of liver and hepatocyte lipid samples were analyzed by GC-FID on a GC3900 with flame ionization detector (FID) or by GC-MS on a GC450 with MS220, respectively, from Varian (Palo Alto, CA). Both systems used a 100 m × 0.25-mm column, either Supelco SP-2560 with GC3900 or Varian FAME Select CP 7420 with GC450. Supelco 37 component FAME mix standards (Sigma) were used to confirm the identity of all FAMEs. The absolute amount in each FAME was calculated against the C17:0 internal control by comparing their peak areas (flame ionization detector) or total ion current where 10 specific and abundant ions of each FAME species were counted and the sum was divided by a response factor to generate its total ion current. Total tissue weight (livers) or protein content (hepatocytes) was used to normalize lipid content. For assay of total content of TAG, nonesterified fatty acid, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and total lipids from livers or plasma (without internal standard) were resuspended with 10% Triton X-100 in isopropyl alcohol and measured by colorimetric kits from Sigma or Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Hepatocytes were isolated from 4-week-old Ncb5or−/− and WT mice that were fasted for 2 h by using a 2-step perfusion procedure with Solution I (0.5 mm EGTA and 5.5 mm glucose in Hanks' buffered salt solution) and Solution II (1.5 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, with 0.0375% collagenase) as modified from (19Kim N.D. Moon J.O. Slitt A.L. Copple B.L. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 90: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Live hepatocytes with survival rates of 85–90% were incubated in Williams' medium E (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C overnight before an 8-h fatty acid treatment with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-complexed palmitic acid (C16:0) or oleic acid (C18:1), or BSA carrier alone. To avoid non-physiological toxic effects of fatty acids, each stock solution was prepared by complexing fatty acids (final concentration 5 mm) with 2.1 mm fatty acid-free BSA in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with constant stirring under nitrogen at 37 °C overnight, resulting in a molar FFA:BSA ratio of 2.4:1 (20Wolins N.E.

Solutions were then passed through a filter (0.2 μm) and stored at −80 °C until use. Fatty acid concentrations were measured with a non-esterified fatty acid C kit (Wako Chemicals). All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The viability of cells was determined from their measured ATP content (CellTiter-Glo(R) Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit, Promega, Madison, WI). After fatty acid treatment, hepatocytes from each 6-cm plate were rinsed with isotonic LiCl before lipid extraction by the method of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar). Ceramide (CM) species were measured to C8:0-CM internal standard by negative ion electrospray ionization/MS as previously described (22Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and normalized to sample protein content. The rate of mitochondrial FAO was calculated by measuring the oxidized product of [n9,10-3H]palmitic acid (Perkin Elmer Life Science) as described (23Djouadi F. Bonnefont J.P. Munnich A. Bastin J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 hepatocytes were seeded in wells of a 24-well plate, incubated overnight in medium with 10% FBS, and then incubated (2 h, 37 °C) with BSA-complexed palmitic acid (0.125 mm unlabeled plus 0.08 μCi of [n9,10-3H]C16:0) in the presence of carnitine (1 mm) in PBS. The amount of substrate taken up by cells within 2 h represented less than 25% that of the total amount in the medium. The H[3H]O product was collected, and its 3H content was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (LS6500 Scintillation Counter, Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) to calculate the initial reaction rate (mmol/h/mg of protein). The protein contents of cells were measured with a BCA protein analysis kit (Pierce). Extracellular flux analysis was performed on a XF24 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) as previously described (24Zhang L. Yu C. Vasquez F.E. Galeva N. Onyango I. Swerdlow R.H. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 458-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 104 hepatocytes were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured overnight in complete medium with 10% FBS (see above). Cells were washed with DMEM (0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 143 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.91 mm NaH2PO4, 15 mg/ml phenol red, 5.5 mm glucose, and 2 mm GlutaMAX from Invitrogen) and incubated in the same medium (37 °C, 1 h without CO2 preincubation). Cells were then loaded into the XF24 analyzer to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in short and repeated intervals as cells alone (base line) and after injection with buffer or BSA-complexed palmitic acid or oleic acid (0.125 mm) in the presence of carnitine (1 mm). OCR values under each condition were normalized to total protein content. Reduced and oxidized glutathione in liver tissue or hepatocytes were measured as described (25Jaeschke H. Mitchell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then collected in ice-cold 3% sulfosalicylic acid, 0.1 mm EDTA. Similarly, frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 3% sulfosalicylic acid before centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove proteins. Pellets were dissolved in 10% SDS for protein determination as above, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots to measure total and oxidized glutathione. For the latter, GSH was derivatized with N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), and the solution was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). Thiol contents of the total and GSSG aliquots were measured by mixing with Solution 1 (1.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid or 30 mm EDTA, 0.08% BSA, 600 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) and Solution 2 (0.5 mg/ml NADPH, 2.5 units/ml glutathione reductase in 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.04% BSA). The cycling reaction was complete after 10-min of incubation at room temperature, and the GSH-reduced products (5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid) were measured by A412. Levels of free thiol were determined relative to a GSH standard calibration curve. Cellular hydrogen peroxide and nuclear DNA levels were determined by staining with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated (37 °C for 20 min in the dark) with 2 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst in Hanks' buffered salt solution (with Ca2+ and Mg2+ but without phenol red). Cells were collected by trypsinization and resuspended in PBS plus 20 mm glucose at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence measurements were performed in clear 96-well plates with excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/533 nm (DCF) or 355/460 nm (Hoechst) on a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cellular hydrogen peroxide level was normalized to nuclear DNA content as represented by the DCF:Hoechst ratio. SCD activity was determined by using [14C]stearoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) as described (26Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes were isolated from mouse livers and purified on a continuous density gradient (11Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A. Acker H. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Fandrey J. Cross A.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30316-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of microsomal proteins were mixed with 2 nmol of [14C]stearoyl-CoA and 1 μmol of NADH in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and incubated (37 °C, 5 min). Total lipids were extracted and transmethylated as above to yield FAME. Radiolabeled substrates (C18:0) and products (C18:1) were separated by TLC on silica gel plates containing 10% AgNO3 (Analtech, Newark, DE). Signals were stored with phosphorimaging and quantitated with a Molecular Imager Pro Plus system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Counts were used to calculate the yield ((C18:1)/(C18:0 + C18:1)), which was then converted to SCD activity (nmol/min/mg). All reactions were linear within the first 15 min under the above conditions. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Values are presented as the means ± S.E. Lower body weights and loss of adiposity are observed in chow-fed Ncb5or−/− mice at ages 6 weeks and older (6Larade K. Jiang Z. Zhang Y. Wang W. Bonner-Weir S. Zhu H. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29285-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that despite similar body weights at birth, Ncb5or−/− mice exhibited significantly lower body weights than WT littermates as early as 2 weeks of age (supplemental Table 1). To determine whether increased oxidative metabolism (catabolism) retarded growth in Ncb5or−/− mice, whole body oxygen consumption of 5-week-old animals was examined by indirect calorimetry. As expected, all mice consumed more oxygen during fed cycles compared with fasting intervals, but Ncb5or−/− mice consumed significantly more O2 than WT mice by 21 and 14% during fasting and fed periods, respectively (Fig. 1A). This reflects a profound change in whole body substrate utilization. No significant difference in respiration exchange ratios was observed (Fig. 1B), suggesting the two genotypes oxidized similar substrate classes. Consistent with increased oxidative metabolism in Ncb5or−/− mice, the density of mitochondria per unit cytosolic area was significantly higher in Ncb5or−/− than WT hepatocytes at age 5 weeks, as shown by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D). We also observed a significantly higher mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio in livers from Ncb5or−/− compared with WT mice by quantitative PCR (Fig. 1E), but no difference in mitochondrial density was observed at 2 weeks (supplemental Fig. 1) when the body weights of Ncb5or−/− mice first began to diverge significantly from WT. Microarray analyses of liver RNA samples from mice at age 5 weeks indicated that genes in the following metabolic and stress response pathways are up-regulated in Ncb5or−/− compared with WT mice, which was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2"

We report here that TGase induces intramolecular cross-linking of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), resulting in structural changes of monomeric Aβ.

We have observed that a large population of Aβ monomers contained an 0.984 Da increase in mass at a glutamine residue, indicating that glutamine 15 serves as an indispensable substrate in TGase-mediated deamidation to glutamate 15. We provide strong analytical evidence on TGase-mediated Aβ peptide dimerization, through covalent intermolecular cross-linking and hence the formation of Aβ1–40 dimers.

https://openalex.org/W2065543957,"The solute carrier family 11 member 1 (SLC11A1) gene is strictly regulated and exclusively expressed in myeloid lineage cells. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the SLC11A1 gene during myeloid development. In this study, we used HL-60 cells as a model to investigate the regulatory elements/factors involved in the transactivation of the SLC11A1 gene during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells. Promoter deletion analysis showed that a 7-base AP-1-like element (TGACTCT) was critical for the responsiveness of the SLC11A1 promoter to PMA. Stimulation by PMA induced the binding of ATF-3 and the recruitment of two components of the SWI/SNF complex, BRG1 and β-actin, to this element in an ATF-3-dependent manner. RNAi-mediated depletion of ATF-3 or BRG1 markedly decreased SLC11A1 gene expression and its promoter activity induced by PMA. Luciferase reporter experiments demonstrated that ATF-3 cooperated with BRG1 and β-actin to activate the SLC11A1 promoter. Furthermore, we showed that PMA can induce the proximal (GT/AC)(n) repeat sequence to convert to the Z-DNA structure in the SLC11A1 gene promoter, and depletion of BRG1 resulted in a significant decrease of Z-DNA formation. Our results demonstrated that recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex initiated Z-DNA formation and subsequently helped to transactivate the SLC11A1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2069377402,"TatC (STM3975) is a highly conserved component of the Twin Arginine Transport (Tat) systems that is required for transport of folded proteins across the inner membrane in gram-negative bacteria. We previously identified a ΔtatC mutant as defective in competitive infections with wild type ATCC14028 during systemic infection of Salmonella-susceptible BALB/c mice. Here we confirm these results and show that the ΔtatC mutant is internalized poorly by cultured J774-A.1 mouse macrophages a phenotype that may be related to the systemic infection defect. This mutant is also defective for short-term intestinal and systemic colonization after oral infection of BALB/c mice and is shed in reduced numbers in feces from orally infected Salmonella-resistant (CBA/J) mice. We show that the ΔtatC mutant is highly sensitive to bile acids perhaps resulting in the defect in intestinal infection that we observe. Finally, the ΔtatC mutant has an unusual combination of motility phenotypes in Salmonella; it is severely defective for swimming motility but is able to swarm well. The ΔtatC mutant has a lower amount of flagellin on the bacterial surface during swimming motility but normal levels under swarming conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2012022547,"Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide antibiotics that contain unusual amino acids such as dehydro and lanthionine residues. Nukacin ISK-1 is a class II lantibiotic, whose precursor peptide (NukA) is modified by NukM to form modified NukA. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter NukT is predicted to cleave off the N-terminal leader peptide of modified NukA and secrete the mature peptide. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that NukT has an N-terminal peptidase domain (PEP) and a C-terminal ATP binding domain (ABD). Previously, in vitro reconstitution of NukT has revealed that NukT peptidase activity depends on ATP hydrolysis. Here, we constructed a series of NukT mutants and investigated their transport activity in vivo and peptidase activity in vitro. Most of the mutations of the conserved residues of PEP or ABD resulted in failure of nukacin ISK-1 production and accumulation of modified NukA inside the cells. NukT(N106D) was found to be the only mutant capable of producing nukacin ISK-1. Asn106 is conserved as Asp in other related ABC transporters. Additionally, an in vitro peptidase assay of NukT mutants demonstrated that PEP is on the cytosolic side and all of the ABD mutants as well as PEP (with the exception of NukT(N106D)) did not have peptidase activity in vitro.

One of the best known lantibiotics, nisin, which is produced by Lactococcus lactis, has been used as a food preservative for decades. Lantibiotics are divided into two different classes based on the biosynthetic pathway and the enzymes from which they are produced (5Pag U. Sahl H.G. Curr. Pharm.

Members of this ABC transporter subfamily are involved in the secretion of proteinaceous compounds and contain an additional N-terminal domain involved in the processing of their substrates at the so-called double glycine site at the C terminus of the leader peptide (7Håvarstein L.S.

The PEPs of LagD, CvaB, ComA, and LctT have been purified and been proven to cleave off the leader peptide of their cognate precursor peptide (7Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol.

The PEPs of these proteins have Cys, His, or Asp residues, which are conserved among the papain-like cysteine proteases. Substitution of these residues results in loss of their peptidase activity, demonstrating that PEP also belongs to the cysteine protease family (9Furgerson Ihnken L.A. Chatterjee C. van der Donk W.A.

The N-terminal leader peptide sequence of the precursor peptide has been reported to be important for peptidase activity of PEP. Furgerson Ihnken et al. found that the double glycine motif and the α-helical structure of the leader peptide are important for proteolysis by PEP of LctT (9Furgerson Ihnken L.A. Chatterjee C. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7352-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Kotake et al. also demonstrated that PEP of ComA cleaves off the leader peptide after the double glycine site and proposed the presence of hydrophobic patch on the surface of the PEP, which interacts with the hydrophobic face of the helix of the precursor peptide (12Kotake Y. Ishii S. Yano T. Katsuoka Y. Hayashi H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2531-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional crystal structure of ComA has been recently clarified, and PEP was shown to have an overall structure similar to the structure of the papain-like cysteine proteases (13Ishii S.

The Cys-His active site of PEP at the bottom of a narrow cleft is suitable for binding of the double glycine site, and a shallow hydrophobic concave surface was proposed to accommodate the helical structure of the leader peptide (13Ishii S.

Walker A, Walker B, and H-loop are distinctive motifs for ABD of the ABC transporters (Fig. 1). The membrane topology of LcnC, an AMS protein involved in the production of lactococcin, includes four membrane helices that span the cytoplasmic membrane. Both the N- and C-terminal parts are in the cytoplasm (8Franke C.M. Tiemersma J. Venema G. Kok J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8484-8490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The peptidase activity of full-length AMS, which has both PEP and ABD, has been reported to require nucleotide hydrolysis as its driving force (14Zhong X. Kolter R. Tai P.C. J. Biol.

NukM introduces unusual amino acids into NukA to form modified NukA. NukT is an AMS protein that is responsible for leader peptide cleavage of modified NukA and secretion of mature nukacin ISK-1 (18Aso Y. Nagao J. Koga H. Okuda K. Kanemasa Y. Sashihara T. Nakayama J. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A previous in vitro study of NukT has clarified that NukT cannot cleave off the leader peptide if the unusual amino acids are not included in the propeptide and that peptidase activity requires energy from ATP hydrolysis (15Nishie M. Shioya K. Nagao J. Jikuya H. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2009; 108: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the functions of PEP and ABD and the details regarding the cooperation between these two domains in full-length NukT have not been characterized. For further understanding of the molecular characteristics of lantibiotic biosynthetic enzymes, we have focused on the conserved residues in PEP and ABD of the AMS protein and constructed a series of NukT mutants. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that C-terminal ABD is important not only for transport activity but also for peptidase activity of NukT.DISCUSSIONNukT is the biosynthetic enzyme for the production of nukacin ISK-1, a class II lantibiotic. NukT contributes to cleavage of the leader peptide of the precursor peptide (modified NukA), which leads to secretion of mature nukacin ISK-1 (18Aso Y. Nagao J. Koga H. Okuda K. Kanemasa Y. Sashihara T. Nakayama J. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). AMS proteins are a family of proteins responsible for both processing (leader peptide cleavage of the precursor peptide) and secretion of the mature active peptide. AMS proteins such as NukT consist of an N-terminal PEP and a C-terminal ABD. Previous reports of purified PEPs (approximately 150 amino acids) of LagD, CvaB, ComA, and LctT have revealed that PEP is a papain-like cysteine protease that recognizes the helix structure and the double glycine motif in the leader peptide of the precursor and cleaves off the leader peptide at the double glycine site (7Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 9Furgerson Ihnken L.A. Chatterjee C. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7352-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Wu K.H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 901-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Ishii S. Yano T. Hayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4726-4731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite the significant diversity of transport substrates, the sequences of the ABDs are remarkably well conserved among all of the ABC transporters. ABD powers the transporter by binding and hydrolyzing ATP. Presumably, ATP binding and/or hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes in the membrane-spanning domain that mediate the unidirectional pumping of substrates across the membrane (34Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Functional and structural information on PEP and ABD has been provided. However, the relationship between PEP and ABD in full-length AMS proteins is still poorly understood. Here, we focused on the conserved residues of PEP and ABD in the AMS protein. We selected mutation points in NukT at residues that are conserved in the PEP catalytic active site of cysteine proteases (Q6A, C12A, H90A, N106D) and conserved motifs that are important for ATPase activity (K503R), ATP binding (D615N), and transport activity (H649R) in ABD (Fig. 1). We constructed a series of NukT mutants and investigated their transport activity in vivo and peptidase activity in vitro.The in vivo transport assay revealed that all of the NukT mutants except for NukT(N106D) cannot produce nukacin ISK-1 in the culture supernatant. Additionally, accumulation of the precursor peptide of modified NukA was detected in nukacin ISK-1 nonproducing recombinant strains (Table 2). NukT(Q6A), NukT(C12A), and NukT(H90A) have mutations in PEP but not in ABD. Accumulation of modified NukA in these mutants indicates that PEP mutants cannot transport the precursor peptide without cleavage of the leader peptide. On the other hand, ABD mutants have no PEP mutations but were observed to accumulate modified NukA. This indicates that cleavage of the leader peptide did not occur. From these results, it is suggested that NukT can function properly only when the peptidase and the transporter are both in the active form.ISO membrane vesicles expressing NukT prepared from S. carnosus can effectively cleave off the leader peptide of modified His-NukA (15Nishie M. Shioya K. Nagao J. Jikuya H. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2009; 108: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the same experiment using RSO membrane instead of ISO membrane revealed that NukT in the correct orientation as in the parent cells cannot cleave off the leader peptide of modified His-NukA, which is added externally (Fig. 4). In the case of the class I lantibiotic nisin, NisT exports the fully modified prenisin, and then the extracellular serine protease NisP cleaves off the leader peptide (35Kuipers A. de Boef E. Rink R. Fekken S. Kluskens L.D. Driessen A.J. Leenhouts K. Kuipers O.P. Moll G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22176-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although there have been no investigations on the membrane topology of LanT of class II lantibiotics, our results distinctively indicate that, unlike the class I lantibiotic, PEP of NukT is on the cytosolic side, and the leader peptide of nukacin ISK-1, a class II lantibiotic, is cleaved off inside the cells before or concomitantly with secretion.The in vitro peptidase assay revealed that the PEP mutants NukT(Q6A), NukT(C12A), and NukT(H90A) cannot cleave off the leader peptide as expected. All of the ABD mutants (NukT(K503R), NukT(D615N), and NukT(H649R)) were also incapable of cleaving off the leader peptide (Fig. 5). These results strongly support the in vivo data described above and also the previous data which suggest that NukT peptidase activity requires ATP hydrolysis (15Nishie M. Shioya K. Nagao J. Jikuya H. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2009; 108: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). According to the previous study of MalK, the H649R mutation has been predicted to not have an effect on ATP binding or hydrolysis but to repress transmembrane signaling or coupling of ATP hydrolysis to transport (32Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, there should be another important function of ABD for NukT peptidase activity. The three-dimensional crystal structure of PEP of ComA has revealed that PEP interacts with hydrophobic residues of the helix structure and the double glycine motif in the leader peptide (13Ishii S. Yano T. Ebihara A. Okamoto A. Manzoku M. Hayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10777-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We propose that the conformational transition subsequent to ATP hydrolysis was blocked in the NukT mutants, and thus the interaction between PEP and modified NukA was prevented which resulted in failure to cleave off the leader peptide.LctT is an AMS protein involved in the production of the class II lantibiotic lacticin 481. The purified PEP of LctT can cleave off the leader peptide of both the modified and unmodified precursor peptide (9Furgerson Ihnken L.A. Chatterjee C. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7352-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we previously reported that full-length NukT can only digest modified NukA (15Nishie M. Shioya K. Nagao J. Jikuya H. Sonomoto K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2009; 108: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ABD of NukT might play an important role in recognition of lanthionine rings. In the future, further investigations of PEP or ABD alone should clearly answer this question.NukT(N106D) was found to be the only mutant that could produce nukacin ISK-1 in vivo and cleave off the leader peptide in vitro. Quantitative analysis revealed that both the level of production of nukacin ISK-1 and the peptidase activity of NukT(N106D) are higher than those of wild-type NukT (Fig. 6). Asn106 is one of the residues in the catalytic triad of the cysteine protease and is conserved as Asp in most of the other AMS proteins (7Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Among the papain-like cysteine proteases, a conserved Cys and His form a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, and Asp or Asn is responsible for the correct orientation of the imidazolium ring of the active-site histidine (36Drenth J. Kalk K.H. Swen H.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 37Nicastro G. Menon R.P. Masino L. Knowles P.P. McDonald N.Q. Pastore A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results led us to propose that Asp is favored over Asn as a catalytic active residue for cleavage of the leader peptide by AMS proteins and thus Asp is highly conserved among this protein family.In this study, we constructed a series of NukT mutants to investigate the importance of conserved residues in PEP and ABD as a full-length AMS protein. All of the NukT mutants except for NukT(N106D) could not produce nukacin ISK-1. The precursor peptide was accumulated inside the cells, and the leader peptide could not be cleaved off in vitro. We conclude from these data that both PEP and ABD are important for peptidase activity, and their cooperative functions are indispensable for proper functioning of NukT.

Kotake et al. also demonstrated that PEP of ComA cleaves off the leader peptide after the double glycine site and proposed the presence of hydrophobic patch on the surface of the PEP, which interacts with the hydrophobic face of the helix of the precursor peptide (12Kotake Y.

NukM introduces unusual amino acids into NukA to form modified NukA. NukT is an AMS protein that is responsible for leader peptide cleavage of modified NukA and secretion of mature nukacin ISK-1 (18Aso Y. Nagao J. Koga H. Okuda K. Kanemasa Y. Sashihara T. Nakayama J.

A previous in vitro study of NukT has clarified that NukT cannot cleave off the leader peptide if the unusual amino acids are not included in the propeptide and that peptidase activity requires energy from ATP hydrolysis (15Nishie M.

However, the functions of PEP and ABD and the details regarding the cooperation between these two domains in full-length NukT have not been characterized. For further understanding of the molecular characteristics of lantibiotic biosynthetic enzymes, we have focused on the conserved residues in PEP and ABD of the AMS protein and constructed a series of NukT mutants. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that C-terminal ABD is important not only for transport activity but also for peptidase activity of NukT. Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing antibiotic peptides, which display a number of favorable characteristics. For example, they have no taste or odor, they are tolerant to high heat and acid, and they have stable activity at nanomolar concentrations against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These attractive qualities are expected to lead to the broad application potentials of lantibiotics (1de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. van der Meer J.R. Siezen R.J. Mol.

So far it remains unclear why infections in the elderly become life threatening despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the serum, and to which extent double infections worsen the clinical course.Young and aged BALB/c-mice were infected with RSV or/and HMPV. Appearance of the mice was observed during course of infection. On day 5 p.i. animals were dispatched by cervical dislocation and levels of TNF-α and NF-κB were determined.The observation of activity, weight and appearance of the different mice showed no differences among the tested groups. Despite this, the immunologic response depends on the animals' age and the virus they were infected with. In young animals, NF-κB levels were elevated if infected with HMPV and HMPV/RSV but remained low in RSV infections, whereas in aged animals the opposite was observed: solely RSV-infected animals showed elevated levels of NF-κB. TNF-α was slightly elevated in HMPV-infected young and old animals, but only in young animals this elevation was significant.Contrary to other studies, no weight loss or change in activity despite productive lung infection with the different viruses were observed. This may be due to the weaker anaesthesia or the lesser volume of virus solution used, leading to less stress in the animals. The observed differences in TNF-α and NF-κB elevation lead to the assumption that young and old individuals have different mechanisms to react against the viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2044792293,"ETV1 is overexpressed in a subset of clinical prostate cancers as a fusion transcript with many different partners. However, ETV1 can also be overexpressed as a full-length transcript. Full-length ETV1 protein functions differently from truncated ETV1 produced by fusion genes. In this study we describe the genetic background of full-length ETV1 overexpression and the biological properties of different full-length ETV1 isoforms in prostate cancer. Break-apart FISH showed in five out of six patient samples with overexpression of full-length ETV1 a genomic rearrangement of the gene, indicating frequent translocation. We were able to study the rearrangements in more detail in two tumors. In the first tumor 5′-RACE on cDNA showed linkage of the complete ETV1 transcript to the first exon of a prostate-specific two exon ncRNA gene that maps on chromosome 14 (EST14). This resulted in the expression of both full-length ETV1 transcripts and EST14-ETV1 fusion transcripts. In chromosome spreads of a xenograft derived from the second prostate cancer we observed a complex ETV1 translocation involving a chromosome 7 fragment that harbors ETV1 and fragments of chromosomes 4 and 10. Further studies revealed the overexpression of several different full-length transcripts, giving rise to four protein isoforms with different N-terminal regions. Even the shortest isoform synthesized by full-length ETV1 stimulated in vitro anchorage-independent growth of PNT2C2 prostate cells. This contrasts the lack of activity of even shorter N-truncated ETV1 produced by fusion transcripts. Our findings that in clinical prostate cancer overexpression of full-length ETV1 is due to genomic rearrangements involving different chromosomes and the identification of a shortened biologically active ETV1 isoform are highly relevant for understanding the mechanism of ETV1 function in prostate cancer."

Previously, we reported the destruction of amyloid fibrils of β(2)-microglobulin K3 fragments and amyloid β by laser irradiation coupled with the binding of an amyloid-specific thioflavin T. Here, we studied the effects of this combination on the amyloid fibrils of two 22-residue fragments of keratoepithelin. The direct observation of individual amyloid fibrils was performed in real time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Both types of amyloid fibrils were broken up by the laser irradiation, dependent on the laser power.

https://openalex.org/W2091444991,"Eye movements create an ever-changing image of the world on the retina. In particular, frequent saccades call for a compensatory mechanism to transform the changing visual information into a stable percept. To this end, the brain presumably uses internal copies of motor commands. Electrophysiological recordings of visual neurons in the primate lateral intraparietal cortex, the frontal eye fields, and the superior colliculus suggest that the receptive fields (RFs) of special neurons shift towards their post-saccadic positions before the onset of a saccade. However, the perceptual consequences of these shifts remain controversial. We wanted to test in humans whether a remapping of motion adaptation occurs in visual perception. The motion aftereffect (MAE) occurs after viewing of a moving stimulus as an apparent movement to the opposite direction. We designed a saccade paradigm suitable for revealing pre-saccadic remapping of the MAE. Indeed, a transfer of motion adaptation from pre-saccadic to post-saccadic position could be observed when subjects prepared saccades. In the remapping condition, the strength of the MAE was comparable to the effect measured in a control condition (33±7% vs. 27±4%). Contrary, after a saccade or without saccade planning, the MAE was weak or absent when adaptation and test stimulus were located at different retinal locations, i.e. the effect was clearly retinotopic. Regarding visual cognition, our study reveals for the first time predictive remapping of the MAE but no spatiotopic transfer across saccades. Since the cortical sites involved in motion adaptation in primates are most likely the primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area (MT/V5) corresponding to human MT, our results suggest that pre-saccadic remapping extends to these areas, which have been associated with strict retinotopy and therefore with classical RF organization. The pre-saccadic transfer of visual features demonstrated here may be a crucial determinant for a stable percept despite saccades."

We tested the hypothesis that the Ca2+-binding activator protein calmodulin (CaM) is the primary decoder of Ca2+ signals, thereby determining the output, e.g. LTP. Thus, we investigated the function of CaM mutants, deficient in Ca2+ binding at sites 1 and 2 of the N-terminal lobe or sites 3 and 4 of the C-terminal CaM lobe, in the activation of αCaMKII. Occupancy of CaM Ca2+ binding sites 1, 3, and 4 is necessary and sufficient for full activation. Moreover, the N- and C-terminal CaM lobes have distinct functions. Ca2+ binding to N lobe Ca2+ binding site 1 increases the turnover rate of the enzyme 5-fold, whereas the C lobe plays a dual role; it is required for full activity, but in addition, via Ca2+ binding site 3, it stabilizes ATP binding to αCaMKII 4-fold. Thr286 autophosphorylation is also dependent on Ca2+ binding sites on both the N and the C lobes of CaM.

A fundamental unexplained feature of the induction of LTP and memory formation is how global Ca2+ elevation is necessary but insufficient, while requiring additional local, high frequency NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ signals (5Topolnik L.

Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), and here we propose that Ca2+ signal transduction is determined by the activation mechanism of αCaMKII by Ca2+·CaM. αCaMKII is an abundant, neuronally expressed, broad specificity protein kinase that is especially enriched in the hippocampus, an area specialized in memory function. αCaMKII forms dodecamers (10Morris E.P. Török K. J. Mol.

Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). αCaMKII thus differs from other Ca2+·CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), e.g. CaMKI and CaMKIV, which are monomeric and for full activation require phosphorylation in the activation loop by an exogenous kinase, in addition to the Ca2+·CaM binding-induced release of their autoinhibitory domain (12Ohmae S.

Activation is manifested in a switch-like increase in Vmax as autoinhibited CaMKs have no detectable Ca2+·CaM-independent basal activity. Later on, we will term this V type regulation. When the Km values for ATP or protein substrates are affected, that will be termed K type regulation. αCaMKII has two successive active states. The first active state is formed by the binding of Ca2+·CaM and ATP. This complex is ready to phosphorylate protein or peptide substrates. Importantly, αCaMKII is a substrate for itself, and the αCaMKII active complex is converted to its second active state, Ca2+·CaM·phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII, by rapid autophosphorylation. This latter process is essential for NMDAR-dependent LTP and spatial learning (2Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 4Malenka R.C. Kauer J.A. Perkel D.J. Mauk M.D. Kelly P.T. Nicoll R.A. Waxham M.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), although the functionally relevant target of the phosphoenzyme has not been identified. The Ca2+·CaM binding affinity for the phosphoenzyme is >104-fold increased, and Ca2+ binding to CaM in the phosphoenzyme complex is stabilized when compared with that with non-phospho-αCaMKII (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a consequence, Ca2+·CaM-bound phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII exists not only at activating (>500 nm) but also at resting (<100 nm) free Ca2+ concentrations (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At free Ca2+ concentrations of <20 nm, when Ca2+ and hence CaM dissociate, activity is reduced to ≤5% of that of fully Ca2+·CaM-stimulated phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII activity is fully Ca2+·CaM-dependent. Furthermore, the activity of phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII is transient in LTP and is time-limited by inhibitory Thr305/306 autophosphorylation (8Lee S.J. Escobedo-Lozoya Y. Szatmari E.M. Yasuda R.

CaM binds Ca2+ at four sites that are formed by EF-hand motifs, two at each of its N- and C-terminal lobes. Of these two lobes, the Ca2+ binding sites in the C-terminal lobe have inherently higher affinity for Ca2+ than those of the N-terminal lobe (16Martin S.R. Andersson Teleman A. Bayley P.M. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Typically, both CaM lobes are involved in the activation of a wide range of CaM target enzymes, and the number of participating Ca2+ ions is thought to vary between 3 and 4 (17Ikura M. Ames J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To dissect the functions of the Ca2+ binding sites of CaM in αCaMKII activation, we have employed CaM mutants in which individual or multiple Ca2+ binding sites have been disabled. The mutants are termed CaM1, CaM2 (N lobe mutants), CaM3 and CaM4 (C lobe mutants), CaM12 and CaM34 (whole lobe mutants), and CaM1234 (the all-site mutant), indicating the position of the mutated EF-hand in the amino acid sequence (18Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The regulation of αCaMKII by CaM is complex. Binding and kinetic studies of Ca2+·CaM and αCaMKII provided evidence for a dynamic process with a series of structural transitions in Ca2+·CaM·αCaMKII during Ca2+·CaM and ATP or ADP binding to the enzyme, in which process Ca2+·CaM binding to αCaMKII is stabilized (19Török K.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6404-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ca2+·CaM binding to αCaMKII is thought to be initiated by one of the CaM lobes, and evidence for such a role by either the N CaM lobe (20Forest A. Swulius M.T. Tse J.K. Bradshaw J.M. Gaertner T. Waxham M.N. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10587-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or the C CaM lobe (21Evans T.I. Shea M.A. Proteins. 2009; 76: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has been presented. The initial Ca2+·CaM-bound αCaMKII complex then undergoes a conformational change to and exists in equilibrium with a form in which CaM wraps around the CaM binding domain with both of its lobes bound (19Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the signaling complexes formed by the interaction of Ca2+, CaM, αCaMKII, and ATP transduce neuronal Ca2+-signaling patterns that result in memory formation. Here we explored the hypothesis that at the molecular level, NMDAR-dependent LTP and memory formation are explained by lobe-specific differential sensing of global and local Ca2+ signals by CaM in the activation of αCaMKII. αCaMKII was overexpressed in baculovirus-transfected Sf9 insect cells and purified by CaM-Sepharose and Mono Q FPLC. Wild type human liver recombinant calmodulin and its point mutants CaM1, CaM2, CaM3, CaM4, CaM12, CaM34, and CaM1234 were obtained by replacing their respective cDNAs from Xenopus vectors (kindly provided by J. P. Adelman) into Escherichia coli expression vectors (kindly performed by Dr. Nael Nadif Kasri, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium). CaM mutants were generated by mutation of the first coordinating Asp of the Ca2+ binding EF-hand motifs to Ala. Mouse monoclonal anti-αCaMKII and anti-phospho-Thr286 antibodies were purchased from Chemicon. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients (ϵo) calculated from the amino acid composition: αCaMKII (subunits), ϵo = 64,805 m−1 cm−1 (280 nm); CaM and CaM mutants, ϵo = 3,300 m−1 cm−1 (278 nm) (19Török K.

Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the αCaMKII294–309 peptide (HPLC-purified to >95%) were measured by weight. A continuous enzyme-linked spectrofluorometric assay was used to determine ADP production by monitoring the decrease in NADH fluorescence resulting from its oxidation to NAD+ (19Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Török K. Cowley D.J. Brandmeier B.D. Howell S. Aitken A. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6188-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out at 21 °C in 50 mm K+-PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2. Typically, 5 mm DTT, 4.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 2 units of PK, 2 mm P-enolpyruvate, 22 μm NADH were added. Saturating concentrations were 2.5 μm free Ca2+, 6 μm wild type or mutant CaM, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μm syntide 2. CaM34 was used at 60 μm in the presence of 220 μm Ca2+. Ca2+, CaM, syntide 2, and ATP concentrations were varied as specified in the appropriate figure legends. Baseline reading was obtained with all but αCaMKII in the assay mix, and 0.05 μm αCaMKII was added to observe enzyme activity in a 60-μl total volume. The fluorescence assays were carried out using an SLM spectrofluorometer and SLM 8100 software. Fluorescence excitation was set to 340 nm (bandpass of 2 nm), and emission was detected at 460 nm (bandpass 32 nm). Thr286 autophosphorylation time courses were measured by manual mixing. 1 μm αCaMKII, 6 μm CaM or CaM mutant (with the exception of CaM34, which was used at 60 μm in the presence of 220 μm Ca2+), and 1 mm ATP were incubated in 50 mm K+-PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.05 mm CaCl2 at 21 °C for various times from 0 to 1,800 s with 15 s as the shortest time point. The reaction was terminated using 4× SDS sample buffer at predefined time points. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–12% precast gels (Invitrogen). Thr286 autophosphorylation was visualized by Western blotting using a phospho-Thr286-αCaMKII-specific monoclonal antibody and fluorescent secondary antibody (IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG). Imaging of Western blots on PVDF Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore) was carried out using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnologies). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) as follows. The average density reading for each band on the Western blot and a reading for time 0 were taken. For time 0, the reaction was terminated prior to the addition of ATP. The following formula was used to calculate relative density on an inverted scale: (Dmax − Dt)/(Dmax − DB), where Dmax is the average density of the darkest band, Dt is the average density at a particular time point, and DB is the average density at time 0. The scale was thus inverted by subtracting each value from the highest density value. Relative density was calculated with reference to the highest density, and the data were fitted with exponential functions using GraFit software program, version 4.0. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using a Kd value of 4.35 × 10−7 m determined in similar buffer conditions, ionic strength, and pH to our assay buffer, which was composed of 50 mm K+-PIPES pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and appropriate Ca2+/EGTA mixtures at 21 °C (25Smith G.L. Miller D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To verify the calculated [Ca2+] concentrations, the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo3 was titrated in the assay solutions containing different Ca2+/EGTA mixtures. The best fit to the titration curve gave a Kd value of 433 ± 55 nm for fluo3 in good agreement with the previously determined Kd value of 390 nm, thus verifying our calculated [Ca2+] values (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The effect of ATP was estimated to be negligible. A Fortran program solving the quadratic equation [Ca2+] = {b ± ·(b2 − 4× [Ca2+]o × [EGTA]o)}/2 where b = Kd + [Ca2+]o + [EGTA]o was used to calculate free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) from total Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), total EGTA ([EGTA]o), and the Kd. Steady-state activity and autophosphorylation kinetic data were fitted to appropriate equations using GraFit version 4.0. Stopped-flow kinetic data were fitted using the KinetAsyst software (TgK Scientific). Enzyme kinetic data were simulated using Mathcad 2001i Professional. Analysis of variance with post hoc Dunnett's multiple comparison test was carried out using GraphPad Prism 5. Typically, three independent sets of experiments were carried out; the data were averaged and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten or the Hill equation. The error reported is the standard deviation (S.D.). A one-way analysis of variance was carried out to compare the Km and Vmax values across the mutants for each substrate and activator and for comparing the rates of Thr286 autophosphorylation stimulated by mutant CaMs with that of wild type CaM. Dunnett's multiple comparison test was performed as post hoc analysis for pairwise comparison of each mutant with the wild type data. Normality of distribution was tested by plotting a histogram of residuals and accepted by visual inspection of a bell-shaped distribution. The role of each Ca2+ binding site of CaM in the activation mechanism of αCaMKII was investigated to understand how signaling by Ca2+ influx is decoded by CaM in neurons. Firstly, the effect of mutating each EF-hand on CaM structure and function was characterized by comparing wild type and mutant Ca2+·CaM secondary structure content and equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants. Far-UV CD spectroscopy, measured as described in supplemental Materials and Methods, demonstrated that there was no significant difference in helical structure content between wild type and mutant CaM in the presence of 0.2 mm EGTA (supplemental Fig. S1). Ca2+ binding by wild type CaM under conditions of 1 mm CaCl2 caused a 1.24-fold increase in molar CD extinction coefficient at 222 nm (Δϵ222, supplemental Table S1). The increases in Δϵ222 induced by Ca2+ binding were smaller in the single mutant (1.4–1.9-fold) and further reduced in the double mutant (∼1.1-fold) CaM proteins. The all-sites mutant CaM1234 far-UV CD spectrum was not altered by the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). The effect of the mutations was thus approximately proportional to the number of mutated sites. The stoichiometric Ca2+ dissociation constants of wild type and mutant CaMs, measured as described in supplemental Materials and Methods, were assigned to the N and C lobe, as established previously (26Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Brown S.E. Porumb T. Zhang M. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3508-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The overall dissociation constant for the N lobe was essentially unaffected in the C lobe mutants CaM3, CaM4, and CaM34, relative to wild type CaM (17 μm) (supplemental Fig. S2). Similarly, the overall dissociation constant for the C lobe in the N lobe mutants CaM1, CaM2, and CaM12 remained similar to wild type (1.8 μm). However, the N lobe dissociation constant was increased in the single N lobe mutants CaM1 (240 μm) and CaM2 (98 μm), in comparison with wild type, reflecting the lack of the second N lobe Ca2+ binding site. Similarly, the C lobe dissociation constant was increased in the single C lobe mutants CaM3 (30 μm) and CaM4 (12 μm) relative to wild type, due to the lack of the other C lobe Ca2+ binding site (supplemental Table S2). Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of the Ca2+-bound wild type and mutant CaM complexes, measured as described in supplemental Materials and Methods, were studied to determine the effect of mutation on the Ca2+ binding dynamics. The fluorescence increase of the Ca2+ chelator quin 2 upon trapping the dissociated Ca2+ was measured using stopped-flow spectroscopy. The complexes of Ca2+ bound to wild type and mutant CaMs with and without the αCaMKII294–309 target peptide were compared. In the absence of the peptide, the dissociation rate constant (koff) of the C lobe site was essentially unchanged in the N lobe mutants CaM1, CaM2, and CaM12 with respect to wild type CaM (11.4 s−1). The koff of one of the N lobe sites was reduced to ∼250 s−1 in the C lobe mutants CaM3, CaM4, and CaM34 when compared with wild type, for which the N lobe koff was too fast to be measured and was estimated to be ∼1,000 s−1 (28Martin S.R. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+ dissociation rate constants of αCaMKII294–309 peptide complexes with wild type CaM and its mutants were reduced when compared with the corresponding peptide-free Ca2+ complexes, consistent with Ca2+-dependent peptide binding (supplemental Table S3). Thus, overall, the effect of each mutation in structural terms was localized to the respective, mutated EF-hand of CaM. Mutation of the N lobe sites had no significant effect on the Ca2+ binding properties of the C lobe sites (24Török K. Cowley D.J. Brandmeier B.D. Howell S. Aitken A. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6188-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutation of site 3 or 4 revealed that the C lobe Ca2+ binding sites interact with one another and also affect the Ca2+ affinity of the N lobe. Substrate phosphorylation by αCaMKII activated by mutant CaM in comparison with wild type was studied using the steady-state NADH-coupled continuous fluorescence assay we had previously developed for the measurement of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase activity (14Tzortzopoulos A.

The steady-state kinetic parameters of αCaMKII activity were determined for each variable by keeping all other unvaried ligands at saturating concentrations, unless otherwise specified.

Significance was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Analysis of syntide 2 concentration dependences of steady-state αCaMKII activity fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation showed that mutations of the Ca2+ binding sites of CaM did not affect the Km value for syntide 2 given as 12.4 μm for wild type CaM (Fig. 1, Table 1). However, closer examination of Fig. 1, B and C, seemed to indicate that syntide 2 phosphorylation stimulated by C lobe CaM mutants may have been sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic. Thus, CaM3, CaM4, and CaM34 dependences were fitted to the Hill equation with the following results. The Km and Hill coefficient (n) values were 7.56 ± 1.22 μm and 2.13 ± 0.69 for CaM3, 15.63 ± 3.17 μm and 1.74 ± 0.51 for CaM4, and 12.00 ± 2.32 μm and 1.49 ± 0.43 for CaM34, respectively. The n values for CaM3 and CaM4 were close to 2, suggesting that Ca2+·CaM C lobe interactions may affect peptide substrate binding to αCaMKII. Ca2+ dependences of activation of syntide 2 phosphorylation by αCaMKII were compared for wild type CaM and CaM mutants (Fig. 2). The Ca2+ activation constant Kact1 for wild type CaM was ∼500 nm with a Hill coefficient (n) of 4.4 (Table 1), comparable with that measured for smooth muscle myosin light chain as substrate (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Multiple comparison of the Kact1 values showed no significant difference between wild type CaM and the mutants, with the exception of CaM34, for which the Kact1 value was 64 μm (Table 1). Ca2+·CaM activation constant Kact2 values were derived from CaM dependence experiments shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Although the Kact2 for wild type CaM and CaM12 appeared lower than those for the other mutants, multiple comparison revealed no significant difference between the wild type and mutant CaMs apart from the Kact2 for CaM34, which was significantly higher at 87 μm (Table 1). ATP binding stabilizes Ca2+·CaM binding to αCaMKII by lowering the Kd for Ca2+·CaM 10-fold (19Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Tzortzopoulos A. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6404-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This relationship was expected to be reciprocal with Ca2+·CaM binding increasing ATP affinity for αCaMKII. Measurement of the dependence of αCaMKII activity on ATP concentration in the presence of the CaM mutants was expected to reveal whether the stabilizing effect of CaM was specifically localized to any of its Ca2+ binding site(s). The Michaelis-Menten constant Km4 for ATP of 46 μm measured in the presence of wild type CaM for syntide 2 phosphorylation was similar to that previously measured with smooth muscle myosin light chain as substrate (14Tzortzopoulos A. Best S.L. Kalamida D. Török K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the Km for ATP remained unchanged with the N lobe mutants CaM1, CaM2, and CaM12 and C lobe mutant CaM4. In contrast, the Km values for ATP were significantly increased with C lobe mutants CaM3 and CaM34, ∼4- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, Table 1). Thus, the interaction that couples the ATP and Ca2+·CaM binding sites resides in the CaM C lobe and is effected by site 3. Vmax values displayed by αCaMKII were measured for each CaM mutant to identify the role of each Ca2+ binding site and lobe in determining the αCaMKII turnover rate. The Vmax value for"
https://openalex.org/W2012724955,"Background The signal of an association between vaccination in the second year of life with a hexavalent vaccine and sudden unexpected deaths (SUD) in the two days following vaccination was reported in Germany in 2003. A study to establish whether the immunisation with hexavalent vaccines increased the short term risk of SUD in infants was conducted in Italy. Methodology/Principal Findings The reference population comprises around 3 million infants vaccinated in Italy in the study period 1999–2004 (1.5 million received hexavalent vaccines). Events of SUD in infants aged 1–23 months were identified through the death certificates. Vaccination history was retrieved from immunisation registries. Association between immunisation and death was assessed adopting a case series design focusing on the risk periods 0–1, 0–7, and 0–14 days after immunisation. Among the 604 infants who died of SUD, 244 (40%) had received at least one vaccination. Four deaths occurred within two days from vaccination with the hexavalent vaccines (RR = 1.5; 95% CI 0.6 to 4.2). The RRs for the risk periods 0–7 and 0–14 were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.5) and 1.5 (95% CI 0.9 to 2.4). The increased risk was limited to the first dose (RR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4), whereas no increase was observed for the second and third doses combined. Conclusions The RRs of SUD for any vaccines and any risk periods, even when greater than 1, were almost an order of magnitude lower than the estimates in Germany. The limited increase in RRs found in Italy appears confined to the first dose and may be partly explained by a residual uncontrolled confounding effect of age."
https://openalex.org/W2156318905,"Encounters with strangers bear potential for social conflict and stress, but also allow the formation of alliances. First impressions of other people play a critical role in the formation of alliances, since they provide a learned base to infer the other's future social attitude. Stress can facilitate emotional memories but it is unknown whether stress strengthens our memory for newly acquired impressions of other people's personality traits. To answer this question, we subjected 60 students (37 females, 23 males) to an impression-formation task, viewing portraits together with brief positive vs. negative behavior descriptions, followed by a 3-min cold pressor stress test or a non-stressful control procedure. The next day, novel and old portraits were paired with single trait adjectives, the old portraits with a trait adjective matching the previous day's behavior description. After a filler task, portraits were presented again and subjects were asked to recall the trait adjective. Cued recall was higher for old (previously implied) than the novel portraits' trait adjectives, indicating validity of the applied test procedures. Overall, recall rate of implied trait adjectives did not differ between the stress and the control group. However, while the control group showed a better memory performance for others' implied negative personality traits, the stress group showed enhanced recall for others' implied positive personality traits. This result indicates that post-learning stress affects consolidation of first impressions in a valence-specific manner. We propose that the stress-induced strengthening of memory of others' positive traits forms an important cue for the formation of alliances in stressful conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093162919,"In the Addona et al. paper (Nature Biotechnology 2009), a large-scale multi-site study was performed to quantify Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) measurements of proteins spiked in human plasma. The unlabeled signature peptides derived from the seven target proteins were measured at nine different concentration levels, and their isotopic counterparts were served as the internal standards.In this paper, the sources of variation are analyzed by decomposing the variance into parts attributable to specific experimental factors: technical replicates, sites, peptides, transitions within each peptide, and higher-order interaction terms based on carefully built mixed effects models. The factors of peptides and transitions are shown to be major contributors to the variance of the measurements considering heavy (isotopic) peptides alone. For the light ((12)C) peptides alone, in addition to these factors, the factor of study*peptide also contributes significantly to the variance of the measurements. Heterogeneous peptide component models as well as influence analysis identify the outlier peptides in the study, which are then excluded from the analysis. Using a log-log scale transformation and subtracting the heavy/isotopic peptide [internal standard] measurement from the peptide measurements (i.e., taking the logarithm of the peak area ratio in the original scale establishes that), the MRM measurements are overall consistent across laboratories following the same standard operating procedures, and the variance components related to sites, transitions and higher-order interaction terms involving sites have greatly reduced impact. Thus the heavy peptides have been effective in reducing apparent inter-site variability. In addition, the estimates of intercepts and slopes of the calibration curves are calculated for the sub-studies.The MRM measurements are overall consistent across laboratories following the same standard operating procedures, and heavy peptides can be used as an effective internal standard for reducing apparent inter-site variability. Mixed effects modeling is a valuable tool in mass spectrometry-based proteomics research."

In the case of the bacterial enhancer-dependent RNA polymerase (which is essential for adaptive responses and bacterial pathogenesis), the DNA melting event depends on specialized hexameric AAA+ ATPase activators. Involvement of such factors in transcription was demonstrated 25 years ago, but why these activators need to be hexameric, whether all the subunits operate identically, what is the contribution of each of the six subunits within the hexamer (structural, functional, or both), and how many active subunits are required for transcription activation remain open questions.

Some hexameric AAA+ ATPases have evolved from homo- (e.g. the helicase MCM in prokaryotes) to hetero-hexamers (e.g. MCM2–7 in eukaryotes) comprising up to six different proteins, strongly suggesting differential roles of each subunit for hexamer activity (8Bell S.P.

The majority of AAA+ proteins are active as homo-oligomers, but knowledge of the contribution of individual subunits to the hexamers activity is incomplete or often absent. At several levels of analysis, the six subunits are virtually identical, and their precise organization and functionality in the hexamer is extremely difficult to probe. A challenging approach is to fix the organization of the hexamer by linking the six subunits together. Chemical cross-linking is commonly used to track the number of subunits present in the oligomer but does not provide a good tool to address the geometrical distribution of subunits for functionality. Two additional approaches have been developed recently: (i) mixing experiments based on the reconstitution of hetero-oligomers containing different variants (13Joly N. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15178-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Moreau M.J. McGeoch A.T. Lowe A.R. Itzhaki L.S. Bell S.D. Mol.

In this study, we combined both approaches and used a model AAA+ activator protein specialized in σ54-dependent transcription activation, the bacterial enhancer binding protein (bEBP) 3The abbreviations used are: bEBP, bacterial enhancer binding protein; RPc, RNA polymerase closed complex; RPo, RNA polymerase open complex; T, T86A; PspF, Phage shock protein F; MCM, minichromosome maintenance.

Joly N. Rappas M. Zhang X. Buck M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The intrinsic organization of the bEBP hexamer (proposed as a ring with six similar subunits) raises questions of how many GAFTGA motifs are required to (i) interact with RPc and (ii) activate transcription. While using ATP hydrolysis to remodel very different substrates (via specific substrate interaction motifs), PspF is part of the same clade as the AAA+ protease ClpX (4Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Journal of structural biology. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), which has recently been studied using single-chain polypeptides (16Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 31Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 29: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the current ClpX model, which is based on a stochastic ATPase activity and the requirement of only one initial interaction with the substrate (16Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), our previous studies on PspF strongly suggest a different mechanism of action, based on cooperative ATPase activity with more than one subunit involved in the initial substrate interaction (13Joly N. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15178-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, using a single-chain polypeptide approach, we reveal novel features of the initial PspF-σ54 interaction that suggest asymmetry and possibly ring discontinuity together with the roles of individual subunits within the hexamer in terms of substrate remodeling activity. We show that not all of the subunits within the hexamer are needed to actively engage the target (σ54 within the RPc) for substrate remodeling (RPo formation). These newly revealed features of bEBP functioning now uniquely distinguish their action from fully processive AAA+ proteins, where all subunits contact the target for remodeling, and from simple bimodal switches where a single subunit alternates between an active ATP-bound state and an inactive ADP-bound state sufficient for its action. Single-chain linked pspF1–275 were constructed by PCR and cloned into pET28b+. Single-chain monomers, dimers, trimers, and hexamers (supplemental Table IS) contained an N-terminal His6 tag cleaved during protein purification. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Unlinked PspF1–275 and linked trimers were overproduced as described in Ref. 29Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Linked dimers were overproduced using LB inoculated with a day culture (6 h) (2% v/v) and grown at 30 °C for 12 h. Proteins were purified by slightly modifying the standard protocol (29Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, after centrifugation, cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) and broken by sonication. The supernatant was loaded onto HiTrapTM Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) precharged with nickel and purified as described (29Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage for 3 h at 23 °C. The protein was finally dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and frozen at −80 °C. σ54 was purified as described (40Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli core RNAP enzyme was purchased from Cambio. Steady-state ATPase assays were used to monitor PspF1–275 or PspF1–275-linked protein ATPase activity. The ATPase activity assays were performed at 37 °C in the presence of an NADH-coupled regeneration system (41Nørby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in a 100-μl final volume, in buffer containing final concentrations of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NADH, 10 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, ATP (from 0 mm to 50 mm), and PspF1–275 or PspF-linked proteins (from 0 to 5 μm hexamer equivalent). Proteins (at the specified concentrations) were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2, ± 0.5 mm ATP or ADP where indicated. 50-μl samples were then injected onto a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm, 24 ml; GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with the sample buffer ± nucleotide (13Joly N. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15178-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and columns were calibrated with globular proteins: apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). All experiments were repeated at least four times, and the elution profiles obtained were similar. Gel mobility shift assays were conducted to detect protein-protein or protein-DNA complexes (26Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in a 10-μl final volume containing 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm DTT, 4 mm ADP, ± NaF (5 mm) ± radiolabeled σ54 (1 μm). Where indicated, PspF1–275 or PspF-linked proteins (2 μm hexamer equivalent) ± AlCl3 (0.4 mm) were added for a further 15 min at 37 °C. Complexes were analyzed on a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled σ54 was detected by a phosphorimaging device (Fuji Bas-5000) and analyzed using the Aida software. Full-length or short primed RNA assays were performed in a 10-μl volume containing: 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm DTT, 4 mm dATP, 0.1 μm core RNA polymerase enzyme, 0.4 μm σ54, and 20 nm promoter DNA. The mix was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by addition of 5 μm of PspF1–275 or PspF-linked proteins and incubated for varying times at 37 °C. Full-length transcription (from the supercoiled Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter) was initiated by adding a mix containing 100 μg/ml heparin, 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, 0.05 mm UTP, and 3 μCi [α-32P]UTP and incubated for a further 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer and analyzed on 6% denaturing gels. Synthesis of the abortive transcript (UpGGG) was initiated by addition of heparin (100 μg/ml), the dinucleotide UpG (0.5 mm), GTP (0.01 mm), and 4 μCi [α-32P]GTP and incubated for a further 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer and analyzed on a 20% denaturing gel. Radiolabeled RNA products were measured by a phosphorimaging device (Fuji Bas-5000) and analyzed using the Aida software. During the mixing experiment, we used different assumptions to attribute the activity corresponding to the hetero-hexamer formed from two different trimers following the law of binomial distribution. When equimolar concentrations of A and B trimers were mixed, we obtained the following distribution. A+B⇒14AA+14AB+14BA+14BB(Eq. 1) If we assume that AB = BA, we now can simplify the previous equation and calculate the activity of the AB hexamer. A+B⇒14AA+12AB+14BB(Eq. 2) We determined the activity of AB hexamer using the following equations. activityobs(A+B)=14activity(AA)+12activity(AB)+14activity(BB)(Eq. 3) activityobs(A+B)−14activity(AA)−14activity(BB)=12activity(AB)(Eq. 4) activity(AB)=2×(activityobs(A+B)−14activityobs(AA)−14activityobs(BB))(Eq. 5) Activityobs(AA), activityobs(BB), and activityobs(A + B) were determined experimentally. We engineered a gene to encode a single-chain polypeptide covalently linking PspF1–275 subunits. Unfortunately, the N-terminal and C-terminal region of PspF1–275 are not defined structurally in the crystal structure available, preventing us from precisely estimating a linking distance (Fig. 1A) (27Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using a systematic approach testing different sizes and compositions of linkers, we identified a glycine-rich sequence (-GSL GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS AAAEF-) suitable for forming wild-type PspF covalently linked dimers and trimers (WW and WWW, respectively; Fig. 1B). The predicted position of the linker precludes introduction of a steric clash with the substrate interacting GAFTGA motif, located on “top” of the hexamer (Fig. 1, A and B). As AAA+ proteins have the common requirement to form higher-order oligomers (usually hexamers) to hydrolyze ATP and remodel their substrate, we tested whether the presence of the linker in WW and WWW was affecting these activities. Using either W, WW, or WWW, we observed similar hexamer formation (Fig. 1C) and ATPase activities (Fig. 1F and Table 1), suggesting that the presence of the linker allows the formation of catalytically competent hexamers. We then investigated whether the engineered proteins were able to interact with σ54 (using an ADP-AlF trapping reaction) and activate RPo formation (in vitro transcription) (26Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We observed that the presence of the linker affects, to some extent, formation of the stable ADP-AlF-dependent PspF1–275 hexamer·σ54 complex (Fig. 1D; W, 100%; WW, 80%; and WWW, 30%). The amount of RPo formed (Fig. 1E) strictly correlates with the amount of PspF1–275 hexamer·σ54 formed (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the presence of the linker affects formation of the initial complex between PspF1–275 and RPc, but not its subsequent remodeling. For simplicity, we compared the activity of each construct (monomer, dimer, and trimer) to the activity observed with each of the corresponding W-linked constructs (W, WW, or WWW) as 100%.TABLE 1Kinetic constants for ATP hydrolysis for PspF1–275 constructsProteinVmaxKmmin−1μmW/W/W/W/W/W39.51 ± 4.62250T/T/T/T/T/T40.19 ± 4.22714Dimer-linkedWW/WW/WW40.60 ± 3.90333WT/WT/WT43.22 ± 4.15303TW/TW/TW46.04 ± 5.76285TT/TT/TT48.94 ± 3.33344Trimer-linkedWWW/WWW33.33 ± 2.59181WWT/WWT28.46 ± 3.99166TWW/TWW33.16 ± 1.52166WTT/WTT28.93 ± 4.14163TWT/TWT28.70 ± 3.63173TTT/TTT29.12 ± 1.24156 Open table in a new tab From these results, we infer that the ATPase and substrate interaction activities of the PspF1–275 hexamer require different oligomer organizations, potentially arising from different levels of sensitivity to subunit movements. In addition, these experiments reveal an unexpected differentiation between common properties of AAA+ proteins (oligomerization and ATPase activity) and specific PspF1–275 properties (σ54 binding interactions). To simplify the comparison between the different constructs, we subsequently expressed the activity associated with each single-chain peptide with respect to the wild-type version containing the same number of linked subunits. Having established that the single-chain forms of the dimer and trimer are active, we investigated whether all the subunits of the hexamer were required for σ54 binding interactions and RPo formation. Substituting threonine in the GAFTGA motif (T86A, referred herein as T, Fig. 2A) greatly reduces σ54 binding interactions without impacting on other properties of the PspF1–275 hexamer (ATPase activity and oligomerization) (30Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We engineered single-chain polypeptides linking native (W) and defective (for σ54 interaction) (T) subunits and showed that ATPase activity and hexamer formation of these peptides were similar (Table 1 and supplemental Table IS and Fig. 1S); demonstrating that introducing one, two, or three variant subunits (T) into the single-chain peptide does not significantly affect hexamer organization nor the formation of the ATPase catalytic site between adjacent subunits. We next examined whether alternate σ54 binding interacting competent (W) and defective (T) subunits can support σ54-dependent hexamer activities. Using WT or TW-linked dimers (allowing formation of WT/WT/WT or TW/TW/TW hexamers, respectively), we observed reduced hexamer-σ54 binding interactions (∼30% of the WW/WW/WW hexamer; Fig. 2B, lanes 9–16). These results establish directly, for the first time, that more than one W subunit is required to support full formation of a stable PspF1–275 hexamer·σ54 complex. Furthermore, we tested whether the residual σ54 interaction was productive for RPo formation. The remodeling activities were more reduced than predicted by simple extrapolation from the σ54 binding results, where each binding interaction is assumed to support a remodeling event. Instead, we observed 10% of RPo formation in contrast with the 25 and 20% of σ54 binding interactions scored for WT and TW hexamers, respectively (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6). As expected, we also observed that the TT/TT/TT hexamer completely failed to stably interact with σ54 and hence activate RPo formation, consistent with results obtained for the T/T/T/T/T/T hexamer (Fig. 2, B and C). We conclude that alternate arrangements of competent and defective subunits in the hexamer are not optimal for σ54 binding and even less so for RPo formation. These results suggest the requirement of more than one competent subunit for these activities and imply that RPo formation involves a different “set” of subunits than those needed for the initial σ54 interaction (based on higher levels of σ54 binding than RPo formation). Clearly, the introduction of alternate defective subunits in the hexamer affects σ54 interactions and uncouples ATPase activity from substrate remodeling. We next addressed whether two adjacent W subunits were required for σ54 binding interactions and RPo formation activities. Using single-chain trimers, WWT or TWW (to form dimers of trimers WWT/WWT or TWW/TWW), we observed similar levels of PspF hexamer·σ54 complex formed as with WWW (80 and 75%, respectively, of WWW/WWW; Fig. 2B, lanes 23–28). Clearly, two adjacent W subunits are more favorable for σ54 binding interactions than alternate competent and defective subunits (see “WT, TW” studies above). Strikingly, the level of RPo formation observed with the WWT and TWW hexamers was different (80 and 40%, respectively, compared with WWW), demonstrating that the WWT and TWW hexamers are not fully equivalent (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10). From these results, we infer that RPo formation is favored by a loop I-mediated contact to σ54, distinct from the one needed for the initial σ54 interaction and operational with WWT/WWT but not with TWW/TWW hexamers. We next tested whether two opposing W subunits in the hexamer were able to support σ54 binding and RPo formation. Using WTT or TWT trimers, we observed a drastic decrease in the amount of complex formed with σ54 (20% and none, respectively, compared with WWW; Fig. 2B, lanes 29–34). The amount of RPo formation was similar to σ54 binding (18% and none, respectively), further demonstrating that the relative locations of the W subunits in the hexamer are critical for its activities and that all the subunits of the hexamer are not functionally equivalent (Fig. 2C, lanes 11 and 12). As expected, the TTT/TTT hexamer failed to bind σ54 or activate RPo formation (Fig. 2, B and C). Differences observed between constructs predicted to have identical organizations in a planar hexamer strongly suggests that the functional hexamer is at some point asymmetric and might adopt either a spiral conformation (discontinuity in the hexamer) or a conformation where the two linked trimers are found in different planes. Based on the likelihood of an asymmetric hexamer arrangement and a physical discontinuity in the hexamer, we asked whether increasing the number of defective subunits in the hexamer has a linearly dependent output effect (or not) on σ54 binding and RPo formation activities. We used a mixing approach to reconstitute different hexamers harboring from zero to six defective subunits (Fig. 3). Mixing experiments have been successfully used to investigate PspF (13Joly N. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15178-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and other AAA+ proteins activities, including ClpX, ClpB, and MCM (14Moreau M.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we measured mixing efficiency by gel filtration (supplemental Fig. 3S) and established that mixing between two different linked trimers was occurring. We assumed that the mixing of trimer A and trimer B follows a binomial distribution (see “Experimental Procedures,” Mathematical Modeling). First, we modeled the theoretical values expected if the mixing between the two different types of trimers (A and B) was not occurring, using the activity values observed in the case of the homo-hexamers (supplemental Fig. 4S). Clearly, the observed σ54 binding and RPo formation activities of the hetero-hexamers are distinct from the activities expected if mixing was not occurring; establishing the formation of hetero-hexamers in solution (Fig. 3A). In addition, we observed that the σ54 binding and RPo formation activities follow different trends, suggesting different requirements for substrate interaction and remodeling. We then compared the contribution of the predicted hetero-hexamer subpopulation to the observed total activity (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we find that the σ54 binding activity of the hetero-hexamer is following a linear trend dependent on the number of adjacent W subunits up to just two adjacent W. Indeed, we observed that with only one W subunit, the hexamer could not detectably stably bind σ54, demonstrating that one W subunit is not sufficient to establish"
