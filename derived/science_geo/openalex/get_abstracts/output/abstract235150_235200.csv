It proves possible to represent the information obtained in a very simple way by the use of an instructive analogy."

https://openalex.org/W2053496438,"ORIENTED flakes of the fine fractions (less than 0.5 µ) of montmorillonite and hectorite, when dipped in protein suspensions at pH values far below their iso-electric point, exhibit a behaviour similar in general to that observed by Gieseking and his collaborators1. The difference in technique, however, shows a striking modification in the resulting protein-clay complexes. After immersion in gelatin-suspensions of pH 2.5 and concentrations stronger than 1 per cent, unidimensional Fourier syntheses of the X-ray diagrams of the oriented flake suggest that: (a) two monolayers, 4.3 A. thick, of the polypeptide chains of the protein are taken up in the interlamellar space, and completely fill it; (b) each monolayer is strongly adsorbed on the clay mineral sheets, and a high degree of order along the c-axis is obtained in the sandwich thus formed. The X-ray diagram is analogous to that of the glycerol – montmorillonite complex. This lends strong support to the idea that surface adsorptive forces play a major part in the formation of these two-layer organic complexes in montmorillonoid clays."

During the contraction, the phosphate groups are split off, and the macromolecules coil up by Brownian movement."

https://openalex.org/W1990361252,"THE Australasian barnacle Elminius modestus Darwin was first recorded by Bishop1 as occurring in very large numbers on the Admiralty Raft moored in the mouth of Chichester Harbour, in July 1945. Crisp and Chipperfield2 recorded the species from the Essex coast in October of the same year. Both authors extended the area of distribution with records made in 1946–47. From the distance apart of the earliest two published records it would appear that E. modestus was already well established in the summer of 1945."

The only analysis of nickel in deep-sea deposits known to us was published in 1914 by F. W. Clarke and G. Steiger, and gave 0.032 per cent as the content of nickel oxide in a composite sample of red clay from fifty-one different localities1. By the aid of modern microanalytical methods (the colour reaction with dimethyl glyoxime) quantities of nickel as small as 5–6 γ can easily be measured."

https://openalex.org/W2056991788,"THE fluorescence of amino-acids and peptides on dry filter paper1 is of great value for locating these substances after paper chromatography, and has been found useful in quantitative work2 since it avoids destructive treatment with reagents such as ninhydrin. It also enables substances to be eluted for further investigations from sheets of chromatograms where gross irregularity of solvent flow renders the use of marker strips3 inaccurate as guides for cutting. Unfortunately, marked variations in fluorescence are often observed when identical chromatograms are run on sheets of No. 4 Whatman paper from different packets of papers or even on adjacent sheets from the same packet4, and batches of papers are occasionally encountered on which no fluorescence at all can be observed at normal nitrogen-levels. As Phillips1, quoting De Ment5, considered fluorescence of amino-acids on paper to be due to excitation of the acids themselves by ultra-violet light, it seemed possible that some impurity present in ‘bad’ fluorescent papers might therefore be quenching fluorescence. Sheets from a particularly bad batch of No. 4 Whatman paper could not be improved, however, by washing with water, dilute sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid or with solutions of 8-hydroxyquinoline or dithizone."

https://openalex.org/W2079357122,"SHARP eyespot of wheat1, caused by Corticium (Rhizoctonia) Solani, is a common disease; but the lesions on leaf sheaths and straws are usually superficial, and there is no evidence that it is of economic importance. Hitherto, it does not appear to have been described on other cereals in Great Britain, though Oort2 shows a photograph of it on rye in Holland, and Sprague records it on barley3 and on oats4 in America. This year a crop of oats has been found in Bedfordshire with many plants severely attacked by a Rhizoctonia resembling that obtained from sharp eyespot in wheat. The lesions in oats resemble those in wheat; but the fungus penetrates deeply into the tissues of leaf sheaths and straws, rotting the shoots. The disease is evidently serious; but the loss cannot be estimated because another parasite, the eelworm Heterodora major, is attacking the roots and reducing growth of the crop. Many barley and a few wheat plants are scattered among the oats and some show typical superficial sharp eyespot lesions; the vigorous growth of the wheat and barley does not seem to be affected, and contrasts vividly with that of the oats."

The results of recent experiments of mine, however, indicate that some modification of this generally accepted view is necessary so far as the initiation of radial growth in ring-porous European species is concerned."

https://openalex.org/W2090147812,"THE surface of filter paper, in contact with water, has a slight negative charge1, and this may account for the non-adsorption of certain colloidal electrolytes such as dyes of the ‘acid’ type, when developed with water, as these also carry a net negative charge in aqueous solution. By the application of principles similar to those described by Weiss2, a ‘primary adsorbate’ may be applied to paper, in this case being so arranged that the paper now has a net positive charge in contact with water. A suitable compound for this purpose is cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, the paper being soaked in 0.03 per cent aqueous solution and dried before use."

https://openalex.org/W2072390614,"THE rates of evaporation, into a vacuum, of solid naphthalene from different crystal faces have been measured directly. Two crystals of naphthalene, masked so as to leave exposed only portions of the faces under study, were mounted so that evaporation from the exposed portions produced a torque which was measured with a quartz suspension fibre. It has been found that both the absolute rates of evaporation and their temperature coefficients are different for different faces, indicating variations in condensation coefficients and energies."

https://openalex.org/W2079699835,"IN the reported discussion of the “Nitrogen Cycle in Nature” at the Newcastle meeting of the British Association, reference was made to Prof. J. H. Quastel's observation that “all the amino-acids studied nitrify readily with the striking exception of methionine”. The report does not mention cystine in this connexion. In the course of work in progress here, we have in one experiment found cystine to cause marked inhibition of nitrification. The addition of amino-acids such as glycine or glutamic acid to batches of soil resulted in a rapid increase in ammonia, usually within two to four days, after which the ammonia values fell as nitrification proceeded. In the case of cystine, however, deamination was slower, reaching a maximum for ammonia in twenty-eight days, while the nitrate of the soil decreased slowly during the same period. At the end of six weeks, when nitrification of the other amino-acids had reached its maximum, only 10 per cent of the nitrogen in cystine had been nitrified and 75 per cent of it was recovered as ammonia."

https://openalex.org/W2012539644,"OBSERVATIONS made by Dixon and Barlee1 recently have inspired a discussion as to the possibility of a transpiration into a saturated atmosphere2,3. Dixon and Barlee showed that shoots, placed in a supersaturated atmosphere or being submerged, continue to absorb water for several days. Experiments in pure nitrogen and with narcotics indicate the necessity of respiration. According to the authors it is very probable that respiratory processes supply the leaf-cells with energy to secrete water drawn from the vessels into the leaf spaces. Thoday doubts, however, that water taken up in such amounts could all be retained, and suggests the possibility of transpiration into a saturated atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1967718259,"THE red 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) (I) is stable to oxygen in the solid state; its solutions, however, are only stable in the dark. When they are irradiated with sunlight or artificial light in the presence of oxygen, a crystalline peroxide (III) is formed1 (the quantum efficiency of the formation of (III)2 rises to unity at concentrations greater than 0.01 molar and is independent of wave-length between 3660 and 5460 A.). The easy formation of this peroxide is reminiscent of the formation of (V) from solutions containing hexaphenylethane molecules, as well as their dissociation products, namely, the paramagnetic triphenylmethyl radicals (IV). (The schemes and are simplified ones and show in both cases only the initial and final products.)"

https://openalex.org/W1984799401,"N different numbers arranged at random in a sequence can be considered to be consisting of k groups of numbers alternately in ascending and descending order. Groups of numbers in ascending and descending order are called runs up and down respectively. Kermack and McKendrick1, Levene and Wolfowitz2 and others have dealt with the theory of runs up and down. Recently3, I developed independently a method similar to that of Frechet4 for calculating the factorial moments of a large number of distributions considered in the statistical literature. This method is directly applicable for calculating the factorial and product moments of the distributions arising in the theory of runs up and down. Thus, for example, the second factorial moment for the distribution of the total number of runs of length p, or of p and more, is the sum of the expectations of the different configurations giving two such runs. The expectation for each of the configurations is the product of their probability and the number of configurations that can be had from the N numbers. The probability for any of the configurations can be evaluated step by step by breaking it into two independent sections and expressing it as the sum of two new configurations as illustrated below."
