https://openalex.org/W2006547120,"The previously observed supraclavicular depot of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans was commonly believed to be the equivalent of the interscapular thermogenic organ of small mammals. This view was recently disputed on the basis of the demonstration that this depot consists of beige (also called brite) brown adipocytes, a newly identified type of brown adipocyte that is distinct from the classical brown adipocytes that make up the interscapular thermogenic organs of other mammals. A combination of high-resolution imaging techniques and histological and biochemical analyses showed evidence for an anatomically distinguishable interscapular BAT (iBAT) depot in human infants that consists of classical brown adipocytes, a cell type that has so far not been shown to exist in humans. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that infants, similarly to rodents, have the bona fide iBAT thermogenic organ consisting of classical brown adipocytes that is essential for the survival of small mammals in a cold environment."
https://openalex.org/W2077936290,"The functions of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are primarily mediated and modulated by three families of proteins: the heterotrimeric G proteins, the G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and the arrestins. G proteins mediate activation of second-messenger-generating enzymes and other effectors, GRKs phosphorylate activated receptors, and arrestins subsequently bind phosphorylated receptors and cause receptor desensitization. Arrestins activated by interaction with phosphorylated receptors can also mediate G-protein-independent signalling by serving as adaptors to link receptors to numerous signalling pathways. Despite their central role in regulation and signalling of GPCRs, a structural understanding of β-arrestin activation and interaction with GPCRs is still lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of β-arrestin-1 (also called arrestin-2) in complex with a fully phosphorylated 29-amino-acid carboxy-terminal peptide derived from the human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp). This peptide has previously been shown to functionally and conformationally activate β-arrestin-1 (ref. 5). To capture this active conformation, we used a conformationally selective synthetic antibody fragment (Fab30) that recognizes the phosphopeptide-activated state of β-arrestin-1. The structure of the β-arrestin-1-V2Rpp-Fab30 complex shows marked conformational differences in β-arrestin-1 compared to its inactive conformation. These include rotation of the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains relative to each other, and a major reorientation of the 'lariat loop' implicated in maintaining the inactive state of β-arrestin-1. These results reveal, at high resolution, a receptor-interacting interface on β-arrestin, and they indicate a potentially general molecular mechanism for activation of these multifunctional signalling and regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2159720471,"The genetic causes of malformations of cortical development (MCD) remain largely unknown. Here we report the discovery of multiple pathogenic missense mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1 and KIF2A, as well as a single germline mosaic mutation in KIF5C, in subjects with MCD. We found a frequent recurrence of mutations in DYNC1H1, implying that this gene is a major locus for unexplained MCD. We further show that the mutations in KIF5C, KIF2A and DYNC1H1 affect ATP hydrolysis, productive protein folding and microtubule binding, respectively. In addition, we show that suppression of mouse Tubg1 expression in vivo interferes with proper neuronal migration, whereas expression of altered γ-tubulin proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupts normal microtubule behavior. Our data reinforce the importance of centrosomal and microtubule-related proteins in cortical development and strongly suggest that microtubule-dependent mitotic and postmitotic processes are major contributors to the pathogenesis of MCD."
https://openalex.org/W2085398950,"The extent and biological impact of RNA cytosine methylation are poorly understood, in part owing to limitations of current techniques for determining the targets of RNA methyltransferases. Here we describe 5-azacytidine-mediated RNA immunoprecipitation (Aza-IP), a technique that exploits the covalent bond formed between an RNA methyltransferase and the cytidine analog 5-azacytidine to recover RNA targets by immunoprecipitation. Targets are subsequently identified by high-throughput sequencing. When applied in a human cell line to the RNA methyltransferases DNMT2 and NSUN2, Aza-IP enabled >200-fold enrichment of tRNAs that are known targets of the enzymes. In addition, it revealed many tRNA and noncoding RNA targets not previously associated with NSUN2. Notably, we observed a high frequency of C→G transversions at the cytosine residues targeted by both enzymes, allowing identification of the specific methylated cytosine(s) in target RNAs. Given the mechanistic similarity of RNA cytosine methyltransferases, Aza-IP may be generally applicable for target identification."
https://openalex.org/W2003605385,"Analysis of gene expression data from 22 tumor types reveals differences in how the metabolic network is perturbed in cancer. Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an emerging hallmark of neoplastic transformation. However, it is not known how the expression of metabolic genes in tumors differs from that in normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit similar metabolic changes. Here we compare expression patterns of metabolic genes across 22 diverse types of human tumors. Overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. Although expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) are very heterogeneous. Our analysis also suggests that the expression changes of some metabolic genes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) may enhance or mimic the effects of recurrent mutations in tumors. On the level of individual biochemical reactions, many hundreds of metabolic isoenzymes show significant and tumor-specific expression changes. These isoenzymes are potential targets for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036445364,"We used the Immunochip array to analyze 2,816 individuals with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), comprising the most common subtypes (oligoarticular and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA), and 13,056 controls. We confirmed association of 3 known JIA risk loci (the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, PTPN22 and PTPN2) and identified 14 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for the first time. Eleven additional new regions showed suggestive evidence of association with JIA (P < 1 × 10(-6)). Dense mapping of loci along with bioinformatics analysis refined the associations to one gene in each of eight regions, highlighting crucial pathways, including the interleukin (IL)-2 pathway, in JIA disease pathogenesis. The entire Immunochip content, the HLA region and the top 27 loci (P < 1 × 10(-6)) explain an estimated 18, 13 and 6% of the risk of JIA, respectively. In summary, this is the largest collection of JIA cases investigated so far and provides new insight into the genetic basis of this childhood autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008193883,"The authors use functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure how the semantic representation changes when searching for different object categories in natural movies. They find tuning shifts that expand the representation of the attended category and of semantically related, but unattended, categories, and compress the representation of categories semantically dissimilar to the target. Little is known about how attention changes the cortical representation of sensory information in humans. On the basis of neurophysiological evidence, we hypothesized that attention causes tuning changes to expand the representation of attended stimuli at the cost of unattended stimuli. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure how semantic representation changed during visual search for different object categories in natural movies. We found that many voxels across occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal cortex shifted their tuning toward the attended category. These tuning shifts expanded the representation of the attended category and of semantically related, but unattended, categories, and compressed the representation of categories that were semantically dissimilar to the target. Attentional warping of semantic representation occurred even when the attended category was not present in the movie; thus, the effect was not a target-detection artifact. These results suggest that attention dynamically alters visual representation to optimize processing of behaviorally relevant objects during natural vision."
https://openalex.org/W2014086521,"Fat is stored or mobilized according to food availability. Malfunction of the mechanisms that ensure this coordination underlie metabolic diseases in humans. In mammals, lysosomal and autophagic function is required for normal fat storage and mobilization in the presence or absence of food. Autophagy is tightly linked to nutrients. However, if and how lysosomal lipolysis is coupled to nutritional status remains to be determined. Here we identify MXL-3 and HLH-30 (TFEB orthologue) [corrected] as transcriptional switches coupling lysosomal lipolysis and autophagy to nutrient availability and controlling fat storage and ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans. Transcriptional coupling of lysosomal lipolysis and autophagy to nutrients is also observed in mammals. Thus, MXL-3 and HLH-30 orchestrate an adaptive and conserved cellular response to nutritional status and regulate lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2068165326,"Human embryonic stem cells differentiated to medial ganglionic eminence–like cells ameliorate learning and memory deficits in a mouse model. Dysfunction of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons, derived from medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), is implicated in disorders of learning and memory. Here we present a method for differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to a nearly uniform population of NKX2.1+ MGE-like progenitor cells. After transplantation into the hippocampus of mice in which BFCNs and some GABA neurons in the medial septum had been destroyed by mu P75-saporin, human MGE-like progenitors, but not ventral spinal progenitors, produced BFCNs that synaptically connected with endogenous neurons, whereas both progenitors generated similar populations of GABA neurons. Mice transplanted with MGE-like but not spinal progenitors showed improvements in learning and memory deficits. These results suggest that progeny of the MGE-like progenitors, particularly BFCNs, contributed to learning and memory. Our findings support the prospect of using human stem cell–derived MGE-like progenitors in developing therapies for neurological disorders of learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2029245949,"Solid tumors often exhibit simultaneously inflammatory and hypoxic microenvironments. The ‘signal transducer and activator of transcription-3’ (STAT3)-mediated inflammatory response and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia response have been independently shown to promote tumorigenesis through the activation of HIF or STAT3 target genes and to be indicative of a poor prognosis in a variety of tumors. We report here for the first time that STAT3 is involved in the HIF1, but not HIF2-mediated hypoxic transcriptional response. We show that inhibiting STAT3 activity in MDA-MB-231 and RCC4 cells by a STAT3 inhibitor or STAT3 small interfering RNA significantly reduces the levels of HIF1, but not HIF2 target genes in spite of normal levels of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α (HIF1α) and HIF2α protein. Mechanistically, STAT3 activates HIF1 target genes by binding to HIF1 target gene promoters, interacting with HIF1α protein and recruiting coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300, and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to form enhanceosome complexes that contain HIF1α, STAT3, CBP, p300 and RNA Pol II on HIF1 target gene promoters. Functionally, the effect of STAT3 knockdown on proliferation, motility and clonogenic survival of tumor cells in vitro is phenocopied by HIF1α knockdown in hypoxic cells, whereas STAT3 knockdown in normoxic cells also reduces cell proliferation, motility and clonogenic survival. This indicates that STAT3 works with HIF1 to activate HIF1 target genes and to drive HIF1-depedent tumorigenesis under hypoxic conditions, but also has HIF-independent activity in normoxic and hypoxic cells. Identifying the role of STAT3 in the hypoxia response provides further data supporting the effectiveness of STAT3 inhibitors in solid tumor treatment owing to their usefulness in inhibiting both the STAT3 and HIF1 pro-tumorigenic signaling pathways in some cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2074671154,"Upregulation of the ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade occurs in >30% of cancers, often through mutational activation of receptor tyrosine kinases or other upstream genes, including KRAS and BRAF. Efforts to target endogenous MAPKs are challenged by the fact that these kinases are required for viability in mammals. Additionally, the effectiveness of new inhibitors of mutant BRAF has been diminished by acquired tumor resistance through selection for BRAF-independent mechanisms of ERK1/2 induction. Furthermore, recently identified ERK1/2-inducing mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2) MAPK genes in melanoma confer resistance to emerging therapeutic MEK inhibitors, underscoring the challenges facing direct kinase inhibition in cancer. MAPK scaffolds, such as IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), assemble pathway kinases to affect signal transmission, and disrupting scaffold function therefore offers an orthogonal approach to MAPK cascade inhibition. Consistent with this, we found a requirement for IQGAP1 in RAS-driven tumorigenesis in mouse and human tissue. In addition, the ERK1/2-binding IQGAP1 WW domain peptide disrupted IQGAP1-ERK1/2 interactions, inhibited RAS- and RAF-driven tumorigenesis, bypassed acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032) and acted as a systemically deliverable therapeutic to significantly increase the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. Scaffold-kinase interaction blockade acts by a mechanism distinct from direct kinase inhibition and may be a strategy to target overactive oncogenic kinase cascades in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1980443290,"Microglia are crucial for the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Peli1 is abundantly expressed in microglia and promotes microglial activation during the course of EAE induction. Peli1 mediates the induction of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in microglia and thereby promotes recruitment of T cells into the central nervous system. The severity of EAE is reduced in Peli1-deficient mice despite their competent induction of inflammatory T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Notably, Peli1 regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway signaling by promoting degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (Traf3), a potent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and gene induction. Ablation of Traf3 restores microglial activation and CNS inflammation after the induction of EAE in Peli1-deficient mice. These findings establish Peli1 as a microglia-specific mediator of autoimmune neuroinflammation and suggest a previously unknown signaling mechanism of Peli1 function."
https://openalex.org/W1998469647,"NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is an aggressive type of squamous cell carcinoma that is defined by the presence of BRD-NUT fusion oncogenes, which encode chimeric proteins that block differentiation and maintain tumor growth. BRD-NUT oncoproteins contain two bromodomains whose binding to acetylated histones is required for the blockade of differentiation in NMC, but the mechanisms by which BRD-NUT act remain uncertain. Here, we provide evidence that MYC is a key downstream target of BRD4-NUT. Expression profiling of NMCs shows that the set of genes whose expression is maintained by BRD4-NUT is highly enriched for MYC upregulated genes, and MYC and BRD4-NUT protein expression is strongly correlated in primary NMCs. More directly, we find that BRD4-NUT associates with the MYC promoter and is required to maintain MYC expression in NMC cell lines. Moreover, both siRNA knockdown of MYC and a dominant-negative form of MYC, omomyc, induce differentiation of NMC cells. Conversely, differentiation of NMC cells induced by knockdown of BRD4-NUT is abrogated by enforced expression of MYC. Together, these findings suggest that MYC is a downstream target of BRD4-NUT that is required for maintenance of NMC cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state. Our findings support a model in which dysregulation of MYC by BRD-NUT fusion proteins has a central role in the pathogenesis of NMC."
https://openalex.org/W2042122795,"Sensory systems exhibit mechanisms of neural adaptation, which adjust neuronal activity on the basis of recent stimulus history. In primary visual cortex (V1) in particular, adaptation controls the responsiveness of individual neurons and shifts their visual selectivity. What benefits does adaptation confer on a neuronal population? We measured adaptation in the responses of populations of cat V1 neurons to stimulus ensembles with markedly different statistics of stimulus orientation. We found that adaptation served two homeostatic goals. First, it maintained equality in the time-averaged responses across the population. Second, it maintained independence in selectivity across the population. Adaptation scaled and distorted population activity according to a simple multiplicative rule that depended on neuronal orientation preference and on stimulus orientation. We conclude that adaptation in V1 acts as a mechanism of homeostasis, enforcing a tendency toward equality and independence in neural activity across the population."
https://openalex.org/W2003001377,"FAT/CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein that facilitates long-chain fatty acid (FA) uptake by cardiomyocytes and adipocytes and uptake of oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) by macrophages. CD36 also mediates FA-induced signaling to increase intracellular calcium in various cell types. The membrane-impermeable sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) ester of oleate (SSO) irreversibly binds CD36 and has been widely used to inhibit CD36-dependent FA uptake and signaling to calcium. The inhibition mechanism and whether SSO modification of CD36 involves the FA-binding site remain unexplored. CHO cells expressing human CD36 were SSO-treated, and the protein was pulled down, deglycosylated, and resolved by electrophoresis. The CD36 band was extracted from the gel and digested for analysis by mass spectrometry. NHS derivatives react with primary or secondary amines on proteins to yield stable amide or imide bonds. Two oleoylated peptides, found only in SSO-treated samples, were identified with high contribution and confidence scores as carrying oleate modification of Lys-164. Lysine 164 lies within a predicted CD36 binding domain for FA and oxLDL. CHO cells expressing CD36 with mutated Lys-164 had impaired CD36 function in FA uptake and FA-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, supporting the importance of Lys-164 for both FA effects. Furthermore, consistent with the importance of Lys-164 for oxLDL binding, SSO inhibited oxLDL uptake by macrophages. In conclusion, SSO accesses Lys-164 in the FA-binding site on CD36, and initial modeling of this site is presented. The data suggest competition between FA and oxLDL for access to the CD36 binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2045808404,"The current model to explain accurate chromosome segregation after DNA replication holds that kinetochore–microtubule attachments exert tension across the centromere and are stabilized by spatial separation from inner centromere-localized Aurora B; here an alternative model is presented, wherein active Aurora B produced by clustering is sufficient to ensure biorientation through a mechanism that is intrinsic to the kinetochore. For chromosome segregation and subsequent cell division to proceed accurately, the chromosomes must be positioned precisely on the spindle microtubules through stable bivalent linkages to the kinetochore. A widely held view is that this process, called biorientation, is ensured because correct kinetochore–microtubule attachments exert tension across the centromere and are stabilized, whereas those that lack tension are destabilized by Aurora B kinase. Here Christopher Campbell and Arshad Desai present data that support an alternative model in which active Aurora B produced by clustering is sufficient to ensure biorientation through a mechanism that is intrinsic to the kinetochore. Accurate segregation of the replicated genome requires chromosome biorientation on the spindle. Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase (Ipl1), a member of the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)1,2. Localization of the CPC to the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures chromosome biorientation: kinetochore–spindle attachments that are not under tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments3,4,5. Here we show that an engineered truncation of the Sli15 (known as INCENP in humans) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the inner-centromere-targeting proteins survivin (Bir1), borealin (Nbl1), Bub1 and Sgo1 (ref. 6). Unlike wild-type Sli15, truncated Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (also known as Cdc28) phosphorylation also suppresses the inviability of Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation."
https://openalex.org/W2003335476,"Liver metastasis is the major cause of death associated to colorectal cancer. Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a non-classical, seven domain, cadherin lacking the conserved cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins. CDH17 was overexpressed in highly metastatic human KM12SM and present in many other colorectal cancer cells. Using tissue microarrays, we observed a significant association between high expression of CDH17 with liver metastasis and poor survival of the patients. On the basis of these findings, we decided to study cellular functions and signaling mechanisms mediated by CDH17 in cancer cells. In this report, loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that CDH17 caused a significant increase in KM12SM cell adhesion and proliferation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an interaction between CDH17 and α2β1 integrin with a direct effect on β1 integrin activation and talin recruitment. The formation of this complex, together with other proteins, was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. CDH17 modulated integrin activation and signaling to induce specific focal adhesion kinase and Ras activation, which led to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase and the increase in cyclin D1 and proliferation. In vivo experiments showed that CDH17 silencing in KM12 cells suppressed tumor growth and liver metastasis after subcutaneous or intrasplenic inoculation in nude mice. Collectively, our data reveal a new function for CDH17, which is to regulate α2β1 integrin signaling in cell adhesion and proliferation in colon cancer cells for liver metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2020717559,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) has a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to better understand the effects of HBx on gene-expression profiles that participate in hepatocarcinogenesis and the mechanism by which HBx regulates these genes. Differentially expressed genes between L02-HBx and L02-Vector control cells were identified by microarray and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. HBx upregulates 456 genes and downregulates 843 genes, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). PDCD4 was downregulated in clinical HCC specimens and the downregulation of PDCD4 in HCC is correlated with HBx. Furthermore, overexpression experiments in HCC cells proved that PDCD4 has strong tumor-suppressive effects both in vitro and in vivo, and may induce cell apoptosis to suppress the development of HCC. HBx induces expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), but failed to change the methylation status of the PDCD4 promoter. HBx downregulates PDCD4 expression at least partially through miR-21. Taken together, this study reported for the first time that HBx downregulates PDCD4 and upregulates miR-21 expression. The overexpression of PDCD4 could suppress tumorigenicity. The deregulation of PDCD4 by HBx through miR-21 represents a potential novel mechanism of the downregulation of PDCD4 in HBV-related HCC and provides new insights into HCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2084044994,"F-box proteins are the substrate-recognition subunits of SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes. Purification of the F-box protein FBXL2 identified the PI(3)K regulatory subunit p85β and tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1 as interacting proteins. FBXL2 interacts with the pool of p85β that is free of p110 PI(3)K catalytic subunits and targets this pool for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. FBXL2-mediated degradation of p85β is dependent on the integrity of its CaaX motif. Whereas most SCF substrates require phosphorylation to interact with their F-box proteins, phosphorylation of p85β on Tyr 655, which is adjacent to the degron, inhibits p85β binding to FBXL2. Dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-655 by PTPL1 stimulates p85β binding to and degradation through FBXL2. Finally, defects in the FBXL2-mediated degradation of p85β inhibit the binding of p110 subunits to IRS1, attenuate the PI(3)K signalling cascade and promote autophagy. We propose that FBXL2 and PTPL1 suppress p85β levels, preventing the inhibition of PI(3)K by an excess of free p85 that could compete with p85-p110 heterodimers for IRS1."
https://openalex.org/W2030124657,"Prevailing models have suggested that grid cell firing in the entorhinal cortex for spatial navigation relies on theta rhythmic inputs from head direction cells. Here, the authors show how head direction cells can skip theta cycles in a regular and organized manner in which two head direction cells will alternate theta skipping in opposing cycles. This so-called theta skipping is dependent on the input from the septum, and these results propose a possible mechanism of spatial computation. High-level cortical systems for spatial navigation, including entorhinal grid cells, critically depend on input from the head direction system. We examined spiking rhythms and modes of synchrony between neurons participating in head direction networks for evidence of internal processing, independent of direct sensory drive, which may be important for grid cell function. We found that head direction networks of rats were segregated into at least two populations of neurons firing on alternate theta cycles (theta cycle skipping) with fixed synchronous or anti-synchronous relationships. Pairs of anti-synchronous theta cycle skipping neurons exhibited larger differences in head direction tuning, with a minimum difference of 40 degrees of head direction. Septal inactivation preserved the head direction signal, but eliminated theta cycle skipping of head direction cells and grid cell spatial periodicity. We propose that internal mechanisms underlying cycle skipping in head direction networks may be critical for downstream spatial computation by grid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049940196,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive human pathogen with a complex lipoteichoic acid (pnLTA) structure. Because the current structural model for pnLTA shows substantial inconsistencies, we reinvestigated purified and, more importantly, O-deacylated pnLTA, which is most suitable for NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization-MS spectrometry. We analyzed pnLTA of nonencapsulated pneumococcal strains D39Δcps and TIGR4Δcps, respectively. The data obtained allowed us to (re)define (i) the position and linkage of the repeating unit, (ii) the putative α-GalpNAc substitution at the ribitiol 5-phosphate (Rib-ol-5-P), and (iii) the length of (i.e. the number of repeating units in) the pnLTA chain.

https://openalex.org/W2126084527,"The signaling molecule adenosine has been implicated in attenuating acute lung injury (ALI). Adenosine signaling is terminated by its uptake through equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). We hypothesized that ENT-dependent adenosine uptake could be targeted to enhance adenosine-mediated lung protection. To address this hypothesis, we exposed mice to high-pressure mechanical ventilation to induce ALI. Initial studies demonstrated time-dependent repression of ENT1 and ENT2 transcript and protein levels during ALI. To examine the contention that ENT repression represents an endogenous adaptive response, we performed functional studies with the ENT inhibitor dipyridamole. Dipyridamole treatment (1 mg/kg; EC50=10 μM) was associated with significant increases in ALI survival time (277 vs. 395 min; P<0.05). Subsequent studies in gene-targeted mice for Ent1 or Ent2 revealed a selective phenotype in Ent2(-/-) mice, including attenuated pulmonary edema and improved gas exchange during ALI in conjunction with elevated adenosine levels in the bronchoalveolar fluid. Furthermore, studies in genetic models for adenosine receptors implicated the A2B adenosine receptor (Adora2b) in mediating ENT-dependent lung protection. Notably, dipyridamole-dependent attenuation of lung inflammation was abolished in mice with alveolar epithelial Adora2b gene deletion. Our newly identified crosstalk pathway between ENT2 and alveolar epithelial Adora2b in lung protection during ALI opens possibilities for combined therapies targeted to this protein set."
https://openalex.org/W2144275228,"Nephrotoxicity severely limits the use of the anticancer drug cisplatin. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We developed novel orally active epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) analogs and investigated their prophylactic effect in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was manifested by increases in blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-β-(d)-glucosaminidase activity, kidney injury molecule 1, and histopathology. EET analogs (10 mg/kg/d) attenuated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing these renal injury markers by 40-80% along with a 50-70% reduction in renal tubular cast formation. This attenuated renal injury is associated with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and ER stress evident from reduction in related biomarkers and in the renal expression of genes involved in these pathways. Moreover, we demonstrated that the attenuated nephrotoxicity correlated with decreased apoptosis that is associated with 50-90% reduction in Bcl-2 protein family mediated proapoptotic signaling, reduced renal caspase-12 expression, and a 50% reduction in renal caspase-3 activity. We further demonstrated in vitro that the protective activity of EET analogs does not compromise the anticancer effects of cisplatin. Collectively, our data provide evidence that EET analogs attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis without affecting the chemotherapeutic effects of cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2043887616,"Formation of the inflammasome, a scaffolding complex that activates caspase-1, is important in numerous diseases. Pyroptotic cell death induced by anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a model for inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation. We discovered 7-desacetoxy-6,7-dehydrogedunin (7DG) in a phenotypic screen as a small molecule that protects macrophages from LT-induced death. Using chemical proteomics, we identified protein kinase R (PKR) as the target of 7DG and show that RNAi knockdown of PKR phenocopies treatment with 7DG. Further, we show that PKR's role in ASC assembly and caspase-1 activation induced by several different inflammasome stimuli is independent of PKR's kinase activity, demonstrating that PKR has a previously uncharacterized role in caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis that is distinct from its reported kinase-dependent roles in apoptosis and inflammasome formation in lipopolysaccharide-primed cells. Remarkably, PKR has different roles in two distinct cell death pathways and has a broad role in inflammasome function relevant in other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2158673001,"The mechanisms through which environmental and dietary factors modulate DNA repair are still unclear but may include dysregulation of gene expression due to altered epigenetic markings. In a mouse model, we investigated the effect of maternal folate depletion during pregnancy and lactation, and high-fat feeding from weaning, on base excision repair (BER) and DNA methylation and expression of selected BER-related genes in the brain of adult offspring. While folate depletion did not affect BER activity of the mothers, BER increased in the offspring at weaning (P=0.052). In the long term, as observed in 6-mo-old offspring, the double insult, i.e., maternal low-folate supply and high-fat feeding from weaning, decreased BER activity significantly in the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and subcortical regions (P≤0.017). This fall in BER activity was associated with small changes in methylation or expression of BER-related genes. Maternal folate depletion led to slightly increased oxidative DNA damage levels in subcortical regions of adult offspring, which may increase sensitivity to oxidative stress and predispose to neurological disorders. In summary, our data suggest that low-folate supply during early life may leave an epigenetic mark that can predispose the offspring to further dietary insults, causing adverse effects during adult life."
https://openalex.org/W1966102221,"Adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae is directly mediated by interactions of adhesins with eukaryotic cellular receptors or indirectly by exploiting matrix and serum proteins as molecular bridges. Pneumococci engage vitronectin, the human adhesive glycoprotein and complement inhibitor, to facilitate attachment to epithelial cells of the mucosal cavity, thereby modulating host cell signaling. In this study, we identified PspC as a vitronectin-binding protein interacting with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of vitronectin. PspC is a multifunctional surface-exposed choline-binding protein displaying various adhesive properties. Vitronectin binding required the R domains in the mature PspC protein, which are also essential for the interaction with the ectodomain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and secretory IgA. Consequently, secretory IgA competitively inhibited binding of vitronectin to purified PspC and to PspC-expressing pneumococci. In contrast, Factor H, which binds to the N-terminal part of mature PspC molecules, did not interfere with the PspC-vitronectin interaction. Using a series of vitronectin peptides, the C-terminal heparin-binding domain was shown to be essential for the interaction of soluble vitronectin with PspC. Binding experiments with immobilized vitronectin suggested a region N-terminal to the identified heparin-binding domain as an additional binding region for PspC, suggesting that soluble, immobilized, as well as cellularly bound vitronectin possesses different conformations. Finally, vitronectin bound to PspC was functionally active and inhibited the deposition of the terminal complement complex. In conclusion, this study identifies and characterizes (on the molecular level) the interaction between the pneumococcal adhesin PspC and the human glycoprotein vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1999175291,"The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations mediates colorectal cancer (CRC) formation by deregulating key signaling pathways in cancer cells. In CRC, one of the most commonly inactivated signaling pathways is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is often inactivated by mutations of TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2). Another commonly deregulated pathway in CRC is the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is an important negative regulator of PI3K-AKT signaling and is silenced in ∼30% of CRC. The combination of TGFBR2 inactivation and loss of PTEN is particularly common in microsatellite-unstable CRCs. Consequently, we determined in vivo if deregulation of these two pathways cooperates to affect CRC formation by analyzing tumors arising in mice that lack Tgfbr2 and/or Pten specifically in the intestinal epithelium. We found that lack of Tgfbr2 (Tgfbr2IEKO) alone is not sufficient for intestinal tumor formation and lack of Pten (PtenIEKO) alone had a weak effect on intestinal tumor induction. However, the combination of Tgfbr2 inactivation with Pten loss (PtenIEKO;Tgfbr2IEKO) led to malignant tumors in both the small intestine and colon in 86% of the mice and to metastases in 8% of the tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, these tumors arose via a β-catenin-independent mechanism. Inactivation of TGF-β signaling and loss of Pten in the tumors led to increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Thus, inactivation of TGF-β signaling and loss of PTEN cooperate to drive intestinal cancer formation and progression by suppressing cell cycle inhibitors."

KS is characterized by neovascularization and spindle cell proliferation. The interaction between HIV-1 and KSHV has a central role in promoting the aggressive manifestations of KS in AIDS patients; however, the pathogenesis underlying AIDS-related KS (AIDS–KS) remains unknown. Herein, we examined the potential of HIV-1 negative factor (Nef) to impact KSHV viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6)-induced angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. In vitro experiments showed that exogenous Nef penetrated vIL-6-expressing endothelial cells. Both internalized and ectopic expression of Nef in endothelial cells and fibroblasts synergized with vIL-6 to promote vascular tube formation and cell proliferation. Using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, we demonstrated that Nef synergistically promotes vIL-6-induced angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Animal experiments further showed that Nef facilitates vIL-6-induced angiogenesis and tumor formation in athymic nu/nu mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that Nef synergizes with vIL-6 to enhance angiogenesis and tumorigenesis by activating the AKT pathway in the CAM model, as well as nude mice. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), significantly impaired the ability of Nef to promote vIL-6-induced tumorigenesis in an allograft model of nude mice. Our data provide first-line evidence that Nef may contribute to the pathogenesis underlying AIDS–KS in synergy with vIL-6. These novel findings also suggest that targeting the PI3K/AKT signal may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach in AIDS–KS patients."

Plant phytochromes display an additional thermal conversion route from the physiologically active Pfr to Pr. The same reaction pattern is found in prototypical biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochromes in contrast to the reverse thermal transformation in bathy bacteriophytochromes. However, the molecular origin of the different thermal stabilities of the Pfr states in prototypical and bathy bacteriophytochromes is not known. We analyzed the structures of the chromophore binding pockets in the Pfr states of various bathy and prototypical biliverdin-binding phytochromes using a combined spectroscopic-theoretical approach. For the Pfr state of the bathy phytochrome from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the very good agreement between calculated and experimental Raman spectra of the biliverdin cofactor is in line with important conclusions of previous crystallographic analyses, particularly the ZZEssa configuration of the chromophore and its mode of covalent attachment to the protein. The highly homogeneous chromophore conformation seems to be a unique property of the Pfr states of bathy phytochromes. This is in sharp contrast to the Pfr states of prototypical phytochromes that display conformational equilibria between two sub-states exhibiting small structural differences at the terminal methine bridges A-B and C-D. These differences may mainly root in the interactions of the cofactor with the highly conserved Asp-194 that occur via its carboxylate function in bathy phytochromes. The weaker interactions via the carbonyl function in prototypical phytochromes may lead to a higher structural flexibility of the chromophore pocket opening a reaction channel for the thermal (ZZE → ZZZ) Pfr to Pr back-conversion."

https://openalex.org/W2135121818,"Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3 plays a critical role in suppressing tumor growth, in part, by increasing the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1, and Foxo3 deficiency in mice results in marked colonic epithelial proliferation. Here, we show in Foxo3-deficient colonic epithelial cells a striking increase in intracytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs), a dynamic organelle recently observed in human tumor tissue. Although the regulation and function of LDs in non-adipocytes is unclear, we hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effect of FOXO3 was dependent on lowering LD density, thus decreasing fuel energy in both normal and colon cancer cells. In mouse colonic tumors, we found an increased expression of LD coat protein PLIN2 compared with normal colonic epithelial cells. Stimulation of LD density in human colon cancer cells led to a PI3K-dependent loss of FOXO3 and a decrease in the negative regulator of lipid metabolism in Sirtuin6 (SIRT6). Foxo3 deficiency also led to a decrease in SIRT6, revealing the existence of LD and FOXO3 feedback regulation in colonic cells. In parallel, LD-dependent loss of FOXO3 led to its dissociation from the promoter and decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1. Stimulation of LD density promoted proliferation in colon cancer cells, whereas silencing PLIN2 or overexpression of FOXO3 inhibited proliferation. Taken together, FOXO3 and LDs might serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2093199757,"Altered androgen-receptor (AR) expression and/or constitutively active AR are commonly associated with prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Targeting AR remains a focal point for designing new strategy of PCa therapy. Here, we have shown that DAB2IP, a novel tumor suppressor in PCa, can inhibit AR-mediated cell growth and gene activation in PCa cells via distinct mechanisms. DAB2IP inhibits the genomic pathway by preventing AR nuclear translocation or phosphorylation and suppresses the non-genomic pathway via its unique functional domain to inactivate c-Src. Also, DAB2IP is capable of suppressing AR activation in an androgen-independent manner. In addition, DAB2IP can inhibit several AR splice variants showing constitutive activity in PCa cells. In DAB2IP−/− mice, the prostate gland exhibits hyperplastic epithelia, in which AR becomes more active. Consistently, DAB2IP expression inversely correlates with AR activation status particularly in recurrent or metastatic PCa patients. Taken together, DAB2IP is a unique intrinsic AR modulator in normal cells, and likely can be further developed into a therapeutic agent for PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2155782265,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. BLT2, a low-affinity LTB4 receptor, is activated by LTB4 and 12(S)-hydroxyheptadeca-5Z,8E,10E -trienoic acid (12-HHT). Although the high-affinity LTB4 receptor BLT1 has been shown to exert proinflammatory roles, the role of BLT2 in allergic inflammation has not been clarified. To study the function of BLT2 in development of asthma, we used mice model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway disease. The 12-HHT levels were elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of OVA-sensitized/challenged wild-type mice. BLT2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced eosinophilia in BAL fluids after OVA exposure. Interleukin (IL)-13 levels in BAL fluids and IL-13-producing CD4+ T cells in the lungs were elevated in BLT2-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice, whereas the levels of IL-4, IL-5, and interferon (IFN)-γ in BAL fluids and serum OVA-specific IgE were comparable. Transfection of BLT2-specific small interfering RNA enhanced IL-13 production in CD4+ T cells in vitro. Expression of BLT2 mRNA in CD4+ T cells was significantly reduced in patients with asthma compared to healthy control subjects. These findings indicate that BLT2 has a protective role in allergic airway inflammation and that diminished BLT2 expression in CD4+ T cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma.—Matsunaga, Y., Fukuyama, S., Okuno, T., Sasaki, F., Matsunobu, T., Asai, Y., Matsumoto, K., Saeki, K., Oike, M., Sadamura, Y., Machida, K., Nakanishi, Y., Kubo, M., Yokomizo, T., Inoue, H., Leukotriene B4 receptor BLT2 negatively regulates allergic airway eosinophilia.

https://openalex.org/W2070504952,"Homologous recombination (HR), a mechanism to accurately repair DNA in normal cells, is deregulated in cancer. Elevated/deregulated HR is implicated in genomic instability and telomere maintenance, which are critical lifelines of cancer cells. We have previously shown that HR activity is elevated and significantly contributes to genomic instability in Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma (BAC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate therapeutic potential of HR inhibition, alone and in combination with telomerase inhibition, in BAC. We demonstrate that telomerase inhibition in BAC cells increases HR activity, RAD51 expression, and association of RAD51 to telomeres. Suppression of HR leads to shorter telomeres as well as markedly reduced genomic instability in BAC cells over time. Combination of HR suppression (whether transgenic or chemical) with telomerase inhibition, causes a significant increase in telomere attrition and apoptotic death in all BAC cell lines tested, relative to either treatment alone. A subset of treated cells also stain positive for β-galactosidase, indicating senescence. The combined treatment is also associated with decline in S-phase and a strong G2/M arrest, indicating massive telomere attrition. In a subcutaneous tumor model, the combined treatment resulted in the smallest tumors, which were even smaller (P=0.001) than those that resulted from either treatment alone. Even the tumors removed from these mice had significantly reduced telomeres and evidence of apoptosis. We therefore conclude that although telomeres are elongated by telomerase, elevated RAD51/HR assist in their maintenance/stabilization in BAC cells. Telomerase inhibitor prevents telomere elongation but induces RAD51/HR, which contributes to telomere maintenance/stabilization and prevention of apoptosis, reducing the efficacy of treatment. Combining HR inhibition with telomerase renders telomeres more vulnerable to degradation and significantly increases/expedites their attrition, leading to apoptosis. We therefore demonstrate that a therapy targeting HR and telomerase has the potential to prevent both tumor growth and genomic evolution in BAC."
https://openalex.org/W2082029782,"Protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) can activate both pro- and anti-tumorigenic signaling depending upon cellular context. Here, we investigated the role of PKCα in lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Gene expression data sets revealed that primary human non-small lung cancers (NSCLC) express significantly decreased PKCα levels, indicating that loss of PKCα expression is a recurrent event in NSCLC. We evaluated the functional relevance of PKCα loss during lung tumorigenesis in three murine lung adenocarcinoma models (LSL-Kras, LA2-Kras and urethane exposure). Genetic deletion of PKCα resulted in a significant increase in lung tumor number, size, burden and grade, bypass of oncogene-induced senescence, progression from adenoma to carcinoma and a significant decrease in survival in vivo. The tumor promoting effect of PKCα loss was reflected in enhanced Kras-mediated expansion of bronchio-alveolar stem cells (BASCs), putative tumor-initiating cells, both in vitro and in vivo. LSL-Kras/Prkca−/− mice exhibited a decrease in phospho-p38 MAPK in BASCs in vitro and in tumors in vivo, and treatment of LSL-Kras BASCs with a p38 inhibitor resulted in increased colony size indistinguishable from that observed in LSL-Kras/Prkca−/− BASCs. In addition, LSL-Kras/Prkca−/− BASCs exhibited a modest but reproducible increase in TGFβ1 mRNA, and addition of exogenous TGFβ1 to LSL-Kras BASCs results in enhanced growth similar to untreated BASCs from LSL-Kras/Prkca−/− mice. Conversely, a TGFβR1 inhibitor reversed the effects of PKCα loss in LSL-Kras/Prkca−/− BASCs. Finally, we identified the inhibitors of DNA binding (Id) Id1-3 and the Wilm’s Tumor 1 as potential downstream targets of PKCα-dependent tumor suppressor activity in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that PKCα suppresses tumor initiation and progression, at least in part, through a PKCα-p38MAPK-TGFβ signaling axis that regulates tumor cell proliferation and Kras-induced senescence. Our results provide the first direct evidence that PKCα exhibits tumor suppressor activity in the lung in vivo."

In allergic airway inflammation, although a chemokine receptor CCR2 was implicated in mediating monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC) recruitment into the lung, we previously also discovered reduced accumulation of DCs in the inflamed lung in mice deficient in formylpeptide receptor Fpr2 (Fpr2(-/-)). We therefore investigated the role of Fpr2 in the trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs in allergic airway inflammation in cooperation with CCR2. We report that in allergic airway inflammation, CCR2 mediated the recruitment of monocyte-derived DCs to the perivascular region, and Fpr2 was required for further migration of the cells into the bronchiolar area. We additionally found that the bronchoalveolar lavage liquid from mice with airway inflammation contained both the CCR2 ligand CCL2 and an Fpr2 agonist CRAMP. Furthermore, similar to Fpr2(-/-) mice, in the inflamed airway of CRAMP(-/-) mice, DC trafficking into the peribronchiolar areas was diminished. Our study demonstrates that the interaction of CCR2 and Fpr2 with their endogenous ligands sequentially mediates the trafficking of DCs within the inflamed lung."
https://openalex.org/W2031480697,"Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an abundant thiol protein in erythrocytes. It is oxidized readily on exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and provides antioxidant protection by cycling between its reduced and disulfide-bonded forms. To test whether Prx2 oxidation could occur in pathological situations where neutrophils are activated, we exposed human erythrocytes to stimulated neutrophils and measured Prx2 oxidation by immunoblotting of nonreducing gels. With phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus Prx2 dimer increased from <5% to up to 100% depending on neutrophil number and incubation time. Studies with inhibitors and myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils showed that H2O2 generated by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase was responsible. Prx2 oxidation was detected at erythrocyte:neutrophil ratios found in blood and reversed over time as the oxidative burst subsided. Acidotic conditions also increased erythrocyte Prx2 oxidation. In a mouse model of endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide, oxidized Prx2 increased transiently from <1 to 15%, then reverted to baseline by 24 h. No increase was seen in mice lacking NADPH oxidase activity. These results indicate that erythrocyte Prx2 scavenges H2O2 produced during inflammation.

The evolutionarily conserved Ser251Pro polymorphism was identified with the ClustalW program. Structure modeling using 3D-JigSaw and the Chimera package revealed that the Pro251 allele disrupts a predicted α-helix in PLIN2. Analyses of macrophages from individuals carrying Ser251Pro variants and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with either of the alleles demonstrated that the Pro251 variant causes increased lipid accumulation and decreased lipolysis. Analysis of LD size distribution in stably transfected cells showed that the minor Pro251 allele resulted in an increased number of small LDs per cell and increased perilipin 3 protein expression levels as compared with cells carrying the major Ser251 allele. Genotyping of 2113 individuals indicated that the Pro251 variant is associated with decreased plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations.

USP7 forms a complex with UbE2E1 in vitro and in vivo through the ASTS USP7 binding motif within its N-terminal extension in an identical manner with other known USP7 binding proteins. We show that USP7 attenuates UbE2E1-mediated ubiquitination, an effect that requires the N-terminal ASTS sequence of UbE2E1 as well as the catalytic activity of USP7. Additionally, USP7 is critical in maintaining the steady state levels of UbE2E1 in cells.

However, whether ACP5 contributes to the metastasis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this paper, a complementary DNA microarray, serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ACP5 is a direct transcriptional target of Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1). ACP5 expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. ACP5 overexpression was correlated with microvascular invasion, poor differentiation and higher tumor-node-metastasis stage. HCC patients with positive ACP5 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative ACP5 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ACP5 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for disease recurrence and reduced-patient survival following curative resection. Transwell assays and an orthotopic metastatic model showed that the upregulation of ACP5 promoted HCC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas ACP5 knockdown inhibited these processes. The knockdown of ACP5 significantly attenuated FoxM1-enhanced invasion and lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACP5 expression was positively correlated with FoxM1 expression in human HCC tissues, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognoses. In summary, ACP5 is a direct transcriptional and functional target of FoxM1. This novel FoxM1/ACP5 signaling pathway promotes HCC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2025092022,"Growth of breast cancers is often dependent on ovarian steroid hormones making the tumors responsive to antagonists of hormone receptors. However, eventually the tumors become hormone independent, raising the need to identify downstream targets for the inhibition of tumor growth. One possibility is to focus on the signaling mechanisms used by ovarian steroid hormones to induce breast cancer cell proliferation. Here we report that the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) could be a potential druggable target. Using the breast cancer cell line T47D, we show that estrogens (E2) and progestins activate MSK1, which forms a complex with the corresponding hormone receptor. Inhibition of MSK1 activity with H89 or its depletion by MSK1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specifically abrogates cell proliferation in response to E2 or progestins without affecting serum-induced cell proliferation. MSK1 activity is required for the transition from the G1- to the S-phase of the cell cycle and inhibition of MSK1 compromises both estradiol- and progestin-dependent induction of cell cycle genes. ChIP-seq experiments identified binding of MSK1 to progesterone receptor-binding sites associated with hormone-responsive genes. MSK1 recruitment to epigenetically defined enhancer regions supports the need of MSK1 as a chromatin remodeler in hormone-dependent regulation of gene transcription. In agreement with this interpretation, expression of a histone H3 mutated at S10 eliminates the hormonal effect on cell proliferation and on induction of relevant target genes. Finally, we show that E2- or progestin-dependent growth of T47D cells xenografted in immunodefficient mice is inhibited by depletion of MSK1, indicating that our findings are not restricted to cultured cells, and that MSK1 plays an important role for hormone-dependent breast cancer growth in a more physiological context."
https://openalex.org/W2140424986,"Bacteriophages, the viruses of eubacteria, have developed unique mechanisms to interact with their host bacteria. They have been viewed as potential antibacterial therapeutics. Mycobacteriophage-derived compounds may interact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and/or its components, such as the cord factor, trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), which is the most abundant glycolipid produced on the surface of MTB. TDM emulsion injected intravenously into mice induces lung immunopathology that mimics many aspects of MTB infection. Thus, TDM is an important target for anti-MTB agent development. On the basis of genomics information of mycobacteriophages, 200 peptides were synthesized. Their effects on MTB, their interactions with TDM, and anti-inflammatory activities were tested. One of them (PK34) showed MTB-killing activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 50 μg/ml and TDM-binding ability. In a mouse model, PK34 showed comparable ability to clear MTB as rifampin did in vivo. It also exerted strong activity to inhibit MTB or TDM-induced inflammation in vivo. PK34 significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokines secretions by inactivating MAPK and PKB signals while it maintained certain proinflammatory cytokine production. It is possible to prospect for TDM-binding and/or anti-MTB peptides by mining the mycobacteriophages genome. In addition to its direct MTB-killing ability, PK34 might be a useful adjunct in the treatment of granulomatous inflammation occurring during mycobacterial infection or a template for developing antituberculosis (TB) agents because of its immunoregulative effects. As a TDM-binding peptide, PK34 may be a promising tool to study TDM's interactions with corresponding receptors and signal pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2018743749,"Nutrient stress that produces quiescence and catabolism in normal cells is lethal to cancer cells, because oncogenic mutations constitutively drive anabolism. One driver of biosynthesis in cancer cells is the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling complex. Activating mTORC1 by deleting its negative regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) leads to hypersensitivity to glucose deprivation. We have previously shown that ceramide kills cells in part by triggering nutrient transporter loss and restricting access to extracellular amino acids and glucose, suggesting that TSC2-deficient cells would be hypersensitive to ceramide. However, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking TSC2 were highly resistant to ceramide-induced death. Consistent with the observation that ceramide limits access to both amino acids and glucose, TSC2−/− MEFs also had a survival advantage when extracellular amino acids and glucose were both reduced. As TSC2−/− MEFs were resistant to nutrient stress despite sustained mTORC1 activity, we assessed whether mTORC1 signaling might be beneficial under these conditions. In low amino acid and glucose medium, and following ceramide-induced nutrient transporter loss, elevated mTORC1 activity significantly enhanced the adaptive upregulation of new transporter proteins for amino acids and glucose. Strikingly, the introduction of oncogenic Ras abrogated the survival advantage of TSC2−/− MEFs upon ceramide treatment most likely by increasing nutrient demand. These results suggest that, in the absence of oncogene-driven biosynthetic demand, mTORC1-dependent translation facilitates the adaptive cellular response to nutrient stress."
https://openalex.org/W1965538713,"ING proteins have an essential role in the control of a variety of cellular functions whose deregulation is associated with tumor formation and dissemination, such as proliferation, apoptosis, senescence or invasion. Accordingly, loss of function of ING proteins is a frequent event in many types of human tumors. In this report, we have studied the function of ING4, a member of the ING family of tumor suppressors, in the context of normal, non-transformed primary fibroblasts. We show that ING4 negatively regulates cell proliferation in this cell type. The antiproliferative action of ING4 requires its ability to recognize chromatin marks, it is p53-dependent at least in part, and it is lost in an ING4 cancer-associated mutant. Gene expression analysis shows that ING4 regulates the expression and release of soluble factors of the chemokine family. The secretory phenotype regulated by ING4 in primary fibroblasts displays a selective paracrine effect on proliferation, fostering the division of tumor cells, while inhibiting division in primary fibroblasts. Consistently, ING4-expressing fibroblasts promoted tumor growth in vivo in co-injection tumorigenesis assays. Collectively, our results show that ING4 not only can regulate the proliferation of primary non-transformed human fibroblasts, but also orchestrates a secretory phenotype in these cells that promotes tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These findings support a critical role for ING4 expression in normal cells in the non-cell-autonomous regulation of tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2093409112,"RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B) was first identified as a metastasis susceptibility gene in breast cancer through its ability to modulate gene expression in a manner that can be used to accurately predict prognosis in breast cancer. However, the mechanism(s) by which RRP1B modulates gene expression is currently unclear. Many RRP1B binding candidates are involved in alternative splicing, a mechanism of gene expression regulation that is increasingly recognized to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis. One such target is SRSF1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1) (SF2/ASF, splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor), an essential splicing regulator that also functions as an oncoprotein. Earlier studies demonstrated that splicing and transcription occur concurrently and are coupled processes. Given that RRP1B regulates transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that RRP1B also regulates the expression of alternative mRNA isoforms through its interaction with SRSF1. Interaction between RRP1B and SRSF1 was verified by coimmunoprecipitation and coimmunofluorescence. Treatment of cells with transcriptional inhibitors significantly increased this interaction, demonstrating that the association of these two proteins is transcriptionally regulated. To assess the role of RRP1B in the regulation of alternative isoform expression, RNA-sequencing data were generated from control and Rrp1b-knockdown cells. Knockdown of Rrp1b induced a significant change in isoform expression in over 600 genes compared with control cell lines. This was verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR using isoform-specific primers. Pathway enrichment analyses identified cell cycle and checkpoint regulation to be those most affected by Rrp1b knockdown. These data suggest that RRP1B suppresses metastatic progression by altering the transcriptome through its interaction with splicing regulators such as SRSF1."
https://openalex.org/W2111732492,"The membrane receptor TCblR/CD320 binds transcobalamin (TC) saturated with vitamin B12 [cobalamin (Cbl)] and mediates cellular uptake of the vitamin. The specificity of TC for Cbl and of the receptor for TC-Cbl ensures efficient uptake of Cbl into cells. The high-affinity interaction of TCblR with TC-Cbl (Ka=10 nM-1) was investigated using deletions and mutations of amino acid sequences in TCblR. Only the extracellular region (aa 32–229) is needed for TC-Cbl binding, but the N-glycosylation sites (N126, N195, and N213) are of no importance for this function. Deleting the cysteine-rich region (aa 95–141) that separates the two low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLR-A) domains does not affect TC-Cbl binding (Ka = 19–24 nM-1). The two LDLR-A domains (aa 54–89 and 132–167) with the negatively charged acidic residues involved in Ca2+ binding are critical determinants of ligand binding. The cytoplasmic tail is apparently crucial for internalization of the ligand. Within this region, the RPL GLL motif and the PDZ binding motifs (QERL/KESL) appear to be involved in initiating and completing the process of ligand internalization. Mutations and deletions of these regions involved in binding and internalization of TC-Cbl are likely to produce the biochemical and clinical phenotype of Cbl deficiency.—Jiang, W., Nakayama, Y., Sequeira, J.

https://openalex.org/W1990189627,"Several Bcl2 family proteins are expressed both as mitochondrial-targeted full-length and as cytosolic truncated alternately spliced isoforms. Recombinantly expressed shorter Bcl2 family isoforms can heterotypically bind to and prevent mitochondrial localization of their full-length analogs, thus suppressing their activity by sequestration. This ""sponge"" role requires 1:1 expression stoichiometry; absent this an alternate role is suggested. Here, RNA sequencing revealed coordinate regulation of BH3-only protein Nix/Bnip3L (Nix) and its alternately spliced soluble form (sNix) in hearts, but relative sNix/Nix expression of ∼1:10. Accordingly, we examined other putative functions of sNix. Although Nix expressed in H9c2 rat myoblasts localized to mitochondria, sNix showed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induced rapid and complete sNix nucleoplasmic translocation concomitant with nuclear translocation of the p65/RelA subunit of NFκB. sNix co-localized and co-precipitated with p65/RelA after TNFα stimulation; TNFα-induced sNix nuclear translocation did not occur in p65/RelA null murine embryonic fibroblasts. ChIP sequencing of TNFα-stimulated H9c2 cells revealed sNix suppression of p65/RelA binding to a subset of weaker DNA binding sites, accounting for its ability to alter gene expression in cultured cells and in vivo mouse hearts. These findings reveal TNFα-stimulated cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of the alternately spliced non-mitochondrial Nix isoform and uncover a role for sNix as a modulator of TNFα/NFκB-stimulated cardiac gene expression. Transcriptional co-regulation of sNix and Nix, combined with sNix posttranslational regulation by TNFα, comprises a previously unknown mechanism for molecular cross-talk between extrinsic death receptor and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathways."
