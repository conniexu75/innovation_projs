https://openalex.org/W2047141391,"Boron, as borate, appears to have a role in partitioning metabolism between the glycolytic and pentose-shunt pathways. This effect results from the association of borate with 6-phosphogluconic acid, forming a virtual substrate that inhibits the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. In the absence of borate, the inhibition of the enzyme is released, and excess phenolic acids are formed. These acids also associate strongly with borate and thus develop an autocatalytic system for production of excess phenolic acids which cause necrosis of tissue and eventual death of the plant."

Both hemoglobins have externally oriented, reactive cysteinyl residues in the A-helix of the beta chain. Hemoglobin Porto Alegre can be designated as α 2 β 2 9 Ser → Cys . The crysteinyl residue of the mouse hemoglobin is at position 13 in the beta chain."

https://openalex.org/W2058164406,"Osmotic and diffusional permeabilities to water have been measured in internally perfused cells of Valonia ventricosa. The osmotic and diffusional permeability coefficients for the protoplast are identical, 2.4 x 10(-4) centimeter per second. Thus, both osmotic and diffusional flows can occur by the same mechanism, that is, by diffusion; and there is no need to postulate the existence of water-filled pores in the membranes of this cell. Supporting evidence for this conclusion is the absence of solvent-solute interactions, that is, ""solvent drag,"" for water, urea, and methanol crossing the protoplast of Valonia."
https://openalex.org/W2038154441,"Symmetric application of indole-3-acetic acid, CO(2), or, to a lesser extent, ethylene can substitute for the contact stimulus in inducing coiling in the tendrils of Marah fabaceus. In the case of auxin, treatment of the apical few millimeters results in strong, permanent coiling throughout the length of the tendril. The speed of the response to CO(2) is comparable to that to tactile stimuli. A possible mechanism for thigmotropism is outlined."

https://openalex.org/W2006327202,"Diploid cells of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe carrying the mating-type allele h(90) are capable of sporulation and copulation. After copulation karyogamy does not always occur. In this case both nuclei will undergo meioses separately (twin meiosis). Asci with eight haploid spores derive from this event. Diploid cells homozygous for the mating-type alleles h(+) or h(-) do not sporulate. However, their nuclei can perform meiosis when they are in a common cytoplasm with a diploid nucleus of compatible mating type."

The protein of red tide (25 to 30 percent, dry basis) supported growth satisfactorily. The essential amino acid composition of the protein closely resembles that of casein, the major protein of milk. As a marine resource, plankton represents a challenge for research."

The spore fraction that is obtained can then be used for genetic analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2061226290,Horizontal borders were deleted progressively from square and circular dot patterns containing disparate forms. Stereoscopic depth and anomalous contour occur in the absence of horizontal borders and the form in depth does not always assume the shape of the dot patterns. The stereoscopic effects depend on a laterally disparate form in the stereogram.

https://openalex.org/W1974546164,A ROLE in replication1–3 has been proposed for the double -stranded RNA isolated after infection of cells with single -stranded RNA viruses4. It is therefore interesting to investigate the structure of this unusual complex in solution.

https://openalex.org/W2090692619,"Magee and Nakamura have reported1 that a pancreozymin and cholecystokinin (PZ/CCK) preparation increased gastric secretion in dogs with a simple gastric fistula. The authors, I am sure, have overlooked previous reports of this finding2,3. Using a commmercial and highly purified preparation of PZ/CCK, ‘Cecekin’ (Vitrum), it was found that doses ranging from 18.75 to 600 U/h increased gastric acid output in dogs with a simple gastric fistula2. These investigations were confirmed in later experiments in which bethanechol (‘Urecholine’) was combined with ‘Cecekin’. In those experiments3, bethanechol plus ‘Cecekin’ produced a greater acid response than bethanechol alone."

https://openalex.org/W1968510097,"A freshwater gastropod, Pachycheilus glaphyrus, responsible for unusual erosion in limestone has been located in southern British Honduras where it is abundant in streams flowing through areas of karst topography. These snails ingest algae that proliferate in solution grooves formed at the fluctuating air-water interface. Rasping action of the radula results in deepening of these grooves and appears to improve the algal habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2011801106,"The data on radiative capture through the giant resonance have led to a model in which the capture is pictured as proceeding through a single broad (and therefore short-lived) state that can be called the giant-resonance state. This state is the one formed directly upon capture of a proton, and hence most of the capture radiation is emitted quickly in the direct-interaction mode. Some of the energy that is contained in the giant-resonance state is shared with the more-complicated states of the compound nucleus (that is, with states having many excited nucleons). This sharing, in turn, gives rise to the fine structure that is observed within the giant-resonance envelope. The constant angular distributions that are observed throughout the giant-resonance region support the single-state picture of the giant resonance."
