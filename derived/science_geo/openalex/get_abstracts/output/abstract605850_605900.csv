https://openalex.org/W2788581379,"After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars, however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy, of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-alpha photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later."
https://openalex.org/W2788168931,"The cosmic radio-frequency spectrum is expected to show a strong absorption signal corresponding to the 21-centimetre-wavelength transition of atomic hydrogen around redshift 20, which arises from Lyman-alpha radiation from some of the earliest stars. By observing this 21-centimetre signal - either its sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio interferometers - we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations. Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable. These results indicate that 21-centimetre cosmology can be used as a dark-matter probe."
https://openalex.org/W2757228964,"Quantum bits based on individual trapped atomic ions constitute a promising technology for building a quantum computer, with all the elementary operations having been achieved with the necessary precision for some error-correction schemes. However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used for generating quantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime, where the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of ions in the trap, giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous proposals for performing gates faster than this natural ""speed limit"" of the trap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser pulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along trajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical phase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust to this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement generation for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single oscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits. The method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields a gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for example, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are possible at the price of higher laser intensity. The method requires only a single amplitude-shaped pulse and one pair of beams derived from a continuous-wave laser, and offers the prospect of combining the unrivalled coherence properties, operation fidelities and optical connectivity of trapped-ion qubits with the sub-microsecond logic speeds usually associated with solid state devices."
https://openalex.org/W2788364872,"Abstract Insufficient growth during childhood is associated with poor health outcomes and an increased risk of death. Between 2000 and 2015, nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight, the core components of child growth failure. Here we show that striking subnational heterogeneity in levels and trends of child growth remains. If current rates of progress are sustained, many areas of Africa will meet the World Health Organization Global Targets 2025 to improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition, but high levels of growth failure will persist across the Sahel. At these rates, much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030. Geospatial estimates of child growth failure provide a baseline for measuring progress as well as a precision public health platform to target interventions to those populations with the greatest need, in order to reduce health disparities and accelerate progress."
https://openalex.org/W2791142934,"Survival biomass production and crop yield are heavily constrained by a wide range of environmental stresses. Several phytohormones among which abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene and salicylic acid (SA) are known to mediate plant responses to these stresses. By contrast, the role of the plant hormone auxin in stress responses remains so far poorly studied. Auxin controls many aspects of plant growth and development, and Auxin Response Factors play a key role in the transcriptional activation or repression of auxin-responsive genes through direct binding to their promoters. As a mean to gain more insight on auxin involvement in a set of biotic and abiotic stress responses in tomato, the present study uncovers the expression pattern of SlARF genes in tomato plants subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses. In silico mining of the RNAseq data available through the public TomExpress web platform, identified several SlARFs as responsive to various pathogen infections induced by bacteria and viruses. Accordingly, sequence analysis revealed that 5’ regulatory regions of these SlARFs are enriched in biotic and abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements. Moreover, quantitative qPCR expression analysis revealed that many SlARFs were differentially expressed in tomato leaves and roots under salt, drought and flooding stress conditions. Further pointing to the putative role of SlARFs in stress responses, quantitative qPCR expression studies identified some miRNA precursors as potentially involved in the regulation of their SlARF target genes in roots exposed to salt and drought stresses. These data suggest an active regulation of SlARFs at the post-transcriptional level under stress conditions. Based on the substantial change in the transcript accumulation of several SlARF genes, the data presented in this work strongly support the involvement of auxin in stress responses thus enabling to identify a set of candidate SlARFs as potential mediators of biotic and abiotic stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2791051140,"Peripheral intravascular cannula/catheter (PIVC) insertion is a common invasive procedure, but PIVC failure before the end of therapy is unacceptably high. As PIVC failure disrupts treatment and reinsertion can be distressing for the patient, prevention of PIVC failure is an important patient outcome. Consumer participation in PIVC care to prevent failure is an untapped resource. This study aimed to understand consumers’ PIVC experience; establish aspects of PIVC insertion and care relevant to them; and to compare experiences of adult consumers to adult carers of a child. An international, web-based, cross-sectional survey was distributed via social media inviting adult consumers and adult carers of a child under 18 years who had experienced having a PIVC in the last five years (one survey each for adults and adult carers) to complete a 10-item survey. As such, sampling bias is a limitation and results should be carefully considered in light of this. There were 712 respondents from 25 countries, mainly female (87.1%) and adults (80%). A little over 50% of adults described insertion as moderately painful or worse, with level of insertion difficulty (0–10 scale) identified as moderate (median 4, IQR 1, 7). Adult carers reported significantly more pain during insertion and insertion difficulty (both p < 0.001). Rates of first insertion attempt failure were higher in children compared with adults (89/139 [64%] vs 221/554 [40%]; p < 0.001), and 23% of children required ≥ 4 attempts, compared with 9% of adults (p < 0.0001). Three themes from open-ended question emerged: Significance of safe and consistent PIVC care; Importance of staff training and competence; and Value of communication. The PIVC experience can be painful, stressful and frustrating for consumers. Priorities for clinicians and policy makers should include use of pain relief as standard practice to reduce the pain associated with PIVC insertion and developing strategies to increase first PIVC insertion attempt success particularly for children and older consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2788260970,"Abstract Educational attainment for women of reproductive age is linked to reduced child and maternal mortality, lower fertility and improved reproductive health. Comparable analyses of attainment exist only at the national level, potentially obscuring patterns in subnational inequality. Evidence suggests that wide disparities between urban and rural populations exist, raising questions about where the majority of progress towards the education targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is occurring in African countries. Here we explore within-country inequalities by predicting years of schooling across five by five kilometre grids, generating estimates of average educational attainment by age and sex at subnational levels. Despite marked progress in attainment from 2000 to 2015 across Africa, substantial differences persist between locations and sexes. These differences have widened in many countries, particularly across the Sahel. These high-resolution, comparable estimates improve the ability of decision-makers to plan the precisely targeted interventions that will be necessary to deliver progress during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W2789615619,"Recently, nano-EOR has emerged as a new frontier for improved and enhanced oil recovery (IOR & EOR). Despite their benefits, the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate at reservoir conditions which cause their detachment from the oil/water interface, and are consequently retained rather than transported through a porous medium. Dielectric nanoparticles including ZnO have been proposed to be a good replacement for EOR due to their high melting point and thermal properties. But more importantly, these particles can be polarized under electromagnetic (EM) irradiation, which provides an innovative smart Nano-EOR process denoted as EM-Assisted Nano-EOR. In this study, parameters involved in the oil recovery mechanism under EM waves, such as reducing mobility ratio, lowering interfacial tensions (IFT) and altering wettability were investigated. Two-phase displacement experiments were performed in sandpacks under the water-wet condition at 95°C, with permeability in the range of 265–300 mD. A crude oil from Tapis oil field was employed; while ZnO nanofluids of two different particle sizes (55.7 and 117.1 nm) were prepared using 0.1 wt. % nanoparticles that dispersed into brine (3 wt. % NaCl) along with SDBS as a dispersant. In each flooding scheme, three injection sequential scenarios have been conducted: (i) brine flooding as a secondary process, (ii) surfactant/nano/EM-assisted nano flooding, and (iii) second brine flooding to flush nanoparticles. Compare with surfactant flooding (2% original oil in place/OOIP) as tertiary recovery, nano flooding almost reaches 8.5–10.2% of OOIP. On the other hand, EM-assisted nano flooding provides an incremental oil recovery of approximately 9–10.4% of OOIP. By evaluating the contact angle and interfacial tension, it was established that the degree of IFT reduction plays a governing role in the oil displacement mechanism via nano-EOR, compare to mobility ratio. These results reveal a promising way to employ water-based ZnO nanofluid for enhanced oil recovery purposes at a relatively high reservoir temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2793652131,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been reported as treatment options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in preclinical models and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This work presents a novel potent and selective BET inhibitor (BI 894999), which has recently entered clinical trials (NCT02516553). In preclinical studies, this compound is highly active in AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and xenografts. HEXIM1 is described as an excellent pharmacodynamic biomarker for target engagement in tumors as well as in blood. Mechanistic studies show that BI 894999 targets super-enhancer-regulated oncogenes and other lineage-specific factors, which are involved in the maintenance of the disease state. BI 894999 is active as monotherapy in AML xenografts, and in addition leads to strongly enhanced antitumor effects in combination with CDK9 inhibitors. This treatment combination results in a marked decrease of global p-Ser2 RNA polymerase II levels and leads to rapid induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of BI 894999 in AML."

https://openalex.org/W2788637286,"Benthic habitat maps, including maps of seabed sediments, have become critical spatial-decision support tools for marine ecological management and conservation. Despite the increasing recognition that environmental variables should be considered at multiple spatial scales, variables used in habitat mapping are often implemented at a single scale. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for using environmental variables at multiple scales for modelling and mapping seabed sediments. Sixteen environmental variables were derived from multibeam echosounder data collected near Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut, Canada at eight spatial scales ranging from 5 to 275 m, and were tested as predictor variables for modelling seabed sediment distributions. Using grain size data obtained from grab samples, we tested which scales of each predictor variable contributed most to sediment models. Results showed that the default scale was often not the best. Out of 129 potential scale-dependent variables, 11 were selected to model the additive log-ratio of mud and sand at five different scales, and 15 were selected to model the additive log-ratio of gravel and sand, also at five different scales. Boosted Regression Tree models that explained between 46.4 and 56.3% of statistical deviance produced multiscale predictions of mud, sand, and gravel that were correlated with cross-validated test data (Spearman’s ρmud = 0.77, ρsand = 0.71, ρgravel = 0.58). Predictions of individual size fractions were classified to produce a map of seabed sediments that is useful for marine spatial planning. Based on the scale-dependence of variables in this study, we concluded that spatial scale consideration is at least as important as variable selection in seabed mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2790288219,"Objective To determine the prevalence, sleep characteristics, and comorbidities associated with a high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the Korean adult population. Methods We analyzed data from 2,740 subjects who responded to a nationwide questionnaire survey of sleep characteristics. Those who qualified under two or more symptom categories of the Berlin questionnaire were defined as “at high risk for OSA”. We investigated their socio-demographic information, sleep habits, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors and consequences significantly associated with a high risk for OSA. Results The prevalence of a high risk for OSA was 15.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5–17.2%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that old age (≥ 70 years, odds ratio [OR] 2.68) and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 (OR 10.75) were significantly related with a high risk for OSA, whereas regular physical activity (OR 0.70) had a protective effect. Subjective sleep characteristics associated with a high risk for OSA were perceived insufficient sleep (OR 1.49), excessive daytime sleepiness (OR 1.88), and insomnia (OR 3.70). In addition, hypertension (OR 5.83), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.54), hyperlipidemia (OR 2.85), and anxiety (OR 1.63) were comorbid conditions independently associated with a high risk for OSA. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the prevalence of a high risk for OSA in a nationwide representative sample of the Korean adult population. These findings elucidate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of those at high risk for OSA."
https://openalex.org/W2790614587,"Resolution of acute inflammation is governed, in part, by lipid mediator class switching from proin flammatory eicosanoids to specialized proresolving mediators, including a recently identified new pathway of mediators, termed maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTR), which includes MCTR1, MCTR2, and MCTR3. Here, we addressed whether each MCTR can impact the known vascular actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Leukotriene D4 (LTD4; 1.5 nmol/mouse) initiated vascular leakage in mouse cremaster vessels, which was reduced (>75%) by MCTR1 and MCTR2 (0.15 nmol each). With isolated Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt) primordial hearts, LTD4 (1–100 nM) induced negative inotropic action and lowered heartbeats 20–30%. Each MCTR (1–100 nM) prevented LTD4-reduced heart rates. With human cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1 (CysLT1) expressed in CHO cells, each MCTR (10–100 nM) significantly reduced LTD4-initiated signaling. To assess the contribution of CysLT1 in the proresolving actions of MCTR, we carried out human macrophage (MΦ) phagocytosis. Each MCTR (0.1–10 nM) stimulated human MΦ phagocytosis of live Escherichia coli, whereas LTD4 did not stimulate phagocytosis. MCTR-activated phagocytosis was significantly blocked by a pharmacologic receptor antagonist (MK571). With both CHO-CysLT1 and human MΦs, each MCTR competed for specific [3H]-LTD4 binding with apparent lower affinity than LTD4. Thus, each MCTR functionally interacts with human CysLT1 to pharmacologically counter-regulate vascular responses and stimulate physiologic phagocytosis with MΦs.—Chiang, N., Riley, I.

https://openalex.org/W2794074673,"Objective Gout patients have a high burden of co-morbid conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We sought to evaluate the association between changes in serum uric acid (SUA) levels over time and the risk of incident DM, CVD, and renal function decline in gout patients. Methods An observational cohort study was conducted among enrollees of private health insurance programs in the US between 2004 and 2015. Gout patients were included on the index date of a SUA measurement ≥6.8 mg/dl. The exposure of interest was cumulative change in SUA levels from baseline. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident DM, incident CVD, and renal function decline (≥30% reduction in glomerular filtration rate) were derived using marginal structural models with stabilized inverse probability weights accounting for baseline confounders (age, gender, co-morbidities, co-medications) and time-varying confounders (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glycated hemoglobin). Results Among 26,341 patients with gout, the average age was 62, 75% were men, and the median baseline SUA was 8.6 mg/dl (interquartile range 7.7 to 9.5). The incidence rates/100 person-years (95% CI) were 1.63 (1.51–1.75) for DM, 0.77 (0.70–0.84) for CVD, and 4.32 (4.14–4.49) for renal function decline. The adjusted HR (95% CI) per 3 mg/dl reduction in SUA, corresponding on average to achieving the target level of <6 mg/dl in this population, was 1.04 (0.92–1.17) for DM, 1.07 (0.89–1.29) for CVD, and 0.85 (0.78–0.92) for renal function decline. Conclusions Reduction in SUA in patients with gout may be associated with a reduced risk of renal function decline, but not with DM or CVD."

However, the mechanism by which CgYapsins modulate immune response and facilitate survival in the mammalian host remains to be identified. Here, using RNA-Seq analysis, we report that genes involved in cell wall metabolism are differentially regulated in the Cgyps1–11Δ mutant. Consistently, the mutant contained lower β-glucan and mannan levels and exhibited increased chitin content in the cell wall. As cell wall components are known to regulate the innate immune response, we next determined the macrophage transcriptional response to C. glabrata infection and observed differential expression of genes implicated in inflammation, chemotaxis, ion transport, and the tumor necrosis factor signaling cascade. Importantly, the Cgyps1–11Δ mutant evoked a different immune response, resulting in an enhanced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in THP-1 macrophages. Further, Cgyps1–11Δ–induced IL-1β production adversely affected intracellular proliferation of co-infected WT cells and depended on activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signaling in the host cells. Accordingly, the Syk inhibitor R406 augmented intracellular survival of the Cgyps1–11Δ mutant. Finally, we demonstrate that C. glabrata infection triggers elevated IL-1β production in mouse organs and that the CgYPS genes are required for organ colonization and dissemination in the murine model of systemic infection. Altogether, our results uncover the basis for macrophage-mediated killing of Cgyps1–11Δ cells and provide the first evidence that aspartyl proteases in C. glabrata are required for suppression of IL-1β production in macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2789017021,"Background Italian pediatric antimicrobial prescription rates are among the highest in Europe. As a first step in an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program, we implemented a Clinical Pathway (CP) for Community Acquired Pneumonia with the aim of decreasing overall prescription of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum. Materials and methods The CP was implemented on 10/01/2015. We collected antibiotic prescribing and outcomes data from children aged 3 months-15 years diagnosed with CAP from 10/15/2014 to 04/15/2015 (pre-intervention period) and from 10/15/2015 to 04/15/2016 (post-intervention period). We assessed antibiotic prescription differences pre- and post-CP, including rates, breadth of spectrum, and duration of therapy. We also compared length of hospital stay for inpatients and treatment failure for inpatients and outpatients. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare quantitative outcomes. Results 120 pre- and 86 post-intervention clinic visits were identified with a diagnosis of CAP. In outpatients, we observed a decrease in broad-spectrum regimens (50% pre-CP vs. 26.8% post-CP, p = 0.02), in particular macrolides, and an increase in narrow-spectrum (amoxicillin) post-CP. Post-CP children received fewer antibiotic courses (median DOT from 10 pre-CP to 8 post-CP, p<0.0001) for fewer days (median LOT from 10 pre-CP to 8 post-CP, p<0.0001) than their pre-CP counterparts. Physicians prescribed narrow-spectrum monotherapy more frequently than broad-spectrum combination therapy (DOT/LOT ratio 1.157 pre-CP vs. 1.065 post-CP). No difference in treatment failure was reported before and after implementation (2.3% pre-CP vs. 11.8% post-CP, p = 0.29). Among inpatients we also noted a decrease in broad-spectrum regimens (100% pre-CP vs. 66.7% post-CP, p = 0.02) and the introduction of narrow-spectrum regimens (0% pre-CP vs. 33.3% post-CP, p = 0.02) post-CP. Hospitalized patients received fewer antibiotic courses post-CP (median DOT from 18.5 pre-CP to 10 post-CP, p = 0.004), while there was no statistical difference in length of therapy (median LOT from 11 pre-CP to 10 post-CP, p = 0.06). Days of broad spectrum therapy were notably lower post-CP (median bsDOT from 17 pre-CP to 4.5 post-CP, p <0.0001). No difference in treatment failure was reported before and after CP implementation (16.7% pre-CP vs. 15.4% post-CP, p = 1). Conclusions Introduction of a CP for CAP in a Pediatric Emergency Department led to reduction of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions, of combination therapy and of duration of treatment both for outpatients and inpatients."

One important bacterial zinc transporter is AdcA, and most bacteria possess AdcA homologs that are single-domain small proteins due to better efficiency of protein biogenesis. However, a double-domain AdcA with two zinc-binding sites is significantly overrepresented in Streptococcus species, many of which are major human pathogens. Using molecular simulation and experimental validations of AdcA from Streptococcus pyogenes, we found here that the two AdcA domains sequentially stabilize the structure upon zinc binding, indicating an organization required for both increased zinc affinity and transfer speed. This structural organization appears to endow Streptococcus species with distinct advantages in zinc-depleted environments, which would not be achieved by each single AdcA domain alone. This enhanced zinc transport mechanism sheds light on the significance of the evolution of the AdcA domain fusion, provides new insights into double-domain transporter proteins with two binding sites for the same ion, and indicates a potential target of antimicrobial drugs against pathogenic Streptococcus species.

Zinc is an essential trace element for all pathogenic bacteria because many crucial enzymes and transcription factors require zinc to maintain their native structure and biological functionality. It has been shown that zinc homeostasis is essential to invasion and infection by pathogenic bacteria (1Zalewski P.D. Truong-Tran A.Q. Grosser D. Jayaram L. Murgia C. Ruffin R.E.

Zinc directly binds to metalloenzymes or zinc finger proteins and functions as a structural or catalytic element to regulate cellular metabolism and gene expression. It also has an immune function as an anti-inflammatory agent (3Zhou X. Cooper K.L. Sun X. Liu K.J. Hudson L.G. Selective sensitization of zinc finger protein oxidation by reactive oxygen species through arsenic binding.J. Biol.

To colonize in different organs, pathogenic bacteria must adapt to changing metal concentrations in various host microenvironments (5Ma L. Terwilliger A. Maresso A.W.

Therefore, pathogenic bacteria require an efficient zinc import system for survival, especially in hosts.

The ABC system in bacteria is usually composed of a zinc-binding lipoprotein, a membrane permease, and an ATPase. In Gram-positive bacteria, the lipoprotein (e.g. AdcA from S. pyogenes) attached to the cell surface acquires zinc from the environment and interacts with the membrane permease to deliver the zinc ions into the cell via ATPase, which provides energy (12Blindauer C.A.

S. pyogenes is one of the most pathogenic bacteria, causing infectious diseases that can be lethal (13Bessen D.E. Population biology of the human restricted pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes.Infect.

Two membrane-associated lipoproteins, AdcA and Lbp, have been identified as essential zinc uptake systems as the deletion of these two genes resulted in a requirement for zinc and decreased infectivity in a mouse model. Both proteins belong to the metal-binding receptor family as ABC transporters. Most bacterial zinc-uptake proteins contain only one zinc-binding domain. Indeed, the protein Lbp in S. pyogenes and its homologous protein AdcAII in S. pneumoniae are single-domain, zinc-binding proteins whose structures and functions have been intensively investigated (16Lawrence M.C.

AdcA proteins in S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes share 61% homology, and both are predicted to have two zinc-binding domains. In vitro studies indicated higher zinc affinity for the N-terminal domain. The S. pyogenes AdcA double-domain organization is rare among other bacterial genera. Due to the distinct translation and mRNA degradation mechanisms, bacteria synthesize large proteins in a much less efficient manner than do eukaryotes (19Valleriani A. Zhang G. Nagar A. Ignatova Z. Lipowsky R. Length-dependent translation of messenger RNA by ribosomes.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2011; 83 (042903) (21599226)10.1103/PhysRevE.83.042903Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, bacteria tend to maintain proteins as small as possible. Thus, there should be a distinct functional and beneficial role for the double-domain AdcA for zinc uptake in Streptococcus species. In this study, we applied molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation to assess the dynamic structure and functional features of the two domains of Streptococcus AdcA. Based on the computational results, we propose a sequential structural stabilization model for the two fused domains that can conduct an interdomain conformational change when bound to zinc, an exceptional feature that enhances zinc uptake efficiency in zinc-deficient environments as compared with single-domains proteins. We further experimentally validated the predicted features and the double-domain organization that endows Streptococcus with unique survival advantages in zinc-depleted environments. We first constructed the S. pyogenes AdcA structure using homology modeling, taking as templates the most homologous crystal structures of B. subtilis Bsu-YcdH (43.9% sequence identity to the N-terminal domain; Protein Data Bank code 2O1E) and E. coli San-YodA (47.3% sequence identity to the C-terminal domain, Protein Data Bank code 1TXL) (Fig. S1B). The constructed AdcA structure contains the amino acid residues 31–515 (Fig. 1A), which is almost full-length except for the predicted signal peptide (amino acids 1–30; Fig. S1A). The modeled structure gained a discrete optimized potential energy score of −49,727.9, indicating that this structure was approximately at the optimal low-energy state (20Unissa A.N. Sudha S. Selvakumar N. Hassan S. Binding of activated isoniazid with acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Bioinformation. 2011; 7 (22125378): 107-11110.6026/97320630007107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Ramachandran plot indicated that the modeled three-dimensional structure was reasonable (Fig. S1C). Virtual docking analysis suggested a zinc-binding center in the N-terminal domain (His-36, His-122, His-186, and Glu-261) and a zinc-binding center in the C-terminal domain (His-436, His-445, and His-447) (Fig. 1B). The two predicted zinc-binding sites, located in the highly conserved area, were in conformity with the principle of ConSurf evolutionary conservation patterns (21Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf: an algorithmic tool for the identification of functional regions in proteins by surface mapping of phylogenetic information.J. Mol.

To determine the universality of the double-domain organization of AdcA homologs in bacteria, we compared S. pyogenes AdcA against 3,449 completely sequenced bacterial genome sequences in the NCBI database using the Blastx tool. We found 649 proteins with more than 30% homology to AdcA. Among these, 31 proteins were single-domain zinc-binding proteins homologous to the C-terminal domain, 408 proteins contained a single zinc-binding domain homologous to the N-terminal domain, and 210 were double-domain proteins (Fig. 1C). These 210 double-domain proteins belonged to 22 species, 14 of which belonged to Streptococcus, showing a significant overrepresentation of this genus (p = 4.3608 × 10−159 by Fisher exact test). A phylogenic tree constructed based on these species showed that the 14 Streptococcus species evolved in two branches and that the evolutionary distances were maintained below 0.22, indicating that these double-domain zinc-binding proteins were highly conserved in Streptococcus during evolution from the common ancestor as compared with the other species (Fig. 1D). These structural results implied that Streptococcus AdcA possesses a unique ability for zinc uptake. To predict the properties of S. pyogenes AdcA, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) 5The abbreviations used are: MDmolecular dynamicsPAR4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinolTPENN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamineRMSFroot mean square fluctuationRMSDroot mean square displacementRgradius of gyrationITCisothermal titration calorimetrySASAsolvent-accessible surface area. simulations on the homology model. Independent replications of the MD simulation using random initial atomic velocities resulted in similar trajectories. All trajectories reached equilibrated conformation within 5 ns. These timescales are 1–2 orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale for forming any secondary structure. To exclude the formation of new secondary structures, we further performed 300-ns MD simulations for apo-AdcA and Zn2-AdcA, a timescale that is sufficient to represent the conformational change of complex proteins (24Skjaerven L.

Compared with the initial state, there was no obvious change in conformation or hydrogen bonds in the equilibrium state (Fig. S5, A–C). Moreover, the trend of change in secondary structures, caused by binding of the two zinc ions, in MD simulations was consistent with CD spectrum experimental results (Fig. 2C and Table S2). The merged results from the initial structure and the average structure of the equilibrium state are shown in Fig. S5D.

Next, we simulated AdcA structures without zinc atoms (apo-AdcA), with zinc in the N-terminal binding center (Zn-N-AdcA) alone, with zinc in the C-terminal binding center (Zn-C-AdcA) alone, and with zinc in both binding centers (Zn2-AdcA) (Fig. 2A). Trajectories of 40-ns MD simulations revealed the highest root mean square displacement (RMSD) for apo-AdcA, indicating that zinc binding stabilizes the protein structure (Fig. 2B). Indeed, Zn2-AdcA had the lowest RMSD, indicating that it has the highest rigidity among all four forms. This was confirmed by CD spectra (Fig. 2C): the unordered fraction of AdcA was reduced from 19.1 ± 0.14 (apo-AdcA) to 11.2 ± 0.56% (Zn2-AdcA) when saturated by zinc, and the helix fraction slightly increased from 53.2 ± 0.62 to 58.8 ± 0.14% (Table S2). However, the structural rigidity of the two zinc-binding centers deviated remarkably. We calculated the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the zinc-binding residues; a lower RMSF indicates higher rigidity. The four residues of the N-terminal domain (His-36, His-122, His-186, and Glu-261) showed reduced RMSF values after binding zinc, whereas two of the three residues in the C-terminal domain (His-436, His-445, and His-447) showed increased RMSF values (Fig. 2D) (24Skjaerven L. Grant B. Muga A. Teigen K. McCammon J.A. Reuter N. Martinez A. Conformational sampling and nucleotide-dependent transitions of the GroEL subunit probed by unbiased molecular dynamics simulations.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7 (21423709)e100200410.1371/journal.pcbi.1002004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicated that zinc stabilizes only the N-terminal domain and that flexibility of the C-terminal domain is not affected by zinc. This was echoed by the RMSF of all C-α atoms of the two domains (Fig. 2E): 132 of 291 residues (45.5%) in the N-terminal domain showed reduced RMSF after binding zinc, whereas 45 of 194 residues (23.9%) in the C-terminal domain showed reduced RMSF after binding zinc. Moreover, the radius of gyration (Rg) within the period of equilibrium also suggested a more flexible structure of Zn-C-AdcA, Zn-N-AdcA, and Zn2-AdcA compared with apo-AdcA (Fig. 2, F and G). To further analyze the Rg values between these three curves, we used symbolic aggregate approximation to evaluate the statistical differences in detail (Fig. S6). The major goal of the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm is to convert time-series data to a symbolic representation, e.g. a < b < c < d. Then, the mean value of each section is calculated (26Keogh E. Lin J. Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless: implications for previous and future research.Knowl. Inf. Syst. 2005; 8: 154-17710.1007/s10115-004-0172-7Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This method can be used to accurately distinguish differences in the data (27Junejo I.N. Aghbari Z.A. Using SAX representation for human action recognition.J. Vis. Commun. Image Represent. 2012; 23: 853-86110.1016/j.jvcir.2012.05.001Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Georgoulas G. Karvelis P.

Signal Process. 2015; 60–61: 220-24210.1016/j.ymssp.2015.01.033Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The strings, converted from the Rg values of Zn-C-AdcA, Zn-N-AdcA, and Zn2-AdcA, were shown as dcbbcbcb, cbacbabc, and cbaabaab, respectively (Fig. S6). Thus, the Rg of Zn-C-AdcA was considerably greater than that of Zn-N-AdcA, and Zn-N-AdcA had a similar Rg compared with Zn2-AdcA (Fig. 2, F and G, and Fig. S6). Therefore, we posit that the N-terminal domain stabilizes the protein structure more than does the C-terminal domain and possesses a higher affinity for zinc. Interestingly, zinc binding in one domain influenced rigidity in the other domain. Zinc binding to the N-terminal domain (Zn-N-AdcA) reduced the RMSF of 18.7% of the residues in the C-terminal domain, and Zn-C-AdcA reduced the RMSF of 12.4% of the residues in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2E). This suggested that the two domains, each with distinct zinc-binding properties, may synergize upon zinc binding, creating new conformational features that do not exist in the single domains. To validate the above mentioned postulations, we mutated key binding residues to alanine to abolish the N-terminal (H36A/H122A/H186A/E261A) or C-terminal (H436A/H445A/H447A) zinc-binding sites while maintaining the full lengths of N-AdcA and C-AdcA. To completely remove the interactions between the two domains, we created an N-lobe (residues 31–321) and a C-lobe (residues 322–515) to mimic the single-domain AdcA that exists in most bacterial species (Fig. 3A). These mutants and the WT AdcA were expressed and purified (Fig. S3, A and B). The inductively coupled plasma MS measurement showed that all the purified proteins did not contain any metal ions. To detect the strength differences of the two binding domains of AdcA, a 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) competition test with Zn2-AdcA was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, PAR could only capture one zinc from Zn2-AdcA under normal conditions, whereas it could capture other zinc atoms only under harsh denaturation conditions, e.g. 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. These results of the competition test showed that the differences in zinc binding strength of the N- and C-terminal domains are significant. We further experimentally determined the zinc-binding affinities of WT and mutant AdcA using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and the calculated values of N, KD, ΔH, and ΔS are shown in Fig. 3, C–G. The KD of the WT AdcA for Zn2+ was measured as 27 ± 7.3 nm, much lower than that of any mutant (Fig. 3C). The independently expressed N-lobe and C-lobe had KD values of 93 ± 8.2 nm and 2.6 ± 0.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 3, F and G), confirming that the N-lobe has higher zinc-binding affinity than does the C-lobe. Moreover, the full-length expressed mutants N-AdcA and C-AdcA had dissociation constants of 390 ± 10.5 nm and 1.1 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 3, D and E). Notably, the independently expressed N-lobe had a stronger binding affinity for Zn2+ than did full-length N-AdcA, implying that the two domains interact with each other, influence each other’s conformation, and thus regulate zinc affinity. Thermodynamic data on enthalpy changes (ΔH) and entropy changes (TΔS) of AdcAs were detected by ITC. For zinc binding, WT AdcA, C-AdcA, N-AdcA, the N-lobe, and the C-lobe were, respectively, found to have ΔH values of −17.6 ± 5.1, −10.2 ± 1.04, −11.4 ± 4.4, −9.9 ± 0.5, and −12.2 ± 1.1 kcal/mol and TΔS values of −7.3 ± 0.7, −2.0 ± 0.3, −2.7 ± 0.4, −0.3 ± 0.07, and −4.5 ± 1.5 kcal/mol. The values of ΔH and TΔS indicated that zinc binding to the five models of AdcA is both enthalpically and entropically favorable with ΔH being the main driving factor. Next, we measured the zinc binding kinetics of AdcA. As expected, N-AdcA, with higher affinity-bound zinc, had very fast kinetics and a two-component reaction (k1 = 45.45 ± 0.07 s−1 and k2 = 0.93 ± 0.02 s−1, A1 = 0.099 ± 0.000 and A2 = 0.161 ± 0.002). In contrast, C-AdcA, with a less rigid structure, bound zinc at a much lower rate and had a second-order reaction. The fast reaction was a minor reaction with an amplitude of A1 = 0.154 ± 0.026 and k1 = 5.02 ± 0.03 s−1, whereas the major reaction had the kinetic parameters A2 = 0.271 ± 0.036 and k2 = 0.15 ± 0.01 s−1 (Fig. 4A). WT AdcA, with two binding centers, revealed a similarly fast process (k1 = 41.05 ± 0.01 s−1) as compared with N-AdcA and a much-accelerated slow process (k2 = 0.75 ± 0.02 s−1) as compared with C-AdcA (Fig. 4A). This indicated that, in the presence of a low concentration of zinc, the N-terminal domain rapidly bound a zinc atom and stabilized the entire protein structure. The C-terminal domain was then stabilized to obtain a faster binding speed. Both the zinc binding velocity and affinity constant of the C-terminal domain are 1 order of magnitude slower and weaker, respectively, than that of the N-terminal domain. To validate the structural stability of the zinc-bound N-terminal domain, we performed proteinase K digestion assays. Zinc-saturated AdcA was almost intact after 30 min of proteinase K digestion, whereas the apo form of AdcA was mostly digested (Fig. 4B). In contrast, C-AdcA was vulnerable to proteinase K attack in both the apo and zinc-bound forms (Fig. 4C) due to the lack of stabilization by the zinc-bound N-terminal domain. This was echoed by the melting temperature of these two proteins. The melting temperature of Zn-C-AdcA was similar to that of WT AdcA and much lower than that of Zn2-AdcA (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the zinc in the N-terminal domain was crucial for enhancing the zinc binding rate in the C-terminal domain. As the C-terminal domain binds zinc with less affinity, it can pass zinc downstream to other zinc-binding proteins that finally transport zinc into the cell. To investigate in detail the structural alterations after zinc binding, we compared the MD simulation trajectories of apo-AdcA, Zn-N-AdcA, and Zn2-AdcA. The mean distance matrix showed remarkably decreased interdomain distances when the N-terminal domain bound a zinc atom (29He Y. Maisuradze G.G. Yin Y. Kachlishvili K. Rackovsky S. Scheraga H.A. Sequence-, structure-, and dynamics-based comparisons of structurally homologous CheY-like proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This can be explained by N-terminal domain stabilization of the C-terminal domain via interatomic interactions of the peptide chains. The mean distance matrix of Zn-N-AdcA showed adjacency of the residue pairs Asn-237 and Lys-460, Glu-235 and Lys-457, Ser-258 and Asp-453, Lys-280 and Asp-453, Lys-280 and Tyr-430, and Asp-273 and Lys-421. All these interactions are interdomain interactions (30Rose A.S. Elgeti M. Zachariae U. Grubmüller H. Hofmann K.P. Scheerer P. Hildebrand P.W.

Moreover, the interdomain surface is linked by at least 10 hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5C, red dashed lines). This multianchored stabilization mechanism explains the stability of the induced conformational change. The induced conformation dramatically decreased the distance among the residues around the zinc-binding pocket of the C-terminal domain (32Timmins A. Saint-André M. de Visser S.P. Understanding how prolyl-4-hydroxylase structure steers a ferryl oxidant toward scission of a strong C-H bond.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139 (28657747): 9855-986610.1021/jacs.7b02839Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), specifically Lys-300 and Glu-481, Glu-299 and Tyr-360, and Lys-354 and Lys-409 (Fig. 5, D and E), facilitating the binding to zinc. This explained the increased affinity of the C-terminal domain when the N-terminal domain was zinc-bound. In summary, these analyses demonstrated the structural basis of the synergy between the two domains for both metal-binding affinity and rate. We showed that the interface interactions rely on 10 hydrogen bonds between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, involving the 12 amino acid residues depicted in Fig. 5C. To evaluate the contributions of the 12 residues to the interface interaction, we successively established 12 single-site mutants of Zn-N-AdcA. However, we found that none of the single-site mutants caused any reduction of the surface formation (Fig. S7). Subsequently, we established four Zn-N-AdcA mutants, mutating groups of the abovementioned residues according to their vicinity: D273A, T276A, and K421A; K280A, S258A, Y430A, D453A, and G452A; E235A, N237A, K460A, and K457A; and a variant mutated for all 12 residues. In the fully mutated protein, only one zinc ion was located in the N-terminal domain of AdcA. The trajectory analyses of the 100-ns MD simulations showed that these mutant proteins took a much longer time (∼20 ns; Fig. 6A) to reach the equilibrium state than did the WT Zn-N-AdcA (∼5 ns; Fig. 2B). Especially the fully mutated protein did not even reach the equilibrium state in 100 ns (Fig. 6A). The result revealed that the 12 residues of the interaction surface are crucial to stabilizing the skeleton of the whole protein. Among the 12 residues, the six residues at positions 273, 276, 280, 430, 452, and 453 showed increased RMSF values after mutation to alanine (Fig. 6B). We next assessed whether the hydrogen bonds stabilized the interaction surface, measuring"

Currently, the most prevalent strategy for PRRSV control remains the prevention of virus transmission, with highly effective therapeutic agents and vaccines still lacking. Proanthocyanidin A2 (PA2) belongs to the family of tea polyphenols, which have been reported to exhibit a range of biological activities including anti-oxidative, cardio-protective, anti-tumoural, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro as well as in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that PA2 exhibits potent anti-viral activity against PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells. Similar inhibitory effects were also found in porcine alveolar macrophages, the primary target cell type of PRRSV infection in pigs in vivo. For traditional type II PRRSV CH-1a strain and high pathogenic GD-XH strain and GD-HD strain, PA2 exhibited broad-spectrum and comparable inhibitory activities in vitro with EC50 ranging from 2.2 to 3.2 μg/ml. Treatment of PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells with PA2 significantly inhibited viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression and progeny virus production in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, PA2 treatment reduced gene expressions of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β and IL-6) induced by PRRSV infection in PAMs. Mechanistically, PA2 inhibited PRRSV replication by targeting multiple pathways including blockade of viral entry and progeny virus release. Altogether, our findings suggest that PA2 has the potential to serve as a novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against PRRSV infection."

Free Xpert testing was offered to all pediatric (0-14 years) presumptive TB cases (both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary) seeking care at public and private health facilities.The current project enrolled 42,238 pediatric presumptive TB cases from April, 2014 to June, 2016. A total of 3,340 (7.91%, CI 7.65-8.17) bacteriologically confirmed TB cases were detected, of which 295 (8.83%, CI 7.9-9.86) were rifampicin-resistant. The level of rifampicin resistance in the project cohort was high. Overall Xpert yielded a high proportion of valid results and TB detection rates were more than three-fold higher than smear microscopy. The project provided same-day testing and early availability of results led to rapid treatment initiation and success rates and very low rates of treatment failure and loss to follow-up.The current project demonstrated the feasibility of rolling out rapid and upfront Xpert testing for pediatric presumptive TB cases through a single Xpert lab per city in an efficient manner. Rapid turnaround testing time facilitated prompt and appropriate treatment initiation. These results suggest that the upfront Xpert assay is a promising solution to address TB diagnosis in children. The high levels of rifampicin resistance detected in presumptive pediatric TB patients tested under the project are a major cause of concern from a public health perspective which underscores the need to further prioritize upfront Xpert access to this vulnerable population."

Methods IPC training was provided to frontline healthcare workers (HCW) in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units, as well as to IPC trainers and IPC supervisors placed in healthcare facilities. Trainings included both didactic and hands-on components, and were assessed using pre-tests, post-tests and practical evaluations. We calculated median percent increase in knowledge. Results From October–December 2014, 20 IPC courses trained 1,625 Guineans: 1,521 HCW, 55 IPC trainers, and 49 IPC supervisors. Median test scores increased 40% (interquartile range [IQR]: 19–86%) among HCW, 15% (IQR: 8–33%) among IPC trainers, and 21% (IQR: 15–30%) among IPC supervisors (all P<0.0001) to post-test scores of 83%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. Conclusions IPC training resulted in clear improvements in knowledge and was feasible in a public health emergency setting. This method of IPC training addressed a high demand among HCW. Valuable lessons were learned to facilitate expansion of IPC training to other prefectures; this model may be considered when responding to other large outbreaks."

There are very little data concerning the prevalence and its associated factors of obesity in non-dialyzed patients who have different stages of CKD. Therefore, in this study, we examined the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors according to the stages of CKD. We used nationwide representative data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was conducted over a 7-year period from 2008 to 2014 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results indicated that: (1) general obesity and abdominal obesity were more prevalent in patients with CKD compared to those without CKD; (2) the prevalence of general obesity and abdominal obesity was highest in stage 2 CKD; (3) stages 3a and 3b were the factors associated with general obesity, and stage 3a was significantly associated with abdominal obesity; (4) the association between general obesity/abdominal obesity and CKD disappeared in people with advanced stage 4/5 CKD; and (5) the presence of comorbidities contributed to the development of both general obesity and abdominal obesity. The findings of this study might support the idea that weight loss is a good potential intervention for the prevention of disease progression in moderate CKD (stage 3), but not severe CKD (stage 4/5)."

Long non-coding RNA SPRY4-IT1 (sprouty4-intron transcript 1) has been reported to play an oncogenic role in various types of human carcinomas. However, the role of SPRY4-IT1 in pancreatic cancer is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the function of SPRY4-IT1 on proliferation and invasion in pancreatic cancer. In the current study, we dissected the function and mechanism of SPRY4-IT1 by multiple approaches including Real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting analysis, MTT assay, Wound healing assay, Transwell assay, and transfection. We found that down-regulation of SPRY4-IT1 inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, SPRY4-IT1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, inhibition of SPRY4-IT1 retarded cell migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression of SPRY4-IT1 enhanced cell growth and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, suppression of SPRY4-IT1 inhibited the expression of Cdc20 in pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings demonstrated that inhibition of SPRY4-IT1 could be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2793802694,"Forty percent of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) show resistant disease to standard chemotherapy (CHOP) in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R). Although many new anti-cancer drugs were developed in the last years, it is unclear which of these drugs can be safely combined to improve standard therapy without antagonizing anti-CD20 efficacy. In this study, we aimed to identify rituximab compatible drug-target combinations for DLBCL. For this, we collected gene expression profiles of 1,804 DLBCL patient samples. Subsequently, we performed a guilt-by-association analysis with MS4A1 (CD20) and prioritized the 500 top-ranked CD20-associated gene probes for drug-target interactions. This analysis showed the well-known genes involved in DLBCL pathobiology, but also revealed several genes that are relatively unknown in DLBCL, such as WEE1 and PARP1. To demonstrate potential clinical relevance of these targets, we confirmed high protein expression of WEE1 and PARP1 in patient samples. Using clinically approved WEE1 and PARP1 inhibiting drugs in combination with rituximab, we demonstrated significantly improved DLBCL cell killing, also in rituximab-insensitive cell lines. In conclusion, as exemplified by WEE1 and PARP1, our CD20-based genome-wide analysis can be used as an approach to identify biological relevant drug-targets that are rituximab compatible and may be implemented in phase 1/2 clinical trials to improve DLBCL treatment."

Here, we show that the periplasmic α-domain of the membrane protein ScsB in the Gram-negative bacterium Proteus mirabilis forms a redox relay with the soluble periplasmic protein PmScsC. We also found that the periplasmic α-domain is sufficient to activate the disulfide isomerase activity of PmScsC. The crystal structure of PmScsBα at a resolution of 1.54 Å revealed that it comprises two structurally similar immunoglobulin-like folds, one of which includes a putative redox-active site with the sequence CXXXC. We confirmed the importance of these cysteine residues for PmScsBα function, and in addition, we engineered cysteine variants that produced a stable complex between PmScsC and PmScsBα. Using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering analyses with contrast variation, we determined a low-resolution structure of the PmScsC–PmScsBα complex. The structural model of this complex suggested that PmScsBα uses both of its immunoglobulin-like folds to interact with PmScsC and revealed that the highly dynamic PmScsC becomes ordered upon PmScsBα binding.

Materials and methods Titanium-40-niobium alloys, mechanically ground or additionally etched and titanium-6-aluminium-4-vanadium were analyzed in combination with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, acetylcholine and nicotine to determine their effects on human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro over 21 days using lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase assays, live cell imaging and immunofluorescence microscopy. Results Cell number of human mesenchymal stem cells of osteoporotic donors was increased after 14 d in presence of ground titanium-40-niobium or titanium-6-aluminium-4-vanadium, together with brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Cell number of human mesenchymal stem cells of non osteoporotic donors increased after 21 d in presence of titanium-6-aluminium-4-vanadium without pharmaceuticals. No significant increase was measured for ground or etched titanium-40-niobium after 21 d. Osteoblast differentiation of osteoporotic donors was significantly higher than in non osteoporotic donors after 21 d in presence of etched, ground titanium-40-niobium or titanium-6-aluminium-4-vanadium accompanied by all pharmaceuticals tested. In presence of all alloys tested brain-derived neurotrophic factor, acetylcholine and nicotine increased differentiation of cells of osteoporotic donors and accelerated it in non osteoporotic donors. Conclusion We conclude that ground titanium-40-niobium and brain-derived neurotrophic factor might be most suitable for subsequent in vivo testing."

Reduced HIV testing may reduce the impact of HIV ""test and treat"" strategies. We aimed to quantify the potential impact of non-disclosure prosecutions on HIV testing and transmission among MSM.MSM attending an HIV and primary care clinic in Toronto completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview questionnaire. HIV-negative participants were asked concern over non-disclosure prosecution altered their likelihood of HIV testing. Responses were characterized using cross-tabulations and bivariate logistic regressions. Flow charts modelled how changes in HIV testing behaviour impacted HIV transmission rates controlling for ART use, condom use and HIV status disclosure.150 HIV-negative MSM were recruited September 2010 to June 2012. 7% (9/124) were less or much less likely to be tested for HIV due to concern over future prosecution. Bivariate regression showed no obvious socio/sexual demographic characteristics associated with decreased willingness of HIV testing to due concern about prosecution. Subsequent models estimated that this 7% reduction in testing could cause an 18.5% increase in community HIV transmission, 73% of which was driven by the failure of HIV-positive but undiagnosed MSM to access care and reduce HIV transmission risk by using ART.Fear of prosecution over HIV non-disclosure was reported to reduce HIV testing willingness by a minority of HIV-negative MSM in Toronto; however, this reduction has the potential to significantly increase HIV transmission at the community level which has important public health implications."
https://openalex.org/W2789678158,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common cause of urinary tract infections. In this study, UPEC strains harboring hemolysin A (HlyA) did not induce programmed cell death pathways by the activation of caspases. Instead, the UPEC pore-forming toxin HlyA triggered an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and manipulated mitochondrial dynamics by causing fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics resulted in severe impairment of mitochondrial functions by loss of membrane potential, increase in reactive oxygen species production, and ATP depletion. Moreover, HlyA caused disruption of plasma membrane integrity that was accompanied by extracellular release of the danger-associated molecules high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and histone 3 (H3). Our results indicate that UPEC induced programmed cell necrosis by irreversibly impairing mitochondrial function. This finding suggests a strategy devised by UPEC at the onset of infection to escape early innate immune response and silently propagate inside host cells.-Lu, Y., Rafiq, A., Zhang, Z., Aslani, F., Fijak, M., Lei, T., Wang, M., Kumar, S., Klug, J., Bergmann, M., Chakraborty, T., Meinhardt, A., Bhushan, S.

Internationally, governments and service providers are often challenged to address complex psychosocial problems. Ideally, the potentially broad range of support activities include a coherent, high-quality mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) programme. We present a theory-driven quantitative analysis of the quality of 40 MHPSS programmes, mostly implemented in European disaster settings. The objective is to measure quality domains recognized as relevant in the literature and to empirically test associations. During the EU project “Operationalizing Psychosocial Support in Crisis” (OPSIC) an evaluation survey was designed and developed for this purpose and completed by 40 MHPSS programme coordinators involved in different mass emergencies and disasters. We analysed the survey data in two steps. Firstly, we used the data to operationalize quality domains of a MHPSS programme, tested constructs and assessed their internal consistency reliability. A total of 26 out of 44 survey items clustered into three of the four domains identified within the theoretical framework: “planning and delivery system” (Cronbach’s alpha 0.82); “general evaluation criteria” (Cronbach’s alpha 0.82); and “essential psychosocial principles” (Cronbach’s alpha 0.75). “Measures and interventions applied”, theoretically a potential fourth domain, could not be confirmed to empirically cluster together. Secondly, several models with associations between domains and measures and interventions were tested and compared. The model with the best fit suggests that in MHPSS programmes with a higher planning and delivery systems score, a larger number of measures and interventions from evidence-informed guidelines are applied. In such programmes, coordinators are more positive about general evaluation criteria and the realization of essential psychosocial principles. Moreover, the analyses showed that some measures and interventions are more likely to be applied in programmes with more evolved planning and delivery systems, yet for most measures and interventions the likelihood of being applied is not linked to planning and delivery system status, nor to coordinator perceptions concerning psychosocial principles and evaluation criteria. Further research is necessary to validate and expand the findings and to learn more about success factors and obstacles for MHPSS programme implementation."

The aim of this study was to assess the aerodynamics in different key-moments of the stroke cycle by Computational Fluid Dynamics. A world-ranked wheelchair sprinter was scanned on the racing wheelchair wearing his competition gear and helmet. The sprinter was scanned in three different positions: (i) catch (hands in the 12h position on the hand-rim); (ii) the release (hands in the 18h position on the hand-rim) and; (iii) recovery phase (hands do not touch the hand-rim and are hyperextended backwards). The simulations were performed at 2.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 6.5 m/s. The mean viscous and pressure drag components, total drag force and effective area were retrieved after running the numerical simulations. The viscous drag ranged from 3.35 N to 2.94 N, pressure drag from 0.38 N to 5.51 N, total drag force from 0.72 N to 8.45 N and effective area from 0.24 to 0.41 m2. The results pointed out that the sprinter was submitted to less drag in the recovery phase, and higher drag in the catch. These findings suggest the importance of keeping an adequate body alignment to avoid an increase in the drag force."

Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) with CMV-specific T cells is a promising therapeutic approach for HSCT recipients, but might be counteracted by CMV’s immune evasion strategies. HLA-C*07:02 is less susceptible to viral immune evasion suggesting HLA-C*07:02-restricted viral epitopes as promising targets for ACT. For a better understanding of HLA-C*07:02-restricted CMV-specific T cells we used recently generated reversible HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 multimers (Streptamers) recognizing a CMV-derived Immediate-Early-1 (IE-1) epitope and analyzed phenotypic and functional T cell characteristics. Initially, we detected very high frequencies of HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 multimer+ T cells (median = 11.35%), as well as robust functional responses after stimulation with IE-1 peptide (IFNγ+; median = 5.02%) in healthy individuals. However, MHC-multimer+ and IFNγ-secreting T cell frequencies showed a relatively weak correlation (r2 = 0.77), which could be attributed to an unexpected contribution of CMV-epitope-independent KIR2DL2/3-binding of HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 multimers. Therefore, we developed a MHC-multimer double-staining approach against a cancer epitope-specific HLA-C*07:02 multimer to identify truly HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 epitope-specific T cells. The frequencies of these truly HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 multimer+ T cells were still high (median = 6.86%) and correlated now strongly (r2 = 0.96) with IFNγ-secretion. Interestingly, HLA-C*07:02/IE-1-restricted T cells contain substantial numbers with a central memory T cell phenotype, indicating high expansion potential e.g. for ACT. In line with that, we developed a clinical enrichment protocol avoiding epitope-independent KIR-binding to make HLA-C*07:02/IE-1-restricted T cells available for ACT. Initial depletion of KIR-expressing CD8+ T cells followed by HLA-C*07:02/IE-1 Streptamer positive selection using paramagnetic labeling techniques allowed to enrich successfully HLA-C*07:02/IE-1-restricted T cells. Such specifically enriched populations of functional HLA-C*07:02/IE-1-restricted T cells with significant central memory T cell content could become a potent source for ACT."

Alterations in ER function can arise from various stimuli such as increased secretory protein synthesis during the differentiation of secretory cells, or diseases that disrupt the function of protein folding pathways.

CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9531536): 982-99510.1101/gad.12.7.982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 15Szegezdi E.

For example, CHOP-mediated up-regulation of GADD34 enhances dephosphorylation of eIF2α, reversing translational attenuation, which further increases the protein-folding burden on the ER (16Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. Feedback inhibition of the unfolded protein response by GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α.J.

Although many studies have uncovered molecules involved in the ER stress–related apoptosis pathway, it is still unclear how the numerous signals from the stressed ER are integrated and how cells decide to activate apoptosis. Here we report a novel role for hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) in cell fate decisions during ER stress. HES1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor (17Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Tomita K. The bHLH gene Hes1 regulates differentiation of multiple cell types.Mol. Cells. 2000; 10 (10774739): 1-710.1007/s10059-000-0001-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As a primary target of the Notch signaling pathway, HES1 regulates cell quiescence and proliferation in the development of multiple organs and cell types (18Kobayashi T. Kageyama R. Expression dynamics and functions of Hes factors in development and diseases.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2014; 110 (25248479): 263-28310.1016/B978-0-12-405943-6.00007-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HES1 mRNA levels have been reported to increase during ER stress in mouse cells (19Szabat M. Kalynyak T.B. Lim G.E. Chu K.Y. Yang Y.H. Asadi A. Gage B.K. Ao Z. Warnock G.L. Piret J.M. Kieffer T.J. Johnson J.D. Musashi expression in β-cells coordinates insulin expression, apoptosis and proliferation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress in diabetes.Cell Death Dis. 2011; 2 (22113197): e23210.1038/cddis.2011.119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of this regulation has not been previously explored. Here we show that HES1 mRNA levels increase in a manner that depends on the ability of PERK to attenuate translation, and affects the survival of cells exposed to chemical inducers of ER stress by repressing GADD34. To measure the response of HES1 to ER stress, we treated Drosophila melanogaster S2, mouse MC3T3-E1, and human HEK293 cells with either dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent that disrupts disulfide bonds, or thapsigargin (Tg), which depletes ER calcium reserves. We then measured relative mRNA levels of fly hairy, or mammalian HES1 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). We found that hairy/HES1 mRNA levels increased during ER stress in all three cell lines (Fig. 1A). To determine which branch of the UPR signaling network is responsible for the up-regulation of hairy/HES1 mRNA during ER stress, we depleted UPR transducers from S2 cells using RNAi, then compared the mRNA levels of hairy in cells treated with and without DTT for 2.5 h (the time of maximal hairy induction in these cells). Depletion of Perk, but not its downstream target Atf4, resulted in loss of hairy mRNA up-regulation (Fig. 1B). To test whether mammalian PERK is necessary for HES1 mRNA up-regulation, we transfected MC3T3-E1 or Hek293 cells with siRNAs targeting either PERK or a negative control sequence (Neg), and induced ER stress with DTT. Induction of HES1 mRNA was significantly blocked by PERK knockdown (Fig. 1, C–E). In contrast to Perk knockdown, depletion of Ire1 in MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in increased induction of the Hes1 mRNA during stress (Fig. 1F). We have not explored the reason for this, but speculate that knockdown of Ire1 may exacerbate ER stress, leading to enhanced PERK signaling and therefore higher Hes1 mRNA levels. Splicing of Xbp1 served as a control for Ire1 knockdown efficiency (Fig. 1G). Depletion of Atf4 did not have significant effects on Hes1 mRNA levels, although it did block induction of its target gene Trib3 as expected (Fig. 1, H and I). These results indicate a conserved effect of PERK, but not ATF4, on HES1 mRNA up-regulation across cells from flies, mice, and humans. PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, as well as other targets such as NRF2 (20Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Nrf2 is a direct PERK substrate and effector of PERK-dependent cell survival.Mol. Cell.

ER stress potentiates insulin resistance through PERK-mediated FOXO phosphorylation.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23431056): 441-44910.1101/gad.201731.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine which aspect of PERK function is important for HES1 mRNA regulation, we used integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB), a small molecule that blocks translational attenuation upon ER stress by inhibiting the downstream effects of eIF2α phosphorylation (23Sidrauski C. Acosta-Alvear D. Khoutorsky A. Vedantham P. Hearn B.R. Li H. Gamache K. Gallagher C.M. Ang K.K. Wilson C. Okreglak V. Ashkenazi A. Hann B. Nader K. Arkin M.R. Renslo A.R. Sonenberg N. Walter P. Pharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memory.Elife. 2013; 2 (23741617)e00498Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). ISRIB reduced HES1 mRNA levels induced by either DTT or Tg treatment in MC3T3-E1 (Fig. 2, A and B) and Hek293 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that the translational attenuation mediated by PERK is important for HES1 regulation. Translational attenuation was also sufficient to increase HES1 mRNA levels, as seen when we treated cells with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 2D). HES1 is known to repress its own expression by directly binding to N-box sequences in its promoter (24Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Structure, chromosomal locus, and promoter analysis of the gene encoding the mouse helix-loop-helix factor HES-1: negative autoregulation through the multiple N box elements.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (7906273): 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HES1 protein and HES1 mRNA are also highly unstable, and thus their levels would potentially be very sensitive to acute changes in translation and transcription (25Hirata H. Yoshiura S. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Harada T. Yoshikawa K. Kageyama R. Oscillatory expression of the bHLH factor Hes1 regulated by a negative feedback loop.Science. 2002; 298 (12399594): 840-84310.1126/science.1074560Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The observation that translation attenuation is both necessary (during ER stress) and sufficient for up-regulation of HES1 mRNA suggested that increased expression of HES1 mRNA may be a direct consequence of the loss of HES1 protein. To address this possibility, we first monitored HES1 protein (Fig. 3, A and B) and mRNA (Fig. 3C) levels over time in Hek293 cells treated with DTT. HES1 protein levels rapidly declined with DTT, then began to recover after ∼2 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast, HES1 mRNA levels increased in the presence of DTT until 2–4 h and then returned to normal levels by 6–8 h (Fig. 3C). We carried out five replicates of these time course experiments. In one of the replicates (circles), the HES1 protein was down-regulated more strongly and for ∼2 h longer (Fig. 3B); in this same replicate, the HES1 mRNA continued its upward trajectory for 2 h longer before returning to baseline (Fig. 3C). These data are consistent with a negative autoregulation model, where the HES1 protein controls expression of its own mRNA. We next asked whether HES1 is released from its own promoter during ER stress (Fig. 3, D and E). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed robust binding of the endogenous HES1 protein to the HES1 promoter in unstressed Hek293 cells (Fig. 3E). We observed a trend where binding of HES1 was reduced after treatment of the cells with DTT for 4 h (p = 0.058, paired t test, n = 5). Taken together, these results support a model where during ER stress, PERK-mediated translational attenuation of HES1 leads to up-regulation of HES1 mRNA through the loss of negative autoregulation. To characterize the role of HES1 during ER stress, we examined the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with either Neg or Hes1 siRNAs. Hes1 knockdown by itself did not significantly affect MC3T3-E1 cell viability in the absence of ER stressors (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, DTT or Tg treatment significantly compromised cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in Hes1-depleted cells as compared with Neg siRNA-transfected cells. To assess whether the reduced viability of Hes1-depleted cells during ER stress results from apoptosis, we labeled cells with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Knockdown of Hes1 increased the percentage of cells that, after DTT treatment, were stained with Annexin V but not with PI, indicative of apoptotic signaling as opposed to necrosis (Fig. 4C). We confirmed this finding in Hek293 cells; depletion of HES1 reduced cell viability upon DTT treatment (Fig. 4D). Severe ER stress triggers cell death through expression of various pro-apoptotic genes (10Tabas I. Ron D. Integrating the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 (21364565): 184-19010.1038/ncb0311-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). We measured the mRNA levels of several of these genes in the presence and absence of ER stress, in control and Hes1-depleted MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5, A–E). Interestingly, expression of Gadd34 mRNA was further increased during ER stress in cells depleted of Hes1 (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with a role for HES1 in repressing the transcription of Gadd34. This effect was conserved in human cells; HES1-depleted Hek293 cells showed elevated levels of GADD34 mRNA (Fig. 5, F and G) and protein (Fig. 5, I–K). Induction of other ER stress–related pro-apoptotic genes in mouse cells, including Chop, Trib3, and Puma, were not affected by Hes1 knockdown. However, CHOP mRNA levels did increase with HES1 knockdown in Hek293 cells (Fig. 5H). The difference between mouse and human cells in terms of HES1 effects on CHOP expression may be explained by the presence of N-box motifs in the promoter of target genes; human CHOP and both mouse and human GADD34 contain N-box motifs within 2 kb upstream of their transcription start sites, whereas mouse Chop does not. To test whether HES1 directly regulates GADD34 through repressing its transcription, we used ChIP as in Fig. 3, D and E. Endogenous HES1 protein was enriched at the GADD34 promoter, consistent with its repressive effects on GADD34 mRNA levels (Fig. 6). This ChIP signal did not vary significantly between untreated and DTT-treated cells, although there was a minor trend toward less binding after DTT treatment (p = 0.085, paired t test, n = 5). To test whether increased expression of GADD34 can explain the ER stress–induced cell death associated with loss of HES1, we compared ER stress sensitivity in cells depleted of HES1, GADD34, and both. Co-depletion of HES1 and GADD34 nearly completely rescued the cell death caused by depletion of HES1 alone in both MC3T3 (Fig. 7, A–C) and Hek293 cells (Fig. 7, D–F). GADD34 is thought to promote cell death by dephosphorylating eIF2α, leading to the recovery of protein synthesis and potentially exacerbating ER stress if activated prematurely (16Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. Feedback inhibition of the unfolded protein response by GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-102210.1083/jcb.153.5.1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 26Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D.

To determine whether phosphorylation of eIF2α was affected in HES1-depleted cells, we compared Neg and HES1 siRNA-transfected Hek293 cells with or without DTT for 4 h, followed by washing out the DTT and allowing cells to recover. We then measured phospho-eIF2α (p-eIF2α) by Western blotting (Fig. 8, A, B, and D). Total eIF2α levels were not affected (Fig. 8C). HES1 knockdown alone led to a small increase in p-eIF2α levels (average 2-fold higher in HES1-depleted cells, p value = 0.03, n = 3; Fig. 8B), suggesting that loss of HES1 causes stress at sublethal levels. However, the p-eIF2α levels after DTT treatment were slightly lower in the HES1 knockdown cells (average 20% lower in HES1-depleted cells, p value = 0.05, n = 3). Notably, the proportional increase in p-eIF2α (in DTT-treated divided by untreated conditions) was lower in the HES1-depleted cells compared with control cells, and this trend continued throughout the recovery period (Fig. 8D). This suggests that when HES1 is depleted, increased GADD34 enhances dephosphorylation of eIF2α during ER stress. In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of HES1 in response to ER stress. Although HES1 has not been previously identified as a regulator of ER protein folding or the secretory pathway, its mRNA levels were up-regulated by ER stress, as a result of PERK activation. We propose that translational attenuation by PERK, coupled with the documented instability of HES1 (25Hirata H. Yoshiura S. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Harada T. Yoshikawa K. Kageyama R. Oscillatory expression of the bHLH factor Hes1 regulated by a negative feedback loop.Science. 2002; 298 (12399594): 840-84310.1126/science.1074560Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), leads to the initial drop in HES1 protein levels during acute ER stress (Fig. 3B). This in turn leads to a relief of transcriptional repression of its own promoter, resulting in an increase in mRNA levels (Fig. 3C), followed by a rise in protein levels. Therefore, although HES1 protein levels do not typically increase above baseline levels during ER stress, this feedback regulation likely contributes to the cells' ability to maintain the correct overall abundance of HES1. The ability to maintain HES1 protein levels during ER stress is important, as its depletion sensitized cells to ER stress–induced apoptosis. This effect appears to be a consequence of the direct regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene GADD34 by HES1: HES1 bound to the GADD34 promoter, HES1 depletion enhanced GADD34 expression in response to ER stress, and depleting cells of GADD34 mitigated the stress-induced apoptosis observed in HES1-depleted cells. HES1 depletion also caused a 2-fold increase in eIF2α phosphorylation in the absence of chemical inducers of ER stress, suggesting that loss of HES1 activates a mild stress response. Overall, we propose that lack of HES1 induces apoptosis during ER stress through a combination of causing low levels of stress and enhancing GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α, thereby reversing the prosurvival effects of PERK. Expression of GADD34 is induced during ER stress by ATF4 and CHOP (27Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Delineation of a negative feedback regulatory loop that controls protein translation during endoplasmic reticulum stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12840028): 34864-3487310.1074/jbc.M301107200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 28Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R.

Because ATF4–CHOP and HES1 are each regulated by PERK but have opposite effects on GADD34 expression, the balance and timing of these components of the UPR may be important in deciding whether cells live or die during ER stress. Interestingly, in human but not mouse cells, HES1 depletion also led to enhanced up-regulation of CHOP mRNA, suggesting that HES1 represses CHOP transcription (Fig. 5H). This regulation would further strengthen the effects of HES1, by repressing both GADD34 and its upstream activator simultaneously, and suppressing the pro-apoptotic effects of CHOP. Like HES1, the zinc finger transcription factor NMP4 has been shown to repress transcription of GADD34 and sensitize cells to ER stress, although it represses transcription even in the absence of stress (29Young S.K. Shao Y. Bidwell J.P. Wek R.C. Nuclear matrix protein 4 is a novel regulator of ribosome biogenesis and controls the unfolded protein response via repression of Gadd34 expression.J. Biol.

HES1, in contrast, did not affect GADD34 expression in the absence of stress (Fig. 5, B and G); HES1 may instead have a specific role in dampening the induction of GADD34 and preventing the premature resumption of protein synthesis. The regulation of HES1 by the UPR, and its effects on GADD34, may extend beyond the acute induction of ER stress studied here. For example, many components of the UPR have been implicated in cancer development (30Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. The role of the unfolded protein response in tumour development: friend or foe?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4 (15573118): 966-97710.1038/nrc1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Cancer cells often show elevated levels of HES1 (31Wang X. Fu Y. Chen X. Ye J. Lü B. Ye F. Lü W. Xie X.

However, it is not clear whether and how mammalian hibernators are resistant to ischemia-induced arrhythmias. The goal of this investigation was to determine the susceptibility of woodchucks ( Marmota monax) to arrhythmias and their mechanisms after coronary artery occlusion at the same room temperature in both winter, the time for hibernation, and summer, when they do not hibernate. By monitoring telemetric electrocardiograms, we found significantly higher arrhythmia scores, calculated as the severity of arrhythmias, with incidence of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and thus sudden cardiac death (SCD) in woodchucks in summer than they had in winter. The level of catalase expression in woodchuck hearts was significantly higher, whereas the level of oxidized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was lower in winter than it was in summer. Ventricular myocytes isolated from woodchucks in winter were more resistant to H2O2-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) compared with myocytes isolated from woodchucks in summer. The EADs were eliminated by inhibiting CaMKII (with KN-93), l-type Ca current (with nifedipine), or late Na+ current (with ranolazine). In woodchucks, in the summer, the arrhythmia score was significantly reduced by overexpression of catalase ( via adenoviral vectors) or the inhibition of CaMKII (with KN-93) in the heart. This study suggests that the heart of the mammalian hibernator is more resistant to ischemia-induced arrhythmias and SCD in winter. Increased antioxidative capacity and reduced CaMKII activity may confer resistance in woodchuck hearts against EADs and arrhythmias during winter. The profound protection conferred by catalase overexpression or CaMKII inhibition in this novel natural animal model may provide insights into clinical directions for therapy of arrhythmias.-Zhao, Z., Kudej, R.

Many of these interactions are poorly characterized. Type IV collagen is abundantly post-translationally modified with 3-hydroxyproline (3-Hyp), but 3-Hyp's biochemical role in type IV collagen's interactions with other proteins is not well established. In this work, we present binding data consistent with a major role of 3-Hyp in interactions of collagen IV with glycoprotein VI and nidogens 1 and 2. The increased binding interaction between type IV collagen without 3-Hyp and glycoprotein VI has been the subject of some controversy, which we sought to explore, whereas the lack of binding of nidogens to type IV collagen without 3-Hyp is novel. Using tandem MS, we show that the putative glycoprotein VI-binding site is 3-Hyp-modified in WT PFHR-9 type IV collagen, but not in PFHR-9 cells in which prolyl-3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) has been knocked out (KO). Moreover, we observed altered 3-Hyp occupancy across many other sites. Using amino acid analysis of type IV collagen from the WT and P3H2 KO cell lines, we confirm that P3H2 is the major, but not the only 3-Hyp-modifying enzyme of type IV collagen. These findings underscore the importance of post-translational modifications of type IV collagen for interactions with other proteins."

To date, only one neuropeptidome of a parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, has been identified. This study aimed to identify more neuropeptides of parasitoid wasps, by using a well-established workflow that was previously adopted for predicting insect neuropeptide sequences. Based on publicly accessible databases, totally 517 neuropeptide precursors from 24 parasitoid wasp species were identified; these included five neuropeptides (CNMamide, FMRFamide-like, ITG-like, ion transport peptide-like and orcokinin B) that were identified for the first time in parasitoid wasps, to our knowledge. Next, these neuropeptides from parasitoid wasps were compared with those from other insect species. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the divergence of AST-CCC within Hymenoptera. Further, the encoding patterns of CAPA/PK family genes were found to be different between Hymenoptera species and other insect species. Some neuropeptides that were not found in some parasitoid superfamilies (e.g., sulfakinin), or considerably divergent between different parasitoid superfamilies (e.g., sNPF) might be related to distinct physiological processes in the parasitoid life. Information of neuropeptide sequences in parasitoid wasps can be useful for better understanding the phylogenetic relationships of Hymenoptera and further elucidating the physiological functions of neuropeptide signaling systems in parasitoid wasps."

Local authorities that are located further North and West, that are more distant from its political centre London and that are more urban tend to have a higher premature mortality rate. Premature mortality also tends to cluster among geographically contiguous and proximate local authorities. We develop a novel analytical research design that relies on spatial pattern recognition to demonstrate that an empirical model that contains only socio-economic variables can eliminate these spatial patterns almost entirely. We demonstrate that socioeconomic factors across local authority districts explain 81 percent of variation in female and 86 percent of variation in male premature mortality in 2012-14. As our findings suggest, policy-makers cannot hope that health policies alone suffice to significantly reduce inequalities in health. Rather, it requires strong efforts to reduce the inequalities in socio-economic factors, or living conditions for short, in order to overcome the spatial disparities in health, of which premature mortality is a clear indication."

https://openalex.org/W2789997000,"The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) likely depend on cortical N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) neurotransmission; however, no previous studies have reported tDCS-mediated modulation of cortical NMDA neurotransmission in humans. The gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR) to a 40 Hz stimulation likely reflects the integrity of cortical NMDA neurotransmission. The present study tested whether the effect of tDCS is reflected in gamma-band ASSRs during a 40 Hz stimulation. Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, we performed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and measured the ASSR in 24 healthy participants during 40 Hz of auditory stimulation after prefrontal tDCS (2 mA) or sham (i.e., placebo) treatment. Our results failed to reveal significant differences in any brain between the two conditions after the application of a frequency of approximately 40 Hz. Based on these results, the ASSR is an insufficient method to detect the effect of tDCS on cortical NMDA neurotransmission. Unexpectedly, the results revealed an enhanced beta-band event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in the left motor cortex after tDCS compared with that observed after the sham stimuli. Given that beta-band oscillations reflect many functions in motor cortices, the tDCS for the frontal areas had some effect on the left motor cortex while the participants were focusing on not pressing the button with their right index finger. An additional study with an adequate psychological task is necessary to draw a conclusion regarding this unexpected result."
https://openalex.org/W2790845537,"As a potent bronchodilator, the anti-inflammatory effects of tiotropium and its interaction with budesonide against cadmium-induced acute pulmonary inflammation were investigated. Compared to values obtained in rats exposed to cadmium, cytological analysis indicated a significant decrease of total cell and neutrophil counts and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in rats pretreated with tiotropium (70μg/15ml or 350μg/15ml). Zymographic tests showed a decrease of MMP-2 activity in BALF in rats pretreated only with high concentration of tiotropium. Histological examination revealed a significant decrease of the severity and extent of inflammatory lung injuries in rats pretreated with both tested concentrations of tiotropium. Though tiotropium (70μg/15ml) or budesonide (250μg/15ml) could not reduce cadmium-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness, their combination significantly decreased bronchial contractile response to methacholine. These two drugs separately decreased the neutrophil number and protein concentration in BALF but no significant interaction was observed when both drugs were combined. Although no inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and MMP-9 was observed in rats pretreated with budesonide alone, the combination with the ineffective dose of tiotropium induced a significant reduction on these parameters. The inhibitory effect of tiotropium on lung injuries was not influenced by budesonide which alone induced a limited action on the severity and extent of inflammatory sites. Our findings show that tiotropium exerts anti-inflammatory effects on cadmium-induced acute neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation. The combination of tiotropium with budesonide inhibits cadmium-induced inflammatory injuries with a synergistic interaction on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and airway hyper-responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2793423019,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a potentially lethal complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). GVHD comprises acute and chronic forms. To date, several approaches to treat acute GVHD or chronic GVHD have been reported. However, there is no literature precedent regarding all-in-one methods to address the 2 GVHD types. Severe inflammation in organs affected by GVHD is highly problematic, and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is known to be detrimentally involved in various inflammatory diseases. Based on the previous reports, we envisaged that there would be a link between GVHD and VAP-1, and we strived to create effective therapies for the 2 types of GVHD using a mouse model of GVHD. Our investigation indicated that expression of VAP-1 was elevated in organs disordered by GVHD. Hence, we subsequently attempted to block VAP-1 by using a novel inhibitor. Our results indicate that systemic injection of the inhibitor prevented aberrant influx of inflammatory cells into tissues and thereby mitigate GVHD-elicited inflammation and fibrosis. Collectively, our study suggests that the increased expression of VAP-1 is detrimentally associated with the development of GVHD and that the blockade of VAP-1 could be a promising medical modality to combat the acute and chronic variants.-Mukai, S., Ogawa, Y., Kawakami, Y., Mashima, Y., Tsubota, K.

https://openalex.org/W2790104321,"Background Observational studies of switching from branded to generic formulations of the same drug substance often lack appropriate comparators for the subjects who switched. Three generic formulations were deemed equivalent to Concerta: an authorized generic (AG) identical except for external packaging, and two other generics (EG). Objective Compare the incidence of a combined endpoint (switching back to Concerta, changing the use of immediate release methylphenidate (MPH), stopping all long-acting methylphenidate, or starting a new medication) among people switched from Concerta to the AG versus the EG. Methods Cohort study from the Truven CCAE database of people aged 6 to 65 diagnosed with ADHD, treated with Concerta, and switched to the EG or to the AG formulation. Results In the EG arm 24.6% and in the AG arm 19.7% of subjects switched back to Concerta. The proportion of subjects meeting the combined endpoint was 39.5% in the EG arm, 32.9% in the AG arm, a crude risk ratio of 1.20 (95% CI 0.94, 1.54). After adjustment by propensity score stratification, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.23 (95% CI 0.90, 1.70). In an unplanned analysis using a different method of adjustment, the adjusted OR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.69, 1.44). Discussion This study did not detect a difference between the proportion of people who met the study endpoint in the two study arms, i.e. between those who switched to a generic formulation that was identical to Concerta except for external packaging and those who switched to the comparison generics. The high incidence of the combined endpoint in the AG arm demonstrates the need for an appropriate comparator in studies of this type. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02730572"
https://openalex.org/W2790118254,"The rise of drug-resistant influenza A virus strains motivates the development of new antiviral drugs, with different structural motifs and substitution. Recently, we explored the use of a bicyclic (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) analogue of sialic acid that was designed to mimic the conformation adopted during enzymatic cleavage within the neuraminidase (NA; sialidase) active site. Given that our first series of compounds were at least four orders of magnitude less active than available drugs, we hypothesized that the new carbon skeleton did not elicit the same interactions as the cyclohexene frameworks used previously. Herein, we tried to address this critical point with the aid of molecular modeling and we proposed new structures with different functionalization, such as the introduction of free ammonium and guanidinium groups and ether side chains other than the 3-pentyl side chain, the characteristic side chain in Oseltamivir. A highly simplified synthetic route was developed, starting from the cyclopropanation of cyclopentenone and followed by an aziridination and further functionalization of the five-member ring. This allowed the efficient preparation of a small library of new bicyclic ligands that were characterized by enzyme inhibition assays against influenza A neuraminidases N1, its H274Y mutant, and N2. The results show that none of the new structural variants synthesized, including those containing guanidinium groups rather than free ammonium ions, displayed activity against influenza A neuraminidases at concentrations less than 2 mM. We conclude that the choice and positioning of functional groups on the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl system still need to be properly tuned for producing complementary interactions within the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2793858835,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a term used to characterize individuals having at least three of the following diseases: obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is widespread, and the number of individuals with MetS is increasing. However, the events leading to the manifestation of MetS are not well-understood. Here, we show that loss of murine ARV1 (mARV1) results in resistance to acquiring diseases associated with MetS. Arv1−/− animals fed a high-fat diet were resistant to diet-induced obesity, had lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and retained glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Livers showed no gross morphological changes, contained lower levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids, and showed fewer signs of NAFLD. Knockout animals had elevated levels of liver farnesol X receptor (FXR) protein and its target, small heterodimer protein (SHP). They also had decreased levels of CYP7α1, CYP8β1, and mature SREBP1 protein, evidence suggesting that liver FXR signaling was activated. Strengthening this hypothesis was the fact that peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor α (PPARα) protein was elevated, along with its target, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Arv1−/− animals excreted more fecal cholesterol, free fatty acids, and bile acids. Their small intestines had 1) changes in bile acid composition, 2) an increase in the level of the intestinal FXR antagonist, tauromuricholic acid, and 3) showed signs of attenuated FXR signaling. Overall, we believe that ARV1 function is deleterious when consuming a high-fat diet. We further hypothesize that ARV1 is critical for initiating events required for the progression of diseases associated with MetS and NAFLD.

https://openalex.org/W2789376350,"Activation of ERK1/2 implies the phosphorylation of tyrosine (pTyr) and threonine (pThr) by MEK1/2; both reactions were thought to be cytoplasmic, promoting ERK to reach the nucleus where it activates several transcription factors. In addition, H2O2 concentrations are known to modulate ERK intracellular translocation, which impacts on cellular proliferation. In this context, the objective of this work was to study the sequence of ERK phosphorylation under two redox conditions and to analyze a putative mitochondrial contribution to this process, in LP07 murine lung cells. A time-course of H2O2 administration was used and ERK phosphorylation was analyzed in cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei. At 1μM H2O2, a proliferative redox stimulus, immunoblot revealed a fast and transient increase in cytosol pTyr and a sustained increase in mitochondrial pTyr content. The detection for pThr/pTyrERK (2pERK) showed in cytosol a marked increase at 5 minutes with a fast dephosphorylation after that time, for both H2O2 concentrations. However, at 50 μM H2O2, an anti-proliferative condition, 2pERK was gradually retained in mitochondria. Interestingly, these results were confirmed by in vivo experiments using mice treated with a highly oxidizing agent [H2O2]. By the use of two ERK2 mutant constructions, where Tyr and Thr were replaced by alanine, we confirmed that 2pERK relied almost completely on pThr183. Confocal microscopy confirmed ERK subcellular distribution dependence on the incidence of cytosolic pTyr and mitochondrial pThr at 1μM H2O2. This work shows for the first time, both in vitro and in vivo, an ERK cycle involving a cross-talk between cytosol and mitochondria phosphorylation events, which may play a significant role in cell cycle progression, proliferation or differentiation under two different redox conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2792976805,"Objective To study the presence of 9p deletion and p16, cyclin D1 and Myc expression and their respective diagnostic and prognostic interest in oligodendrogliomas. Methods We analyzed a retrospective series of 40 consecutive anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (OIII) from a single institution and compared them to a control series of 10 low grade oligodendrogliomas (OII). Automated FISH analysis of chromosome 9p status and immunohistochemistry for p16, cyclin D1 and Myc was performed for all cases and correlated with clinical and histological data, event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Chromosome 9p deletion was observed in 55% of OIII (22/40) but not in OII. Deletion was highly correlated to EFS (median = 29 versus 53 months, p<0.0001) and OS (median = 48 versus 83 months, p<0.0001) in both the total cohort and the OIII population. In 9p non-deleted oligodendrogliomas, p16 hyperexpression correlated with a shorter OS (p = 0.02 in OII and p = 0.0001 in OIII) whereas lack of p16 expression was correlated to a shorter EFS and OS in 9p deleted OIII (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0002 respectively). Expression of Cyclin D1 was significantly higher in OIII (median expression 45% versus 14% for OII, p = 0.0006) and was correlated with MIB-1 expression (p<0.0001), vascular proliferation (p = 0.002), tumor necrosis (p = 0.04) and a shorter EFS in the total cohort (p = 0.05). Hyperexpression of Myc was correlated to grade (median expression 27% in OII versus 35% in OIII, p = 0.03), and to a shorter EFS in 9p non-deleted OIII (p = 0.01). Conclusion Chromosome 9p deletion identifies a subset of OIII with significantly worse prognosis. The combination of 9p status and p16 expression level identifies two distinct OIII populations with divergent prognosis. Hyperexpression of Bcl1 and Myc appears highly linked to anaplasia but the prognostic value is unclear and should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2794099843,"Acquisition of numerical knowledge and understanding of numerical information are crucial for coping with the changing demands of our digital society. In this study, we assessed arithmetic learning in older and younger individuals in a training experiment including brain imaging. In particular, we assessed age-related effects of training intensity, prior arithmetic competence, and neuropsychological variables on the acquisition of new arithmetic knowledge and on the transfer to new, unknown problems. Effects were assessed immediately after training and after 3 months. Behavioural results showed higher training effects for younger individuals than for older individuals and significantly better performance after 90 problem repetitions than after 30 repetitions in both age groups. A correlation analysis indicated that older adults with lower memory and executive functions at baseline could profit more from intensive training. Similarly, training effects in the younger group were higher for those individuals who had lower arithmetic competence and executive functions prior to intervention. In younger adults, successful transfer was associated with higher executive functions. Memory and set-shifting emerged as significant predictors of training effects in the older group. For the younger group, prior arithmetic competence was a significant predictor of training effects, while cognitive flexibility was a predictor of transfer effects. After training, a subgroup of participants underwent an MRI assessment. A voxel-based morphometry analysis showed a significant interaction between training effects and grey matter volume of the right middle temporal gyrus extending to the angular gyrus for the younger group relative to the older group. The reverse contrast (older group vs. younger group) did not yield any significant results. These results suggest that improvements in arithmetic competence are supported by temporo-parietal areas in the right hemisphere in younger participants, while learning in older people might be more widespread. Overall, our study indicates that arithmetic learning depends on the training intensity as well as on person-related factors including individual age, arithmetic competence before training, memory, and executive functions. In conclusion, we suggest that major progress can be also achieved by older participants, but that interventions have to take into account individual variables in order to provide maximal benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2793380721,"The role of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in immune responses has been broadly studied and it has been shown that activated VDR alters the levels of some interleukins (ILs). In this study, we studied the opposite, i.e. whether 13 selected pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory ILs influence the transcriptional activity of human VDR. The experimental models of choice were two human stably transfected gene reporter cell lines IZ-VDRE and IZ-CYP24, which were designed to evaluate the transcriptional activity of VDR. The gene reporter assays revealed inhibition of calcitriol-induced luciferase activity by IL-4 and IL-13, when 1 ng/mL of these two compounds decreased the effect of calcitriol down to 60% of the control value. Consistently, calcitriol-induced expression of CYP24A1 mRNA was also significantly decreased by IL-4 and IL-13. The expression of VDR and CYP27B1 mRNAs was not influenced by any of the 13 tested ILs. These data suggest possible cross-talk between the VDR signalling pathway and IL-4- and IL-13-mediated cell signalling."
