https://openalex.org/W2043667001,"The gene encoding the Nod2 protein is frequently mutated in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, although the physiological function of Nod2 in the intestine remains elusive. Here we show that protective immunity mediated by Nod2 recognition of bacterial muramyl dipeptide is abolished in Nod2-deficient mice. These animals are susceptible to bacterial infection via the oral route but not through intravenous or peritoneal delivery. Nod2 is required for the expression of a subgroup of intestinal anti-microbial peptides, known as cryptdins. The Nod2 protein is thus a critical regulator of bacterial immunity within the intestine, providing a possible mechanism for Nod2 mutations in CD."

These variants are thought to be defective in activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and antibacterial defenses, but CD clinical specimens display elevated NF-κB activity. To illuminate the pathophysiological function of NOD2, we introduced such a variant to the mouse Nod2 locus. Mutant mice exhibited elevated NF-κB activation in response to MDP and more efficient processing and secretion of the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). These effects are linked to increased susceptibility to bacterial-induced intestinal inflammation and identify NOD2 as a positive regulator of NF-κB activation and IL-1β secretion."

By mutation of the two largest subunits (NRPD1a and NRPD2), we show that Pol IV silences certain transposons and repetitive DNA in a short interfering RNA pathway involving RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 and Dicer-like 3. The existence of this distinct silencing polymerase may explain the paradoxical involvement of an RNA silencing pathway in maintenance of transcriptional silencing."

This improved synaptic plasticity is hypothesized to be associated with better memory consolidation in the hippocampus. We used a condition that reliably elicits a dopaminergic response, reward anticipation, to study the relationship between activity of dopaminergic midbrain areas and hippocampal long-term memory in healthy adults. Pictures of object drawings that predicted monetary reward were associated with stronger fMRI activity in reward-related brain areas, including the substantia nigra, compared with non-reward-predicting pictures. Three weeks later, recollection and source memory were better for reward-predicting than for non-reward-predicting pictures. FMRI activity in the hippocampus and the midbrain was higher for reward-predicting pictures that were later recognized compared with later forgotten pictures. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of dopaminergic midbrain regions enhances hippocampus-dependent memory formation, possibly by enhancing consolidation.

The hippocampal formation plays a critical role in episodic memory (Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997Vargha-Khadem F. Gadian D.G. Watkins K.E. Connelly A. Van Paesschen W. Mishkin M.

Encoding of novel stimuli is associated with synaptic plasticity processes in the hippocampus for which the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) is generally believed to play an important role (Morris and Frey, 1997Morris R.G.

Recently, evidence is accumulating that LTP induction and maintenance in the area CA1 of the hippocampus are critically modulated by dopaminergic input from midbrain neurons (Frey et al., 1990Frey U.

Neurobiol. 2003; 69: 375-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Exposure to novel stimuli, for instance, activates midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which also target the hippocampus (Schultz, 1998Schultz W. Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Rats freely moving in a novel spatial environment have a reduced threshold for LTP induction in a narrow time window, and this facilitation of LTP in the CA1 region can be blocked by D1/D5 receptor antagonists (Li et al., 2003Li S. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Dopamine-dependent facilitation of LTP induction in hippocampal CA1 by exposure to spatial novelty.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These findings are paralleled by data showing aversive effects of dopamine depletion on memory performance. In aged humans, deficits in episodic memory are better accounted for by D2 receptor binding than by age (Bäckman et al., 2000Bäckman L. Ginovart N. Dixon R.A. Wahlin T.B. Wahlin A. Halldin C. Farde L. Age-related cognitive deficits mediated by changes in the striatal dopamine system.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2000; 157: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In aged animals, dopamine agonists can promote hippocampus-dependent learning (Hersi et al., 1995Hersi A.I. Rowe W. Gaudreau P. Quirion R. Dopamine D1 receptor ligands modulate cognitive performance and hippocampal acetylcholine release in memory-impaired aged rats.Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Bach et al., 1999Bach M.E.

Animals show impairment of object recognition memory and spatial memory after neurotoxic lesions to dopaminergic neurons (Gasbarri et al., 1996Gasbarri A. Sulli A. Innocenzi R. Pacitti C. Brioni J.D.

O'Dell S.J. Marshall J.F. Neurotoxic methamphetamine regimen severely impairs recognition memory in rats.Synapse. 2003; 49: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as well as reduced maze learning after D2 antagonists injected into the rat hippocampus (Umegaki et al., 2001Umegaki H. Munoz J. Meyer R.C. Spangler E.L. Yoshimura J. Ikari H. Iguchi A. Ingram D.K. Involvement of dopamine D(2) receptors in complex maze learning and acetylcholine release in ventral hippocampus of rats.Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In humans, the reduced level of striatal dopamine in methamphetamine abusers is correlated with verbal memory impairment (Volkow et al., 2001Volkow N.D. Chang L. Wang G.J. Fowler J.S. Leonido-Yee M. Franceschi D. Sedler M.J. Gatley S.J. Hitzemann R. Ding Y.S. et al.Association of dopamine transporter reduction with psychomotor impairment in methamphetamine abusers.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2001; 158: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, hippocampal D2 receptor availability is correlated with verbal memory performance (Kemppainen et al., 2003Kemppainen N. Laine M. Laakso M.P. Kaasinen V. Nagren K. Vahlberg T. Kurki T. Rinne J.O. Hippocampal dopamine D2 receptors correlate with memory functions in Alzheimer's disease.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In healthy human subjects, levodopa enhances learning success and long-term retention of repetitively presented words (Knecht et al., 2004Knecht S. Breitenstein C. Bushuven S. Wailke S. Kamping S. Floel A. Zwitserlood P. Ringelstein E.B. Levodopa: faster and better word learning in normal humans.Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The link between memory formation and dopaminergic neuromodulation has recently also been supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in healthy humans (Schott et al., 2004Schott B.H. Sellner D.B. Lauer C.J. Habib R. Frey J.U. Guderian S. Heinze H.J. Düzel E. Activation of midbrain structures by associative novelty and the formation of explicit memory in humans.Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have shown that activity of the ventral tegmental area and medial substantia nigra accompanied hippocampal activity related to memory formation, in that both structures were activated by novelty and in relation to subsequent free recall performance (Schott et al., 2004Schott B.H. Sellner D.B. Lauer C.J. Habib R. Frey J.U. Guderian S. Heinze H.J. Düzel E. Activation of midbrain structures by associative novelty and the formation of explicit memory in humans.Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that dopaminergic input to the hippocampus enhances consolidation in the hippocampus. Activation of D1/D5 receptors in CA1 enhances consolidation of inhibitory avoidance in rats, whereas blockade of these results in amnesia (Bernabeu et al., 1997Bernabeu R. Bevilaqua L. Ardenghi P. Bromberg E. Schmitz P. Bianchin M. Izquierdo I. Medina J.H. Involvement of hippocampal cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways in a late memory consolidation phase of aversively motivated learning in rats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7041-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic neuromodulation is required for the maintenance of LTP (i.e., “late LTP”) in hippocampal CA1 (Frey et al., 1990Frey U. Schroeder H. Matthies H. Dopaminergic antagonists prevent long-term maintenance of posttetanic LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.Brain Res. 1990; 522: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Frey et al., 1991Frey U. Matthies H. Reymann K.G. The effect of dopaminergic D1 receptor blockade during tetanization on the expression of long-term potentiation in the rat CA1 region in vitro.Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 129: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Huang and Kandel, 1995Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. D1/D5 receptor agonists induce a protein synthesis-dependent late potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The prolonged maintenance of LTP—late LTP—requires the synthesis of new macromolecules during its induction, a property which is similar to processes during the consolidation of memory at the systems level. If the hypothesis that dopaminergic input to the hippocampus enhances consolidation in the hippocampus is correct, conditions that are associated with increased activity of dopaminergic midbrain regions should increase episodic memory performance after long retention delays, when the processes underlying consolidation should be finished. A condition that reliably activates dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain is reward anticipation (for a review, see Wise, 2004Wise R.A. Dopamine, learning and motivation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). In animal studies, single neurons are activated by conditioned stimuli and not by unconditioned rewarding stimuli after completion of the conditioning procedure (Schultz et al., 1992Schultz W. Apicella P. Scarnati E. Ljungberg T. Neuronal activity in monkey ventral striatum related to the expectation of reward.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4595-4610PubMed Google Scholar, Schultz, 1998Schultz W. Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Human fMRI studies have demonstrated the activation of dopaminergic areas (dorsal and ventral striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) by reward-predicting stimuli (Knutson et al., 2001aKnutson B.

Anticipation of reward in a nonaversive differential conditioning paradigm and the brain reward system: an event-related fMRI study.Neuroimage. 2003; 20: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Results indicate that some of these areas are no longer activated by reward receipt when the contingency between predicting stimulus and reward delivery has been learned (Knutson et al., 2001bKnutson B. Fong G.W. Adams C.M. Varner J.L. Hommer D. Dissociation of reward anticipation and outcome with event-related fMRI.Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3683-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, O’Doherty et al., 2002O’Doherty J.P. Deichmann R.

Neural responses during anticipation of a primary taste reward.Neuron. 2002; 33: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and that rewarding outcomes are registered by mesial frontal cortex instead (Knutson et al., 2003Knutson B. Fong G.W. Bennett S.M. Adams C.M. Hommer D. A region of mesial prefrontal cortex tracks monetarily rewarding outcomes: characterization with rapid event-related fMRI.Neuroimage. 2003; 18: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To study the link between dopaminergic midbrain activity and hippocampus-dependent memory formation in humans, we used an event-related fMRI design in a reward anticipation paradigm with a modulated monetary incentive delay task (Knutson et al., 2000Knutson B. Westdorp A. Kaiser E. Hommer D. FMRI visualization of brain activity during a monetary incentive delay task.Neuroimage. 2000; 12: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Pictures of living and nonliving things served as cues predicting whether a following number comparison task was rewarded or not (Figure 1). Participants were asked to indicate whether they expected a reward or neutral trial but not told that a memory task for these pictures would follow. The difficulty of the number comparison task was adjusted so that approximately 80% of reward trials were followed by a correct response and a reward, and the rest were followed by a mild punishment. The fMRI data of the study phase were analyzed according to performance in an immediate and a delayed subsequent memory test (difference due to memory [DM] analyses; for a review, see Paller and Wagner, 2002Paller K.A. Wagner A.D. Observing the transformation of experience into memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2002; 6: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In the immediate memory test, approximately 2 min after the study phase, participants made old/new judgments on randomly mixed studied and unstudied pictures. In the delayed test (3 weeks later), participants were shown the same test pictures in a remember/know recollection paradigm (Tulving, 1985Tulving E. Memory and consciousness.Can. Psychol. 1985; 26: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar). For each recognized picture, a source memory question followed asking whether the picture had been first presented in the study or test phase. This approach made it possible to study neuromodulation by comparing the encoding activation of reward-predicting and neutral items that were recognized and forgotten after short and long retention intervals. Given the reward anticipation property of the dopaminergic system, we expected the reward cue pictures to be associated with an increased hemodynamic response in the dopaminergic reward system including the midbrain dopaminergic areas without making the pictures themselves rewarding stimuli, or reward delivery dependent on the reaction to the cue pictures or on learning success. We expected that reward anticipation should improve hippocampus-dependent long-term memory formation. In the delayed memory test, this should be associated with improved recollection and higher source memory accuracy of reward-predicting pictures compared with the neutral pictures. This behavioral improvement of long-term memory should be accompanied by increased activity of dopaminergic midbrain areas and of the hippocampus at the time of presentation of the reward-predicting stimuli that were recognized after 3 weeks delay. The absence of such increased activity for reward-predicting stimuli recognized in the immediate test would be compatible with animal data that dopaminergic neuromodulation improves hippocampus-dependent consolidation. Its presence already for reward-predicting stimuli recognized in the immediate test, on the other hand, would make a consolidation account less likely. Participants correctly recognized the cues signaling rewarded or neutral trials (97% ± 1%). Reaction times for reward-predicting cues were significantly shorter than those for neutral cues (708 ± 27 ms versus 770 ± 20 ms; p < 0.001). In the number comparison task, reaction times and correct response rates differed significantly across conditions. Participants gained money on an average of 81% ± 2% of reward trials, approximating the targeted 80% correct response rate, whereas the average correct response rate for nonrewarded trials was 68% ± 4% (p < 0.01). Reaction times in rewarded trials were significantly shorter (519 ± 18 ms) than those in nonrewarded trials (562 ± 17 ms; p = 0.001). The fMRI contrast between reward cues and neutral cues revealed significant (p < 0.0005) activations of the dopaminergic system: large parts of striatum (bilateral putamen, right caudate, bilateral nucleus accumbens), left globus pallidus, and right substantia nigra (Table 1; Figure 2). Other areas known to be activated by reward anticipation such as insula, anterior cingulate, and thalamus were also activated.Table 1Anatomical Locations of Regions Responding to Reward AnticipationTalairach CoordinatesStructureLeft/Rightxyzz ScoreInsula (BA 13)R459−34.41Anterior cingulate (BA 25)L−35−84.06Medial frontal gyrus (BA 6)L02504.38Precentral gyrus (BA 4, BA 6)L−33−8644.16R45−9474.34R45−11614.23Cingulate gyrus (BA 23)R6−16283.88Postcentral gyrus (BA 5, BA 3)L−39−26573.47L−36−46634.04Inferior parietal lobule (BA 40)L−50−30403.71L−53−36293.58R68−25234.03Precuneus (BA 7)R18−44554.03R9−61563.63Fusiform gyrus (BA 37)L−50−53−183.87PutamenL−1511−83.86R153−83.80CaudateR9983.70Globus pallidusL−18−3−73.90Substantia nigra/midbrainR6−21−123.54ThalamusL−15−22183.71CerebellumR3−65−273.62Data are thresholded at p < 0.0005 (uncorrected), and only clusters with >10 voxels are reported. Open table in a new tab Data are thresholded at p < 0.0005 (uncorrected), and only clusters with >10 voxels are reported. Unlike this anticipation contrast (i.e., reward-predicting cue versus neutral cue), reward outcome (reward versus neutral outcome) was not associated with activation of the dopaminergic system. Instead, reward outcome was associated with significant activations in right middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area [BA] 10), secondary visual areas, fusiform gyrus, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and thalamus (p < 0.005) when compared to neutral outcome. This expected dissociation between reward anticipation and reward outcome was further confirmed by masking the outcome contrast (reward versus neutral outcome) with the anticipation contrast (reward-predicting cue versus neutral cue; thresholded at 0.0005). The only common activation resulting from this masking was in the thalamus (p < 0.005; min. cluster size 5 voxels). Hit rate (correct “old” responses to studied pictures) did not differ across conditions (average 77% ± 2%). The average rate of correct rejections (correct “new” responses to unstudied pictures) was 86% ± 2%. At the time of test, the fMRI contrast between hits and misses (incorrect new responses to studied pictures) revealed higher activity for hits in the right temporal lobe (BA 20; p < 0.005). Hits belonging to previously rewarded categories elicited higher activity in left insula, right amygdala, left cuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum when compared with hits belonging to previously unrewarded categories. In the subsequent memory (“DM”) analysis of study trials, pictures that were subsequently recognized showed a stronger activation of several brain regions, including left insula, fusiform gyrus, secondary visual areas, left prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus when compared with pictures that were subsequently missed (Table 2; Figure 3).Table 2Anatomical Locations of Regions Active during Successful Encoding as Tested by the Immediate Memory TestTalairach CoordinatesStructureLeft/Rightxyzz ScoreInferior frontal gyrus (BA 47)R3031−143.50Insula (BA 13)L−36−7252.74Precentral gyrus (BA 6, BA 4)L−39−13313.52L−15−29713.33Parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30)L−12−38−34.06Fusiform gyrus (BA 37, BA 20)L−45−53−123.38R42−36−163.70Cuneus (BA 18)R12−72153.13Superior parietal lobule (BA 7)L−30−73453.13Superior occipital gyrus (BA 19)R36−83263.22Middle occipital gyrus (BA 18, BA 19)L−36−9373.40R48−56−73.35CerebellumL−33−59−153.00Data are thresholded at p < 0.005, and only clusters with >10 voxels are reported. Open table in a new tab Data are thresholded at p < 0.005, and only clusters with >10 voxels are reported. Separate DM analyses of reward-predicting and neutral items revealed different patterns of brain activity. Reward-predicting pictures that were subsequently recognized were not different (at a threshold of p < 0.005; min. cluster size 5 voxels) from reward-predicting pictures that were subsequently missed. In contrast, neutral pictures that were subsequently recognized showed a stronger activation than neutral pictures that were subsequently missed in regions including left PFC, fusiform cortex, occipital areas, and left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30). Old items from the reward task were better recognized than new distractor items from the immediate memory task, irrespective of reward condition (63% ± 3% and 44% ± 2%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the old items, there was a significantly higher rate of remember responses for previously reward-predicting than for previously non-reward-predicting pictures (29% ± 4% versus 20% ± 3% [one-tailed Student’s t test]; p < 0.05). In the source recognition task, performance for old reward-predicting items was higher than that for old neutral items (61% ± 3% versus 55% ± 3%; p < 0.05). Only the source retrieval rate for old reward-predicting items, not the one for neutral or new pictures, was significantly above chance level. The DM analysis showed an increased hemodynamic response in the dopaminergic system (right caudate, right substantia nigra), cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, for subsequently recognized versus subsequently missed items (Table 3; Figures 4A–4C ). When this contrast was masked with the reward anticipation contrast (thresholded at 0.0005), significant (p < 0.005; min. cluster size 5 voxels), activation of left nucleus caudatus and right substantia nigra remained, as well as precentral gyrus (BA 6) and postcentral gyrus (BA 2). This showed that the same region in the substantia nigra was activated by reward anticipation and in relation to successful memory formation.Table 3Anatomical Locations of Regions Active during Successful Encoding as Tested by the Delayed Memory TestTalairach CoordinatesStructureLeft/Rightxyzz ScoreMiddle frontal gyrus (BA 46)L−5330233.68Cingulate gyrus (BA 24, BA 31)L−6−1303.93L−21−21453.79L−15−15422.86R15−13342.89Middle temporal gyrus (BA 21)L−62−12−73.31Parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36)/hippocampusR42−27−113.48Superior parietal lobule (BA 7)R18−70593.36Middle occipital gyrus (BA 19)R39−84154.44CaudateR15−7282.89Substantia nigra/midbrainR9−21−143.10Data are thresholded at p < 0.005, and only clusters with >10 voxels are reported.

Separate DM analyses for reward-predicting and neutral items were conducted in order to assess whether activity in the substantia nigra was related to successful memory formation only for reward-predicting items. Indeed, for later recognized reward-predicting pictures, a significantly increased hemodynamic response occurred in right substantia nigra (other regions were left insula and secondary visual areas [BA 18 and BA 19]; p < 0.005), whereas the substantia nigra was not part of the DM effect for neutral items (here effects were in the right red nucleus, left cingulate gyrus [BA 24], and left parahippocampal gyrus [BA 30]; p < 0.005). To further investigate the relationship between reward anticipation, memory formation, and activity of substantia nigra and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, we conducted a 2 (factor reward: reward-predicting versus neutral) by 2 (factor memory: recognized versus forgotten) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of percent signal change for the peak voxels in both regions. For the substantia nigra, this revealed significant main effects of reward [F(1, 15) = 6.8; p < 0.05] and later memory performance [F(1, 15) = 14.0; p < 0.01] as well as a reward by memory interaction [F(1, 15) = 4.6; p < 0.05; Figure 4D]. For the hippocampus, this revealed significant main effects of reward [F(1, 15) = 4.9; p < 0.05] and memory [F(1, 15) = 19.5; p = 0.001] but no interaction (Figure 4D).

Both pheromone ORs are coexpressed with an OR from the highly conserved insect OR subfamily. This coexpression promotes the functional expression of pheromone receptors and confers ligand-stimulated nonselective cation channel activity. The same effects were also observed for general ORs. Both odorant and pheromone signaling pathways are mediated by means of a common mechanism in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2095596605,"A major obstacle for successful axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) arises from inhibitory molecules in CNS myelin, which signal through a common receptor complex on neurons consisting of the ligand-binding Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) and two transmembrane coreceptors, p75 and LINGO-1. However, p75 expression is only detectable in subpopulations of mature neurons, raising the question of how these inhibitory signals are transduced in neurons lacking p75.

Our results implicate TROY in mediating myelin inhibition, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of regeneration failure in the adult nervous system. Damaged axons in the adult CNS are unable to spontaneously regenerate upon injury, in contrast to neurons in the peripheral or embryonic nervous system. Such a failure in regeneration is believed to arise from both a decline in the intrinsic growth state of mature neurons, as well as the presence of a nonpermissive environment in the injured adult CNS preventing axon growth (reviewed in Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996Schwab M.E.

In addition to the physical barrier formed by the astrocytic scar tissue that develops at the lesion site (Morgenstern et al., 2002Morgenstern D.A. Asher R.A. Fawcett J.W.

Brain Res. 2002; 137: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), inhibition by both extracellular matrix proteoglycans secreted by reactive glial cells and inhibitory molecules associated with CNS myelin have been shown to restrict axon regeneration in the adult nervous system (Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996Schwab M.E.

To date, three major inhibitory molecules in myelin have been characterized, including Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), which collectively account for the majority of the inhibitory activity in myelin (reviewed by Filbin, 2003Filbin M.T.

Though structurally distinct, all three myelin inhibitors signal through a common receptor complex in neurons, which includes the ligand binding Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), and two signal-transducing binding partners, p75 and LINGO-1, to exert its effects on the neuronal cytoskeleton and prevent axon growth (Domeniconi et al., 2002Domeniconi M.

Although this receptor complex has been extensively scrutinized as a convergence point for the inhibitory signals of CNS myelin, it remains unclear whether other coreceptors may also be involved. Interestingly, while NgR and LINGO-1 are widely expressed in the adult CNS (Figure 1; Wang et al., 2002cWang X. Chun S.J. Treloar H. Vartanian T. Greer C.A. Strittmatter S.M.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), p75 expression is much more restricted. Initially identified as a low-affinity receptor for neurotrophins, p75 is highly expressed in the developing nervous system during periods of axon outgrowth and dendritic arborization, but decreases over the postnatal period and adulthood (reviewed by Roux and Barker, 2002Roux P.P. Barker P.A. Neurotrophin signaling through the p75 neurotrophin receptor.Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, Chao, 2003Chao M.V. Neurotrophins and their receptors: a convergence point for many signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). In fact, only subpopulations of a few types of mature neurons, such as subsets of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, have been shown to express p75 in adults (McMahon et al., 1994McMahon S.B. Armanini M.P. Ling L.H. Phillips H.S.

Furthermore, though neurons from p75 mutant mice are less inhibited by myelin components in an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay, a significant amount of residual inhibitory response remains (Wang et al., 2002bWang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. P75 interacts with the Nogo receptor as a co-receptor for Nogo, MAG and OMgp.Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, studies with p75 mutant mice have failed to show any significant promotion of regeneration in an in vivo spinal cord injury model (Song et al., 2004Song X.Y. Zhong J.H. Wang X. Zhou X.F. Suppression of p75NTR does not promote regeneration of injured spinal cord in mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest the possible presence of other functional homologs of p75 that allow neurons lacking this coreceptor to remain responsive to myelin inhibition. p75 is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family, a class of type I transmembrane proteins bearing significant homology in their extracellular domains, which contain one or more cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) characteristic of this receptor superfamily (reviewed by Locksley et al., 2001Locksley R.M.

However, their cytoplasmic tails are highly divergent, with a broad range of affinities for intracellular adaptors allowing for different signaling specificities. While many TNFR family members have been well characterized in the context of injury and inflammation (Locksley et al., 2001Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

Schweigreiter R. Yamashita T. Rosenkranz K. Wekerle H. Barde Y.A. Tumor necrosis factor inhibits neurite outgrowth and branching of hippocampal neurons by a rho-dependent mechanism.J.

Essig M. et al.Neutralization of CD95 ligand promotes regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for the involvement of TROY (also known as TAJ), a newly identified member of the TNF receptor family expressed in the adult nervous system (Kojima et al., 2000Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. TROY, a newly identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, exhibits a homology with Edar and is expressed in embryonic skin and hair follicles.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20742-20747Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as a functional homolog of p75 in mediating myelin inhibition. Like p75, TROY can form a receptor complex with NgR and LINGO-1 and mediate the outgrowth inhibition and signaling pathways triggered by myelin inhibitors. Moreover, blocking the interaction of TROY with NgR by different dominant-negative approaches efficiently abolished neuronal responses to myelin inhibitors. These results implicate an important role for TROY in mediating the inhibitory effects of myelin components on axon regeneration. The fact that p75 is not expressed in all mature neurons raises the question of why neurons lacking p75 expression also fail to regenerate after axonal injury. One possibility is that these neurons are inhibited in an NgR-independent manner. Alternatively, other functional equivalents of p75 may allow these neurons to remain responsive to myelin inhibitors. To distinguish these possibilities, we employed DRG neurons from adult rats. Consistent with previous reports (McMahon et al., 1994McMahon S.B. Armanini M.P. Ling L.H. Phillips H.S. Expression and coexpression of Trk receptors in subpopulations of adult primary sensory neurons projecting to identified peripheral targets.Neuron. 1994; 12: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, Wright and Snider, 1995Wright D.E. Snider W.D. Neurotrophin receptor mRNA expression defines distinct populations of neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 351: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we found that only 60%–70% of DRG neurons expressed detectable levels of p75 (p75+) and that this subpopulation was mostly distinct from those positively stained by Isolectin B4 (IB4+), a marker for cell surface glycoconjugates on neurons lacking p75 (Averill et al., 1995Averill S. McMahon S.B. Clary D.O. Reichardt L.F. Priestley J.V. Immunocytochemical localization of trkA receptors in chemically identified subgroups of adult rat sensory neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, Molliver et al., 1997Molliver D.C. Wright D.E. Leitner M.L. Parsadanian A.S. Doster K. Wen D. Yan Q. Snider W.D. IB4-binding DRG neurons switch from NGF to GDNF dependence in early postnatal life.Neuron. 1997; 19: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). When cultured on immobilized inhibitory substrates such as the extracellular domain of Nogo-A (Nogo-66) or OMgp, most DRG neurons exhibited reduced neurite outgrowth regardless of p75 expression (see Figure S1A in the supplemental material available with this article online). This neurite outgrowth inhibition is mediated by NgR receptor complexes, as overexpression of a truncated NgR that retains the ligand binding domain but not the coreceptor binding domain (Wang et al., 2002bWang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. P75 interacts with the Nogo receptor as a co-receptor for Nogo, MAG and OMgp.Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) resulted in enhanced neurite outgrowth on these inhibitory substrates in more than 90% of the DRG neurons including both p75−/IB4+ cells and p75+/IB4− cells (Figure S1B). Similarly, overexpressing a truncated p75 lacking its intracellular domain also allowed significant neurite outgrowth in most DRG neurons, including the p75−/IB4+ cells (Figure S1B). These results suggest that the response to myelin inhibitors in neurons lacking p75 expression may be mediated by other potential p75 functional homologs that can also be blocked by the truncated p75 in a dominant-negative manner. In previous studies, although we found that DRG neurons from p75 knockout mice were able to overcome the inhibitory effects of immobilized myelin substrates as compared to wild-type neurons (Wang et al., 2002bWang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. P75 interacts with the Nogo receptor as a co-receptor for Nogo, MAG and OMgp.Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), average neurite lengths were still shorter than those on PDL, indicating some residual response to myelin inhibition. Yet, when the response of different subpopulations of DRG neurons (IB4+ and IB4−) from p75−/− mice were quantified separately, we found that the majority of the cells that could overcome myelin inhibition were IB4−, while most of the IB4+ neurons, which would represent the p75− population from wild-type animals, remained inhibited by myelin inhibitors (Figure S1C). Even within the IB4− population of DRG neurons from p75−/− mice, average neurite lengths on myelin substrates were still less than those on PDL (Figure S1C), suggesting that these neurons retained some residual response to myelin inhibitors. Together, these results provide further support for the potential existence of other functional homologs of p75. In addition to p75, several other known members of the TNFR family, including TROY (Kojima et al., 2000Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. TROY, a newly identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, exhibits a homology with Edar and is expressed in embryonic skin and hair follicles.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20742-20747Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), CD40 (Tan et al., 2002Tan J. Town T. Mori T. Obregon D. Wu Y. DelleDonne A. Rojiani A. Crawford F. Flavell R.A. Mullan M. CD40 is expressed and functional on neuronal cells.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), DR6 (Pan et al., 1998Pan G. Bauer J.H. Haridas V. Wang S. Liu D. Yu G. Vincenz C. Aggarwal B.B. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Identification and functional characterization of DR6, a novel death domain-containing TNF receptor.FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and TNFR1A (Yan et al., 2003Yan P. Liu N. Kim G.M. Xu J. Xu J. Li Q. Hsu C.Y. Xu X.M. Expression of the type 1 and type 2 receptors for tumor necrosis factor after traumatic spinal cord injury in adult rats.Exp. Neurol. 2003; 183: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), have been reported to be expressed in the mature nervous system. To examine the possibility of these molecules as potential p75 functional homologs, we first examined their expression patterns in the adult CNS by in situ hybridization. We found that several TNFR family members, including TROY (Figures 1A, 1E, 1I, and 1M), CD40, and DR6 (data not shown) are highly expressed in most parts of the adult CNS, including the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, as well as most DRG and retinal ganglion neurons (RGCs). This was in sharp contrast to the expression of p75, which was limited to subpopulations of DRG neurons (Figure 1J) and undetectable in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and most RGCs (Figures 1B, 1F, and 1N). Consistent with previous studies (Wang et al., 2002cWang X. Chun S.J. Treloar H. Vartanian T. Greer C.A. Strittmatter S.M. Localization of Nogo-A and Nogo-66 receptor proteins at sites of axon-myelin and synaptic contact.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Mi et al., 2004Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. et al.LINGO-1 is a component of the Nogo-66 receptor/p75 signaling complex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), both NgR (Figures 1C, 1G, 1K, and 1O) and LINGO-1 (Figures 1D, 1H, 1L, and 1P) are broadly expressed across most of these CNS regions. Immunostaining of DRG neurons in culture also showed colocalization of signals from both anti-TROY and anti-β-tubulin antibodies, demonstrating the expression of TROY in both cell bodies and neurites of these neurons (Figures 1Q–1S). Together, these results are consistent with the notion that TROY can act as a coreceptor of NgR. To determine whether TNFR members expressed in the CNS can substitute for the role of p75 as an NgR coreceptor, we first determined whether they could form a receptor complex with NgR and LINGO-1. Using a cell surface binding assay, we found that, like p75, an alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of TROY (AP-TROY) can bind to NgR-expressing COS-7 cells (Figures 2A and 2B ) with an apparent kD of ∼10 nM for AP-TROY and ∼80 nM for AP-p75. This is further supported by the fact that neither AP-p75 nor AP-TROY can bind to a truncated form of NgR (DN-NgR), which retains its ligand binding domain but lacks the unique carboxy-terminal region required for coreceptor binding (Figure 2A), suggesting that p75 and TROY may bind to a similar region of NgR. In contrast, neither CD40-AP nor DR6-AP showed any detectable binding in the nanomolar range (Figure 2C). When transfected into 293T cells, TROY can be coimmunoprecipitated with NgR and LINGO-1 (Figure 2D), demonstrating that TROY, like p75, is capable of forming receptor complexes with NgR and LINGO-1. To further examine whether TROY can form a functional receptor complex with NgR and LINGO-1, we examined whether coexpression of NgR, p75, and LINGO-1 can allow nonneuronal cells to respond to myelin inhibitors by activating RhoA, a required step in the signaling pathways for myelin inhibition (Lehmann et al., 1999Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. Inactivation of Rho signaling pathway promotes CNS axon regeneration.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Niederost et al., 2002Niederost B. Oertle T. Fritsche J. McKinney R.A. Bandtlow C.E. Nogo-A and myelin-associated glycoprotein mediate neurite growth inhibition by antagonistic regulation of RhoA and Rac1.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10368-10376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations (Mi et al., 2004Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. et al.LINGO-1 is a component of the Nogo-66 receptor/p75 signaling complex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), we found that soluble myelin inhibitors can activate RhoA in COS-7 cells cotransfected with NgR, p75, and LINGO-1 (Figure 3B ). More importantly, we found that TROY can also substitute for p75 in reconstituting this functional receptor complex with NgR and LINGO-1 in responding to all three myelin inhibitors (Figures 3A–3D). As expected, all three components (NgR, LINGO-1, and p75 or TROY) were required to confer this Rho activation (Figure 3A). These results further support the role of TROY as a functional homolog of p75 in transducing the inhibitory signal of myelin inhibitors. If TROY can function as a p75-like NgR coreceptor, one prediction will be that a truncated TROY lacking its intracellular domain, once overexpressed, will compete for binding of endogenous coreceptors like p75 and TROY to NgR, restricting neuronal response to myelin inhibitors in a dominant-negative manner. To test this, we generated recombinant herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) expressing either full-length (FL-TROY) or dominant-negative TROY (DN-TROY). DRG neurons infected with these viruses do not show significant changes in cell survival as indicated by Hoechst 33258 staining and neurite outgrowth on the control PDL substrate (data not shown). However, when expressed in cultured DRG neurons, the truncated, but not full-length, TROY dramatically enhanced neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons on immobilized Nogo-66 (Figure 4A) and other myelin inhibitors (data not shown), including both the IB4+ and IB4− populations. As our results suggested that DRG neurons from p75−/− mice still retained some responsiveness to myelin inhibitors, we next examined whether such residual activity could be blocked by overexpression of DN-TROY. As shown in Figure 4B, DN-TROY resulted in further recovery from the inhibitory effects of Nogo-66 in both IB4+ and IB4− DRG neurons. However, the inhibition was not totally abolished, presumably because expression levels of the protein were not high enough to completely displace the activity of endogenous TROY and other potential coreceptors. Interestingly, expression of FL-TROY resulted in an enhanced inhibitory response of IB4− neurons to Nogo-66 compared to YFP-infected controls (Figure 4B). As these IB4− neurons express p75 in wild-type animals, these results suggest the possibility that overexpression of TROY could rescue the neuronal response to myelin inhibitors in p75−/− mice. Based on these results, we further anticipated that a TROY-Fc fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of TROY, when supplied exogenously, would interfere with receptor complex formation and disrupt the response of cultured neurons to myelin inhibitors. As shown in Figure 4C, inhibition of neurite outgrowth from DRG neurons by Nogo-66 can be neutralized by the addition of excess recombinant TROY-Fc, but not control IgG, in the immobilized substrate. Similar results were also obtained from experiments using other myelin inhibitors or solubilized myelin as substrates (data not shown). These results further substantiated the involvement of TROY in mediating the inhibitory activity of myelin inhibitors. Until now, available evidence has suggested that the majority of the inhibitory activity associated with CNS myelin signal via a common receptor complex consisting of NgR, LINGO-1, and p75. Yet, in contrast to NgR and LINGO-1, p75 is only expressed in limited populations of mature neurons in the adult CNS, even after injury (Roux and Barker, 2002Roux P.P. Barker P.A. Neurotrophin signaling through the p75 neurotrophin receptor.Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, Chao, 2003Chao M.V. Neurotrophins and their receptors: a convergence point for many signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated that TROY, another TNF receptor family member broadly expressed in the adult CNS, can substitute for p75 as a coreceptor of NgR and LINGO-1 and mediate the inhibitory effects of myelin inhibitors. Like p75, TROY binds NgR with similar affinity, and together with LINGO-1 can reconstitute the activation of RhoA, a required step in the signaling pathways of myelin inhibition. Additionally, both overexpression of a truncated form of TROY lacking its intracellular domain and addition of a TROY-Fc fusion protein can block neuronal response to myelin inhibitors in a dominant-negative manner. Together, these results suggest that TROY may act as a functional homolog of p75. In addition to p75 and TROY, several other TNFR members have also been shown to be expressed in the adult CNS. Our studies, however, failed to demonstrate the ability of these TNFR members to bind NgR with high affinity, suggesting that p75 and TROY may be unique among their relatives in mediating myelin inhibition. Nevertheless, these in vitro binding results do not preclude the possibility that other TNFR members may also act as NgR coreceptors under physiological conditions. Interestingly, although TNFR members had been well characterized in the context of inflammation and cell survival, recent studies are now implicating their involvement in axonal growth as well, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For example, cross-linking Fas (also known as CD95) on cultured sensory neurons has been shown to induce neurite outgrowth (Desbarats et al., 2003Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Fas engagement induces neurite growth through ERK activation and p35 upregulation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Consistently, functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury is delayed in Fas-deficient mice and accelerated by local administration of antibodies against Fas (Desbarats et al., 2003Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Fas engagement induces neurite growth through ERK activation and p35 upregulation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TNF seems to inhibit the neurite outgrowth of cultured hippocampal neurons through the TNF receptor, as suggested by studies in TNF receptor-deficient mice (Neumann et al., 2002Neumann H. Schweigreiter R. Yamashita T. Rosenkranz K. Wekerle H. Barde Y.A. Tumor necrosis factor inhibits neurite outgrowth and branching of hippocampal neurons by a rho-dependent mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 854-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important in the future to determine whether these phenomena are mediated by the NgR receptor complex as well. In light of the structural basis for the ability of NgR to interact with multiple binding partners (He et al., 2003He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z.

Yet, it remains unclear whether these molecules provide functional redundancy or whether they permit distinct signaling properties in different cells. Recent studies suggest that p75 is a component of three distinct receptor platforms (with Trk receptors, NgR/LINGO-1, and sortilin) that bind different"
https://openalex.org/W2097520363,"To analyze the dynamics of protein complexes during the yeast cell cycle, we integrated data on protein interactions and gene expression. The resulting time-dependent interaction network places both periodically and constitutively expressed proteins in a temporal cell cycle context, thereby revealing previously unknown components and modules. We discovered that most complexes consist of both periodically and constitutively expressed subunits, which suggests that the former control complex activity by a mechanism of just-in-time assembly. Consistent with this, we show that additional regulation through targeted degradation and phosphorylation by Cdc28p (Cdk1) specifically affects the periodically expressed proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1993433521,"Myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) are inhibitors of CNS axonal regeneration following injury. The Nogo receptor complex, composed of the Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1), neurotrophin p75 receptor (p75), and LINGO-1, represses axon regeneration upon binding to these myelin components. The limited expression of p75 to certain types of neurons and its temporal expression during development prompted speculation that other receptors are involved in the NgR1 complex. Here, we show that an orphan receptor in the TNF family called TAJ, broadly expressed in postnatal and adult neurons, binds to NgR1 and can replace p75 in the p75/NgR1/LINGO-1 complex to activate RhoA in the presence of myelin inhibitors. In vitro exogenously added TAJ reversed neurite outgrowth caused by MAIFs. Neurons from Taj-deficient mice were more resistant to the suppressive action of the myelin inhibitors. Given the limited expression of p75, the discovery of TAJ function is an important step for understanding the regulation of axonal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1995720011,"The 2.0-angstrom structure of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit bound to a deletion mutant of a regulatory subunit (RIalpha) defines a previously unidentified extended interface. The complex provides a molecular mechanism for inhibition of PKA and suggests how cAMP binding leads to activation. The interface defines the large lobe of the catalytic subunit as a stable scaffold where Tyr247 in the G helix and Trp196 in the phosphorylated activation loop serve as anchor points for binding RIalpha. These residues compete with cAMP for the phosphate binding cassette in RIalpha. In contrast to the catalytic subunit, RIalpha undergoes major conformational changes when the complex is compared with cAMP-bound RIalpha. The inhibitor sequence docks to the active site, whereas the linker, also disordered in free RIalpha, folds across the extended interface. The beta barrel of cAMP binding domain A, which is the docking site for cAMP, remains largely intact in the complex, whereas the helical subdomain undergoes major reorganization."

AQP4-deficient mice had remarkably lower intracranial pressure (9 ± 1 versus 25 ± 5 cm H2O) and brain water accumulation (2 ± 1 versus 9 ± 1 μl) at 30 h, and improved survival (80 versus 0% survival) at 60 h, through comparable CSF bacterial and white cell counts.

Even with effective antibiotic treatment, mortality from pneumococcal meningitis is 10–30%, with 30–50% of patients acquiring permanent neurological deficits (1.Pfister H.W. Feiden W. Einhaupl K.M.

A major complication associated with unfavorable outcome in bacterial meningitis is brain edema, which causes a rise in intracranial pressure potentially leading to brain ischemia, herniation, and death (8.Nau R. Bruck W. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 38-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9.Saez-Llorens X. McCracken Jr., G.H. Lancet. 2003; 361: 2139-2148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation and absorption of excess fluid in brain edema associated with meningitis are poorly understood. The two main types of brain edema are cytotoxic and vasogenic (10.Klatzo I. Acta Neurochir. Suppl. (Wien). 1994; 60: 3-6PubMed Google Scholar). Cytotoxic edema, as occurs in ischemic stroke, refers to cell swelling that primarily affects astroglial cells. Vasogenic edema, as occurs in brain tumors, involves accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the brain parenchyma because of a leaky blood-brain barrier (BBB). 1The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood-brain barrier; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; AQP4, aquaporin-4; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ICP, intracranial pressure. Although both types of brain edema are thought to co-exist in meningitis (8.Nau R. Bruck W.

Lancet. 2003; 361: 2139-2148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), their relative contributions to brain swelling are not known. Recently, the bidirectional water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been found to play an important role in brain-water homeostasis (11.Papadopoulos M.C. Saadoun S. Binder D.K. Manley G.T. Krishna S.

Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). AQP4 protein is expressed strongly in astroglia at the BBB and CSF-brain interfaces (17.Rash J.E. Yasumura T. Hudson C.S. Agre P. Nielsen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11981-11986Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 18.Nielsen S. Nagelhus E.A. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Bourque C. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting involvement in water movement between fluid compartments (blood and CSF) and brain parenchyma. AQP4 deletion markedly reduced brain swelling in mouse models of cytotoxic brain edema, including water intoxication and focal cerebral ischemia (16.Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). In contrast, AQP4 deletion in mice significantly worsened outcome in mouse models of vasogenic brain edema, including intraparenchymal fluid infusion, focal cortical freeze injury, and brain tumor (19.Papadopoulos M.C. Manley G.T. Krishna S. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Thus, AQP4 appears to facilitate water movement into brain astroglia in cytotoxic edema, and water movement out of the brain in vasogenic edema. To investigate the functional role of AQP4 in meningitis, we created a mouse model of meningitis involving injection of live S. pneumoniae into the CSF. Although the severity of infection was similar in wild type and AQP4 null mice as assessed by CSF bacterial and white cell counts, the AQP4 null mice had remarkably lower intracranial pressure, brain water accumulation, astrocyte foot process swelling, and mortality. Based on experimental data and computational modeling, we conclude that reduced permeability of the BBB in AQP4 deficiency accounted for the improved outcome in AQP4 null mice. Our results have specific implications regarding aquaporin-based therapies of bacterial meningitis. Mice—AQP4 null mice were generated by targeted gene disruption as described previously (20.Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These mice have normal growth, appearance, survival, gross cerebrovascular anatomy, brain water content, intracranial pressure, bulk intracranial compliance, and serum chemistries, except for a mild reduction in maximal urinary concentrating ability after prolonged water deprivation (16.Manley G.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31233-31237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on weight- and sex-matched wild type and AQP4 null mice in an outbred (CD1) genetic background. Investigators were blinded to genotype information in all experiments. Protocols were approved by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Animal Research. Bacterial Culture—S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (clinical isolate) was purchased from ATCC (catalog number 700676) and grown at 37 °C on trypticase soy agar-enriched with defribrinated sheep blood (Remel, Lenexa, KS). Sensitivity to cefotaxime was confirmed using antibiotic resistance discs (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA). Bacteria were periodically subcultured from infected mouse CSF to maintain virulence. About 8 h prior to injection, two bacterial colonies were suspended in brain heart infusion broth (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. S. pneumoniae was grown in brain heart infusion broth to mid-log phase, estimated using optical absorbance at 570 nm. The bacterial suspension was then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in sterile, 0.9% saline to an absorbance of 0.20 at 570 nm, equivalent to 3–4 × 106 colony forming units/50 μl, which was confirmed for each set of experiments by quantitative bacterial cultures. Pneumococcal Meningitis Model—Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (intraperitoneal 125 mg/kg, Sigma). The head was secured in a stereotactic frame (Benchmark, Neurolab, St. Louis, MO) with the mouthpiece set at 5 mm and the ear bars at 10 mm. After incising the scalp, a 1-mm diameter burr hole was made 2-mm lateral and 0-mm posterior to the bregma, using a micromotor drill (Foredom, Bethel, CT). A blunted 27-gauge needle attached to a gas-tight glass syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was stereotactically introduced through the burr hole until the needle tip made contact with the skull base (Fig. 1A). After 2 min, 50 μl of S. pneumoniae suspended in 0.9% saline was infused over 5 min and 2 min later the needle was gradually removed. In control studies only saline was infused. About 5% mice died during the injection, most likely because of intracerebral hemorrhage and/or rapid increase in intracranial pressure. Mice that died prior to recovery from anesthesia were excluded from the study. After recovery mice were kept at room temperature and provided with standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were given subcutaneous injections of 0.5 ml of normal saline at 10, 20, and 30 h after bacterial infusion to prevent dehydration. Immunodetection of AQP4 —For immunocytochemistry, mouse brains were fixed in 10% formalin overnight, processed through graded concentrations of ethanol, immersed in Citrisolv (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA), and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (7 μm thick) were deparaffinized in Citrisolv and rehydrated with graded ethanols. After blocking with goat serum, samples were incubated with a rabbit anti-AQP4 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound antibody was detected using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis, the left cerebral cortex (contralateral to infusion site) was homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (crude membrane extract) was loaded on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 μg of protein/lane) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) followed by anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). AQP4 protein was quantified by scanning densitometry using serial dilutions of brains from meningitis mice as standards. Intracranial Pressure—Intracranial pressure (ICP) was recorded from the cisterna magna as described (19.Papadopoulos M.C. Manley G.T. Krishna S. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). After positioning the mouse in the stereotactic frame, a midline incision was made at the back of the neck and the underlying muscles were dissected to reveal the cisterna magna. A 27-gauge needle attached using short, non-compliant tubing to a pressure transducer (TSD104A; Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA) was inserted into the cisterna magna. Intracranial pressure was recorded at 50 Hz. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37–38 °C using a heating lamp. ICP values were averaged over 2–5 min. Brain Water Content—Rectal temperature was maintained between 37 and 38 °C using a heating lamp for 1 h prior to mouse sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the brain was immediately removed and divided into right and left hemispheres and cerebellum. Brain fragments were weighed immediately and then dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 105 °C. The dried brain was re-weighed and % brain water content calculated as (wet weight - dry weight) × 100/wet weight. The net change in brain water in meningitis was computed from % brain water after normalization to a constant brain weight of 500 mg. Neurological Score—Global neurological deterioration, which occurs when intracranial pressure rises, was quantified using an established neurological scale (22.Matkowskyj K.A. Marrero J.A. Carroll R.E. Danilkovich A.V. Green R.M. Benya R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G455-G462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): 1 = dead, 2 = no righting reflex, 3 = ataxia, 4 = loss of scatter reflex, and 5 = normal. Mice were scored prior to bacterial injection and every 10 h thereafter. Physiological Parameters—CSF white cell count was determined by counting cells in CSF smears after Gram stain (Remel, Lenexa, KS). The number of live bacteria in the CSF was quantified by culturing serial dilutions of CSF on trypticase soy broth agar with defibrinated sheep blood. Glucose concentrations were measured with a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra, LifeScan, Milpitas, CA) using 1-μl samples of CSF and serum. Arterial blood pressure was recorded from the carotid artery and central venous pressure from the internal jugular vein using the Biopac system. Blood, obtained from the left cardiac ventricle, was analyzed using a blood gas machine (model 248, Chiron Corp., Norwood, MA) and at the Moffitt Hospital clinical laboratory. Evans Blue Extravasation—In some experiments, Evans blue dye (Sigma) (4% in saline, 160 mg/kg) was injected into a femoral or jugular vein at 30 h after bacterial infusion. Fifteen minutes later, the left cardiac ventricle was perfused with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The brain was removed and divided into right and left hemispheres and cerebellum. Each part of the brain was immersed in 2 ml of formamide at 55 °C overnight, and the extracted dye was quantified by optical absorbance at 610 nm against Evans blue/formamide standards. For comparison, Evans blue dye extravasation was also measured 1 h following focal cortical freeze injury, performed as previously described (19.Papadopoulos M.C. Manley G.T. Krishna S. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Cortical Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Photobleaching measurements were done as described previously (23.Binder D.K. Papadopoulos M.C. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8049-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, after anesthesia the head was immobilized in a stereotactic frame and a craniotomy was fashioned to reveal the intact dura and underlying brain surface. FITC-dextran (70 kDa, 30 mg/ml, Sigma) dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid was applied to cover the exposed dura for 2 h. After loading, the dural surface was washed with dye-free artificial CSF. In some experiments, the dura was then opened and the cortical surface was exposed for 10 min to CSF that had been collected from control mice or mice with meningitis. The stereotactic frame was then transferred to the stage of an upright epifluorescence microscope. For cortical fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements, the first order beam of an argon ion laser (488 nm) diffracted by an acoustooptic modulator was focused onto the surface of the mouse brain through a dichroic mirror (510 nm) and objective lens (Nikon ×50 air). Emitted fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier. Bleaching was accomplished by increasing laser illumination intensity ∼4000-fold for 1–2 ms. Apparent diffusion coefficients in brain versus saline (D/D0) were computed from fluorescence recovery curves. Electron Microscopy—Brain ultrastructure was evaluated at 30 h after bacterial infusion. Mice were killed and the non-injected hemisphere was immersed overnight in 3% (w/v) Karnovsky fixative. Samples were postfixed in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with aqueous saturated uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined in a 1200 EX JEOL electron microscope. The astrocytic foot process cross-sectional area was measured in randomly selected transmission electron micrographs by image analysis software as described (16.Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Osmotic Water Permeability of the Blood-brain Barrier—The product of apparent osmotic water permeability of the BBB, Pf, and BBB surface area, S, was estimated experimentally from the kinetics of brain water accumulation in response to intraperitoneal injection of distilled water (200 ml/kg), according to the relation, Jv=PfSvw(ϕbrain−ϕplasma) where vw is the partial molar volume of water (0.018 cm3/mmol), ϕbrain is brain osmolality (∼310 mOsm, (24.Hatashita S. Hoff J.T. Salamat S.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow. Metab. 1988; 8: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), and ϕplasma is plasma osmolality after intraperitoneal water infusion (∼290 mOsm at 3–6 min) measured using a micro-osmometer (Micro-Osmette, Precision Systems Inc., Natick, MA). Water flux into the brain Jv was estimated by wet/dry brain weight measurements at 3 and 6 min after water injection. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, analysis of variance, and Log Rank tests. Analyses were done using WinSTAT (version 2001.1, A-Prompt, Lehigh Valley, PA) or XLStat-Pro (version 7.5, Addinsoft, Brooklyn, NY) software. Mouse Model of Meningitis—As evidenced by using Evans blue dye, fluid injected at the base of the skull rapidly distributed throughout the CSF (Fig. 1B). Histological examination of the needle tract in two wild type and two AQP4 null mice did not reveal brain abscess or significant hemorrhage (not shown). No focal histological abnormality was noted after hematoxylin/eosin staining of brain sections from these mice. The pneumococcal infection in mice showed multiple similarities to human meningitis. There was marked leukocyte infiltration of the leptomeninges in infected, but not in saline-injected mice (Fig. 1C). Inflammation was prominent in the basal meninges, but was absent from meninges overlying the hemispheric convexities, and was qualitatively similar in wild type and AQP4 null mice. Gram stain of CSF smears revealed that >90% of leukocytes were polymorphonuclear and associated with Gram-positive streptococci (Fig. 1D). The severity of pneumococcal infection in the CSF and the systemic reaction were evaluated (Fig. 1D and Table I). At 30 h after bacterial infusion, CSF leukocyte and bacterial counts were comparably elevated in wild type and AQP4-deficient mice. There was no significant difference in serum sodium concentration to account for the differential brain swelling between wild type and AQP4 null mice with meningitis (presented below). The CSF:serum glucose ratio was low in all mice with meningitis compared with saline-injected control mice. Pneumococcus-infected wild type and AQP4 null mice became comparably hypothermic, which is a manifestation of systemic sepsis, whereas three wild type and three AQP4 null mice injected with sterile saline remained normothermic. Because hypothermia can attenuate brain swelling, measurements of ICP and brain water content were performed after re-establishing normothermia using a heating lamp for 1 h prior to measurements. Arterial blood gas analysis at 30 h after bacterial infusion revealed metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Hemodynamic parameters that could independently influence ICP, including central venous and arterial blood pressures, were also comparable in wild type and AQP4 null mice.Table IPhysiological parameters (mean ± S.E.) of wild type and AQP4 null mice measured at 30 h after injection of S. pneumoniae into CSFParameterWild typenAQP4 nullnGeneral Temperature (°C)34 ± 11634 ± 116 Weight loss (%)12 ± 1149 ± 214Hemodynamics Mean arterial blood pressure (mm Hg)86 ± 3373 ± 83 Central venous pressure (mm Hg)1.4 ± 0.531.3 ± 0.43Arterial blood gases pO2 (mmHg)94 ± 7490 ± 104 pCO2 (mmHg)24 ± 1423 ± 24 pH7.25 ± 0.0147.26 ± 0.014Chemistries Serum [Na+] (mm)142 ± 32143 ± 12 CSF:blood glucose<0.25aCerebrospinal fluid glucose level below the detection limit3<0.25aCerebrospinal fluid glucose level below the detection limit3a Cerebrospinal fluid glucose level below the detection limit Open table in a new tab AQP4 Expression—Because AQP4 expression in brain is reported to be up-regulated in brain edema from multiple causes (12.Papadopoulos M.C. Krishna S. Verkman A.S. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 2002; 69: 242-248PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Badaut J. Lasbennes F. Magistretti P.J. Regli L. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), AQP4 protein expression was determined in normal mice and mice with pneumococcal meningitis. Immunoblot analysis showed AQP4 protein in brain homogenates from wild type mice as bands at ∼30 and 34 kDa representing the two AQP4 protein isoforms expressed in brain, which were absent in homogenates from AQP4 null mice (Fig. 2A). Quantitative immunoblot analysis of brain homogenates taken at 30 h after bacterial infusion indicated ∼7-fold increased AQP4 protein expression in wild type mice compared with control wild type mice. Immunohistochemistry showed AQP4 expression in wild type mice in pericapillary astrocyte foot processes, external glial limiting membrane, and ependyma (Fig. 2B). Increased AQP4 immunolabeling was found in the external glial limiting membrane, pericapillary regions, and in a fibrillary pattern throughout the brain parenchyma in meningitis (Fig. 2C). AQP4 protein was absent from the brain of an AQP4 null mouse with meningitis (Fig. 2D). Outcome Measures—After injection of pneumococcus into the CSF and recovery from anesthesia, we noted progressive global neurological deterioration of wild type and AQP4 null mice (Fig. 3A). At 30 h post-infection, AQP4 null mice showed less neurological impairment than wild type mice, as quantified by neurological score. AQP4 null mice also had significantly lower mortality than wild type mice assessed over a one-week period after bacterial infusion (Fig. 3B). Because human subjects with meningitis are likely to receive antibiotics, in the survival studies mice were treated with intraperitoneal cefotaxime (115 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days) starting at 24 h after bacterial infusion. Cefotaxime is the first line treatment for pneumococcal meningitis in humans and has good CSF penetration in meningitis (26.Aronin S.I. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2002; 3: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because the severity of CSF infection and the systemic response were similar in wild type and AQP4-deficient mice over the first 30 h, we investigated whether the improved outcome in AQP4 null mice was because of reduced brain swelling. Brain swelling was quantified using ICP and brain water content was determined from measurement of wet and dry brain weights. In wild type mice at 30 h after bacterial infusion, ICP was elevated to ∼3 times normal (Fig. 3C), and associated with a substantial increase in total brain water content (Fig. 3D). Remarkably, ICP did not rise above baseline in AQP4 null mice with meningitis, and the increase in brain water was much reduced (Fig. 3D). In control studies, there was no rise in ICP or brain water content at 30 h after injecting sterile saline into the CSF. Cytotoxic Versus Vasogenic Brain Edema in Meningitis— Because AQP4 has opposing roles in cytotoxic (16.Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) versus vasogenic (19.Papadopoulos M.C. Manley G.T. Krishna S. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) edema, we sought to determine the type(s) of edema that occur(s) in the bacterial meningitis model used here. Electron microscopy of cerebral cortex from mice with meningitis revealed swelling of pericapillary astrocyte foot processes, a marker of cytotoxic edema (Fig. 4A). Averaged pericapillary foot process area was ∼6-fold greater in brain cortex from wild type compared with AQP4 null mice, which had about the same area as non-infected control mice. No tight junction opening (the hallmark of vasogenic brain edema) was found in 20 randomly chosen capillary endothelial tight junctions from wild type and AQP4 null mice (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows that meningitis produced little increase in extravasation of Evans blue into brain compared with cortical freeze injury, an established model of vasogenic brain edema (10.Klatzo I. Acta Neurochir. Suppl. (Wien). 1994; 60: 3-6PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used as an independent method to assess cytotoxic versus vasogenic brain edema. We showed recently that diffusion of FITC-dextran in brain extracellular space is remarkably slowed in cytotoxic brain edema (23.Binder D.K. Papadopoulos M.C. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8049-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas diffusion is accelerated in vasogenic edema (27.Papadopoulos M.C. Binder D.K. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The differential response occurs because the extracellular space contracts in cytotoxic (cell swelling) brain edema, but expands in vasogenic brain edema. As shown in Fig. 5A, the diffusion of 70 kDa FITC-dextran was markedly impaired at 30 h after bacterial infusion. Consistent with previous findings (23.Binder D.K. Papadopoulos M.C. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8049-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the baseline apparent diffusion coefficient was slightly higher in AQP4 null mice. Meningitis produced greater slowing of FITC-dextran diffusion in wild type than AQP4 null mice (67 versus 39% of baseline). Mechanism by Which AQP4 Deficiency Limits Brain Edema—Two possible mechanisms were investigated to explain the reduced cytotoxic brain edema in meningitis in wild type versus AQP4 null mice: (a) greater intrinsic brain cell swelling in response to meningitis in wild type versus AQP4 null mice, and (b) reduced BBB water permeability in AQP4 null mice. To investigate mechanism a, we measured"

The molecular pathway for this arginine permeation is not understood, nor is the filtering mechanism that permits passage of charged arginines but excludes solution ions. We find that substituting the first S4 arginine with smaller amino acids opens a high-conductance pathway for solution cations in the Shaker K+ channel at rest. The cationic current does not flow through the central K+ pore and is influenced by mutation of a conserved residue in S2, suggesting that it flows through a protein pathway within the voltage-sensing domain. The current can be carried by guanidinium ions, suggesting that this is the pathway for transmembrane arginine permeation. We propose that when S4 moves it ratchets between conformations in which one arginine after another occupies and occludes to ions the narrowest part of this pathway.

Voltage-gated ion channels play fundamental roles in cell signaling, including action potential generation, transmitter and hormone secretion, and excitation-contraction coupling (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland2001Google Scholar). In these channels, gates located in a conserved central pore domain (consisting of segments S5, P, and S6) open and close in response to changes in membrane potential that are detected by the specialized voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) (consisting of segments S1, S2, S3, and S4) (Doyle et al., 1998Doyle D.A.

The S4 helix in each VSD has a series of positively charged amino acids (mostly arginines) spaced at intervals of three (Gandhi and Isacoff, 2002Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Molecular models of voltage sensing.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Movement of these arginines across the membrane electric field is the core mechanism by which the channels detect changes in membrane potential (Gandhi and Isacoff, 2002Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Molecular models of voltage sensing.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Bezanilla, 2002Bezanilla F. Voltage sensor movements.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The structure of the VSDs and the nature of the movement of S4 are matters of continuing debate. In an early model, S4 was proposed to move on its own, via axial translation and/or rotation through a “canaliculus” or “gating pore,” where its arginines are insulated from lipid by a polar protein environment (Goldstein, 1996Goldstein S.A.

Isacoff E.Y. Molecular models of voltage sensing.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the recent and radically different “paddle model,” S4 was proposed to reside at the periphery of the channel, with the arginines in the lipid, and with S4 moving jointly with S3 (Jiang et al., 2003aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

The principle of gating charge movement in a voltage-dependent K+ channel.Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that the actual structure lies somewhere in-between these extremes and that S4 is situated at the interface between lipid and the pore domain: (1) perturbation scanning on Kv2.1 and EAG channels found both low- and high-impact faces that suggest lipid and protein interaction, respectively (Li-Smerin et al., 2000Li-Smerin Y.

Wang D.N. MacKinnon R. Electron microscopic analysis of KvAP voltage-dependent K+ channels in an open conformation.Nature. 2004; 430: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the arginines of S4 interact with lipid, as proposed in the paddle model, or if they reside in a polar protein environment, as suggested by recent studies on Shaker and KvAP (Ahern and Horn, 2004Ahern C.A. Horn R. Specificity of charge-carrying residues in the voltage sensor of potassium channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Starace and Bezanilla, 2004Starace D.M. Bezanilla F.

Perozo E. Molecular architecture of the KvAP voltage-dependent K+ channel in a lipid bilayer.Science. 2004; 306: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have addressed this question in the Shaker channel by making substitutions in S4 that are expected to disfavor interaction with water and favor interaction with lipid. We find that, contrary to what one would expect if S4 arginines faced lipid, substitution with smaller hydrophobic amino acids of the first S4 arginine (R1) creates a pathway for leak by monovalent cations. This current, which we refer to as the “omega current,” is specific for mutations at R1 and flows through a pathway that is distinct from the central K+ pore. Omega current is observed only when S4 is at rest and the R1 position is deep in the span of the membrane. It can be effectively carried by guanidinium, suggesting that this is the pathway through which arginine side chains normally traverse the membrane electric field. The omega current is influenced by a mutation in S2, suggesting that S2 lines the pathway. We propose that, rather than a “gating pore,” in which S4 is entirely surrounded by protein, the key to voltage sensing is a guanidinium pore at the core of each VSD. Transmembrane movement of S4 carries arginines selectively through this pore. The absence of ion leak in wild-type channels suggests that S4 favors conformations where one of the arginines occupies and occludes the narrowest part of the pathway. One of the puzzles about VSD structure and motion is how to permit bulky S4 arginines to move reversibly and quickly through the membrane, while preventing ions from the intracellular and extracellular solutions from leaking through the same pathway. A leak through the VSDs would dissipate the local electric field that acts on S4, compromising voltage-sensing function, and could, if sufficiently large, lead to loss of the transmembrane ion gradient. In order to understand the basis of selective arginine permeation, we set out to examine the properties of this conduction pathway. We reasoned that if arginines cross the membrane through a specialized permeation pathway then there might be a way to make that pathway permeable to solution ions and thus both enable its characterization and shed light on the mechanism by which ion leak is normally prevented. We began with mutations in the Shaker potassium channel at the first S4 arginine (Shaker residue 362, referred to as R1), because this has been recently shown to support proton conduction when replaced by a histidine (Starace and Bezanilla, 2004Starace D.M. Bezanilla F. A proton pore in a potassium channel voltage sensor reveals a focused electric field.Nature. 2004; 427: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We mutated R1 to alanine, cysteine, histidine, serine, and valine. In absence of a proton gradient (at pH 7.1), we found that the alanine, cysteine, serine, and valine mutants conduct a sizable inward current upon hyperpolarization (V < −100 mV) that is absent in the wild-type channel and in the histidine mutant (Figures 1A–1E ). We refer to this as “omega current” to distinguish it from the typical “alpha current” that this and other voltage-gated channels conduct upon depolarization. Since channels with mutations R1C or R1S had the largest omega current, we focused on this mutation. We found that cysteine substitution at positions neighboring R1 (361, 363, 364, and 365), including R2 (365), showed no omega current (Figure 1F), indicating specificity for the R1 position. Treatment of R1C channels with both positively and negatively charged cysteine-modifying methane-thiosulfonate reagents (see Experimental Procedures for details) induced a shift to more negative potentials of the activation of the alpha current, as shown earlier (Larsson et al., 1996Larsson H.P.

Three transmembrane conformations and sequence-dependent displacement of the S4 domain in shaker K+ channel gating.Neuron. 1998; 20: 1283-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and eliminated the omega current (Figure 1G). This confirms that the side chain of the R1 position is critical to the appearance of the omega current. We considered two possible explanations for the omega current. The mutations at R1 could produce an abnormal opening of the central K+ pore, which is normally closed at negative voltage, or they could make the arginine pathway in the voltage sensor ion permeant. We tested these possibilities by examining the effect on the omega current of two different manipulations that alter the alpha current. We found that AgTx2, a polypeptide that blocks the extracellular mouth of the central K+ pore, inhibits the alpha current (Gross and MacKinnon, 1996Gross A. MacKinnon R. Agitoxin footprinting the Shaker potassium channel pore.Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but does not affect the omega current (Figures 2A and 2B ). In addition, closure of the K+ pore by P-type inactivation did not alter the omega current (Figures 2C and 2D). These results indicate that the omega current flows through a pathway (which we refer to as the “omega pore”) distinct from the central K+ pore. The observation that the omega current only turns on at negative voltage suggests that there may be a requirement for S4 to be in its resting conformation. To test this possibility, we exploited a specific characteristic of N-terminal ball inactivation. Opening of the internal gate of Shaker provides access for the ball to its binding site within the central K+ pore, and once the ball is bound it prevents the gate from closing and the voltage sensor from returning to the resting conformation (Bezanilla et al., 1991Bezanilla F. Perozo E. Papazian D.M. Stefani E. Molecular basis of gating charge immobilization in Shaker potassium channels.Science. 1991; 254: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This “immobilization” lasts until the ball unbinds. We compared the onset of omega current in response to hyperpolarizing steps before and after an inactivating depolarization and found that ball inactivation significantly slows the rate at which the omega current turns on (Figure 3). The result is consistent with a requirement for S4 to be in its resting conformation. Thus, the omega current can serve as a real-time indicator of the conformational state of the VSD. If the omega conducting state were the resting state of the VSD, then one would expect to see a correlation between the voltage dependencies of the omega current and gating charge movement (Q-V). This is indeed what we observed. We measured the Q-V of Shaker R1C (Figure 4A , upper panel) and found that it has two components: a large component of the charge moves over the range of wild-type activation (from −100 to 0 mV) and a smaller component (∼20%) moves at more negative voltages (<−100 mV). This split Q-V in R1C resembles what is seen with analogous mutations of R2 (e.g., Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996Aggarwal S.K. MacKinnon R.

We find that the activation of the omega current occurs in the voltage range of the small component of the Q-V (Figure 4A, lower panel), supporting the notion that the resting state of S4 is the omega conducting state.

We therefore looked for a way of determining whether S4 motion is responsible for the small component of the Q-V in the R1 mutant channel and the turn-on of the omega conductance. For this purpose, we used fluorescence to monitor S4 motion directly. To do this, we mutated R1 to serine, rather than cysteine, so that it would not be labeled with the fluorophore. The R1S channel was also engineered to contain a cysteine at position 356, which we labeled with the thiol-reactive fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Figure 4B, upper panel). Position 356, located in the S3b-S4 loop near S4, was previously shown to be exposed to the extracellular solution both in the activated and resting states (Larsson et al., 1996Larsson H.P.

Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Direct physical measure of conformational rearrangement underlying potassium channel gating.Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We compared the fluorescence recordings with 356C-TMRM in Shaker R1 and in Shaker R1S. In labeled R1 channels, the largest fluorescence change was found to occur between −100 and 0 mV, the normal voltage range of activation, whereas in labeled R1S channels it occurred between −200 and −60 mV (Figure 4B, upper panel; open and filled circles, respectively), the voltage range over which the omega current turned on (Figure 4B, lower panel). The shift of the major fluorescence component to more negative potentials in R1S channels was consistent with the negative shift of a component of the Q-V measurement in R1C channels, thus indicating that more negative potentials are required to fully deactivate S4 when its first arginine is substituted with the smaller uncharged side chains. Together, the fluorescence and charge measurements are consistent with omega conductance of R1X channels turning on when S4 is in its resting position. In presence of a proton gradient, Starace and Bezanilla, 2004Starace D.M. Bezanilla F. A proton pore in a potassium channel voltage sensor reveals a focused electric field.Nature. 2004; 427: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar observed a proton current in the Shaker R1H mutant at negative voltages. In absence of proton gradient, at near neutral pH, inward proton current in R1H was too small for us to detect (Figure 1E). In contrast, in R1C the omega current at −200 mV was about 6% of the alpha current at +60 mV. This size of the current at such low proton concentration suggests that it is unlikely to be carried by protons. Indeed, we found that a 10-fold increase of the proton concentration in the pipette did not alter the omega current (data not shown). If the omega current is not carried by protons, then what ions do generate this current? We used ion substitution to try to identify these ions. Replacing chloride with the large organic anion methane-sulphonate (MES−) in both pipette and bath solutions (see Experimental Procedures for details) did not alter the omega current (Figure 5A ), indicating that the current is likely not carried by anions. The omega current was, however, affected by exchanging potassium with lithium or cesium in the pipette solution (Figure 5B). The order of permeation efficiency was Cs+ > K+ > Li+. The preference for the larger cations was weak (PCs/PK = 1.23 ± 0.11, n = 9; PLi/PK = 0.24 ± 0.05, n = 8; see Experimental Procedures) in contrast to the high selectivity of the central K+ pore. Our finding that substitution of an S4 arginine with smaller amino acids opened a conductance that selects against anions and has a weak selectivity between cations suggested to us that it could flow through the pathway normally taken by the arginine side chains. To examine this possibility, we asked if guanidinium ions could also carry the current. We found that guanidinium ions do carry an omega current. The guanidinium current is larger than that carried by the other cations and is not seen in oocytes expressing wild-type Shaker with its R1 intact (Figure 5C). The guanidinium omega current appears at membrane potentials less negative than those required to activate the current carried by other ions (compare filled squares and gray line in Figure 5C at V < −100 mV). As a result, the ratio between guanidinium and potassium omega currents, measured at the same voltage over the range −250 to −150 mV, increases from a value of 3.0 ± 0.5 (−250 mV, n = 11) to a value of 8.1 ± 2.4 (−150 mV, n = 12). A possible explanation for the shift in activation of the guanidinium omega current is that the occupancy of the omega pore by guanidinium stabilizes the resting conformation of Shaker R1C, so that, to reach the resting/omega-conducting conformation of the channel, less negative voltages are required. What is the environment of the R1 position that permits cations to flow at a high rate when the arginine is substituted with amino acids with small hydrophobic side chains? We examined one position, glutamate 283 in S2, because it appears to interact electrostatically with S4 arginines (Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 2000Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Lin M.A. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Voltage-dependent structural interactions in the Shaker K(+) channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The conservative mutation E283D produced a 6-fold increase (6.0 ± 1.1, n = 6) in the omega conductance (Figures 6A and 6B ). The region around position 283 is highly accessible to the external solution in both the resting and activated states, although 283 itself is not very accessible (283C is modified by MTSET ∼1000-fold more slowly than 356C, a site that is highly accessible to MTS reagents [Larsson et al., 1996Larsson H.P.

This suggests that the outer end of S2 lines the external vestibule of the omega pore and that, when S4 is at rest, E283 lies near R1 in the narrow part of the omega pore. The homologous position to E283 in EAG channels has been shown to influence the occupancy by external Mg2+ of a specialized S2/S3 binding site in EAG channels (Silverman et al., 2000Silverman W.R. Tang C.Y. Mock A.F. Huh K.B. Papazian D.M. Mg(2+) modulates voltage-dependent activation in ether-a-go-go potassium channels by binding between transmembrane segments S2 and S3.J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 663-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When bound, Mg2+ stabilizes the resting conformation of S4 (Schonherr et al., 2002Schonherr R. Mannuzzu L.M. Isacoff E.Y. Heinemann S.H. Conformational switch between slow and fast gating modes: allosteric regulation of voltage sensor mobility in the EAG K+ channel.Neuron. 2002; 35: 935-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting proximity between its binding site and S4. If Shaker had a vestibule similar to that used by Mg2+ to reach its binding site in EAG channels, then we would predict that Mg2+ would have access to the omega pore. Indeed, we found that extracellular Mg2+ effectively blocks the omega current (Figure 6B). Together these findings suggest that at negative voltage external cations enter a vestibule located between S2, S3 and the most N-terminal part of S4. Once in the vestibule, they can permeate into the cell if Shaker’s S4 is in the resting conformation and R1 is substituted with a smaller amino acid. The VSDs in Shaker R1C are permeable to guanidinium, but in Shaker R1 they are not ion-conducting. This could mean that, when the omega pore is occupied by the guanidino moiety of an S4 arginine, no more space is left for other ions to pass. We found that ethyl-guanidinium blocks the omega current carried by potassium in E283D/R1C channels (Figure 6C) while guanidinium does not (data not shown), suggesting that the omega pore is right the size to accommodate an arginine side chain but not much more. We found that the ratio between the omega chord conductance of Shaker E283D/R1C measured at –270 mV and the corresponding alpha chord conductance measured at +80 mV was 0.79 ± 0.09 (n = 6). If we assume a maximal open probability for the omega pore of one, a single alpha conductance of 10 pS, and if we take into account that there are four VSDs per channel, we can estimate the single VSD conductance to be ∼0.6 pS. The value could be even larger, as suggested by the fact that, while the alpha chord and slope conductances are approximately the same, the omega slope conductance is about five times higher than the corresponding chord conductance ([dI/dV]−270/[Gchord]−270 = 4.94 ± 0.15, n = 6). In the lower estimate, the flux rate at −270 mV through a single omega pore is ∼106 ions per second. The crystal structure of KvAP led to the proposal of the paddle model to describe the movement of S4 in response to voltage change (Jiang et al., 2003aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. X-ray structure of a voltage-dependent K+ channel.Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 2003bJiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. The principle of gating charge movement in a voltage-dependent K+ channel.Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In this model, the transmembrane movement of S4 arginines takes place within the lipid phase and no cation-conducting pore is predicted. The notion that S4 is in contact with lipid is supported by recent electron microscopy images of KvAP that show S4 to be at the channel perimeter (Jiang et al., 2004Jiang Q.X. Wang"
https://openalex.org/W1984661089,"Cytokine production plays a critical role in diseases caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Here we show that a latent KSHV gene product, kaposin B, increases the expression of cytokines by blocking the degradation of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Cytokine transcripts are normally unstable because they contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3' noncoding regions that target them for degradation. Kaposin B reverses this instability by binding to and activating the kinase MK2, a target of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and a known inhibitor of ARE-mRNA decay. These findings define an important mechanism linking latent KSHV infection to cytokine production, and also illustrate a distinctive mode by which viruses can selectively modulate mRNA turnover."

We found that in Drosophila , Protein O -fucosyltransferase 1 (OFUT1), an enzyme that glycosylates epidermal growth factor–like domains of Notch, also has a distinct Notch chaperone activity. OFUT1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein, and its localization was essential for function in vivo. OFUT1 could bind to Notch, was required for the trafficking of wild-type Notch out of the endoplasmic reticulum, and could partially rescue defects in secretion and ligand binding associated with Notch point mutations. This ability of OFUT1 to facilitate folding of Notch did not require its fucosyltransferase activity. Thus, a glycosyltransferase can bind its substrate in the endoplasmic reticulum to facilitate normal folding."
https://openalex.org/W2141876100,"Discriminating the direction of motion of a low-contrast pattern becomes easier with increasing stimulus area. However, increasing the size of a high-contrast pattern makes it more difficult for observers to discriminate motion. This surprising result, termed spatial suppression, is thought to be mediated by a form of center-surround suppression found throughout the visual pathway. Here, we examine the counterintuitive hypothesis that aging alters such center-surround interactions in ways that improve performance in some tasks. We found that older observers required briefer stimulus durations than did younger observers to extract information about stimulus direction in conditions using large, high-contrast patterns. We suggest that this age-related improvement in motion discrimination may be linked to reduced GABAergic functioning in the senescent brain, which reduces center-surround suppression in motion-selective neurons."

This pattern could result from natural selection for specific allometries or from developmental constraints on patterns of differential growth. We performed artificial selection on the allometry between forewing area and body size in a butterfly to test for developmental constraints, and then used the resultant increased range of phenotypic variation to quantify natural selection on the scaling relationship. Our results show that the short-term evolution of allometries is not limited by developmental constraints. Instead, scaling relationships are shaped by strong natural selection."

These lines of evidence led to us investigate the binding mode of 15d-PGJ2 to the PPARγ LBD. While we built a model structure of 15d-PGJ2-PPARγ complex, we became aware of the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 covalently binds to the PPARγ LBD. Here, we have shown that an α,β-unsaturated ketone is a core moiety of endogenous PPARγ ligands. The ligands containing the α,β-unsaturated ketone can covalently bind to a cysteine residue in PPARγ LBD through a Michael addition, and the covalent binding is required for PPARγ activation by these ligands. According to this core moiety, we have identified oxidized eicosanoids, including 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (ETE), 15-oxoETE, 15-oxo-eicosadecaenoic acid (EDE), 15-keto-prostaglandin E2, 15-keto-prostaglandin E1 (15-keto-PGE1), 15-keto-prostaglandin F2α (15-keto-PGF2), and 15-keto-prostaglandin F1α (15-keto-PGF1), as novel endogenous PPARγ ligands. We analyzed the structure-activity relationship of these oxidized prostaglandins in PPARγ activation. We also discuss the biological connection between the ligand synthesis and PPARγ function. Chemicals—PPARγ ligands and eicosanoids were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. or Alexis Corporation (Lausen, Switzerland). Rhodamine-maleimide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Reagents for animal cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or WAKO (Osaka, Japan). Plasmids—For bacterial expression of the PPARγ LBD, a PPARγ fragment containing amino acid residues 195–477 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides (5′-GA CAT ATG GCG GAG ATC TCC AGT and 5′-G CGG ATC CTA GTA CAA GTC CTT G; underlines indicate introduced NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively) and subcloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET28a (Invitrogen).

TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis—After the PPARγ LBD protein was incubated with the ligands, the protein solution was mixed with 33% acetonitolyl saturated with sinopinic acid at a 1:1 ratio. Then, 2 μl of the sample was spotted onto the grid and dried completely under vacuum. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry spectrum was obtained with a Voyager Elite (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Rhodamine-Maleimide Assay—The purified PPARγ LBD (0.1 μm) was mixed with various ligands at the indicated concentrations in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After SDS was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 0.5%, rhodamine-maleimide and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were added to the mixture to 0.2 and 1 mm final concentrations, respectively. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and were separated by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent signals derived from rhodamine were visualized by a FM-BIO II (Hitachi). Calculation of Binding Constant—We calculated the kon values of irreversible binding of ligands as follows. [NR]+[ligand]→[NR−ligand](binding constant=kon) [NR] total=a,[ligand] total=b,[NR−ligand]=x Here, NR and NR-ligand indicate a nuclear receptor and a ligand-conjugated nuclear receptor, respectively. The reaction speed at certain time (t) is shown as Equation 1. dx/dt=kon(a−x)(b−x) (Eq. 3) If a is not equal to b, Equation 1 can be converted to Equation 2. kont=ln[{b(a−x)}/{a(b−x)}]/(a−b) (Eq. 4) If a is equal to b, Equation 1 can be converted to Equation 3. kont=x/{a(a−x)} (Eq. 5) We obtained the kon value after nonlinear least square fitting of the data using Equation 2 and Equation 3 by the Newton method. We calculated the Kd value of competitors as follows. [NR] free+[competitor] total⇆[NR:competitor](binding constant=Kα) [NR] total=a,[ligand] total=b,[ligand−conjugated NR]=x,[competitor] total=c,[competitor] free=f,[NR] free=A,[NR:competitor]=d Here, NR:competitor indicates a reversible complex between a competitor and a nuclear receptor. The reaction equilibrium constant is shown as Equation 4. Kaamp;=d/AfKaamp;=d/(a−x−d)(c−d) (Eq. 8) The reaction speed of the covalent binding at certain time (t) is shown as Equation 5. dx/dt=kon(a−x−d)(b−x) (Eq. 9) We obtained the Ka value after nonlinear square fitting of the data with the values generated by a differential equation modified from Equations 4 and 5. Kd was obtained as 1/Ka. Measurement of UV Spectra—Samples were mixed at indicated concentrations and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. UV spectra between 250 and 400 nm were recorded using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. For graphical presentation, UV spectrum of PPARγ alone was subtracted from that of the ligand-PPARγ mixture. Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—Cell culture, transient transfection, and luciferase assay were described previously (24.Shiraki T. Sakai N. Kanaya E. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we measured the fluorescence of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein as an internal control of transfection efficiency, using a Fusion α (PerkinElmer, Inc.). Model Building—The 15d-PGJ2-PPARγ covalently bound complex was built using the crystal structure of the PPARγ-BRL49653-coactivator peptide complex (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FM6) (12.Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) as the template. The force field and programs used for the potential-energy calculations of the PPARγ and the coactivator peptide were described in a previous report (25.Shiraki T. Kodama T.S. Jingami H. Kamiya N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinf. 2005; 58: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One of the conformations of 15d-PGJ2, which was randomly generated with a molecular dynamics simulation at 400 K in vacuo, was introduced into the ligand binding pocket of PPARγ by visual manipulation. Here, the carboxyl group and the cyclopentenone ring in 15d-PGJ2 were placed in the vicinity of the BRL49653 head group and the sulfur atom in Cys-285, respectively. All of the Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, and His residues and the carboxyl group in 15d-PGJ2 were treated as the charged forms. Force field parameters for 15d-PGJ2 covalently bound to Cys-285 were taken from those of the analogous fragments in the AMBER general force field (www.amber.scripps.edu/) for the organic molecule data base. Its partial charges were obtained from charge fitting with the RESP program (26.Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9620-9631Crossref Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) (www.amber.scripps.edu/Questions/resp.html) after geometry optimization with the Gaussian 98 program (27.Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W.

The potential energy of the complex was minimized by using the conjugated gradient method via the following steps. First, the geometry of 15d-PGJ2-conjugated Cys-285 in PPARγ was allowed to be flexible while the position of the other part was restrained with a harmonic potential, and then all of the complex was allowed to be flexible without restraint. After the energy minimization procedures, a 100-ps heating from 0 to 300 K and a 500-ps equilibration were done. Subsequently, a 500-ps sampling simulation was executed. Here, all of the main-chain atoms of PPARγ and the coactivator peptide were restrained by applying a harmonic potential to the minimized conformation, and the time step of the molecular dynamics simulation was 1 fs. Finally, the closest structure to the average of the sampled ones was chosen as the complex model. Reverse Transcription-PCR—THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and treated with ligands for 10 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and total RNA was purified from cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quality of isolated RNA was determined by electrophoresis. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase (Promega) with an oligo(dT)15 primer. PCR primers were designed according to the uniSTS data base; detail is available upon request. PCR products were separated by PAGE and stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes). Images of the gels were obtained by the FM-BIO II (Hitachi). Model Building of the 15d-PGJ2-PPARγ Complex—As the first step toward understanding the binding mechanism of the natural PPARγ ligands, we built a model structure of the 15d-PGJ2-PPARγ complex according to the superimposed structures of the PPARγ LBD complexed with several synthetic ligands (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1KNU, 1FM6, 1I7I, 4PRG). In the superimposed structures, the polar part of the ligands tended to localize near helix 12 of PPARγ and the non-polar part near helix 3 (Fig. 1A). To fit 15d-PGJ2 to the binding site of BRL49653, we considered four possible orientations of 15d-PGJ2 in the PPARγ ligand binding pocket (Fig. 1B). In the models, the cyclopentenone ring (Fig. 1B, a and b) or the carboxyl group (Fig. 1B, c and d) of 15d-PGJ2 could be assigned as a polar moiety. In the latter case, we noticed that a cysteine residue (Cys-285) of PPARγ located at close proximity to the electrophilic carbon(s) of an α,β-unsaturated ketone in 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1B, c and d). The PPARγ ligand binding pocket was large enough to accommodate 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1C). Covalent Binding of 15d-PGJ2 to PPARγ LBD—The model building described above raised the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 is bound to PPARγ covalently. To test this possibility, we performed a mass spectroscopy experiment. Generally, macromolecules such as proteins are denatured during MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analyses, and so small molecules, such as ligands, are detached from the proteins. Actually, with or without the synthetic ligand BRL49653, the PPARγ LBD showed the same molecular weight as that calculated from the amino acid composition (MW = 34, 534) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in the presence of 15d-PGJ2, the PPARγ LBD exhibited a higher molecular weight, which was close to the molecular weight of the PPARγ LBD plus 15d-PGJ2 (calculated MW = 34, 850) (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that 15d-PGJ2 was bound to PPARγ even after the PPARγ was denatured and suggested that 15d-PGJ2 covalently bound to PPARγ. To confirm that 15d-PGJ2 modifies the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD, we took advantage of rhodamine-maleimide to label free cysteine residues in proteins. Fortunately, there is only one cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD. In these experiments, we denatured the protein by adding 0.5% SDS after ligand-protein complex formation, to facilitate rhodamine-maleimide access to the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD (Fig. 2B). The amount of the rhodamine-maleimide-labeled PPARγ LBD decreased by incubating with 15d-PGJ2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), indicating that 15d-PGJ2 covalently bound to the cysteine residue of PPARγ. Based on the irreversible binding reaction model, we calculated kon value of 15d-PGJ2 as 47,165.3 m−1 min−1. We next added the known PPARγ ligands to the reaction mixture simultaneously with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 2D). Excess amount of the competitors can occupy the ligand binding pocket, and so 15d-PGJ2 cannot reach to the cysteine residue. Then addition of 0.5% SDS removes the non-covalently bound competitors, with the result that the cysteine residue in the denatured PPARγ LBD can be labeled by rhodamine-maleimide. This result indicates that the non-covalent ligands and 15d-PGJ2 share their binding site. Using the kon value of 15d-PGJ2, the Kd values of BRL49653, MCC-555, and 13(S)-HODE were calculated to be 129 nm, 577 nm, and 199 μm, respectively. Rhodamine-maleimide assay revealed that 15d-PGJ2 specifically modified the cysteine residue of the PPARγ LBD. Concomitantly, 15d-PGJ2 itself must be modified by binding to the PPARγ LBD. Then, we measured the UV spectrum of 15d-PGJ2 in the absence or presence of the PPARγ LBD (Fig. 3A). In the absence of the PPARγ LBD, 15d-PGJ2 showed peak absorbance at 320 nm (Fig. 3A, a, thin line). After incubating with the PPARγ LBD, the resultant peak absorbance of 15d-PGJ2 shifted to 295 nm (Fig. 3A, a, thick line). This blue shift of the peak absorbance was also observed even when 15d-PGJ2 was incubated in a free cysteine solution (Fig. 3A, b). However, the resultant peak absorbance was 310 nm, which was different from the PPARγ-induced peak absorbance but rather similar to that of a 15d-PGJ2 analogue, CAY10410, which lacks the cyclopentenone ring (Fig. 3A, c, thick line). The results suggested that the cysteine residue of the PPARγ LBD targeted an electrophilic carbon within 15d-PGJ2 that is different from that of free cysteine targets. Considering the similarity of the peak absorbance, the free cysteine may target C9 of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3B), whereas the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD may target C13 of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3B). The amplitude of the UV spectrum of CAY10410 was reduced by binding to PPARγ (Fig. 3A, c), whose peak absorbance was probably shifted to a shorter wavelength than that we had measured. The result indicated that the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD may also target C13 of CAY10410 (Fig. 3B) as well as 15d-PGJ2. Covalent Binding of Natural Ligands to PPARγ—PPARγ is reportedly activated by several natural and synthetic ligands (5.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) showed that oxidized fatty acids, e.g. 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and 9- and 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (oxoODE) derived from oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), activated PPARγ and mediated the cellular effect of oxLDL in macrophages. Then we assessed whether such known PPARγ ligands possess the ability to bind covalently to PPARγ. We showed that the molecules (e.g. 15d-PGJ2, CAY10410, 9-oxoODE, 13-oxoODE, and T0070907) covalently bound to the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD in the rhodamine-maleimide assay (Fig. 4A). CAY10410 also showed weaker blocking activity than 15d-PGJ2. The natural ligands and CAY10410, which covalently bound to the PPARγ LBD, share the common chemical structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone (Fig. 4B, boxes). Although 9(S)-HODE and 13(S)-HODE have structures quite similar to those of 9-oxoODE and 13-oxoODE, respectively, they lack an α,β-unsaturated ketone and did not covalently bind to the PPARγ LBD, indicating that the α,β-unsaturated ketone was a crucial structure for the covalent binding. It is reported that synthetic ligands GW9662, T0070907, and L-764406 covalently bind to the cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD (21.Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K.

In this assay, we were able to confirm the cysteine modification by T0070907 (Fig. 4A), which has been shown to react with the cysteine residue of the PPARγ LBD through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the chlorine in the structure (21.Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.-L. Li Y. J. Biol.

Because the cysteine residue of the PPARγ LBD targets the β-carbon in the α,β-unsaturated ketone, as shown in Fig. 3, the different mode of action was evident between the 15d-PGJ2-represented natural ligands and these synthetic ligands. Although the binding mode by 15d-PGJ2, 9-oxoODE and 13-oxoODE was achieved by the same chemical reaction, they showed different IC50 to block the rhodamine-maleimide to label the free cysteine residue in the PPARγ LBD (Fig. 4C). We calculated the kon values of 15d-PGJ2, 13-oxoODE, and 9-oxoODE as 47,165.3, 8,073.7, and 1,535.3 m−1 min−1, respectively. Requirement of the Covalent Binding for PPARγ Activation—We evaluated the relationship between the binding modes of the ligands and their activities in a cell-based transcription assay (Fig. 5A). BRL49653 was the most potent activator of PPARγ among the ligands we tested (Fig. 5A, left panel). CAY10410 showed transcriptional activity similar to that of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5A, middle panel). On the other hand, when we compared the activities of structurally related molecules, e.g. 13(S)-HODE versus 13-oxoODE and 9(S)-HODE versus 9-oxoODE (Fig. 5A, right panel), the ligands that covalently bound to PPARγ always showed significantly higher activities than the analogous ligands lacking an α,β-unsaturated ketone. This result is consistent with a previous report that oxo metabolites showed greater activities and affinities than HODE did (7.Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the covalent binding to the receptor helped the ligands to activate PPARγ. We made three PPARγ mutants with the cysteine exchanged to alanine (C285A), valine (C285V), or serine (C285S). All of the mutants were still activated by BRL49653 at levels equivalent to that of the wild type PPARγ, whereas they totally lost responsiveness to 15d-PGJ2 and 13-oxoODE (Fig. 5B). Thus, these putative natural ligands indeed functioned as ligands, via novel covalent binding to the"
https://openalex.org/W2040997299,"Recent results suggest that long-lasting potentiation at hippocampal synapses involves the rapid formation of clusters or puncta of presynaptic as well as postsynaptic proteins, both of which are blocked by antagonists of NMDA receptors and an inhibitor of actin polymerization. We have investigated whether the increase in puncta involves retrograde signaling through the NO-cGMP-cGK pathway and also examined the possible roles of two classes of molecules that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: Ena/VASP proteins and Rho GTPases. Our results suggest that NO, cGMP, cGK, actin, and Rho GTPases including RhoA play important roles in the potentiation and act directly in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, where they contribute to the increase in puncta of synaptic proteins. cGK phosphorylates synaptic VASP during the potentiation, whereas Rho GTPases act both in parallel and upstream of cGMP, in part by maintaining the synaptic localization of soluble guanylyl cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W2047764073,"Functional involvement of the Notch pathway in osteoblastic differentiation has been previously investigated using the truncated intracellular domain, which mimics Notch signaling by interacting with the DNA-binding protein CBF-1. However, it is unclear whether Notch ligands Delta1 and Jagged1 also induce an identical cellular response in osteoblastic differentiation. We have shown that both Delta1 and Jagged1 were expressed concomitantly with Notch1 in maturating osteoblastic cells during bone regeneration and that overexpressed and immobilized recombinant Delta1 and Jagged1 alone did not alter the differentiated state of MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells. However, they augmented bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2)-induced alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of several differentiation markers, except for osteocalcin, and ultimately enhanced calcified nodule and in vivo ectopic bone formation of MC3T3-E1. In addition, both ligands transmitted signal through the CBF-1-dependent pathway and stimulated the expression of HES-1, a direct target of Notch pathway. To test the necessity of Notch signaling in BMP2-induced differentiation, Notch signaling was inhibited by the dominant negative extracellular domain of Notch1, specific inhibitor, or small interference RNA. These treatments decreased alkaline phosphatase activity as well as the expression of other differentiation markers and inhibited the promoter activity of Id-1, a target gene of the BMP pathway. These results indicate the functional redundancy between Delta1 and Jagged1 in osteoblastic differentiation whereby Delta1/Jagged1-activated Notch1 enhances BMP2-induced differentiation through the identical signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data also suggest that functional Notch signaling is essential not only for BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation but also for BMP signaling itself.

Notch signaling pathway is highly conserved beyond species and plays a critical role in a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Hansson E.M. Lendahl U. Chapman G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To date, four Notch receptors (Notch1–4) and five of their ligands (Delta1, -3, -4 and Jagged1, -2) have been identified in mammalians; all are single-span transmembrane polypeptides that act by cell-to-cell contact (2Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Notch receptors contain 36 epidermal growth factor-like repeats and 3 cysteine-rich Notch/LIN-12 repeats in a large extracellular domain and 6 tandem cdc10/ankyrin repeats, a glutamine-rich domain, and a PEST sequence in an intracellular domain. Notch ligands also contain epidermal growth factor repeats in the extracellular domain in addition to a unique cysteine-rich N-terminal region referred to as the Delta:Serrate:LAG2 (DSL) domain, but their intracellular domains are small and poorly conserved. The interaction of Notch with the ligands induces the nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch as a result of proteolytic cleavage at the juxtamembrane portion. In the nuclei, the intracellular domain interacts with CSL DNA-binding proteins, including CBF1/RBP-J, and transactivates target genes such as hairy enhancer of split-1 (HES-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HES, hairy/enhancer of split; BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein-2; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Col1α, type 1 collagen; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; siRNA, small interference RNA; NICD, intracellular domain of Notch1; DN-Notch, dominant negative NOTCH. and HES-5. In an alternative pathway, Notch receptors have also been reported to transmit signal through CSL-independent pathways by interacting with other signaling molecules, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, Src, and nuclear factor κB (3Small D.

Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but its functional role in bone development has been poorly understood as mice deficient in Notch1, Jagged1, or Delta1 die at an early embryonic stage before bone formation due to impaired somatogenesis and/or vascularization (6Swiatek P.J.

In contrast, the in vitro potential of Notch pathway in osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis has been investigated in several reports. Notch activation reduces the surface expression of c-Fms, which is a receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor, in osteoclast precursor cells and enhances the expression of osteoprotegerin in stromal cells, which results in the down-regulation of osteoclastogenesis (9Yamada T.

However, controversial results have been obtained with respect to osteoblastic differentiation. Continuous expression of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD), believed to act as a constitutive active form by retrovirus system or by an ordinary stable transfection study, inhibits bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 2-induced osteoblast differentiation in osteoblast precursor cells, including MC3T3-E1 (10Sciaudone M. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Shindo K. Kawashima N. Sakamoto K. Yamaguchi A. Umezawa A. Takagi M. Katsube K. Suda H. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transient expression of NICD by the adenovirus system in MC3T3-E1 cells leads to an enhanced bone mineral deposition (12Tezuka K. Yasuda M. Watanabe N. Morimura N. Kuroda K. Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, despite these results, it is critical to determine whether Notch ligands Delta and Jagged have an identical function in osteoblastic differentiation because these ligands have been shown to exert distinct activity in certain cells (13Amsen D.

Moreover, it is also unclear whether Notch signaling itself is required for the osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMP2. The interaction between Notch and BMP has been demonstrated to be crucial for endothelial cell migration and myogenic differentiation (15Dahlqvist C. Blokzijl A. Chapman G. Falk A. Dannaeus K. Ibanez C.F. Lendahl U. Development. 2003; 130: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Itoh F. Itoh S. Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Iso T. Dotto G.P. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Kato M. Dijke EMBO J. 2004; 23: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To clarify the functional involvement of Delta/Jagged-Notch signaling pathway in osteoblastic differentiation, we first confirmed the expression of Notch, Delta, and Jagged by immunohistochemistry in an in vivo bone regeneration model. We then addressed the functional difference between Delta1 and Jagged1 by transient transfection study and by using recombinant proteins in MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells. We also clarified the essential role of Notch1 signaling in BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation by inhibiting Notch signaling with the dominant negative form of Notch1, a specific inhibitor, and siRNA. Bone Regeneration Model and Immunostaining—Bone defects (1.2-mm diameter) were created in the diaphysis of unilateral femurs of 8-week-old C57BL6/J mice using a dental drill with copious saline irrigation. Notch expression was analyzed after 5, 10, and 15 days of operation. For isolation of RNA, the femur was dissected into 8-mm-long pieces containing the bone defect using a bone saw. For immunohistochemistry, the animals were perfusion-fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid, and embedded in paraffin. The deparaffinized sections were preincubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, followed by 10% horse serum for 1 h. The slides were incubated with primary antibody for Notch1 (UBI) and Delta1 (F-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Jagged1 (188323; R&D Systems) for 2 h at room temperature. These primary antibodies were detected by donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 and sheep anti-rabbit Alexa 526 (Molecular Probe) and visualized by confocal laser microscopy (LSM5 PASCAL; Carl Zeiss) as described previously (17Iioka T. Furukawa K. Yamaguchi A. Shindo H. Yamashita S. Tsukazaki T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To detect the active form of Notch1, the section was incubated with anti-cleaved (Val1744) antibody (Cell Signaling), and color was developed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody with diaminobenzidine as a substrate. Plasmid Constructs—Expression vectors for the full length of Jagged1 and Delta1 include human cDNA (4Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C.

ALP (alkaline phosphatase)-luc and OSE-luc contain the –1838/+81 promoter region of the mouse ALP gene and six copies of the Runx2 binding site on the osteocalcin 2 promoter, respectively (20Hirata K.

The Id-1 reporter includes four tandem copies of the Smad1 binding site on the human Id-1 core promoter (21Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). HES-1-luc contains the –87 to –51 promoter fragment of the human HES-1 gene. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay— C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, and C2C12 cells were obtained from Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). C3H10T1/2 and MC3T3-E1 were maintained in Eagle's α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen), 50 units/ml penicillin-G, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics. Primary osteoblastic cells were isolated enzymatically from newborn mouse calvariae as described previously (22Wada Y. Kataoka H. Yokose S. Ishizuya T. Miyazono K. Gao Y.H. Shibasaki Y. Yamaguchi A. Bone. 1998; 22: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and maintained in the same condition. Mesenchymal cells in bone marrow were obtained from mouse femurs as described elsewhere. Transfection of the plasmid DNA was performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were incubated with or without BMP2, which was kindly provided by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection by the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The processes of ligand preparation and coating on the culture dish have also been described previously (9Yamada T. Yamazaki H. Yamane T. Yoshino M. Okuyama H. Tsuneto M. Kurino T. Hayashi S. Sakano S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2227-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ALP Staining and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay of Osteocalcin—ALP activity was determined by histochemical technique using naphthol AS-MX phosphate and fast blue BB salt as described previously (20Hirata K. Tsukazaki T. Kadowaki A. Furukawa K. Shibata Y. Moriishi T. Okubo Y. Bessho K. Komori T. Mizuno A. Yamaguchi A. Bone. 2003; 32: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The concentration of osteocalcin in the condition medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biomedical Technologies). In Vivo Bone Formation—MC3T3-E1 cells (3 × 105 in number) were inoculated into poly-d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid/gelatin sponge (PGS) (kindly provided by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.), a scaffold carrier that was preincubated with 1 μg of either BMP2, Delta1, and/or Jagged1. The PGS/cell complex was then transplanted into the subfascial region of nude mice as described previously (20Hirata K. Tsukazaki T. Kadowaki A. Furukawa K. Shibata Y. Moriishi T. Okubo Y. Bessho K. Komori T. Mizuno A. Yamaguchi A. Bone. 2003; 32: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and subjected to soft x-ray imaging and histological analysis 2 weeks after transplantation. siRNA and Immunoblotting—siRNA specific for mouse Notch1 was introduced into MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells at the final concentration of 1 mm with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNAs designed for Notch1 were as follows: RNAi1, AGGCAACAGUGAAGAAGAAGAAGAU; RNAi2, CCAACAAGGACAUGCAGAACAACAA; RNAi3, UGAGACAGGCAACAGUGAAGAAGAA. All of these duplex siRNAs carry the overhanging AG and UA extranucleotides for sense and antisense sites, respectively (iGENE, Tsukuba, Japan). The scramble sequence ACGCGUAACGCGGGAAUUU was used as the control. Four hours later, the cells were incubated with or without recombinant human BMP2 and subjected to luciferase assay, ALP staining, or immunoblot analysis. For immunoblotting, the transfected cells were harvested in a buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and the supernatant was resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Notch1 expression was detected by anti-Notch1 cytoplasm antibody (UBI) and ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time PCR—cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer, and the mRNA expression was quantified by the Light Cycler system (Roche Diagnostics). Primer sequences, MgCl2 concentration, and the annealing temperature are available on request. The relative amount of mRNA was determined at 50% levels of PCR product and normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Notch Expression during Bone Regeneration—Notch receptors and their ligands have been demonstrated to express in certain osteoblastic cells, but their in vivo expression profile remains unclear. To clarify this, immunohistochemical analysis of Delta1, Jagged1, and Notch1 was performed using an adult mouse femur carrying a bone defect in the diaphysis. Immunoreactivity to Notch1 was subtle in untreated femurs. However, strong expression was detected in the mesenchymal cells that had migrated into the bone defect 5 days after injury (Fig. 1, A and B). At this stage, Delta1 was also expressed, and confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated extensive colocalization between Notch1 and Delta1. Immunostaining with Jagged1 on day 10, when the cortical bone was in a reconstruction phase, showed that both Notch1 and Jagged1 colocalized in the osteoblasts on the surface of the trabeculae. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies that recognize the active form of Notch1 (23Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) showed that the Notch1 signal is activated in the osteoblasts and chondrocytes appeared around the bone defect (Fig. 1D). Real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression of Notch1, Delta1, and Jagged1 was temporarily up-regulated on day 5 after the drill hole injury was introduced (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the Notch1 signal is activated in osteoblast-committed cells during bone regeneration via up-regulation of Delta1 and Jagged1. ALP Activity and Osteocalcin Production by Transient Expression of Notch1, Delta1, and Jagged in MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 Cells—Prior to investigating the functional role of Notch signaling in osteoblast differentiation, the expression of Notch1–4, Delta1, -3, -4, and Jagged1, -2 was examined in three osteoprogenitor cell lines, namely C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, C2C12, and in the primary culture of calvaria- and bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cells. Reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that although the expression of several ligands, such as Notch4 and Delta4, was absent or very low in several cells, other molecules, including Notch1, Delta1, and Jagged1, were expressed well in the examined cells (Fig. 2A). Because the functional property of ligand-induced Notch activation in osteoblast differentiation is not yet characterized, we determined to compare the functional differences of Delta1 and Jagged1. For this, we first carried out a transient transfection study using the expression vector of NICD and full length of Delta1 and Jagged1 in the cultured MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells. ALP staining showed that overexpression of these molecules alone did not influence ALP activity but enhanced BMP2-induced ALP activation in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). Luciferase reporter assay carrying the ALP promoter showed that Delta1 and Jagged1 transactivated the promoter activity in the presence of BMP2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, BMP2-induced production of osteocalcin, another important marker for osteoblast differentiation, was suppressed through both protein and transcriptional levels by a similar manner (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that biological functions of Delta1 and Jagged1 are equivalent with NICD. Ligand Immobilization and in Vivo Bone Formation—Notch ligands are transmembrane proteins and thus act by cell-to-cell contact. To confirm that recombinant Delta1 and Jagged1 also display identical functions as demonstrated by transient expression study and to test whether ligand immobilization is necessary, MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells were incubated with recombinant Delta1 or Jagged1 under two culture conditions wherein the recombinant proteins were suspended in culture medium or immobilized on the culture plate. The result showed that for BMP2, an augmentation in BMP2-induced ALP activity was observed in the presence of immobilized Delta1 and Jagged1 but not in the presence of Delta1 and Jagged1 in the medium (Fig. 3A). In addition, inhibition of osteocalcin expression was also observed in the immobilized condition (Fig. 3B). The expression profile of osteoblastic differentiation markers was investigated by real-time PCR in C2C12 cells. In addition to ALP, mRNA levels of type 1 collagen (Col1α) and Runx2 were increased by Jagged1 coating, whereas osteopontin levels did not change and osteocalcin levels decreased slightly (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with Delta1 treatment (data not shown). However, 3 weeks of culture in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid resulted in enhanced mineralization in the presence of Delta1 and Jagged1 with concomitant up-regulation of ALP and osteocalcin mRNA (Fig. 3D). We also examined the in vivo potential of Delta1 and Jagged1 for bone formation; a scaffold carrier carrying MC3T3-E1 cells along with Delta1, Jagged1, and/or BMP2 was transplanted into the subfascial region of nude mice for 2 weeks. The results showed that Delta1 or Jagged1 alone did not trigger calcification but enhanced ectopic bone formation induced by BMP2 (Fig. 3E). The histology results showed that larger numbers of mineralized bone trabeculae could be observed in cases carrying both BMP2 and Delta1 or Jagged1 compared with BMP2 alone (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that both Delta1 and Jagged1 need to be immobilized and act as positive regulators for osteoblastic differentiation, although osteocalcin production is down-regulated in an early stage of differentiation. CBF-1-dependent Activation and HES-1 Regulation— Notch1 transmits signals through CSL DNA-binding protein-dependent and -independent pathways. Wild type or dominant negative (R218H) CBF-1 was transfected with or without Delta1 or Jagged1 to observe the requirement of CBF-1 for Delta/Jagged-induced Notch activation. The results showed that CBF-1 alone is able to enhance BMP2-induced ALP activation and that R218H CBF-1 blocked Delta1/Jagged1-induced ALP activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar inhibitory effects caused by R218H were observed in the expression of Runx2 and Col1α (data not shown). In addition, both Delta1 and Jagged1 induced the expression of HES-1, a target gene of Notch, through the CBF-1-dependent pathway (Fig. 4, C and D). Considered collectively, these results suggest that CBF-1 is involved in the osteoblast differentiation induced by Delta1 and Jagged1. Suppression of Notch1 Signaling by Dominant Negative Extracellular Domain and Specific Inhibitor—Notch signaling has been demonstrated to play a crucial role for cell fate determination by interacting with BMP signaling (16Itoh F. Itoh S. Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Iso T. Dotto G.P. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Kato M. Dijke EMBO J. 2004; 23: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Nakashima K. Taga T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5723-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Notch1 signaling is required for BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation, we utilized the extracellular domain of Notch1 as a dominant negative form (DN-Notch1) and γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458. Overexpression of DN-Notch1 and incubation with L685,458 resulted in a dramatic decrease of ALP activity induced by BMP2 (Fig. 5, A and B). DN-Notch1 also suppressed BMP2-induced osteocalcin expression (Fig. 5C). Luciferase assay using each promoter demonstrated that this suppression is regulated by transcriptional levels (Fig. 5D). Real-time PCR also demonstrated that the expression levels of ALP, osteocalcin, and Runx2 were diminished by DN-Notch1 to 22, 4, and 43% of the control, respectively. These results suggest that Notch1 signaling is important for BMP2-triggered osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of Endogenous Notch1 Expression by siRNA—To further confirm the requistric role of Notch pathway, three distinct small interference RNA (siRNA), which were designed based on the coding region of mouse Notch1, were transfected into the cultured cells. The transfection efficiency of Cy3-labeled control siRNA was ∼40% (data not shown). Immunoblots of total cell lysates of Notch1-siRNA-introduced MC3T3-E1 cells showed specific inhibition of endogenous Notch1 (Fig. 6A). Similar to the case of DN-Notch1, the siRNA-mediated suppression of Notch1 resulted in a strong inhibition of BMP2-induced ALP activity as well as osteocalcin expression (Fig. 6, B and C) by affecting the transcriptional levels (Fig. 6D). However, the expression levels of osteoblastic differentiation markers were not necessarily concomitant with the promoter activity except for osteocalcin, the expression of which was dramatically decreased (Fig. 6E). The suppression of ALP, Runx2, and Col1α was ∼40% of the scramble RNA. Considered collectively, however, these results indicate that endogenous Notch1 signaling is essential for BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation. Interaction between Notch and BMP Signaling—The interference of signaling pathway between Notch and BMP/transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) has been previously demonstrated (16Itoh F. Itoh S. Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Iso T. Dotto G.P. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Kato M. Dijke EMBO J. 2004; 23: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Nakashima K. Taga T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5723-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Blokzijl A. Dahlqvist C. Reissmann E. Falk A. Moliner A. Lendahl U. Ibanez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To study a mechanism of Notch1-induced augmentation of BMP activity, we first examined whether Notch activation could enhance BMP signaling. For this purpose, the expression and transcriptional control of Id-1, a target gene of BMP signaling, were examined in cells treated with immobilized Delta1 and Jagged1 in the presence or absence of BMP2. However, the results showed that mRNA levels and Id-1 promoter activity induced by BMP2 could not be influenced by Notch activation (Fig. 7, A and B). In addition, it was determined by real-time PCR that Notch1 activation did not alter the expression levels of BMP2 antagonists such as Noggin, Chordin, Follistatin, and Tsg (data not shown). These data suggest that the enhancement of BMP2 activity by Notch1 is not due to the activation of BMP signaling. Next, we investigated a mechanism by which the inhibition of the Notch signal leads to a dramatic decrease in BMP activity. Incubation with L685,458 reduced the expression levels of Id-1 (Fig. 7C). In addition, the transient transfection of DN-Notch1 and siRNA resulted in the reduction of Id-1 promoter activity (Fig. 7, C and D). Considered collectively, these data indicate that the suppression of BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation by Notch inhibition is at least partially due to suppressed BMP signaling. Notch receptors are known to play an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and are required for the organization of many different tissues, including vascular system, hematopoietic system, skin, and pancreas (2Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the expression of Notch-related molecules in developing bone remains unclear, a recent study has demonstrated that Notch1 is expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and subsequently in the hypertrophic chondrocytes during chondrogenesis (26Watanabe N. Tezuka Y. Matsuno K. Miyatani S. Morimura N. Yasuda M. Fujimaki R. Kuroda K. Hiraki Y. Hozumi N. Tezuka K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2003; 21: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). From this study, it appears that Notch1, Delta1, and Jagged1 are expressed in cultured osteoblast precursor cells as well as in differentiating osteoblasts during bone regeneration and that Notch1 is actually activated in these cells. These results suggest that in addition to the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell niche (27Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. Milner L.A. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar), Notch signaling plays an important role in the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic cell lineage. Moreover, the concomitant expression of Notch1, Delta1, and Jagged1 may give rise to a possibility of an autocrine and/or paracrine action instead of a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that is characterized by a contact-dependent inhibition model in the development of the nervous system (28Sestan N. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rakic P. Science. 1999; 286: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Although there is no functional difference between Delta and Jagged in a majority of cases, these ligands show distinct expression patterns in a part during development (29Weinmaster G. Roberts V.J. Lemke G. Development. 1991; 113: 199-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lindsell C.E. Boulter J. diSibio G. Gossler A. Weinmaster G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This suggests that specific ligand-receptor pairs may perform distinct functions. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated the role of Delta and Jagged in the differential commitment of T lymphocytes (13Amsen D. Blander J.M. Lee G.R. Tanigaki K. Honjo T. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 515-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Fringe, an extracellular regulatory protein, glycosylates Notch, which in turn leads to specific inhibition of Jagged binding (5Cheng P. Zlobin A. Volgina V. Gottipati S. Osborne B. Simel E.J. Miele L. Gabrilovich D.I. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that, like NICD, Delta1 and Jagged1 show identical biological activity in the case of osteoblastic differentiation. Although Delta1 or Jagged1 alone is unable to modulate differentiated status, these ligands enhance BMP2-induced expression of several differentiation markers, such as ALP, Runx2, and Col1α, in the same manner. In addition, Delta1 and Jagged1 are capable of enhancing bone mineral deposition and BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation. Furthermore, it appeared that both Delta1 and Jagged1 transmit signals through CBF-1 and transactivate the HES-1 gene. Similar results have been demonstrated by Tezuka et al. (12Tezuka K. Yasuda M. Watanabe N. Morimura N. Kuroda K. Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), who utilized the adenovirus system to express NICD. Osteocalcin expression is likely to be suppressed in an initial phase of differentiation when Notch1 is activated (12Tezuka K. Yasuda M. Watanabe N. Morimura N. Kuroda K. Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Nofziger D. Miyamoto A. Lyons K.M. Weinmaster G. Development. 1999; 126: 1689-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, Notch signaling is thought to either block differentiation toward a primary differentiation fate or to force the cell to remain in an undifferentiated state (1Hansson E.M. Lendahl U. Chapman G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Considering the concomitant expression of Delta1 and Jagged1 in vivo bone regeneration, these results suggest that there is a functional redundancy between Delta1 and Jagged1 and that these ligands direct osteoprogenitor cells to the differentiated status through identical signaling pathways. However, contradictory results have been reported from a retrovirus or an ordinary stable transfection study in which NICD introduction impairs osteoblastic differentiation of stromal cell ST-2 and MC3T3-E1 and Kussa cells (10Sciaudone M. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Shindo K. Kawashima N. Sakamoto K. Yamaguchi A. Umezawa A. Takagi M. Katsube K. Suda H. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this difference is that the effect of Notch activation may vary depending on the period of Notch activation; transient and short-term activation of the Notch pathway may enhance osteoblastic differentiation as shown in our study, whereas long-term continuous activation may lead to the inhibition of osteoblastic commitment. Further studies would be necessary to elucidate the culture period-dependent functional difference of Notch signaling in osteoblastic differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of Notch signaling by DN-Notch or L685,458 leads to a dramatic decrease in ALP and osteocalcin production. Furthermore, the inhibition of endogenous expression of Notch1 by siRNA also resulted in a dramatic decrease in osteoblastic differentiation associated with the decrease in differentiation markers, such as Col1α and Runx2 expression. In particular, osteocalcin expression was severely suppressed at the transcriptional level. Although this observation is not consistent with the results of the ligand stimulation study, it suggests that a functional Notch signal may be essential for osteocalcin expression through a distinct regulatory mechanism compared with other marker genes. Considered collectively, these results indicate that constitutive Notch1 signaling is critical for BMP2-induced osteopathic differentiation. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of Notch signal through L685,458 and R218H CBF-1 prevents BMP4-induced suppression of myogenesis of C2C12 cells (15Dahlqvist C. Blokzijl A. Chapman G. Falk A. Dannaeus K. Ibanez C.F. Lendahl U. Development. 2003; 130: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), indicating that functional Notch signaling may be necessary, to some extent, for BMP-induced differentiation. To explore a mechanism of the cooperative interaction between Notch and BMP signaling in osteoblast differentiation, we examined the interaction between BMP and Notch signaling. Recent studies have revealed that Notch and BMP/TGFβ cooperatively activate opposite pathways such as HES1 and HES-5 or Smad target gene PAI-1 (16Itoh F. Itoh S. Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Iso T. Dotto G.P. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Kato M. Dijke EMBO J. 2004; 23: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Nakashima K. Taga T.

In Notch pathway, NICD interacts with Smad1/5 and recruits the transcription machinery, including p300 and P/CAF, resulting in the cooperative activation of Notch target genes such as Herp2 and HES-2 (16Itoh F.

BMP2 also did not induce the expression of HES-1 gene expression. These results indicate the presence of other interaction mechanisms between BMP and Notch. It is possible that other Notch target genes such as Lfng, Hey1, and Tcf7 that could be up-regulated in C2C12 cells with response to BMP2 (32de Jong D.S. Steegenga W.T. Hendriks J.M. van Zoelen E.J.

Cappellen D. Rohner D. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37704-37715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). More importantly, our data revealed that the inhibition of Notch signaling or expression leads to a dramatic decrease in Id-1 promoter activity, indicating that Notch signaling is required for BMP signaling itself and that BMP signaling locates upstream of Notch as described previously in the regeneration process in Xenopus tail (34Beck C.W. Christen B. Slack J.M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, it is most likely that Notch signaling may be critical for TGFβ pathway as well, because TGFβ-induced reporter activity using 3TP-luc and ARE-luc was also inhibited by DN-Notch and L685,458 in our examined cells. 2T. Tsukazaki, unpublished data. Further experiments are necessary to explore the underlying mechanism that links Notch inhibition to the suppressed BMP/TGFβ signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that both Delta1 and Jagged1 transmit signals through the CBF1-dependent pathway and induce osteoblastic differentiation by cooperating with BMP. In addition, functional Notch1 activation is essential not only for BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation but also for BMP signaling itself. Our results suggest a therapeutic potential for the signaling pathway from Delta1 and Jagged1 to CBF1-dependent gene expression in bone regeneration as well as osteoporosis. We thank T.

https://openalex.org/W2160497177,"Action potentials in central neurons are initiated near the axon initial segment, propagate into the axon, and finally invade the presynaptic terminals, where they trigger transmitter release. Voltage-gated Na(+) channels are key determinants of excitability, but Na(+) channel density and properties in axons and presynaptic terminals of cortical neurons have not been examined yet. In hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, which emerge from parent axons en passant, Na(+) channels are very abundant, with an estimated number of approximately 2000 channels per bouton. Presynaptic Na(+) channels show faster inactivation kinetics than somatic channels, suggesting differences between subcellular compartments of the same cell. Computational analysis of action potential propagation in axon-multibouton structures reveals that Na(+) channels in boutons preferentially amplify the presynaptic action potential and enhance Ca(2+) inflow, whereas Na(+) channels in axons control the reliability and speed of propagation. Thus, presynaptic and axonal Na(+) channels contribute differentially to mossy fiber synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2070454568,"When a visual stimulus suddenly appears, it captures attention, producing a transient improvement of performance on basic visual tasks. We investigate the effect of transient attention on stimulus representations in early visual areas using rapid event-related fMRI. Participants discriminated the orientation of one of two gratings preceded or followed by a nonpredictive peripheral cue. Compared to control conditions, precueing the target location improved performance and produced a larger fMRI response in corresponding retinotopic areas. This enhancement progressively increased from striate to extrastriate areas. Control conditions indicated that the enhanced fMRI response was not due to sensory summation of cue and target signals. Thus, an uninformative precue increases both perceptual performance and the concomitant stimulus-evoked activity in early visual areas. These results provide evidence regarding the retinotopically specific neural correlate for the effects of transient attention on early vision."
https://openalex.org/W2022641189,End states—the zero-dimensional analogs of the two-dimensional states that occur at a crystal surface—were observed at the ends of one-dimensional atom chains that were self-assembled by depositing gold on the vicinal Si(553) surface. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the differential conductance along the chains revealed quantized states in isolated segments with differentiated states forming over end atoms. A comparison to a tight-binding model demonstrated how the formation of electronic end states transforms the density of states and the energy levels within the chains.
https://openalex.org/W2108072597,"Associative learning is important on rapid timescales, but no suitable form of short-term plasticity has been identified that is both associative and synapse specific. Here, we assess whether endocannabinoids can mediate such plasticity. In the cerebellum, bursts of parallel fiber (PF) activity evoke endocannabinoid release from Purkinje cell dendrites that results in retrograde synaptic inhibition lasting seconds. We find that the powerful climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell synapse regulates this inhibition. Compared to PF stimulation alone, coactivation of PF and CF synapses greatly enhanced endocannabinoid-mediated inhibition of PF synapses. Retrograde inhibition was restricted to PFs activated within several hundred milliseconds of CF activation. This associative plasticity reflects two aspects of calcium-dependent endocannabinoid release. First, PF-mediated activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors locally reduced the dendritic calcium levels required for endocannabinoid release. Second, CF and PF coactivation evoked localized supralinear dendritic calcium signals. Thus, endocannabinoids mediate transient associative synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2081554922,"Deformation of metals and alloys by dislocations gliding between well-separated slip planes is a well-understood process, but most crystal structures do not possess such simple geometric arrangements. Examples are the Laves phases, the most common class of intermetallic compounds and exist with ordered cubic, hexagonal, and rhombohedral structures. These compounds are usually brittle at low temperatures, and transformation from one structure to another is slow. On the basis of geometric and energetic considerations, a dislocation-based mechanism consisting of two shears in different directions on adjacent atomic planes has been used to explain both deformation and phase transformations in this class of materials. We report direct observations made by Z-contrast atomic resolution microscopy of stacking faults and dislocation cores in the Laves phase Cr 2 Hf. These results show that this complex dislocation scheme does indeed operate in this material. Knowledge gained of the dislocation core structure will enable improved understanding of deformation mechanisms and phase transformation kinetics in this and other complex structures."

Here we show that despite millions of years of predominantly vertical transmission, the domesticated fungi actively reject mycelial fragments from neighboring colonies, and that the strength of these reactions are in proportion to the overall genetic difference between these symbionts. Fungal incompatibility compounds remain intact during ant digestion, so that fecal droplets, which are used for manuring newly grown fungus, elicit similar hostile reactions when applied to symbionts from other colonies. Symbiont control over new mycelial growth by manurial imprinting prevents the rearing of multiple crops in fungus gardens belonging to the same colony."
https://openalex.org/W1986599659,"In sensory neurons, Ca(2+) entry is crucial for both activation and subsequent attenuation of signaling. Influx of Ca(2+) is counterbalanced by Ca(2+) extrusion, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange is the primary mode for rapid Ca(2+) removal during and after sensory stimulation. However, the consequences on sensory signaling resulting from mutations in Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers have not been described. Here, we report that mutations in the Drosophila Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger calx have a profound effect on activity-dependent survival of photoreceptor cells. Loss of CalX activity resulted in a transient response to light, a dramatic decrease in signal amplification, and unusually rapid adaptation. Conversely, overexpression of CalX had reciprocal effects and greatly suppressed the retinal degeneration caused by constitutive activity of the TRP channel. These results illustrate the critical role of Ca(2+) for proper signaling and provide genetic evidence that Ca(2+) overload is responsible for a form of retinal degeneration resulting from defects in the TRP channel."
https://openalex.org/W2131924308,"The trigeminal loop in the brainstem comprises the innermost level of sensorimotor feedback in the rat vibrissa system. Anatomy suggests that this loop relays tactile information from the vibrissae to the motoneurons that control vibrissa movement. We demonstrate, using in vitro and in vivo recordings, that the trigeminal loop consists of excitatory pathways from vibrissa sensory inputs to vibrissa motoneurons in the facial nucleus. We further show that the trigeminal loop implements a rapidly depressing reflex that provides positive sensory feedback to the vibrissa musculature during simulated whisking and contact. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the trigeminal loop provides an enhancement of vibrissa muscle tone upon contact during active touch."
https://openalex.org/W2145432449,"DNA methylation cooperates with methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9), a modified histone molecule that is targeted by heterochromatin protein 1, to form a transcriptionally silent chromatin. Methyl CpG-binding protein MBD1 recognizes methylated CpG dinucleotide and recruits H3-K9 methyltransferases such as SETDB1 to genomic regions. Here we show that MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor (MCAF) 1, also known as the human homologue of murine ATFa-associated modulator (AM), is required for transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation by MBD1, together with the involvement of SETDB1. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of MCAF1 shows similarity to a number of sequences of the MCAF/AM-related proteins, resulting in the identification of a new member of the protein family, termed MCAF2. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding analyses reveal that both MCAF proteins interact with MBD1, SETDB1, and Sp1 via two evolutionarily conserved distinct domains. Furthermore, MCAF1 enhances transcriptional repression by MBD1 together with SETDB1, and exogenous expression of MCAF2 partly compensates for the repressive activity in MCAF1 knockdown HeLa cells. The expression of MBD1 mutant, which lacks interaction with MCAF proteins, perturbs heterochromatin protein 1-enriched heterochromatin formation at the MBD1-containing chromosomal loci.

To date, five family members have been characterized in mammals: MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3 have been characterized as transcriptional repressors; and MBD4 has been characterized as a thymine DNA glycosylase that removes deamination products at methyl-CpG sites. MBD1 is also involved in base excision repair together with the methyl-purine DNA glycosylase (10.Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Fujita N. Tsuruzoe S. Ohki I. Shirakawa M. Kawasuji M. Nakao M. Proc. Natl.

These MBD proteins bind specifically to the methyl-CpG pairs, except for MBD3, which localizes to methylated DNA regions by associating with MBD2. On the other hand, posttranslational modifications of amino termini of core histones are correlated to transcriptional states and recognized by relevant chromatin-associated factors (4.Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 6.Richards E.J. Elgin S.C.

These posttranslational modifications include acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and other modifications of the histone molecules. It is known that methylated DNA regions normally coexist with the deacetylation and methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9) and that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) selectively binds methyl H3-K9 to form repressive chromatin (12.Bannister A.J.

Recent studies have revealed that both DNA methylation and H3-K9 methylation share a common pathway to form heterochromatin (15.Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16.Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V. Lichota J. Habu Y. Paszkowski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8823-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In Neurospora crassa, the DIM-5 gene encodes a H3-K9-specific methyltransferase containing a SET (Suvar3–9 enhancer of zeste trithorax) domain that results in methyl H3-K9. The dim-5 mutants completely abolished cytosine methylation of the genome (17.Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In contrast, H3-K9 methylation is not affected in dim-2 mutants that lack DNA methyltransferase activity, leading to the loss of methyl cytosine (18.Kouzminova E. Selker E.U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4309-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that H3-K9 methylation directs DNA methylation in Neurospora. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DNA methylation is also affected in mutations of the KRYPTONITE (KYP) gene encoding H3-K9-specific methyltransferase in the plant (15.Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19.Tariq M. Paszkowski J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 244-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, cytosine hypomethylation in association with markedly reduced methyl H3-K9 occurs predominantly in sites of plant-specific 5′-CpNpG-3′ methylation, whereas CpG methylation is not affected in kyp mutants (20.Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 21.Malagnac F. Bartee L. Bender J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6842-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Conversely, met1, a DNA methylase similar to DIM-2 and mammalian Dnmt1, is required for the maintenance of H3-K9 methylation because disruption of the met1 gene causes loss of methyl H3-K9 (16.Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V. Lichota J. Habu Y. Paszkowski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8823-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that methyl H3-K9 depends on DNA methylation in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, deficiencies in Suv39h, one of the major H3-K9 methyltransferases in mammals, result in strong loss of methyl H3-K9 and reduced methylation of the major satellite DNA (14.Lehnertz B. Ueda Y. Derijck A.A. Braunschweig U. Perez-Burgos L. Kubicek S. Chen T. Li E. Jenuwein T. Peters A.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1192-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), whereas Dnmt1 knockouts cause significant DNA hypomethylation and, at least in part, affect methyl H3-K9 (19.Tariq M.

Although the relationships are not precisely known, these findings suggest that DNA methylation and H3-K9 methylation may be relatively independent in mammals (16.Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V.

It is currently unknown how interrelations of both modifications are established and maintained and how DNA methyltransferases and MBD proteins are functionally associated with H3-K9 methyltransferases and HP1 at the molecular levels. We demonstrated previously that MBD1 represses transcription by recruiting HP1, Suv39h1, and histone deacetylase via the MBD of the protein (23.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Tsuruzoe S. Shinkai Y. Tachibana M. Chiba T. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24132-24138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and by interacting with MCAF1 (formerly called MCAF) via the transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at the carboxyl terminus (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Compared with other MBD proteins, the TRD of MBD1 can strongly repress promoter activity, even though it acts from a long distance, and the repression tends to be unaffected by histone deacetylase inhibitors (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25.Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast, MeCP2, MBD2, and MBD3 seem to repress transcription from adjacent promoter in a histone deacetylation-mediated manner (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite such distinguishing characteristics, however, the proper mechanism of MBD1-mediated transcriptional repression remains to be elucidated. Recently, it has been reported that MCAF1 is the human homologue of murine ATFa-associated modulator (AM) with transcriptional repression activity (26.De Graeve F. Bahr A. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1807-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MCAF1/AM facilitates conversion of di-methyl to tri-methyl H3-K9 by histone methyltransferase, murine protein ESET, and human homologue SETDB1, both in vitro and in vivo (27.Wang H. An W. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Chatton B. Tempst P. Roeder R.G. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). MCAF1/AM enhances SETDB1/ESET-mediated H3-K9 trimethylation and subsequent transcriptional repression, indicating that it is the first molecule that modulates the histone methyltransferase activity. It has been further suggested that MCAF1/AM associates with the homeobox-containing zinc finger protein ZHX1 as a transcriptional co-repressor (28.Yamada K. Kawata H. Shou Z. Hirano S. Mizutani T. Yazawa T. Sekiguchi T. Yoshino M. Kajitani T. Miyamoto K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The lines of evidence suggest that MCAF1/AM potentially interacts with a wide range of molecules for gene regulation. During investigation of the function of MCAF1, we found that MCAF1 shows two amino acid sequences that are evolutionarily conserved among many species. In the present study, we report a novel member of the MCAF/AM family proteins, named MCAF2. Both MCAF1 and MCAF2 appear to have the ability to bind MBD1, SETDB1, and Sp1 through the conserved domains. Furthermore, we find that MBD1 recruits SETDB1 through interaction with MCAF1 to form HP1-condensed heterochromatin. We discuss that MBD1·MCAF1·SETDB1 complex directs DNA methylation to histone methylation, resulting in the formation of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin and that the MCAF/AM family of proteins is representative of a structurally and functionally related class of epigenetic modulators. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of MCAF2—The method for PCR-based, full-length cDNA cloning with sequence information of human expressed sequence tags in databases has been reported previously (29.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The cDNA of MCAF2 initially contained a sequence fragment identical to human partial cDNAs XP016601, BI459223, and BF979579. We determined the complete cDNA sequence of MCAF2 (GenBank™ accession number AY560615), and it is consistent with that of an uncharacterized protein (GenBank™ accession number NM024997). Plasmids—The cDNAs for MCAF2 were cloned into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-FLAG-MCAF2 and pcDNA3-insulator-His-FLAG-MCAF2), Drosophila expression vector pAC5.1/V5-His (pAC-MCAF2) (Invitrogen), and pEGFP-C1 (pEGFP-MCAF2) (Clontech). The cDNAs for human SETDB1 (KIAA0067) were obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute and inserted into mammalian expression vectors (pcDNA3-FLAG-SETDB1) and pAC5.1/V5-HisA (pAC-SETDB1). The luciferase reporter (pG5-luc-actin 5C) was constructed by subcloning a fragment of Drosophila actin 5C promoter into a GAL4-containing pG5-luc vector (Promega). HP1 proteins were expressed from EGFP-inserted pPyCAGIP vector. pSilencer3.1puro vector (Ambion) is used to express small hairpin RNAs.

The pcDNA3-insulator-His-FLAG-MCAF2 (2 μg) was stably introduced to HeLa cells under selection with G418 (800 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. For a knockdown experiment, HeLa cells (1.0 × 105 cells) were transfected with siRNA expression vector (2.0 μg) with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in a 6-well plate, and after 24 h, the cells were diluted to one-third and transferred to a 12-well plate under selection with puromycin (1.0 μg/ml). After 48 h, the knockdown cells were used for luciferase assay. Protein Expression—The MCAF2 cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET28a (Invitrogen). The deletion mutants and the Domain 2 point mutants of MCAF1 and MCAF2 were prepared by a mutagenesis method. The expressions of these proteins and His-TRD of MBD1 were determined as described previously (23.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Tsuruzoe S. Shinkai Y. Tachibana M. Chiba T. Nakao M. J. Biol.

Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-MCAF2 antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused MCAF2 (amino acids 1–681). For affinity purification of the antibodies, His-tagged MCAF2 (amino acids 1–327) was coupled to Affi-Gel 10-activated matrix (Bio-Rad). Anti-MCAF1 antibodies were reported previously (24.Fujita N.

Immunoprecipitation—K562 cells were lysed with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation (1500 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min, mixed with buffer I (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), and then incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (1500 rpm), the nuclear extracts (400 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of buffer II (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After a 10-min centrifugation, supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies or control IgG and then incubated for 1 h after the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull-down Assay—Bacterially expressed GST and GST fusion proteins (1 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with His-tagged proteins (1 μg) or cell lysates from FLAG-SETDB1-expressing HeLa cells in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The input indicates 10% of the His-tagged proteins or cell lysates in the reaction mixture. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activities were determined as described previously (29.Fujita N. Takebayashi S.

Values are the means ± S.D. of results from three independent experiments. Identification of MCAF2 and MCAF/AM Protein Family—To investigate whether a novel MCAF1/AM-like protein is present, we performed a tblastn search of the GenBank™ data base using the amino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 1154–1270) of MCAF1 (GenBank™ accession number AF425650). We found that overlapping expressed sequence tag clones had sequence similarity, and then we cloned a 2046-bp full-length cDNA that encoded a new polypeptide of 681 amino acid residues, designated MCAF2 (GenBank™ accession number AY560615). Two conserved domains are called as Domain 1 and Domain 2 of MCAF/AM family proteins (Fig. 1A). As described below, these regions of MCAF1 and MCAF2 are important for interacting with cooperative proteins. The sequence identities between human MCAF1 and MCAF2 are 27% (Domain 1) and 56% (Domain 2), indicating that Domain 2 is well conserved. Furthermore, a number of cDNA and expressed sequence tag clones were identified as having similarity to the Domain 2 of MCAF1 over ∼100 carboxyl-terminal residues of each protein (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these belong to a class of the MCAF/AM protein family. However, most of these proteins are of undefined or poorly defined functions. To analyze the expression of MCAF1 and MCAF2, we generated anti-MCAF2 as well as previously reported anti-MCAF1 polyclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis of human cultured cells showed ∼200- and 100-kDa bands of endogenous MCAF1 and MCAF2, respectively (Fig. 1C). MCAF1 was highly expressed in most of the cells studied, whereas the expression of MCAF2 was present in some cell lines, including K562 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Sp1 and β-tubulin were almost comparably detected as controls. The expression levels of MCAF1, MCAF2, and Sp1 were somewhat low in primary fibroblasts. FLAG-tagged MCAF2, which was used in this study, was expressed in HeLa (S3) cells with the same molecular weight as endogenous protein appeared. Among these cell lines, HeLa and K562 were used for analyzing the functions and distinctions between MCAF1 and MCAF2. MCAF Proteins Interact with MBD1—We reported recently that MCAF1 associates with methylated DNA-binding protein MBD1 (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first focused on characterization of the interaction between MCAF proteins and MBD1. MBD1 is a transcriptional regulator containing the MBD, cysteine-rich CXXC domains, and the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) (Fig. 2A) (25.Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our previous report showed that the TRD of MBD1 bound the Domain 2 of MCAF1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We prepared GST-fused deletion mutants of MCAF1 (Δ10, Δ18, and Δ8) and MCAF2 (Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3) (Fig. 1A), and in vitro pull-down analysis was carried out (Fig. 2B). GST and GST-fused portions of MCAF proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the His-tagged TRD of MBD1. The TRD of MBD1 bound MCAF1 (Δ8) and MCAF2 (Δ3) containing Domain 2 of the proteins. To examine the significance of Domain 2, we constructed Domain 2 mutants of MCAF1 (Δ8) and MCAF2 (Δ3), whose evolutionarily conserved leucine residue was converted to arginine (termed L1224R and L636R, respectively) (Fig. 1B). The Domain 2 mutants completely abolished binding to the TRD of MBD1. Moreover, we used wild-type and mutants of the TRD of MBD1 for the pull-down analysis. Previous reports showed that three TRD mutants (I576R, L579R, and I576R/L579R in Fig. 2A) of MBD1 lost transcriptional repression activity (25.Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29.Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The GST-fused TRD proteins of MBD1 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, followed by incubation with His-tagged MCAF1 Δ8 and MCAF2 Δ3 (Fig. 2C). The wild-type TRD of MBD1 bound Domain 2 of both MCAF proteins. The TRD (L579R) of MBD1 bound MCAF proteins weakly, whereas both TRD (L576R) and TRD (I576R/L579R) lost the ability to bind the MCAF proteins. These data suggest that both MCAF proteins interact similarly with MBD1. To visualize the specific localization of MCAF proteins and MBD1 in the nucleus, we expressed GFP-tagged MCAF proteins and DsRed-fused MBD1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2, D-F; Fig. 6, A-C). It has been shown that the localization of MBD1 is highly dependent on the distribution of methyl-CpG on the genome (10.Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Fujita N. Tsuruzoe S. Ohki I. Shirakawa M. Kawasuji M.

Both MCAF1 and MCAF2 co-localized with wild-type MBD1 at the multiple foci (Figs. 2D and 6A). In contrast, Domain 2 mutants, MCAF1(L1224R) and MCAF2(L636R), did not selectively coexist with MBD1 (Figs. 2E and 6B), suggesting that Domain 2 is necessary for the interaction with MBD1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, neither MCAF1 nor MCAF2 was co-localized with MBD1 (I576R) (Figs. 2F and 6C), which can bind methylated DNA regions but not Domain 2 of MCAF proteins. The results presented were seen in >90% of the nuclei in the transfected cells, suggesting that both Domain 2 of MCAF proteins and TRD of MBD1 are crucial for their interaction in vivo. Interaction of MCAF Proteins with SETDB1 and Sp1—It was reported recently that MCAF1/AM is associated with SETDB1/ESET and Sp1 (24.Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H.

We have used citrate synthase (CS) as a model to understand the mechanism of aggregation during refolding and its prevention using several known structure-stabilizing cosolvent additives of the polyol series. Interestingly, no parallel correlation between the folding effect and the general stabilizing effect exerted by polyols was observed. Although increasing concentrations of polyols increased protein stability in general, the refolding yields for CS decreased at higher polyol concentrations, with erythritol reducing the folding yields at all concentrations tested. Among the various polyols used, glycerol was the most effective in enhancing the CS refolding yield, and a complete recovery of enzymatic activity was obtained at 7 m glycerol and 10 μg/ml protein, a result superior to the action of the molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES in vitro. A good correlation between the refolding yields and the suppression of protein aggregation by glycerol was observed, with no aggregation detected at 7 m. The polyols prevented the aggregation of CS depending on the number of hydroxyl groups in them. Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetics experiments suggested that polyols, including glycerol, act very early in the refolding process, as no fast and slow phases were detectable. The results conclusively demonstrate that both the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects are critical in the folding process and that all structure-stabilizing molecules need not always help in productive folding to the native state. These findings are important for the rational design of small molecules for efficient refolding of various aggregation-prone proteins of commercial and medical relevance.

Aggregation of proteins during folding, both in vitro and in vivo, is known to lead to low native protein yields as well as the onset of several age-related diseases (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). Hence, there is a growing interest in developing strategies to prevent protein aggregation to enhance protein refolding yields and to design drugs for diseases involving protein aggregation. Several attempts have been made in this direction with successes as well as failures (2De Bernardez-Clark E. Schwarz E. Rudolph R.

Using the molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES, up to 80% refolding of CS could be obtained at 10 μg/ml protein, whereas unassisted refolding was only 5% (7Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Inspired by the GroEL/ES-assisted two-step folding mechanism, Rozema and Gellman (9Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) proposed an artificial chaperone-assisted refolding system in which a detergent was used to prevent aggregation, and cyclodextrin was added to remove the detergent, leading to the native structure formation. Using this strategy, a 65% refolding yield of CS was observed (21Daugherty D.L. Rozema D. Hanson P.E. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33961-33971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar two-step strategy has also been applied using cycloamylose, and complete recovery of the refolded protein has been claimed (12Machida S. Ogawa S. Xiaohua S. Takaha T. Fujii K. Hayashi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Despite its successful use in improving the refolding yield, the two-step artificial chaperone strategy is complicated, requiring the removal of the accessory agents before the enzyme can be effectively used.Another useful strategy that has been applied to improve the refolding yield of proteins is to use small molecular mass additives in the refolding buffer. The advantage of using such a strategy over the artificial chaperone strategy is that it is convenient and cost-effective, and the additives need not be removed from the refolding buffers. One can also select compounds that are simple in structure and that are biocompatible, thereby offering a possibility to be used in vivo to correct protein misfolding and to prevent aggregation responsible for a growing number of human and animal diseases (22Tatzelt J.

Despite successful use of these molecules in enhancing protein refolding yields, their mechanism of action for the refolding process is far from clear. In this study, we used a series of polyol osmolytes with increasing numbers of hydroxyl groups in an attempt to enhance the refolding yield of CS as well as to investigate their mechanism of action given that their mechanism of action for enhancing protein stability is well understood (36Gekko K.

Because glycerol was found to be the most effective among the polyols used in enhancing the refolding yield, extended studies were carried out with glycerol to understand its mechanism of action in detail. Understanding the mechanism of cosolvent-mediated folding of proteins and the prevention of their aggregation would be helpful not only in the rational design of additives for enhancing protein refolding yields, but also in the prevention of aggregation of proteins involved in several conformational diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Acetyl coenzyme A, CS (porcine heart), dithioerythritol, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), erythritol, oxalacetate, sorbitol, Tris, and xylitol were purchased from Sigma. Ethylene glycol (Qualigens India Ltd.), glycerol (Roth Chemicals), and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl; Sigma and ICN Biomedicals) were of the highest purity grade and were used as such. For protein concentration determination and enzyme assay, Hitachi U2000, Specord (Analytik Jena AG), and Cary spectrophotometers were used. For maintaining constant temperature, a Haake Technik GmbH water bath was used.Refolding Protocol—The concentration of native CS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ280 = 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution in a 1-cm path length cuvette (42Singh M. Brooks G.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4636-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzyme was used without further purification. CS (1 mg/ml) was denatured in 0.1 m Tris-HCl containing 6.0 m GdmCl and 20 mm dithioerythritol for at least 1 h at room temperature (6Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).Refolding experiments were carried out by diluting the denatured protein into the refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). In the case of cosolvent-assisted refolding, various cosolvents were added at different concentrations to the refolding buffer into which the denatured protein was mixed. Refolding was carried out by single shot dilution in a glass test tube, in which the denatured protein was diluted 1:100 in the refolding buffer by vigorous vortexing for 30–60 s. Extreme care had to be taken at this step because rapid mixing was essential for reproducibility and better refolding yields. Refolded samples were incubated at the desired temperatures until completion of the reaction. The refolding at 25 °C was complete in <2 h. CS activity assay was carried out to follow the formation of native CS molecules. CS catalyzes the following reaction: oxalacetate + acetyl coenzyme A → citrate + CoASH.The free–SH groups of CoASH react with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and form a mercaptide ion, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate–, which absorbs at 412 nm. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.047 mm acetyl coenzyme A, and 0.023 mm oxalacetate. For the activity assay, 5 or 10 μl of enzyme was added to make a solution with a final concentration if 1.0 ml, and the absorbance was recorded for 180 s. For calculating the change in absorbance (ΔA/s), the initial linear portion was used (43Srere P.A. Brazil H. Gonen L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S129-S134Crossref Google Scholar). All activity assays were carried out at 25 °C. The change in absorbance of the native protein, which was treated in the same way as the refolded sample but without denaturing, was taken as 100% while expressing the relative refolding yields. The enzyme assays were carried out at least in triplicates and as many as five times. The average values are reported, and the error in the activity measurements was not more than ±5%.Aggregation Kinetics—Aggregation kinetics studies of CS were carried out by detecting light scattering of the aggregates formed during folding at 25 °C or after high temperature incubation at 45 °C using a Cary Varian Eclipse fluorometer and a 400-μl stoppered fluorescence cuvette with constant stirring. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 500 nm with a slit width of 2.5 nm each. For folding studies, the mixing of the denatured protein was carried out manually in the spectrometer cuvette with stirring, yielding a final protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. For aggregation studies at 45 °C, 10 μg/ml CS was also used.Refolding Kinetics—The refolding kinetics of CS in the absence and presence of polyols were monitored at 24 °C by fluorescence detection using a BioLogic SFM-300 stopped-flow module attached to a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with an addition photomultiplier tube for fluorescence detection. The excitation wavelength for intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was 280 nm, and an interference filter with a peak transmittance at 340 nm was used for emission detection. A mixing ratio of 1:9 denatured protein/folding buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) was used for the refolding of the protein in a 30-μl cuvette. Data were acquired up to 1 s for the detection of any fast phase with a time interval of 0.5–2 ms as well as up to 3 min with an interval of 0.1 s.Measurements of refolding kinetics were carried out using an Applied Photophysics RX.2000 rapid kinetics setup based on a pneumatic ram drive system using a microvolume cuvette interfaced with a Varian Eclipse fluorometer. The mixing ratio for CS folding in this case was 1:10 using a 250-μl syringe for the protein solution and 2.5-ml syringe for the refolding buffer. The refolding protein concentration was 10 μg/ml. Experiments were carried out at 0.9, 2.7, 4.5, and 6.4 m glycerol in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.1, as well as in 1 m each ethylene glycol, erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol at 24 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 338 nm with slit widths of 10 and 20 nm, respectively. The limitation of the instrumental setup allowed the first data point to be collected at 31 ms only for experiments with data collection up to 1 s. Both the fast phase (up to 1s) and the slow phase (up to 3 min) were acquired. The 338-nm wavelength was selected based on equilibrium measurements of the fluorescence spectra of the native and denatured protein solutions. Furthermore, pH jump experiments to monitor the dimer formation kinetics were carried out by mixing, at a 1:10 ratio, a 100 μg/ml CS solution in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, with a 50 mm phosphate buffer solution, pH 8, yielding a final protein concentration of 10 μg/ml at pH 8.RESULTSEffect of Polyols—Table I shows the results of the effect of polyols, viz. ethylene glycol, glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol ranging from 0.5 to 9 m, depending on their solubility, on the CS refolding yield at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and 25 °C. The polyols vary in the number of–OH groups in them: ethylene glycol has two, glycerol three, erythritol four, xylitol five, and sorbitol six. Except erythritol, which decreased the refolding yield at all concentrations, all other polyols led to an initial increase in the refolding yield, followed by a decrease at higher concentrations. Erythritol is known to increase the thermal stability of proteins (44Back J.F. Oakenfull D. Smith M.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), but resulted in a decrease in the refolding yields for CS. In contrast, ethylene glycol, which is known as a destabilizer of protein conformation (39Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), led to a gradual increase in the refolding yield of CS, with a maximum yield of 52% at 5 m, whereas the control yield was 36%. There was a sharp decline in the refolding yield after 5 m, with no refolding activity obtained at 9 m.Table IEffect of polyols on the refolding yield of CSConcRefolding yieldEGGlycerolErythritolXylitolSorbitol%0.0 m36373439350.5 m1137341.0 m3551760521.5 m1154382.0 m4956817313.0 m46675.0 m52717.0 m32839.0 m071 Open table in a new tab Glycerol also led to a gradual increase in the refolding yield, and a very high refolding yield of 83% was obtained at 7 m, followed by a decrease. It was not possible to use glycerol at concentrations higher than 9 m, as there were mixing problems due to the high viscosity of the solutions. Glycerol has long been known to stabilize proteins against chemical and thermal denaturation. Gekko and Timasheff (36Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 37Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) proposed that the solvophobic effect of glycerol is responsible for its stabilizing action. Glycerol has been used to increase the refolding yield of proteins (34Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Jaspard E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 46Tieman B.C. Johnston M.F. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44541-44550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Glycerol has been used not only in in vitro studies, but also in in vivo studies, where it has been used to prevent the formation of the scrapie form (PrPsc) of the soluble prion protein (PrPc) (22Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The refolding yield obtained by us for CS in glycerol is comparable with that using the GroEL/ES system, in which a similar yield has been obtained (7Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both xylitol and sorbitol resulted in maximum refolding yields of 60 and 52%, respectively, at 1 m, followed by a decrease as their concentrations increased. The results suggest that there is no parallel correlation between the ability of the polyols to stabilize proteins and their effect in enhancing the refolding yield of CS.Effect of Protein Concentration and Temperature—It has been reported previously that the refolding yield of CS depends on protein concentration (6Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 7Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As the protein concentration increased, there was a drastic decrease in the spontaneous refolding yield of the enzyme, with negligible activity observed at a refolding concentration of 50 μg/ml (Table II). The addition of 7 m glycerol led to an increase in the refolding yield at 10 and 20 μg/ml almost to a similar extent but a smaller increase was observed relatively at 50 μg/ml. Refolding of proteins is also known to be highly temperature-dependent, with a tendency to form aggregates with increasing temperature, as a consequence of which, the refolding yield is reduced (47Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). This is quite obvious from the data on CS presented in Table III. The data on the effect of glycerol studied at various temperatures (10, 15, 25, 30, and 35 °C) reveal that glycerol helped to refold CS to a greater extent with increasing temperature, resulting in a 100% yield at 30 and 35 °C (Table III), at which the control activities were quite low. This result is much superior to the results obtained for CS refolding using molecular chaperones (7Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Table IIEffect of protein concentration on the refolding yield of CS in 7.0 m glycerol at 25 °CCS concSpontaneous refoldingGlycerol-assisted refoldingμg/ml%%10408320217350340 Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffect of temperature on CS refolding in the absence and presence of 7 m glycerolTemperatureSpontaneous refoldingGlycerol-assisted refolding°C%%10475115504725408330291003511100 Open table in a new tab Addition of Glycerol at Different Time Intervals—To determine at which stage glycerol can affect the refolding of CS, glycerol was added at different time intervals during the folding of CS by manual mixing. The results show that there was almost a negligible effect of glycerol even as early as 15 s after refolding. No significant effect of glycerol on the CS refolding yield (activity) was observed when the addition was delayed further (data not shown). This suggests that the presence of glycerol, leading to an increase in the refolding yield, is necessary during the beginning or very early stages of refolding.Compensation for the Urea Effect by Glycerol—Studies on the compensation effect of glycerol on the refolding of CS in the presence of various concentrations of urea were carried out. Urea was used as a cosolvent additive in the concentration range of 0.5–2 m (Table IV). There was no effect of urea at 0.5 m, whereas a further increase in its concentration led to a decrease in the refolding yield, with no refolding observed at 2 m. It has been shown previously in the case of P22 tailspike protein folding that low concentrations of urea destabilize folding intermediates (48Fuchs A. Seiderer C. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is possible that an intermediate in CS refolding may also be susceptible to low urea concentrations, which in turn decrease the refolding yield. To determine whether glycerol stabilizes folding intermediates and in turn increases the refolding yield, CS refolding was carried out at 7 m glycerol in the presence of various concentrations of urea (Table IV). We observed that 1.5 m urea almost completely inhibited the refolding of CS, but 1.5 m urea and 7 m glycerol led to a very high refolding yield. To inhibit the refolding completely, 3 m urea was required in the presence of 7 m glycerol.Table IVEffect of urea (Part A) and a mixture of urea and glycerol (Part B) on CS refolding yield at 25 °CRefolding yield%Part A.

At a concentration as low as 0.5 m, it started losing activity rapidly. In the presence of 3 m glycerol, however, the denaturation transition curve was shifted toward higher GdmCl concentrations. These experiments suggest that glycerol helps in the stabilization of the native CS structure against GdmCl denaturation. Glycerol concentrations higher than 3 m were difficult to achieve due to mixing problems with GdmCl.To study the effect of glycerol on the thermal inactivation of CS, inactivation kinetics experiments with the enzyme were performed at 45 °C. This temperature was chosen because it has been reported that CS inactivates rapidly at this temperature, resulting in no activity after 20 min of incubation (18Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20424-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that there was a complete loss of enzymatic activity after incubation at 45 °C for 25 min, whereas in the presence of 7.0 m glycerol, 20% of the enzymatic activity was retained. This further suggests that glycerol stabilizes the native structure of CS against the effect of high temperature.Fig. 2Thermal inactivation of CS at 45 °C. The native protein (10 μg/ml) was incubated in buffer (•) and in 7 m glycerol (▿) at 45 °C. At different time intervals, aliquots were taken, and enzyme assay was carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Refolding and Aggregation Kinetics—Fig. 3 presents data on the refolding kinetics in the absence and presence of 7 m glycerol determined by activity measurements. The addition of glycerol slowed down the kinetics of refolding as evidenced by the rate constants of 0.213 and 0.126 min–1 in 7 m glycerol compared with 0.635 and 0.148 min–1 in the control buffer at 10 and 35 °C, respectively. Data on the aggregation kinetics of CS during refolding by manual mixing in the presence and absence of 1 m polyols as monitored by fluorescence at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 4a. Polyols suppressed the aggregation of CS depending on the number of hydroxyl groups in them, which is in accordance with their effect on the thermal stability of proteins (39Gekko K. Morikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44Back J.F. Oakenfull D. Smith M.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar)"
https://openalex.org/W2016655511,Adaptations in neurons of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) induced by chronic morphine treatment mediate expression of many signs of opioid withdrawal. The abnormally elevated action potential rate of opioid-sensitive PAG neurons is a likely cellular mechanism for withdrawal expression. We report here that opioid withdrawal in vitro induced an opioid-sensitive cation current that was mediated by the GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1) and required activation of protein kinase A (PKA) for its expression. Inhibition of GAT-1 or PKA also prevented withdrawal-induced hyperexcitation of PAG neurons. Our findings indicate that GAT-1 currents can directly increase the action potential rates of neurons and that GAT-1 may be a target for therapy to alleviate opioid-withdrawal symptoms.

Arginines B13 and B17 are each chelated by an aspartic acid/glutamic acid pair and by isoleucine B20, which, offset by a one-quarter helix turn from a straight line connecting the arginines, interacts with a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids. The binding cassette of relaxin cuts at an angle of ∼45° across five parallel leucine-rich repeats. The arginine residues 13 and 17, which evolve parallel from the B-chain α-helix of relaxin, neutralize the charge repulsion of the juxta-posed acidic groups on the receptor and thereby trigger closure of a hydrogen bonding network around the guanidinium groups. Thus, relaxin is bound by synchronized chelation of two arginines and stabilized by hydrophobic interaction of isoleucine B20 with tryptophan, isoleucine, and leucine in neighboring leucine-rich repeats of the receptor. Deletion of any one of the three features diminishes interaction to the level of nonspecific binding. This model explains the exquisite sensitivity of relaxin binding avidity to minute changes in the disposition of the guanidinium and the size dependence of the hydrophobic binding residue in position B20.

The peptide hormone relaxin supports vital processes such as heart function, coronary and peripheral blood flow, and physiological adaptation to the stresses of pregnancy (1.Dschietzig T. Stangl K.

The positive effect of this hormone on peripheral and cardiac blood flow makes relaxin, along with its receptor, a prime target for research on chronic debilitating diseases.

This genre of receptors, including those for thyrotropin, luteotropin, and human chorionic gonadotropin, is known to have leucine-rich repeats in their ectodomains and to be anchored to the cell surface by seven helical transmembrane segments. The binding sites are thought to be large and to cover much of the inner aspects of the concave pleated sheet structures (6.Smith G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V. Richter C. Vassart G. Pardo L.

Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In contrast, our earlier work on relaxin has revealed sharply defined binding structures (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that would require an equally well defined binding region on the receptor surface. LRR proteins, such as the RNase inhibitor for example, can bind proteins with extraordinarily high affinity (9.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 10.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Binding constants reach into the femtomolar range when as many as 26 residues make surface contact (11.Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, our structure function studies with synthetic relaxin showed clearly that the contact with LGR7 is essentially limited to three residues located in the center of the B-chain helix. Thus, the binding energy sufficient to yield an affinity constant of ∼10−10m had to be derived from an unusual receptor/ligand interaction. A binding cassette of the general formula RXXXRXX(I/V) was discovered that appears in every species-specific relaxin regardless of major primary structure variations in the molecule (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, steric effects are exerted by glycine A14, which, by its smallness, controls the position of the A-chain loop (12.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13124-13128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we are presenting evidence for the identity of a contact residue on LGR7 for each of the members of the relaxin-binding cassette. Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—Escherichia coli strain XL1Blue MRF′ was used for plasmid amplification and the human embryo kidney cell strain 293T/17 (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-11286) for protein expression. Plasmid pUC18 served as cloning vector, and plasmid pcDNA3.1.zeo (Invitrogen) was utilized as expression vector. Mutagenic primers used in this study were custom synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Integrated DNA Technologies). Sequences are available upon request. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the LGR7 Receptor—The full-length cDNA of the human relaxin receptor LGR7 in the pUC-18 cloning vector encoded the prolactin signal peptide and the LGR7 mature protein (courtesy Dr. Hsueh, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Stanford University). This cDNA was further modified to contain the coding sequence for the FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the mature LGR7 protein, a unique BamHI site at the 5′-end and a unique EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the coding sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using pairs of custom oligonucleotides in combination with a polymerase chain reaction. The reaction was performed starting with 50 ng of the DNA template, 10 pmol of each primer, 250 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 1 unit of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) in 50 μl of the reaction buffer. The reaction mixture was heated to 94 °C for 2 min followed by 18 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 6 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. Wild-type DNA was digested with 10 units of endonuclease DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C, and the PCR reaction mixture was used to transform competent XL1-Blue-MRF′ cells. Individual colonies of the transformed cells were grown, and the plasmid was isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing using the primers LGR7-14r (5′-GGCATACAGCTTGTTCTC-3′), LGR7-24r (5′-GAAATTCCATCAGTGTTTGG-3′), or LGR7-4f (5′-GAATGTTTGGTCGGTTCTG-3′). The cDNA of the mutant was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the suitable pcDNA3.1.zeo vector. Individual clones were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and purified using a plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen). The primers used to sequence the DNA were T7 (vector), BGHR, LGR7-4f (the coding cDNA), LGR7-4r (5′-CAGAACCGACCAAACATTC-3′), LGR7-14r, LGR7-14f (5′-GAGAACAAGCTGTATGCC-3′), LGR7-24r, and LGR7-24f (5′-CCAAACACTGATGGAATTTC-3′). Cell Culture—Cells (293T/17) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 11995-065) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere, detached with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), and transferred to 6-well plates (106 cells/well). The 293T/17 cells were grown for 24 h before transfection with either the pcDNA3.1.zeo vector alone (negative control), the vector bearing the LGR7 coding sequence (positive control), or the vector containing the mutant sequences. For transfections, the Polyfect™ reagent (Qiagen) and protocols provided by the manufacturer were used, and the transfected 293T/17 cells were assayed after a 48-h culture period. Relaxin and Antibody Binding Assays—The transfected 293T/17 cells were dislodged by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.5) per 10 ml of conditioned medium for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, suspended two times in 1 ml of ice cold binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lysine, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3), and recentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The pellet, collected and reconstituted to 25 × 106 cells per ml, was transferred to ice-cold binding buffer. For binding assays, 0.25 pmol of 125I-Tyr(B30),Phe(A3) human relaxin-II (based on 80% counting efficiency, the molar activity is 3900 cpm/fmol) (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of binding buffer, 40 μl of binding buffer with or without 0.16 nmol of human relaxin II, and 40 μl (equal to 106 cells) of the cell suspension was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter, the cells were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and collected by centrifugation (10 min at 2,000 × g at 4 °C), and the pellet washed with 1 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C. The tips of the vials containing the pellets were placed in tubes and transferred to a γ-counter. Determination of the FLAG Antigen— A radioactive, anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was prepared by the chloramine T method (13.Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Free 125I was removed from the antibody by size separation on Sephadex G25 in 50 mm phosphate buffer saline at pH 7.4 (ratio of labeled per unlabeled antibody was ∼1:10). Antibody binding assays were performed in parallel with receptor binding assays. About 106 cells were suspended in a total assay volume of 100 μl containing the labeled antibody (100,000 cpm/assay) in the presence or absence of 0.2 μg (0.2 nmol) of the synthetic FLAG peptide and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were recovered, washed as described above, and the pellet was analyzed in a γ-counter. Relative relaxin binding of the mutants was calculated as B/Bo (%) = {[(TBM - NBM) - (TBV-NBV)]/[(TBW - NBW) - (TBV - NBV)]}× F × 100, where TB is total binding, NB is nonspecific binding, subscript M is mutant, subscript V is vector, subscript W is wild type, and F is the correction factor to compensate for differences in protein expression as determined by the binding of 125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody in the presence and absence of the FLAG-peptide where F = (TBAW - NBAW)/(TBAM - NBAM) (subscript A is antibody). Each data point was measured in duplicate. Data are presented as the mean (±S.E.) of 2-4 independent experiments. Molecular Modeling—To model the leucine-rich repeat domain of LGR7 on the protein sequence of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor, the algorithm described by Kajava et al. (14.Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was used in combination with the Sybyl software (version 6.91, Tripos, St Louis, MO). The 24-residue repeats of LGR7 were aligned with the 28/29-residue repeats 3-12 based on the x-ray structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (2BNH). The corresponding residues of LGR7 were mutated, and additional residues located in the helical region on the outer surface were excised. Thereafter, prolines, side chain amides, and other side chains were fixed, and the molecule was energy-minimized using MAXIMIN for 1,000 iterations at default setting. The resulting molecule was checked for the chirality, and differences were corrected. Thereafter, the LGR7 model was again energy-minimized. The leucine-rich repeat domain of LGR7 was modeled on the coordinates of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor using the approach of Kajava et al. (14.Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The reduction in length of the repeats, from the 28/29-amino acid repeat of ribonuclease inhibitor to the 24-residue repeat of LGR7, was achieved by removing the corresponding residues in the helical structure of each repeat. The sequences of the individual repeats are shown in Fig. 1. The energy-minimized molecule shows the expected parallel pleated sheets inside and helices at the outside of a horseshoe-shaped structure. The conserved asparagines appear on the edge of the sheet-turn-helix motif. There was no deviation of the bond lengths from the ideal, as all of the chiral centers were correct and >90% of the ϕ/Ψ angles of the backbone structure are within the allowed values. Further analysis of the backbone structure showed a cis-peptide bond between Ser-201 and Leu-202 located in the β-turn between repeat 4 and 5 and a 164° bond angle of the peptide bond between Cys-248 and Ser-249. The pseudo-energy of this structure was assessed by the program MatchMaker, which revealed an overall average pseudo-energy of -0.04 (15.Godzik A. Kolinski A. Skolnick J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16.Sowdhamini R. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Morgan P.J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The pseudo-energy showed periodic changes to more negative values for the pleated sheet regions and positive values for the helical regions. Although the overall negative pseudo-energy values indicate a good match between the primary structure and the tertiary structure, the probability of a valid structure is higher for the internal surface than for the outer circumference. On this inner surface of the receptor we replaced single residues using site-directed mutagenesis. In parallel experiments, 293T/17 cells were transiently transfected with the genes for the mutant receptor, the LGR7 wild type for positive control, and the vector for negative control. Binding assays were conducted with radioactively labeled human relaxin (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of unlabeled human relaxin. The tracer concentration was sufficient to saturate the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). Binding of 125I-relaxin at saturation to LGR7 in control experiments allowed us to determine the number of receptors per cell surface. Based on the molar activity of the relaxin tracer at 3900 cpm/fmol, the relaxin-receptor expression varied between 2,000 and 5,000 receptors/cell. The concentration of mutant receptors expressed on the cell surface was determined using an 125I-anti-FLAG antibody, and values for receptor binding were corrected accordingly (see Tables and II). Replacement of the acidic residues Asp-231, Glu-233, Glu-277, and Asp-279 by their corresponding amides significantly reduced the affinity of the mutant receptor for the relaxin tracer (Fig. 3). Replacement of Asp-231 by Glu caused the same effect. In addition, replacing either Trp-180, Ile-182, or Leu-204 by alanine caused a significant drop in 125I-relaxin binding. Lower affinity for relaxin was detected for the LGR7 mutants V253A and V255A. Neither the replacement of Asp-276 by Asn nor the replacement of Val-206 by Ala diminished receptor binding (Figs. 3 and 4).Table IIBinding of 125I-anti-FLAG antibody to transfected 293T cells The data set presented here was done in parallel to the receptor binding assays shown in Table I. Assays were performed in a total volume of 100 μl using 1,000,000 cells per data point, 105 cpm of 125I-anti-FLAG antibody in the absence (TB, total binding) and presence (NB, nonspecific binding) of 2 μg/ml FLAG peptide. No specific antibody binding was observed for 293T cells transfected with pcDNA. The correction factor (F) was used to compensate for differences in protein expression.

All transient expression experiments were done in 293T/17 cells using side-by-side transfections of two or three mutants, the wild type (positive control), and vector only (negative control). Relative binding was calculated by comparison of the specific binding of 125I-relaxin to the receptor or receptor mutant corrected according to the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface determined by the specific binding of 125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Comparison of dose-response curves of relaxin binding to LGR7 and LGR7 mutant D276N, a residue that is not part of the receptor-binding site.

Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Structure/function studies showed that arginines B13 and B17 in relaxin could neither be extended (homoarginine) (17.Schwabe C. Büllesbach E. Relaxin and the Fine Structure of Proteins. Springer-Verlag, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar) nor replaced by lysine without a severe reduction in receptor binding avidity (18.Büllesbach E.E. Yang S. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isoleucine B20 in relaxin could be exchanged for other hydrophobic residues, whereby amino acids smaller than Ile or Val reduced binding as a function of reduced overlap (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To investigate which structural features would lead to these unusually stringent binding requirements, we expressed native and mutated LGR7 in 293T cells. Initial direction for experimentation was derived from the coordinates of the intracellular porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (9.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 10.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14.Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The surface produced by the LRR segments in these proteins is connected at the periphery by short α-helices that run normal to the plane of the pleated sheets. Alignment of the leucine-rich repeats 1-10 by the conserved asparagines provided a starting position for discovering configurations that would satisfy the requirements of the binding cassette of relaxin. The distance between the arginine residues was fixed by one helix turn to ∼5.4 Å so that any of the negative charges, not falling into this range, could be ignored. In addition, a hydrophobic surface had to exist ∼4 Å away on one side of a line connecting the negative charges. Based upon the precise determination of the three binding residues in relaxin, initial selection of complementary sites on the receptor was 3-fold strained. Statistically, such a configuration could be expected to occur only once in a relatively small molecule like the LGR7 ectodomain. The topography of our model suggested that, on the pleated sheet, glutamic acid 277 and aspartic acid 279 on leucine-rich repeat number 8 and aspartic acid 231 and glutamic acid 233 on repeat number 6 would match the distribution of arginines in the binding cassette of relaxin (Figs. 1 and 5). Note that each pair of these residues is on the same repeat, i.e. they are fixed by primary sequence relative to each other. This configuration was so convincing that Glu-277 became the starting point for our mutational analysis. Glutamic acid 277 was exchanged for glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. As a control, aspartic acid 276, which points below the plane of the pleated sheet, was mutated to asparagine in a parallel experiment. Transfection efficiency was estimated by means of radioactive antibodies targeted to the FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the LGR7 construct (Tables I and II). The correction factor for expression efficiency was small in any case compared with the total changes in affinity. Ligand concentrations were chosen such as to saturate the unmodified receptor that was always used in control experiments. Under these conditions, the conversion of Glu to Gln at position 277 caused a sharp reduction in the binding of relaxin to LGR7, whereas the conversion of the adjacent Asp-276 to Asn showed no effect (Figs. 3 and 4). This result suggested that Glu-277 made an ionic bond to one of the relaxin arginines, but the glutamate side chain, protruding from a relatively planar pleated sheet, would not be able to discriminate against lysine in place of arginine, for example, as the results of our receptor binding studies with relaxin demand (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aspartic acid 279 (Fig. 1), a potential partner in capturing the guanidinium group, was subsequently replaced by asparagine. This change also eliminated specific ligand/receptor interaction (Fig. 3). A chelating interaction with the guanidinium group, involving two acidic functions, would indeed explain the rejection of the primary amine of lysine in favor of a guanidinium group. Structure/function work on the binding cassette of relaxin, in combination with analogy modeling based on the porcine RNase inhibitor, has provided persuasive evidence for a chelating interaction between either arginine B13 or B17 in relaxin and Glu-277 and Asp-279 on LGR7.Table IRepresentative receptor binding data of the mutants Each set of experiments included a side-by-side transfection of 293T cells with wild type DNA (LGR7), vector DNA (pcDNA), and mutant DNA.

Two acidic residues were observed that satisfied this requirement, i.e. aspartic acid 231 and glutamic acid 233, both in repeat number 6. Asp-231 was replaced by asparagine and Glu-233 by glutamine, and the two constructs were tested in transiently transfected 293T cells. Both mutants did not bind relaxin, suggesting that LGR7 bound the two arginines of relaxin each with an aspartic and glutamic acid pair. The arginines would neutralize the charge repulsion between residues 231/233 and 277/279 and thus induce a binding configuration comprising the guanidinium group sandwiched between two acidic functions. Receptor/ligand interaction is usually associated with a binding pocket, which is sort of a nesting feature on the receptor that is not conspicuous on the inner LGR7 surface. Despite the curvature of the inner aspect of LGR7 that seems to cradle the relaxin molecule, one is still faced with an end-to-end interaction between the arginines protruding from an α-helix in relaxin and acidic residues from a pleated sheet of the receptor surface. The inner aspect of the LGR7 receptor is slightly concave but without the varied landscape that a binding cleft in a globular protein provides. At this point our results would allow relaxin to bind the receptor in two orientations, either with the C-terminal toward the cell or toward the cysteine-rich domain. This is very important information when one begins to search for the signal initiation site of relaxin. The potential hydrophobic interaction region that would have to match Ile B20 in relaxin is located ∼3.5-4 Å C-terminally to B17 arginine in relaxin, offset from the straight line connecting the arginine residues. This arrangement provides an element of asymmetry that would unambiguously orient the ligand on the receptor surface. Tryptophan 180, isoleucine 182, leucine 204, and valine 206 form such a hydrophobic cluster at the correct distance to engage isoleucine B20 in relaxin. This cluster of hydrophobic residues is located on LRRs 4 and 5 of LGR7 (Figs. 1 and 5). Hydrophobic sites, by the nature of interaction, should show some tolerance to replacement by like functions of different size, which is exactly what we observed. Mutation of tryptophan (position 180 on repeat number 4) to alanine reduces binding to ∼10% of control value. The exchange of isoleucine 182 on the same repeat again reduces binding to ∼10%, and replacement of leucine 204 on repeat number 5 by alanine still binds relaxin to ∼20% of the native receptor. These observations are strongly supported by the structure function work that preceded this study (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Isoleucine and valine in position B20 (the binding cassette of relaxin) would provide nearly the same overlap and, hence, essentially the same binding intensity. Substituting isoleucine for either nor-leucine or α-aminobutyric acid diminished binding progressively until it bottomed out with the introduction of alanine, leading to a ∼1,000-fold reduction. A substantial decrease was obtained when we converted members of the contact site in LGR7, i.e. tryptophan 180, isoleucine 182, or leucine 204 to alanine. Furthermore, the exchange of valine 206 on repeat number 5 for alanine caused no significant loss in binding avidity, thus providing a demarcation for the extent of the hydrophobic binding region. Based upon these experiments, we concluded that the hydrophobic cluster on repeats 4 and 5 of LGR7 is the interaction site for Ile B20 in relaxin. The discovery of the hydrophobic interaction site fixes the binding direction for relaxin on the LRR surface such that the C-terminal of the B chain must point toward the N-terminal end of the receptor. Analyses of complex systems must be broken down into the various components that enter into the final equation. Stringent requirements for the interpretation of the data concerning the relaxin-binding site on the receptor have been derived from the precise description of the binding cassette of relaxin. It follows that the binding residues on the receptor have to be arranged like a mirror image of the binding cassette. Although finding one binding residue would be a questionable result, the discovery of three binding centers at exactly the distance from each other as dictated by the x-ray coordinates of relaxin represents very strong evidence. These conditions have been met by our results. We have shown that the two arginines, B13 and B17, in relaxin have charge and chain length requirements, and our experiments reveal that if any of these parameters is mismatched, binding will be reduced 1,000-fold. For example, amidation of only one of the acid functions in one of the two chelating pairs, either aspartate or glutamate, to the corresponding amide is sufficient to abolish binding. It was equally astounding to note that a change in length by one carbon, without changing the charge, of one of the chelating acids eliminated binding as well. Thus the fact that mutating aspartic acid 231 to glutamic acid abolished binding not only speaks of a highly restricted chelating configuration, it also locates the interacting functional groups with respect to each other with a precision that could not be matched by cross-linking experiments. This result, together with the previously reported binding sites on relaxin, again fixes the entire binding site within the plane of the LGR7 leucine-rich ectodomain. The two arginines interacting with four acidic side chains of two different configurations alone lock the arginine interaction in place (Fig. 6). Still, the direction of the relaxin B-chain helix could be determined only from a third interaction site, which was provided by Ile B20 in relaxin and its partners in the hydrophobic cluster of the receptor, including Trp-180, Ile-182, and Leu-204. Replacement of either of the valine residues (positions 253 or 255) in LRR segment number 7 by alanine caused a significant reduction of relaxin binding without a possibility of direct interaction with the ligand. The opposing potential contact residues Glu B14 and Val B16 in relaxin are located between the two binding arginines in relaxin and point away from the receptor interaction site. In addition, these residues can be replaced freely by smaller and larger residues without affecting binding affinity (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 2E. E. Büllesbach and C. Schwabe, unpublished results. It is likely that the valines in LGR7 orient the acidic residues on repeats number 6 and number 8 to permit the optimal overlap with the arginines on the B chain helix. A construct of LGR7 without the cysteine-rich region will not bind relaxin. Our extensive structure function work with relaxin has revealed no residues that influence receptor binding other than the binding cassette and glycine A14 (8.Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19.Schwabe C. Büllesbach E.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fact that deletion of the cysteine-rich region eliminates binding completely suggests that the binding site has been disassembled by structural changes, because the cysteine-rich region may stabilize the relatively short pleated sheet segment of the receptor. In summary, the LRR surface of proteins would, a priori, make this structure unsuited for the kind of binding pockets that come to mind when one thinks of very selective protein-protein interactions. LGR7/relaxin interaction is unique in that the specificity is established by pendulous arginine side chains, evolving in-line from an α-helix in relaxin, that are met by the protruding acidic side chains of the receptor, and all of this is supported by laterally displaced hydrophobic binding residues that act like the third leg of a tripod. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a binding site that could well be typical for other protein binding leucine-rich repeat receptors. Our model explains the widely observed extensive cross-reactivity of relaxins that exists despite significant sequence variations as long as the binding cassette is present. Precise knowledge of the receptor-binding cassette in relaxin and the topology of its members has provided de facto confirmation of the analogy-derived model of LGR7, at least to the extent of the relaxin contact region.

To investigate a possible biological function of the pro-form of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a member of the TGF-β family, mature BMP-2, proBMP-2, and the isolated pro-peptide were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli cells, and a biophysical comparison was performed. Protocols were developed that allowed efficient refolding and subsequent purification of the proteins. ProBMP-2 could be processed to an N-terminally truncated form of BMP-2, digit removed BMP-2 (drBMP-2), that possessed biological activity, i.e. it induced ectopic bone formation. Bone inducing activity was also displayed by proBMP-2. The three proteins were characterized both by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. From these analyses, predominant β-sheet secondary structural elements in the pro-peptide were deduced. The thermodynamic stability of the pro-peptide was determined by chemical unfolding assays. As in the case of NGF/proNGF, the mature part of BMP-2 stabilized the structure of the pro-peptide moiety. However, in contrast to NGF/proNGF, the pro-peptide did not stimulate oxidative folding of the mature part in vitro.

The cystine knot is a structural signature that describes disulfide connectivities in which two pairs of disulfide bridges form a ring through which a third disulfide bridge is threaded. The motif has been discovered in both inhibitory peptides and growth factors (1Lindholm P. Göransson U. Johansson S. Claeson P. Gullbo J. Larsson R. Bohlin L. Backlund A. Mol.

With an antiparallel head to head arrangement of two monomers in the functional dimer, they belong to the TGF-β subgroup. BMP-2 is one of the most intensively characterized BMP representatives, finding clinical application by its ability to induce bone formation (3Valentin-Opran A. Wozney J. Csimma C. Lilly L.

The pre-sequence mediates translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and thus secretion. The function of the 263-residue pro-peptide is hitherto unknown.We and others could demonstrate for NGF/proNGF that the pro-peptide assists maturation in vivo and oxidative folding in vitro, probably assisting the latter process by facilitating formation of the correct disulfide connectivities (10Rattenholl A.

Recently, pro-forms of growth factors have received intensive scientific attention because it has been shown in some cases that the pro-peptides have functions in addition to those of maturation and/or folding of the mature growth factors. The presence of the pro-peptide can modulate or even change the biological activity of the respective cytokine. Several lines of evidence indicate that the pro-form of NGF induces pro-apoptotic signals (13Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 14Ibánez C.F. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 284-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), in contrast to NGF, which acts as a mitogen (11Rattenholl A. Lilie H. Grossmann A. Stern A. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the pro-peptide targets NGF to a newly described receptor protein, sortilin, that specifically binds the pro-form (15Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). In the case of TGF-β, the pro-peptide has been demonstrated to delay the function of the mature growth factor and thus has been termed latency-associated peptide β-1-LAP (16Böttinger E.P. Factor V.M. Tsang M. L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Kopp J.B. Qian S.W. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jullien P. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5538-5543PubMed Google Scholar). The pro-peptide of TFG-β has a similar size to that of BMP-2; the homology of the two pro-peptides with 25% identical amino acids is moderate, however. A stabilizing role has been found in cell culture for a closely related pro-peptide, that of BMP-4 (19Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Sequential cleavage at two distinct sites within the pro-domain by furin or furin-like proteases is required for the activation of the BMP-4 precursor (20Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar, 21Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proBMP-2 and proBMP-6 have been detected in arthritic synovial tissue (22Lories R.J.U. Derese I. Ceuppens J.L. Luyten F.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whereas these results suggest a function of the pro-peptides in modulation of BMP activities, no specific function of the pro-peptide of BMP-2 could be assigned as yet. In the present study, refolding and purification protocols for proBMP-2, BMP-2, and the pro-peptide have been established to allow a biophysical comparison of the three proteins. Our results document that, similarly to NGF and proNGF, the pro-peptide part is stabilized by the mature part. Because oxidative folding in vitro is not stimulated by the pro-peptide, an in vivo role beyond structure formation can be anticipated for the pro-peptide moiety.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—DNA encoding pre-proBMP-2 was provided by Roche Diagnostics. Cloning of coding sequences for proBMP-2, BMP-2, and the pro-peptide was achieved by PCR. The start of the coding sequence for the pro-peptide was determined by the program PSORT (psort.nibb.ac.jp.), which predicted cleavage of the signal sequence between Gly–263 and Gly–264. Gene expression with DNA for the pro-peptide and proBMP-2 was only successful in vector pET15b (Novagen), which codes for an N-terminal histidine tag. Expression of the BMP-2 cDNA was performed in pET11a (Novagen). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was used as bacterial host strain. Before transformation with plasmids encoding BMP-2 proteins, the cells were transformed with plasmid pUBS520 (23Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The vector carries the gene for dnaY encoding the tRNAAGA/AGG for l-arginine codons. These codons are extremely rare in E. coli but are frequent in eukaryotic genes and thus often limit heterologous expression. Additional copies of dnaY overcome the lack of that otherwise rare tRNA. For recombinant production, cultivation in either shake flasks with 2YT medium or a Biostat ED fermenter was performed. For fermentation, the following medium was used: 54 g/liter yeast extract (OHLY KAV; DHW, Cologne, Germany), 0.54 g/liter NH4Cl, and 12 g/liter glycerol. The pH was adjusted with 1 m K2HPO4 to 7.0–7.4. Addition of 2.8 mm MgSO4, 0.01% thiamine, 0.1% ampicillin, and 0.05% kanamycin occurred by sterile filters. Feeding was started at A600 = ∼20. At A600 = 60, induction of gene expression was started by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After an additional 3 h of cultivation, cells were harvested by centrifugaion. Pellets were shock-frozen and stored at –80 °C.Protein Refolding and Purification—Inclusion body (IB) isolation and solubilization were performed according to Rudolph et al. (24Rudolph R. Böhm G. Lilie H. Jaenicke R. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 57-99Google Scholar). Renaturation of proBMP-2 and BMP-2 was carried out by 1:100 dilutions of IB protein solubilized in 5 m guanidinium chloride into refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 1 m l-arginine, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 2 mm reduced glutathione). Prior to use, the buffer was degassed and pre-chilled to 10 °C. Protein concentration during renaturation was 3 μm. After renaturation (3–14 days), both proBMP-2 and BMP-2 were concentrated using a Filtron Minisette (PallGelman) cross-flow device. pH was adjusted to 5.5, and the material was dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris, 75 mm acetic acid, 0.2 m KH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea and then filtered. Subsequently, ∼150 mg of protein was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap™ heparin-Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) column that had been pre-equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, 125 mm acetic acid, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea (buffer A) containing 0.3 m NaCl. Loading was performed at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.6 m NaCl. Elution of dimeric proBMP-2 was finally achieved by application of a linear gradient from 0.6 to 0.8 m NaCl in 5 column volumes.Purification of renatured BMP-2 was identical to that of proBMP-2 with the following exceptions: after dialysis against buffer A, the column was loaded with a maximum of 30 mg of dialyzed protein. Dimeric BMP-2 species was eluted at a NaCl concentration of 0.7 m. Homogenous fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm NH4-acetate, pH 4.0, and lyophilized.ProBMP-2 was further purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography (see below). Lyophilized protein was dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 10 mm K-acetate, pH 4.5. The solution was then mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0, and incubated on ice overnight. Subsequently, the solution was loaded at a flow rate of 7.5 ml/min onto a self-packed 30-ml Macro-Prep CHT-I column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated with 0.1 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0 (buffer M). For elution, 0.1 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0, and 1 m K-phosphate (buffer N) was used. Washing was performed with 4 column volumes of 10% and 20% buffer N. Elution was started by a gradient from 20% to 40% buffer N. ProBMP-2 eluted at 40% buffer N. Homogeneous fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 0.1 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0.For renaturation and purification of the pro-peptide, IB protein was solubilized at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. An equilibrated 5-ml HiTrap™ heparin-Sepharose HP column was loaded with ∼40 mg of pro-peptide at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Due to the high DNA content of the pro-peptide IB preparation, the column was washed extensively with buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl until a baseline of the UV absorption was reached. Elution was performed by a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.7 m NaCl in buffer A (20 column volumes). Pro-peptide-containing fractions were pooled and, for refolding by dialysis, diluted 1:2 with 2 m l-arginine/HCl, 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. A first dialysis was performed against 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and a second dialysis was performed against 25 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.0. Renatured protein was then further purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Here, the same buffer system used for proBMP-2 was applied (buffers M and N). The column was loaded with 75 mg of refolded protein (0.5 mg/ml). Washing was performed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with 1.5 column volumes of buffer M and then 3 column volumes of 7% buffer N. The pro-peptide eluted at 25% buffer N that was reached after 4 column volumes. Homogenous fractions were pooled, concentrated with polyethylene glycol 35000, and then dialyzed against 0.1 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0.Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopy—Spectroscopic analyses were carried out at 20 °C. Dialysis buffer was used as a reference. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with a FluoroMax-3 spectrophotometer. Slit widths for excitation and emission were set to 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Excitation was at 295 nm. Measurements were recorded in 0.5-nm intervals in quartz cuvettes. CD spectroscopy was performed with either an AVIV 62A DS or a Jasco J710. Recordings were done in 1-nm steps, and 10 recordings were averaged. Ellipticities were calculated according to Schmid (25Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 261-297Google Scholar).Preparation of Digit Removed BMP-2 (drBMP-2)—drBMP-2 was obtained via limited proteolysis from proBMP-2. Refolded protein was dialyzed in two steps against 0.1 m Tris, 0.125 m acetic acid, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea and 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4 m urea, and 1 mm EDTA. For proteolysis, dialyzed samples were incubated at a concentration of 2 mg/ml with 1% (w/w) trypsin for 4 h at 4 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. drBMP-2 was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Fractogel EMD Phenyl S (Merck) was added directly to trypsin-cleaved protein at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) followed by dialysis against 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0. The loaded gel material was transferred to an empty column and thoroughly washed with (a) dialysis buffer, (b) 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, (c) 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, and 4 m urea, and (d) the same buffer in which urea was replaced by 1 m l-arginine. Elution was performed with 6 m guanidinium chloride and 0.2 m acetic acid. drBMP-2-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then sterile-filtered.Denaturant-induced Unfolding—Proteins were incubated at the indicated concentrations of urea or guanidinium chloride for 24 h to ensure equilibrium conditions. The exact concentrations of the denaturants were controlled by refractrometry. Thermodynamic stabilities and m values were determined according to Refs. 26Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar and 27Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar.Biological Activity—Biological activity was tested with eight adult male Wistar rats (body weight, ∼400 g; Charles River, Germany). The study was performed according to the current legal regulations of animal care and protection and the guidelines of the local authorities. Implant preparations were performed under laminar flow hoods. drBMP-2 and proBMP-2 were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at protein concentrations of 0.125 and 0.65 mg/ml, respectively. Solutions were sterile-filtered and applied to ceramic β-tri-calcium cubes (5 × 5 × 5 mm; ChronOs, Mathys, Switzerland). In total, 0.25 μmole (calculated for the dimeric species) of each protein was adsorbed. Cubes were implanted into abdominal wall pouches of anesthetized rats. Each rat received a total of four implants. 30 days after implantation, animals were sacrificed by drug overdose, and implants were excised. One half of the implants was examined histochemically, whereas the other half was deep-frozen for subsequent determination of alkaline phosphatase activity. For histochemical analysis, the implants were dehydrated and embedded in methylmethacrylate resins. 100–150-μm sections were cut with a diamond band saw and ground with a grinding machine to ∼50 μm. Surface staining was done with Toluidine O. Determination of alkaline phosphatase was performed after homogenization of the samples with a Potter S (B. Braun Biotech) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100. Tissue debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was tested for activity of alkaline phosphatase by the Ecoline test kit (Merck).RESULTSThe Pro-peptide Plays No Significant Role during in Vitro Oxidative Folding—Because our previous results had clearly indicated that oxidative folding of NGF is stimulated in vitro by the pro-peptide (10Rattenholl A. Ruoppolo M. Flagiello A. Monti M. Vinci F. Marino G. Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Rattenholl A. Lilie H. Grossmann A. Stern A. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this is also the case for BMP-2/proBMP-2. The cDNAs for BMP-2, proBMP-2, and the BMP-2 pro-peptide were cloned into pET vectors to allow efficient expression. All three proteins were deposited in IBs upon recombinant production in E. coli. IB formation of the pro-peptide was unexpected because this protein fragment does not possess any cysteines that could be linked in disulfide bonds. Protocols were developed that enabled efficient recovery of native proteins from the IB pellets. After renaturation, the proteins were further purified as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” to ensure a single, homogenous, native species for further analysis. In Fig. 1, A–C, representative purification steps and the results of the final purification steps are illustrated. After purification, yields of mature BMP-2 and proBMP-2 were 25% and 10%, respectively, as calculated from the amount of protein originally present in the IB pellets. Differences in final yields were mainly due to losses during purification of renatured protein because SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed that after renaturation, disulfide-bonded dimeric species were obtained with yields of ∼50%. Thus, in contrast to NGF, at least for in vitro structure formation, the pro-peptide of BMP-2 does not appear to be required.ProBMP-2 Can Be Processed in Vitro to drBMP-2—In analogy to proBMP-4, it is assumed that BMP-2 becomes converted to mature BMP-2 by pro-hormone convertases of the furin type that cleave at a dibasic sequence motif (20Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar, 28Seidah N.G. Prat A.

Because we had shown previously that the pro-form of NGF can also be cleaved in vitro by trypsin to obtain mature NGF (11Rattenholl A. Lilie H. Grossmann A. Stern A. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), this protease was used to test maturation of proBMP-2 to BMP-2. Proteolysis with trypsin resulted in N-terminally truncated BMP-2 (Fig. 2). Peptide sequence analysis revealed that the ratio of proteolysis products was 2:1:3 corresponding to truncated species that started with Arg7, Lys8, and Arg9. N-terminally truncated forms of BMP-2 have been described previously and referred to as drBMP-2 (30Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L.

A non-natural, N-terminally modified form of BMP-2 lacking this site displayed increased biological activity in a limb bud cell assay when compared with full-length BMP-2, an observation that had been explained by sequestration of the full-length protein by heparin via the heparin binding site (31Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The fact that the N-terminal truncation products were trypsin-resistant (30Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F. Grant R.A. Chen G-X. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Rosenbaum J.S. Mol. Cell.

Proteolysis with trypsin was performed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of processing was performed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining (proBMP-2) or Coomassie Blue staining (BMP-2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both ProBMP-2 and drBMP-2 Induce Ectopic Bone Formation—The next question was whether drBMP-2 generated in vitro from proBMP-2 would be biologically active. Biological activity of drBMP-2 was analyzed in an animal model. Both drBMP-2 and proBMP-2 were applied to ceramic cubes and implanted into rats. Upon explantation after 30 days, all implants appeared to be well tolerated, and no signs of adverse effects were detectable. In both the drBMP-2 and proBMP-2 groups, clearly visible bone formation and hematopoietic bone marrow were observed in most cases on the outer surface and within the ceramic implant cubes (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, control implants were covered by thin layers of surrounding muscle with some nutrient vessels and appeared otherwise unchanged (Fig. 3C). No obvious differences in the basic histological results between proBMP-2 and drBMP-2 were detected. Thus, drBMP-2 derived from refolded proBMP-2 exhibited at least very similar, if not identical, osteoinductive activity as proBMP-2.Fig. 3Bone inducing activity of drBMP-2 (A) and proBMP-2 (B). Ceramic cubes were analyzed histochemically as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bright blue areas represent bone tissue, and dark blue cells represent osteoblasts. C, control implant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For quantification of the observed bone inducing activity of proBMP-2 and drBMP-2, the activity of alkaline phosphatase was determined for each implant (Fig. 4). The activities were analyzed using the Friedman rank test and pairwise comparison according to Wilcoxon and Wilcox (33Sachs L. Angewandte Statistik: Anwendung statistischer Methoden. Springer, Berlin1992Crossref Google Scholar). Enzyme activities of drBMP-2- and proBMP-2-coated implants were significantly increased compared with the control implants but did not differ significantly from each other (α = 5%). In summary, both drBMP-2 and proBMP induced ectopic bone formation to the same extent, at least in the animal test performed here.Fig. 4Quantification of biological activities. Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Units indicate total enzyme activity of half an implant block.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Mature Part of BMP-2 Influences the Spectroscopic Properties of the Pro-peptide Moiety in ProBMP-2—Besides the biological activity in the case of proBMP-2 and drBMP-2, the correctly folded state of the three proteins (proBMP-2, BMP-2, and the pro-peptide) was confirmed by spectroscopic analyses. First, fluorescence spectra of the native proteins were compared with those of the denatured samples. These studies were complicated by the low solubility of BMP-2 at neutral pH. Improved solubility of BMP-2 at pH values of <6 had been reported previously (31Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 34Vallejo L.F. Rinas U. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to obtain comparable data, fluorescence spectra of proBMP-2 and the pro-peptide were also recorded at acidic pH. A clear shift of the emission maxima from 339.5 to 349 nm (proBMP-2) and from 340 to 351 nm (pro-peptide) indicated that incubation at pH 4.7 resulted in an at least partial denaturation of the pro-peptide (Fig. 5, A and C). Incubation of proBMP-2 in 6 m guanidinium chloride and of the pro-peptide in 5.25 m urea at pH 7.0 caused additional shifts of the emission maxima to 359 nm. This additional shift was interpreted as a final complete solvent exposure of the tryptophans in strong denaturants at high concentrations and a partial solvent exposure of either some or all of the three tryptophan residues in the pro-peptide at pH 4.7. Fluorescence analyses were complemented by UV spectroscopy under identical conditions (data not shown). The UV difference spectra of native and denatured proBMP-2 clearly differed depending on whether the protein was incubated at acidic pH or in guanidinium chloride, again supporting the hypothesis that acidic pH partially denatures the pro-peptide moiety. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the UV difference spectra of the native pro-peptide and the pro-peptide that had been incubated at low pH or in urea were almost superimposable.Fig. 5Fluorescence spectra of proBMP-2 (A), BMP-2 (B), and pro-peptide (C). Protein concentrations were 0.4 μm (proBMP-2), 1.9 μm (BMP-2), and 1.3 μm (pro-peptide).

In this study, we examined the cellular functions of group VIB iPLA2γ. Lentiviral transfection of iPLA2γ into HEK293 cells resulted in marked increases in spontaneous, stimulus-coupled, and cell death-associated release of arachidonic acid (AA), which was converted to prostaglandin E2 with preferred cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 coupling. Conversely, treatment of HEK293 cells with iPLA2γ small interfering RNA significantly reduced AA release, indicating the participation of endogenous iPLA2γ. iPLA2γ protein appeared in multiple sizes according to cell types, and a 63-kDa form was localized mainly in peroxisomes. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of cellular phospholipids revealed that iPLA2γ and other intracellular PLA2 enzymes acted on different phospholipid subclasses. Transfection of iPLA2γ into HCA-7 cells also led to increased AA release and prostaglandin E2 synthesis via both COX-1 and COX-2, with a concomitant increase in cell growth. Immunohistochemistry of human colorectal cancer tissues showed elevated expression of iPLA2γ in adenocarcinoma cells. These results collectively suggest distinct roles for iPLA2β and iPLA2γ in cellular homeostasis and signaling, a functional link between peroxisomal AA release and eicosanoid generation, and a potential contribution of iPLA2γ to tumorigenesis.

The second mammalian iPLA2 isoform, group VIB iPLA2γ,is homologous to iPLA2β in the catalytic region, whereas the N-terminal regions of these two enzymes show no similarity (31.Mancuso D.J.

Because bromoenol lactone (BEL), an iPLA2 inhibitor that has been used frequently for analysis of the cellular functions of iPLA2β, inhibits all iPLA2 isozymes (31.Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M.

In this study, we examined the cellular fatty acid-releasing and prostaglandin (PG)-biosynthesizing functions of iPLA2γ in comparison with those of other intracellular PLA2 enzymes. Our results indicate that iPLA2γ has the ability to promote basal and stimulus-coupled AA release; that iPLA2γ displays unique cyclooxygenase (COX) coupling for immediate and delayed PGE2 production; that iPLA2γ, iPLA2β, and cPLA2α act on different cellular phospholipid pools; and that the 63-kDa form (relative to the 88-kDa full-length form) of iPLA2γ is dominant in several cell lines and is located in peroxisomes. Furthermore, the elevated expression of iPLA2γ in human colorectal adenocarcinoma implicates its potential role in tumorigenesis.

Briefly, cDNAs were amplified by PCR with the Advantage cDNA polymerase mixture (Clontech) and primers 5′-CACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAA-3′ (FLAG primer) and 5′-TCACAATTTTGAAAAGAATGGAAG-3′ (iPLA2γ-3′ primer) with iPLA2γ cDNA in the pEFBOS-Ffg vector (42.Tanaka H.

Experiments with iPLA2γ Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Two sets of synthetic hairpin-forming oligonucleotides directed to iPLA2γ were prepared (Beck): for set 1 (coding sequences shown in italic type), 5′-GATCCCGCTCTTCAGGCTGCAGTTAGTTCAAGAGACTAACTGCAGCCTGAAGAGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACTCTTCAGGCTGCAGTTAGTCTCTTGAACTAACTGCAGCCTGAAGAGCGG-3′ (antisense); and for set 2, GATCCCGTGTGGCAGGCCATTAGAGCTTCAAGAGAGCTCTAATGGCCTGCCACATTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAATGTGGCAGGCCATTAGAGCTCTCTTGAAGCTCTAATGGCCTGCCACACGG-3′ (antisense). After annealing, both sets of double-stranded DNAs harbored BamHI and HindIII sites at each 5′- and 3′-end. After cutting with BamHI and HindIII, they were ligated into the BamHI/HindIII-digested pRNA-U-6.1/Hygro vector (GenScript Corp.) with T4 ligase (Takara Biomedicals). After transformation into Top10 competent cells (Invitrogen), the plasmids were extracted and purified using the Endofree plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen Inc.). HEK293 cells grown in 12-well plates (Iwaki Glass) were transfected with a mixture of plasmids for iPLA2γ siRNA (sets 1 and 2; 1 μg of each) or 2 μg of mock plasmid (pRNA-U6.1/Hygro) with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the method described previously (44.Kamei D.

The cells were then subjected to limiting dilution in culture medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin in 96-well plates (Iwaki Glass). The surviving colonies were expanded, and iPLA2γ expression was monitored by immunoblotting. Measurement of PLA2 Activity—PLA2 activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled AA or linoleic acid (LA) released from the substrate phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) bearing [14C]AA or [14C]LA at the sn-2 position (Amersham Biosciences). The substrate in ethanol was dried under a stream of N2 and dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume of 250 μl) consisted of appropriate amounts of the required sample (cell lysate), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, [14C]AA or [14C]LA was extracted by Dole's method (77.Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (12.Murakami M. Shimbara S.

Assays for AA Release and PGE2 Generation—Cells grown to near confluency in 48-well plates (Iwaki Glass) were incubated overnight with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA or [3H]oleic acid (OA) (Amersham Biosciences). After three washes with fresh medium, 100 μl of culture medium with or without 10 μm A23187 (Calbiochem) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (Genzyme) was added to each well, and the radioactivities released into the supernatants after incubation for appropriate periods were measured. The percentage release was calculated using the formula (S/(S + P)) × 100, where S and P are the radioactivities measured in the supernatant and cell pellet, respectively, as described previously (12.Murakami M.

Aliquots of the supernatants from replicate cells (without preincubation with radiolabeled fatty acids) were subjected to PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical Co.). Confocal Laser Microscopy—Cells grown in glass-bottomed dishes (Matsunami Glass) precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in PBS. After three washes with PBS, the fixed cells were sequentially treated with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (for blocking) containing 0.5% (w/v) saponin (for permeabilization) in PBS for 1 h, with anti-iPLA2γ antibody (1:200 dilution) in PBS containing 1% albumin for 1 h, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) in PBS containing 1% albumin for 1 h, with three washes with PBS at each interval. For double immunostaining, cells stained with anti-iPLA2γ antibody were incubated with mouse anti-PEX19 antibody (1:250 dilution) for 2 h, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h. After six washes with PBS, the fluorescent signal was visualized with an Olympus IX70 laser scanning confocal microscope as described previously (45.Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S.

Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI/MS)—Mass spectra were obtained on a Quattro micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with an electrospray ion source as described previously (46.Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts from cells were reconstituted in 2:1 chloroform/methanol (100-300 μmol/liter phosphorus), and 2 μl of the sample was injected per run. The samples were introduced using a flow injector into the ESI chamber at a flow rate of 4 μl/min in a solvent system of acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative scan modes. The flow rate of the nitrogen drying gas was 12 liters/min at 80 °C. The capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.7 kV and 30 V, respectively; argon at 3-4 × 104 torr was used as the collision gas; and a collision energy of 30 - 40 V was used for obtaining fragment ions for precursor ions. Group VIB iPLA2γ Is Expressed Mainly as a 63-kDa Protein in HEK293 Cells—To assess the cellular function of iPLA2γ,we used the lentiviral method to transfect HEK293 cells with cDNA for N-terminally FLAG-tagged iPLA2γ. As assessed by RNA blotting, endogenous iPLA2γ mRNA was detected faintly in mock-transfected control cells and was increased in iPLA2γ-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). A lysate of iPLA2γ-transfected HEK293 cells showed higher Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity toward pure phospholipid substrates than a lysate of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B), confirming successful transfection. The lysate of iPLA2γ-transfected cells hydrolyzed both PE and PC with a trend to a <2-fold preference for the former, and both sn-2-AA and sn-2-LA were liberated equally (Fig. 1B). Thus, iPLA2γ shows relatively poor selectivity for substrate phospholipids in terms of head group and fatty acid moieties. To verify further the expression of overexpressed iPLA2γ protein in the transfectants, we"

Cell death was previously reported to be dependent upon the activation of caspase-1 via interaction with IpaB secreted by intracellular Shigella, but in this study, we show that Shigella infection of macrophages can also induce cell death independent of caspase-1 or IpaB activity. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopic analyses indicated that caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death is morphologically indistinguishable and that both resemble necrosis. Analyses of Shigella mutants or Escherichia coli using co-infection with Listeria suggested that a component common to Gram-negative bacteria is involved in inducing caspase-1-independent cell death. Further studies revealed that translocation of bacterial lipid A into the cytosol of macrophages potentially mediates cell death. Notably, cell death induced by cytosolic bacteria was TLR4-independent. These results identify a novel cell death pathway induced by intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that may play a role in microbial-host interactions and inflammatory responses.

These results identify a novel cell death pathway induced by intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that may play a role in microbial-host interactions and inflammatory responses. Shigella are highly adapted human pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery (also referred to shigellosis). The prominent pathogenic feature of Shigella is the ability to invade a variety of host cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells, which leads to severe inflammatory responses in intestinal tissue. When Shigella reach the colon and rectum, the bacteria translocate through the epithelial barrier via M cells that overlie the solitary lymphoid nodules (1.Wassef J.S. Keren D.F. Mailloux J.L. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 858-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once they reach the underlying M cells, Shigella invade the resident macrophages, and the infecting bacteria escape from the phagosome into the cytosol. Shigella multiply in the cytoplasm and induce cell death through activation of caspase-1 mediated by IpaB protein secreted via the type III secretion system (TTSS), 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; BM, bone marrow; BMDCs, BM-derived dendritic cells; BMMs, BM-derived macrophages; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PGN, peptidoglycan; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidylserine; SPI, Salmonella pathogenicity island; TLR, Toll-like receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; IL, interleukin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; N-WASP, neural-Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; BM, bone marrow; BMDCs, BM-derived dendritic cells; BMMs, BM-derived macrophages; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PGN, peptidoglycan; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidylserine; SPI, Salmonella pathogenicity island; TLR, Toll-like receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; IL, interleukin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; N-WASP, neural-Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein. in turn leading to the maturation and release of IL-1β (2.Navarre W.W.

Microbiol. 1999; 53: 155-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Shigella released from the killed macrophages enter the surrounding enterocytes through their basolateral surface by inducing membrane ruffling and macro-pinocytosis (4.Tran Van Nhieu G. Bourdet-Sicard R. Dumenil G. Blocker A. Sansonetti P.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Once the bacterium is surrounded by a membrane vacuole, it immediately disrupts the vacuole membrane and escapes into the cytoplasm. Shigella multiply in the cytoplasm and move about by inducing actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium, allowing intracellular bacteria to spread within the cytoplasm as well as into the adjacent epithelial cells (5.Bernardini M.L.

During bacterial multiplication within the epithelial cells, peptidoglycan (PGN) is released from the cytoplasmic bacterium, and the muropeptide composed of a diaminopimelate-containing N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid dipeptide is recognized by Nod1/CARD4, which engages the formation of IκB kinase (IKK)·RICK complex required for the activation of NF-κB, thus leading to the production of interleukin (IL)-8 (7.Inohara N.

As a result, the proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines produced by the macrophages, and epithelial cells infected with Shigella elicit strong inflammation in the intestinal tissue. Although it has been reported that macrophages infected by Shigella undergo apoptosis as a result of IpaB-mediated caspase-1 activation (12.Zychlinsky A. Kenny B. Ménard R. Prévost M.C. Holland I.B. Sansonetti P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13.Chen Y. Smith M.R. Thirumalai K. Zychlinsky A.

Immun. 1997; 65: 5165-5170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the notion that Shigella induces cell death through apoptosis is controversial. For example, some studies showed that macrophage cell death induced by Shigella causes necrotic cell death (15.Fernandez-Prada C.M. Hoover D.L. Tall B.D. Venkatesan M.M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Fernandez-Prada C. Tall B.D. Elliott S.E. Hoover D.L. Nataro J.P. Venkatesan M.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Shigella infection of human monoblastic cell line U937 cells differentiated to macrophages elicited apoptosis, whereas infection differentiated toward the myeloid lineage cells caused necrotic cell death (17.Nonaka T. Kuwae A. Sasakawa C. Imajoh-Ohmi S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Nonaka T. Kuwabara T. Mimuro H. Kuwae A. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Microbiology (Reading). 2003; 149: 2513-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, other studies have indicated that cell death of macrophages by Shigella infection is not totally suppressed by caspase-1-deficiency (19.Stockbauer K.E. Foreman-Wykert A.K. Miller J.F. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Hilbi H. Moss J.E. Hersh D. Chen Y. Arondel J. Banerjee S. Flavell R.A. Yuan J. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32895-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that multiple cell death pathways are engaged in the macrophage cell death response to Shigella infection. A similar situation has also been noted in Salmonella-induced macrophage cell death (21.Boise L.H. Collins C.M. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 64-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Hueffer K. Galán J.E. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the morphological features of infected macrophages have been shown to be both necrotic and apoptotic; cell death occurred in Salmonella infection (21.Boise L.H. Collins C.M. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 64-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23.Brennan M.A. Cookson B.T. Mol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 204-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Salmonella infection of macrophages mediated by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) TTSS is capable of inducing both caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death (25.Chen L.M. Kaniga K. Galán J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 26.Monack D.M. Raupach B. Hromockyj A.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9833-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), whereas the cell death mediated by SPI-2 TTSS is partly dependent on caspase-1 (27.Monack D.M. Detweiler C.S. Falkow S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The rapid caspase-1-dependent cell death caused by Salmonella infection is also referred to as “programmed necrotic death,” implying that the cell death is somewhat different from the well characterized apoptotic cell death (23.Brennan M.A. Cookson B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that Salmonella infection leads to caspase-1-independent cell death, in which autophagosome formation in mitochondria is induced by SipB protein secreted by Salmonella SPI-1 TTSS (28.Hernandez L.D. Pypaert M. Flavell R.A. Galán J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, the results of these studies have strongly suggested that the cell death responses of macrophage by Salmonella infection are variable, perhaps reflecting the activation of different host cell death pathways by pathogenic bacteria. In this context, we wished to evaluate the impact of caspase-1-independent macrophage cell death on Shigella infection by using caspase-1-deficient macrophages and dendritic cells and to identify the bacterial component(s) involved in inducing cell death. The results showed that caspase-1-independent cell death occurs in Shigella infection independent of IpaB secreted by Shigella TTSS. Analysis of the morphological features of the caspase-1-dependent and -independent macrophage cell death induced by Shigella indicated that the cells undergo a necrotic type of cell death. Co-infection experiments with a series of Shigella mutants or Escherichia coli K-12 with Listeria monocytogenes have indicated that bacterial component(s) common to Gram-negative bacteria in the macrophage cytosol can induce cell death regardless of the presence or absence of caspase-1 activation. The analysis designed to identify bacterial surface components that stimulate cell death identified lipid A as a potent inducer of cell death in the macrophage cytosol. Importantly, the putative lipid A-mediated death pathway is distinct from the pathway mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and we herein propose that at least lipid A released by Shigella into the macrophage cytosol stimulates a cell death pathway through a mechanism that is independent of caspase-1 and TLR4. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The wild-type Shigella flexneri 2a YSH6000 and L. monocytogenes 1/2a EGD strains have been described previously (29.Suzuki T. Mimuro H. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasaki T.

Yoshikawa M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 470-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used in this study. The ipaB and ipaD null mutants were constructed by allele replacement strategies according to the procedures described previously (33.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus (IID number 671) and Bacillus subtilis (IID 506) were obtained from the Laboratory of Culture collection in our department. To visualize living bacteria in infected cells, a gfp gene was cloned into pUC19-Tp (34.Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and transformed into Shigella strains. The Shigella and Listeria strains were grown routinely in brain-heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences). The Staphylococcus and Bacillus strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (BD Biosciences). Mice—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan Clea. The caspase-1-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background) and TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background) have been described previously (35.Kuida K.

Mouse handling conformed to the requirements of the Animal Care and Use Committee in Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo. Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and alkaline-detoxified LPS derived from E. coli B55:O5 and purified lipid A preparations of E. coli F583 were purchased from Sigma. PGN from S. aureus was from Fluka-Chemie. PGN from Shigella S325 mutant was purified by the methods described previously (10.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zähringer U. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The purified Shigella PGN was further treated with polymyxin B-immobilized beads (Detoxi-Gel; Pierce) to remove contaminating LPS. The following antibodies were obtained commercially: rabbit anti-mouse caspase-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-mouse caspase-9 and -3 (Cell Signaling), and anti-mouse Fas (Jo2; Pharmingen). Bone Marrow (BM) Culture—Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were isolated by plating BM cells from femurs and tibias at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates with 10% fetal calf serum-RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 ng/ml murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech), as described previously (37.Inaba K.

At day 6, loosely adherent cells were harvested by gentle pipetting and enriched for the CD11c-expressing population by using a magnetic cell sorter and N418 magnetic beads (Myltenyi Biotec). Approximately 90% of the enriched population stained positive for CD11c with antibody HL3 (BD Biosciences) according to the flow cytometry analysis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated by plating BM cells in 10% fetal calf serum-RPMI 1640 supplemented with 30% supernatant from L929 cells. At day 5, strongly adherent macrophages were harvested by incubating in PBS on ice for 10 min. Bacterial Infection—DCs or macrophages were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates containing 10% fetal calf serum-RPMI 1640. The cells were infected with wild-type Shigella or Listeria at a multiplicity of infection of ∼10/cell. In the case of non-invasive strains, cells were infected with ∼40 bacteria/cell because preliminary data indicated that ∼4 times fewer macrophages phagocytosed non-invasive bacteria than invasive strains. The plates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to synchronize the stage of infection, and 30 min later, gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (60 μg/ml) were added to kill the extracellular bacteria. For DC maturation, the wells were extensively washed with RPMI 1640 to remove residual extracellular bacteria before adding antibiotics and then incubated for additional 24 h. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay, Flow Cytometry, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—At the time indicated after infection, the LDH activity of the culture supernatants from infected cells was measured by using the CytoTox 96 assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For DC maturation, at 24 h after infection, surviving DCs were incubated with anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2; Pharmingen) to minimize nonspecific staining, and the cells were then stained with biotinylated anti-CD40 (3/23; Pharmingen) and developed with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Pharmingen). For detection of apoptosis/necrosis, at the indicated time after infection, the macrophages were stained with annexin-V-FITC (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min on ice and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest software. Cytokine production in the culture supernatants was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems). Murine Pulmonary Infection and TUNEL Assay—Anesthetized mice were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 108 bacteria in 20 μl as described previously (38.Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A. Arondel J.

The mice were sacrificed at the indicated time, and their lungs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The tissue embedded was frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned using a Leica cryostat (model CM1900). A TUNEL assay was performed using the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega). The sections were also immunostained with TRITC-anti-Shigella LPS antibody and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were analyzed under a confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss), and the cells that contained a nucleus with an intensity higher than an arbitrary threshold of 50 in non-infected lung area were defined as TUNEL-positive. Time-lapse Imaging and Transmission Electron Microscopy—Static or moving images of infected cells were collected with a cooled CCD camera and a time-lapse imaging system (Roper Scientific), and they were analyzed using IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corp.). For electron microscopy, infected cells were fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and after post-fixing with osmium tetroxide, the samples were dehydrated in ethanol end embedded in Epon. Thin sections were examined with a Hitachi (H-7100) electron microscope. Adsorption on the Latex Beads—Exponentially growing bacteria (A600 = 1.0) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in one-fifth volume of PBS. The bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication and clarified by filtration. When indicated, bacterial lysates were boiled for 1 h at 100 °C or treated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Two microliters of latex beads (carboxylated microparticles, 2 μm in diameter; Polyscience) were mixed with 100 μl of bacterial lysates or the bacterial components (1 mg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, washed in PBS, and then added to the macrophages at a density of 10-20 beads/cell, with or without Listeria. Shigella Infection of Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Induces Caspase-1-independent Cell Death—To investigate the Shigella-induced macrophage death in the absence of caspase-1, BMDCs expanded with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or BMMs isolated from wild-type or caspase-1-deficient mice were infected with YSH6000 (wild-type Shigella). Although no release of LDH by caspase-1-deficient BMDCs was detected until 2 h after infection, LDH release began 2 h after infection and increased greatly to a level similar to that in wild-type BMDCs by 5 h (Fig. 1A). A similar cell response was seen in BMMs infected with YSH6000 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that caspase-1-independent cell death occurs upon infection of DCs or macrophages with Shigella. By contrast, the ipaB mutant (ΔipaB), which cannot escape into the cytoplasm, did not cause a significant level of LDH release (Fig. 1A). We then assessed the maturation of caspase-1-deficient BMDCs to confirm that caspase-1-independent cell death was caused by Shigella infection. Wild-type and caspase-1-deficient BMDCs infected with Shigella for 24 h were examined for IL-12 production and cell surface expression of CD40. IL-12 production and CD40 up-regulation were observed upon infection of wild-type and caspase-1-deficient BMDCs with mutant ΔipaB and S325 (TTSS-deficient mutant), but not YSH6000 (Fig. 1, B and C), confirming that all infected DCs had been destroyed by Shigella infection before maturation. A previous study revealed reduced apoptotic cells in the lung of caspase-1-deficient mice when compared with wild-type mice at 6 h after infection with Shigella (38.Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A. Arondel J. Thirumalai K. Banerjee S. Akira S. Takeda K. Zychlinsky A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To assess apoptosis in the lung, we infected caspase-1-deficient and wild-type mice with Shigella via nasal route and determined the number of apoptotic cells by the TUNEL assay. After 6 h of infection, TUNEL-positive macrophage-like cells were detected in both the wild-type and the mutant mice, although there were fewer apoptotic cells in the lung of caspase-1 mutant mice (Fig. 1, D and E), consistent with the previous study (38.Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A. Arondel J. Thirumalai K. Banerjee S. Akira S. Takeda K. Zychlinsky A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). By 12 h after infection, however, the number of apoptotic cells was similar in the lung of wild-type and mutant mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, caspase-1 contributes to the early phase of cell death, but it is not required for the induction of cell death in macrophages and DCs upon infection with Shigella. Characterization of Shigella-induced Cell Death—To characterize the cell death induced by Shigella in wild-type and caspase-1-deficient BMMs, we collected time-lapse images of infected BMMs. When wild-type BMMs were infected with YSH6000, extensive membrane blebbing and nuclear shrinkage were observed within 60 min after infection (Fig. 2A and supplemental movie Fig. 2Amovie1.mov). Similar blebbing was observed 150 min after infection of caspase-1-deficient BMMs (Fig. 2A and supplemental movie Fig. 2Amovie2.mov), and these delayed cellular responses were comparative to that of the LDH release by infected caspase-1-deficient cells (Fig. 1A). Anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis in wild-type BMMs did not cause such extensive membrane blebbing, and small blebs protruded along the cell periphery instead (Fig. 2A). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed that YSH6000 caused the necrotic type of cell death by both wild-type (1 h after infection) and caspase-1-deficient BMMs (3 h after infection). Indeed, both types of infected cells showed cell membrane disappearance and loss of cytoplasm, findings that were strikingly different from typical apoptotic cellular events (Fig. 2B). Thus, although the onset of cell death in caspase-1-deficient macrophages occurred later than wild-type macrophages, the cellular responses of the wild-type and caspase-1-deficient cells to Shigella infection were similar and resembled necrosis rather than apoptosis. Bacterial Components Common to Gram-negative Bacteria Have Cell Death-inducing Activity—IpaB secreted by Shigella has been reported to be the sole bacterial agent capable of triggering macrophage programmed cell death because the protein interacts with and activates caspase-1 (12.Zychlinsky A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32895-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). IpaB and IpaC are essential for TTSS function because they mediate the transfer of effector proteins through the host cell membrane by forming membrane pores at the points of contact between the TTSS needles and the host membrane. The activities are also involved in the ability of Shigella to disrupt the phagocytic vacuoles and escape into the macrophage cytoplasm. Thereby the ipaB and ipaC mutants are unable to escape from phagocytic vacuole into the cytoplasm (12.Zychlinsky A. Kenny B. Ménard R. Prévost M.C. Holland I.B. Sansonetti P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39.Edgeworth J.D. Spencer J. Phalipon A. Griffin G.E. Sansonetti P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1464-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate whether IpaB and IpaC (and IpaD) are involved in inducing macrophage cell death, we created a co-infection system of Shigella mutants and L. monocytogenes in which secretion of listeriolysin O by Listeria helps the non-invasive Shigella mutants to escape into the cytoplasm. Infection of macrophages with Listeria alone did not induce appreciable cell death by 5 h after infection (data not shown). To validate this system, RAW264.7 cells expressing N-WASP (N-WASP is required for Shigella VirG-mediated actin polymerization) (40.Suzuki T. Mimuro H. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were infected with S325 (a TTSS-deficient Shigella mutant that expresses VirG, which is required to mediate actin polymerization) together with Listeria, and the ability of S325 to induce actin assembly was investigated by immunofluorescence staining with anti-Shigella LPS antibody and phalloidin (40.Suzuki T. Mimuro H. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With this system, the bacterium residing within the cytosol could be assembled by polymerized actin. As seen in Fig. 3A, YSH6000 formed actin assemblies by 30 min after infection of RAW264.7 expressing N-WASP. Under the same condition, the number of actin-positive S325 co-infected with Listeria also gradually increased (Fig. 3A), thus demonstrating that S325 resided within the macrophage cytoplasm. By exploiting a similar system using J774A.1 macrophages, the ability of ΔipaB to cause cell death was examined when co-infected with Listeria. At 2 h after infection, ΔipaB was able to induce cell death as judged by LDH release, and the induced cell death resembled necrotic cell death with extensive blebbing and was indistinguishable from that induced by YSH6000 (Fig. 3B and supplemental movies Fig. 3Bmovie1.mov and Fig. 3Bmovie2.mov). In a similar manner, ΔipaC, ΔipaD, S325, and YSH6200 (large plasmid-cured Shigella mutant) were all still capable of inducing cell death when co-infected with Listeria (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, an E. coli strain, DH5α, also induced cell death when co-infected with Listeria (Fig. 3C). Intriguingly, no LDH release was observed when Gram-positive bacteria, such as B. subtilis or S. aureus, were co-infected with Listeria, strongly suggesting that bacterial component(s) common to Gram-negative bacteria have potent activity to induce necrotic cell death. To further characterize the cell death induced by the Gram-negative bacteria internalize"

 Elion and colleagues, is that activation of one of the proteins in the mating pathway leads to degradation of a key transcription factor that lies at the end of the filamentous growth pathway. Thus, even though some signal does leak from one pathway to another, the insulation is sufficient to prevent interference between two very different cellular programs."

Malaria alone accounts for up to 500 million new cases of disease each year and for 2 to 3 million deaths, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. To combat such extensive and devastating diseases, researchers need to conduct medical trials involving the diverse populations and communities that are affected. Doing that ethically and responsibly, explains malaria researcher Ogobara Doumbo of the University of Bamako in Mali, requires that investigators develop an understanding of the social and cultural subtleties that govern how different groups around the world make decisions about participating in research.

MAPKs are activated through a module consisting of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MKK), and a MKK kinase (MAP3K). Because of its unique position in the MAPK module, a MAP3K is crucial in relaying the upstream receptor-mediated signals through the MAPK cascades to induce physiological responses. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanism of MAP3K regulation and activation remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that MAP3K MEKK2 activation requires dimerization. We mapped the MEKK2 dimerization motif in its catalytic domain and showed that the NH2-terminal region is not required for MEKK2 dimer formation. We also found that the inactive, non-phosphorylated MEKK2 formed significantly more dimers than the phosphorylated and, hence, active MEKK2. Moreover, prevention of MEKK2 dimer formation inhibited MEKK2-mediated JNK activation. Using a chemical-induced dimerization system, we further demonstrated that MEKK2 dimer formation in vivo augmented MEKK2-dependent JNK activation and JNK/AP-1 reporter gene transcription. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism underlying MEKK2 regulation and activation.

Activation of a MAPK requires a MAPK kinase, which, in turn, is activated by a MAP3K. Whereas much has been learned about how a MAPK or a MAPK kinase is activated, the molecular mechanisms of MAP3K activation remain largely unknown in the mammalian system. A growing number of MAP3Ks have been identified that are capable of activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs, including MEKK1, MEKK3, MEKK4, MEKK5, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1, mixed lineage kinases, dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase, and Tpl2 (1.Lange-Carter C.A.

These MAP3Ks have in common a conserved catalytic domain with substantial homology to that of the yeast MAP3K STE11 (9.Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence from biochemical and genetic studies showing that the MAP3Ks are responsible for sorting distinct cell surface signals through various downstream MAPK pathways to the cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors. Genetic studies using gene-targeting mice revealed that members of the MAP3K family have both overlapping and distinct functions. For example, MEKK2 is involved in T-cell and mast cell function but not required for embryonic development (10.Guo Z. Clydesdale G. Cheng J. Kim K. Gan L. McConkey D.J. Ullrich S.E. Zhuang Y. Su B.

In contrast, MEKK3 is essential for early embryonic cardiovascular and neuronal development (12.Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat.

Despite extensive efforts in the past, it is still largely unknown how MEKK2, as well as other MAP3Ks, is activated. One major hurdle preventing us from understanding this process is that overexpression, common to transient transfections, constitutively activates most MAP3Ks in the absence of any agonist stimuli, leading toward the activation of downstream MAPKs such as the JNKs, ERKs, and p38. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms of MEKK2 activation. We found that MEKK2 forms dimers through its catalytic domain. The dimerization is essential for MEKK2 phosphorylation and activation. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid DNA was transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen).

For the GST pull-down assay, COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-, FLAG-, or GST-tagged expression vectors and lysed 40 h after transfection using a low salt lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Nuclear and cellular debris were removed from the lysates by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. GST-fusion proteins were precipitated from the clarified lysates with GSH-Sepharose at 4 °C for a 4-h incubation in a rotator. The beads were washed four times with a low salt lysis buffer, and the precipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Luciferase Reporter Assay—For the Gal4-luciferase reporter gene assay, the reporter plasmid Gal4-Luc was co-transfected with empty vector or Gal4-cJun-(1–223) alone or with FvMEKKCT or FvMEKK3CT constructs. A β-actin-Renilla luciferase reporter vector was included in every experiment for transfection efficiency control. Relative luciferase activity was determined and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Chemically Induced Dimerization—Synthetic dimerizer AP20187-mediated MEKK2 and MEKK3 dimer formation was carried out as described previously (26.Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). MEKK2 Activation Requires Self-phosphorylation—Previously, we and others found that the transient expression of MEKK2 in various cell lines led to a strong activation of its downstream targets, including the JNK and p38 MAPKs (3.Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15.Su B. Cheng J. Yang J. Guo Z. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MEKK2 may be capable of self-activation without the need for any upstream agonist stimulation. When transiently expressed, the full-length MEKK2 and its COOH-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 342–619) (an active form of MEKK2) displayed multiple protein bands on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, A and B). When treated with a protein phosphatase, the bands showing a slower mobility were significantly reduced, suggesting that MEKK2 is a phosphoprotein. In addition, when kinase-inactive forms of MEKK2, MEKK2(KM) (Fig. 2A) or MEKK2-(342–619)(KM) (Fig. 2B), were expressed, only the faster migrating bands were observed, suggesting that they were non-phosphorylated or hypo-phosphorylated species. These results also indicate that MEKK2 phosphorylation may be dependent on its catalytic activity. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we further demonstrated that MEKK2-(342–619) was able to phosphorylate itself and also phosphorylate JNKK2, one of its major substrates (18.Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, neither MEKK2-(342–619)(KM) nor the protein phosphatase-treated MEKK2-(342–619) was able to phosphorylate JNKK2. Thus, these results strongly suggest that MEKK2 phosphorylation is required for its activation. MEKK2 Forms Dimers through Its Catalytic Domain—Transient expression of the JNK1/2 or ERK1/2 MAPKs usually does not lead to their activation in contrast to MEKK2 expression. This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of MAPK activation may be fundamentally different from that of a MAP3K. Because one of the consequences of transient expression of MEKK2 is elevated intracellular MEKK2 concentration, it is possible that this increased MEKK2 concentration may activate itself through spontaneous dimerization. Dimer formation mediated by ligands or adaptor molecules has been shown to activate many receptor tyrosine kinases (27.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and Ser/Thr kinases, such as members of the transforming growth factor-β receptor family (30.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar) and c-Raf-1 (29.Farrar M.A. Alberol I. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine whether MEKK2 forms dimers, we co-expressed GST-fused MEKK2 (GST-MEKK2) with HA-tagged NH2-terminal (amino acids 1–342) or COOH-terminal (amino acids 342–619) regions of MEKK2 for a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the COOH-terminal catalytic domain, but not with the NH2-terminal region of MEKK2, was co-precipitated by the full-length MEKK2. This finding suggests that MEKK2 forms dimers through its catalytic domain. To confirm this hypothesis, we co-expressed a GST-fused catalytic domain of MEKK2, GST-MEKK2-(342–619), with the full-length MEKK2 and the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions of MEKK2 or a truncated catalytic domain of MEKK2:MEKK2-(342–424). As expected, we found that the GST-MEKK2 (342–619) co-precipitated with the full-length and the COOH-terminal but not the NH2-terminal regions of MEKK2 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we found that the truncated catalytic domain MEKK2-(342–424) was also co-precipitated with GST-MEKK2-(342–619), indicating that this region, which includes most of the kinase subdomains I–III of MEKK2, includes the dimerization domain for MEKK2. If this assumption is correct, we would expect overexpression of this motif to disrupt MEKK2 dimer formation. Indeed, we found that expression of this motif led to a significant decrease in MEKK2 dimer formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Concomitantly, the interaction between the MEKK2 catalytic domain and this dimerization motif was increased. Dimerization Leads to MEKK2 Activation through Transphosphorylation—Interestingly, although there are both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MEKK2 species in the cell lysates, we found that the non-phosphorylated MEKK2 (faster migrating band) was preferentially co-precipitated in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3A). This suggested that the non-phosphorylated MEKK2 may form more stable dimers than the phosphorylated and, hence, activated MEKK2. To confirm this possibility, we used the same GST pull-down assay to assess the co-precipitation of untreated or protein phosphatase-treated MEKK2 or MEKK2-(342–619)(KM). As shown in Fig. 4A, only the non-phosphorylated species of MEKK2 was co-precipitated, suggesting that the non-phosphorylated and inactive MEKK2 formed more stable dimers. This result also indicates that MEKK2 dimerization might occur prior to its phosphorylation and thus is required for activation. To understand how MEKK2 dimerization leads to MEKK2 activation, we co-expressed a GST-MEKK2 fusion protein with either HA-MEKK2-(342–619) or HA-MEKK2-(342–619)(KM) proteins. The MEKK2 dimers were precipitated with an anti-HA antibody. After thorough washing, the immunocomplex was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay to determine the level of GST-MEKK2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-MEKK2 precipitated by HA-MEKK2-(342–619) was phosphorylated. Consistently, HA-MEKK2 (342–619) was also phosphorylated in this complex. However, although a similar amount of full-length GST-MEKK2 was pulled down by HA-MEKK2-(342–619)(KM), neither GST-MEKK2 nor HA-MEKK2-(342–619)(KM) was phosphorylated in the same assay. This finding suggests that MEKK2 activation is mediated through transphosphorylation by two dimerized wild type catalytic domains. Chemical-induced Dimerization in Vivo Activates the MEKK2-dependent MAPK Pathway—To test the dimerization dependence of MEKK2 activation in a more physiological setting, we utilized a well characterized chemically induced dimerization system to induce MEKK2 dimers in intact cells and determine whether this would activate MEKK2 and the MEKK2-dependent JNK-AP-1 pathway. FKBP12 binds to the naturally occurring product FK506 and can be homodimerized with FK1012, which consists of two linked molecules of FK506 (31.Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). A synthetic, cell-permeable homodimerizing reagent, AP20187, which has a greatly reduced affinity for endogenous FKBP12 (∼250 nm), binds with high affinity (∼0.1 nm) to a F36V mutant (Fv) form of FKBP12 (32.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli Jr., F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It was shown that the addition of low AP20187 concentrations to cells activated various proteins fused with the Fv domain with no adverse effect on the cells (26.Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To adapt MEKK2 to chemical-induced dimerization control, we constructed expressing vector FvMEKK2CT by fusing the catalytic domain of MEKK2 with the Fv domain so that the fusion protein could be induced to form dimers in the presence of AP20187 as shown in Fig. 5A. We co-transfected the JNK expression vector with FvMEKK2CT and determined JNK activation in the absence or presence of AP20187. As shown in Fig. 5B, without cotransfection of FvMEKK2CT there was no JNK activation either in the absence or presence of AP20187, suggesting that AP20187 has no effect on the basal activity of JNK. In contrast, co-transfection of FvMEKK2CT increased JNK activation in the absence of AP20187 as measured by its phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun. However, this low level JNK activation was greatly augmented by the addition of AP20187 (Fig. 5B). Consistently, we observed a similar increase of the JNK/AP-1-dependent Gal4-c-Jun reporter gene expression by the addition of AP20187 (Fig. 5C). Because of the high homology between the MEKK2 and MEKK3 catalytic domains, we expected that MEKK3 activation might also involve dimerization of its catalytic domain. To test this idea, we constructed an analogous FvMEKK3CT construct. Using the same assay, we demonstrated that dimerization of MEKK3 through its catalytic domain activated MEKK3 similarly to what we found with MEKK2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, these results provide in vivo evidence that MEKK2 dimerization leads to its activation. If MEKK2 dimer formation is required for MEKK2 activation, we would expect that disrupting or blocking MEKK2 dimer formation should inhibit its activation of JNK. To test this notion, we expressed the MEKK2 dimerization motif MEKK2-(342–424) to disrupt MEKK2 dimers as shown in Fig. 3C and determined its effect on MEKK2-mediated JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 5D, we found that JNK activation by MEKK2 was significantly inhibited by the expression of the dimerization motif in a dose-dependent manner, further demonstrating that MEKK2 dimer formation is critical for MEKK2 signaling. A key question regarding the specific activation of individual MAPK modules is how a MAP3K within a given MAPK module is first activated. Although there is ample evidence suggesting that MAP3Ks respond to numerous upstream stimuli, precisely how they are activated at the molecular level remains largely speculative. One of the major hurdles in studying MAP3Ks in mammalian systems is that, unlike MAP2Ks or MAPKs, once they are overexpressed most MAP3Ks become active, thus preventing further analysis of the mechanism of activation. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern the activation of MEKK2, a member of the MEKK/STE11 subgroup of MAP3K. The expression of MEKK2 by transient transfection revealed a phosphoprotein with a strong capacity for JNK activation. Removal of the phosphate by protein phosphatase treatment resulted in the loss of MEKK2 activity. We are in the process of identifying the active phosphorylation sites that are likely located within the activation loop of MEKK2 between the sub-kinase domains VII and VIII. Although it remains to be shown whether another kinase (MAP4K) is needed to phosphorylate the active sites in MEKK2, our current study suggests that MEKK2 is capable of self-phosphorylation and activation. In this study, we found that MEKK2 is capable of forming dimers that lead to its self-phosphorylation and activation. We mapped the MEKK2 dimerization motif that is located within its catalytic domain and not in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain. Interestingly, activation of another MAP3K family member, Raf, also requires dimer formation (29.Farrar M.A. Alberol I. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 33.Goetz C.A. O'Neil J.J. Farrar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51184-51189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was reported that the MAPK/RK2 also forms dimers through the catalytic domain (27.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that dimerization may be an important regulatory mechanism for activation of certain Ser/Thr protein kinases. If our results are correct, we would expect that MEKK3 activation also involves dimer formation through its catalytic domain because there is high homology between MEKK2 and MEKK3 catalytic domains. Indeed, we found that MEKK3 also forms dimers through its catalytic domain and that induction of MEKK3 dimer formation in cells results in MEKK3-dependent JNK MAPK activation (Fig. 5, B and C, and data not shown). It was recently reported that a putative protein-protein interaction motif called the PB-1 domain, located at the NH2-terminal region of MEKK2 and its homolog MEKK3, was involved in transducing activation signals to downstream MAPK modules (34.Lamark T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the PB-1 domain has the potential to form dimers, our study suggests that MEKK2 dimer formation does not depend on this domain. It is still possible that the PB-1 domain is involved only in the tethering of other regulatory proteins or MEKK2 substrates such as MEK5 (35.Nakamura K. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36989-36992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We used an induced dimerization system to show clearly that dimerization of MEKK2 could increase MEKK2 activity. However, it is unclear whether different MEKK2 stimuli all activate MEKK2 through this mechanism. If MEKK2 is capable of self-activation through dimer formation, how do cells prevent unwanted MEKK2 activation in the absence of stimulation when all of the cells seem to express endogenous MEKK2? One likely possibility is that there are putative proteins or factors in the cells to prevent the dimerization of MEKK2/3. An alternative mechanism is that MEKK2 or MEKK3 do not have a high affinity for each other unless they are modified (for instance by phosphorylation or ubiquitination) or tethered together by scaffold proteins following cell stimulation. Searching for proteins that are potential regulators of the MEKK2 signaling will provide further insight into the complex regulation of the MEKK2-dependent MAPK signal pathway.

The meprin B isoform exists primarily as a cell-surface homooligomer composed of disulfide-linked, multidomain β-subunits. To gain insight into how the tertiary and quaternary structure of meprin B affects function, the disulfide-bonding pattern and sites of domain-domain interactions were investigated using sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, cross-linking, and mass spectrometry techniques. Three symmetrical intersubunit disulfide bonds were identified in the noncatalytic interaction domains; two in the MAM (meprin, A-5 protein, protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ) domain and one in the TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) domain. These disulfide bridges are unique for the known homophilic interactions of these domains. Mutation of any of the intersubunit cysteine residues resulted in the inability of meprin B to form disulfide-linked dimers. The four cysteines of the protease domain formed intradomain disulfide bonds. The MAM domain also had one intradomain disulfide bond and one free cysteine. Cross-linking studies of the meprin B dimer with the amine-reactive cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate revealed inter- and intradomain contacts within the protein, including prosequence-prosequence, protease-TRAF, protease-epidermal growth factor, and TRAF-TRAF interactions.

Meprins are unique among mammalian metalloproteinases in that they are composed of multidomain, evolutionarily related α and β subunits that form disulfide-linked homo- or heterooligomeric dimers (6.Ishmael F.T.

The heterodimers tend to form tetramers (α2,β2; α3,β1), whereas the meprin α homodimers form decameric 900-kDa complexes to very higher molecular mass multimers of up to 6 MDa, among the largest extracellular proteolytic complexes known. Only dimers of homooligomeric meprin β have been observed thus far. However, the local concentrations of meprin B in kidney brush border membranes have been estimated to be in the high micromolar range, higher than conditions used for in vitro experiments (7.Bertenshaw G.P.

Although the meprin α and β subunits are 42% identical at the amino acid level, they differ markedly in their ability to self-associate, in proteolytic processing during biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, and in substrate specificity (1.Bond J.S.

For example, meprin β has a preference for acidic residues in the P1 and P1′ sites of the substrate, whereas meprin α selects for small or hydrophobic residues at these sites (10.Bertenshaw G.P.

Multimers containing the α subunit (homooligomers or heterooligomers) are designated meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18), whereas homooligomers of the β subunit are designated meprin B (EC 3.4.24.63). The cDNA-deduced primary sequences of both subunits predict a similar arrangement of functional domains beginning with an NH2-terminal signal sequence, a prosequence followed by a protease domain containing the active site, a meprin, A-5 protein, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ domain (MAM), 1The abbreviations used are: MAM, meprin, A-5 protein, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; OCK+, 2-aminobenzoic acid-MGWM-DEID-2,4-dinitrophenyl-SG-OH; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domain (see Fig. 1). The MAM domain is present in many cell surface proteins and is thought to be involved in cell-cell adhesion, protein-protein interactions, and signal transduction (12.Cismasiu V.B. Denes S.A.

The TRAF domain is found in a diverse population of intracellular proteins and is also involved in protein associations and signal transduction; meprins are the only plasma membrane and extracellular proteins known to contain TRAF domains (13.Zapata J.M.

Distal to the TRAF domain is an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a putative COOH-terminal transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. Meprin β retains the EGF, transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic tail during biosynthesis and moves to the cell surface as a type I membrane-bound protein. The meprin β subunit is primarily found at the plasma membrane; however, it can be shed into the extracellular milieu (14.Eldering J.A. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur.

The α subunit contains a 56-amino acid inserted (I) domain between the TRAF- and EGF-like domains, not present in the β subunit, that directs COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of this subunit during biosynthesis, resulting in removal of the region proximal to the TRAF domain (16.Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consequently, homooligomers of α are secreted, and meprin α is only found membrane-bound via interactions with the meprin β subunit. No crystal structures of meprins are available yet, perhaps due to the fact that these multidomain, multimeric complexes are highly glycosylated and heterogeneous. The x-ray crystal structure of the 20-kDa crayfish astacin, the prototype of the astacin metalloproteinase family, has been solved (17.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling studies of the mouse and rat meprin α and β protease domains indicate that the residues essential for zinc coordination and peptide bond hydrolysis in astacin are conserved in the meprin protease domain (10.Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deletion and truncation studies with the meprin A homooligomer demonstrated that there is an important interdependence of the meprin domains for correct folding of an activable, stable, mature enzyme. For example, deletion of the MAM domain or truncation of the meprin α protein after the protease domain results in rapid degradation of the protein by the proteasome, indicating that the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum recognizes the pro-protease as an incorrectly folded protein (19.Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20.Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Truncation of the protein after the MAM domain leads to a secreted protein that cannot be activated by limited proteolysis, again indicating the protein is not properly folded. Thus, studies of the meprin α protein indicate that the noncatalytic MAM and TRAF domains are critical for an enzymatically active protease; however, little is known about how the domains of either subunit interact. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of one cysteine residue in each of the MAM domains for intersubunit disulfide bridging of the subunits (21.Chevallier S. Ahn J. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22.Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chevallier et al. (21.Chevallier S. Ahn J. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutation of rat αCys-309 in the MAM domain resulted in the expression of a monomeric enzyme and that mutations of rat αCys-560 and αCys-562 in the TRAF domain do not affect dimerization. In addition, mutation of the equivalent residue in the MAM domain of rat meprin β, Cys-306, resulted in no β dimers or αβ heterodimers. On the basis of these studies it was concluded that there was a unique Cys residue in the MAM domain of each meprin subunit that formed a single intersubunit disulfide link. However, no systematic study has been performed on the disulfide bonding pattern of either subunit. For the studies herein a number of techniques were used to define the oligomeric structure of meprin B and the effect that it may have on function. Self-association properties and the molecular mass of rat meprin B were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation using sedimentation equilibrium studies in which protein concentrations in the micromolar range are achieved. The intra- and intersubunit disulfide bonding pattern was elucidated using mass spectroscopy analyses to gain insight into the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein. Point mutations of selected cysteine residues were created at positions based on the disulfide mapping experiments to define the role of intersubunit disulfide bond formation on oligomerization of the protein. In addition, cross-linking experiments were conducted to reveal additional points of inter- and intrasubunit contact between and within domains. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Recombinant rat meprin B was purified as described previously and dialyzed into ultracentrifugation buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium chloride (7.Bertenshaw G.P. Norcum M.T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2522-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements of meprin B were conducted using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in absorbance mode. The supplied XL-I acquisition software was used to acquire data. Simultaneous acquisition at a range of protein concentrations (500 nm to 5.5 μm) was accomplished using a six-channel center-piece while monitoring at wavelengths appropriate for the protein concentration (220–300 nm). Data were acquired at rotor speeds of 6,000, 9,000, and 12,000 rpm. Equilibrium was achieved when 2 consecutive sets of data taken 2 h apart were completely superimposable. After collection of these data, the rotor speed was increased to 36,000 rpm to deplete the meniscus, allowing determination of base-line absorbance. The partial specific volume of meprin B was determined to be 0.72 by performing parallel sedimentation equilibrium experiments in solutions of H2O and D2O as described elsewhere (23.Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24.Edelstein S.J. Schachman H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data were edited using the Microcal Origin software package (Version 3.78, Microcal Software). Local and global nonlinear least squares analyses were employed using the program WinNonlinLR (version 1.05) to extract solution molecular masses. Mapping of Disulfide Bonds—A dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid assay was performed to determine the number of free thiols in meprin as described previously (25.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21467) Google Scholar). Meprin (1 ml of an 8 μm solution, in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) was then denatured by the addition of 480 mg of urea (Sigma). A 100 mm solution of N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) was prepared using dimethylformamide (Fisher) and was immediately added to the above solution (10 mm final concentration) to alkylate any free thiols. The mixture was allowed to sit at 25 °C for 1 h before dialyzing into 100 mm NH4HCO3 (Sigma), pH 8.5. Endoproteinase Glu-C was prepared (Sigma, 1 mg/ml in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5), added to the meprin solution at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The resulting peptide mixture was passed through a 10-kDa cutoff concentrator (Amicon) to remove the endoproteinase Glu-C. One-half of this sample was analyzed without further digestion, whereas chymotrypsin (Sigma, 1 mg/ml in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5) was then added to the other half of the mixture at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The digested mixtures were then separated by HPLC using a peptide separation program described previously (26.Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Samples were directly analyzed by a Mariner electrospray time of flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) as they eluted from the column. In addition, the proteins were alkylated then digested with endoproteinase Glu-C alone or in combination with chymotrypsin as described above. The samples were subjected to HPLC, and one-ml fractions were collected. These fractions were dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 5 μl of a solution containing 5 mg/ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) dissolved in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 0.5 microliter of each fraction was spotted on a target plate and analyzed with a Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) as described previously (6.Ishmael F.T.

MALDI data were analyzed using the Automated Spectrum Assignment Program website (roswell.ca.sandia.gov/~mmyoung/index.html). Cross-linking of Meprin B and Mapping the Points of Contact— Meprin B (0.5 ml of an 8 μm solution in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) was mixed with 50 μl of a 4 mm solution of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce) dissolved in dimethylformamide (Fisher). Crosslinking was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 25 °C and quenched with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (final concentration). The protein solution was then dialyzed into 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and digested with endoproteinase Glu-C as described above. The protease was then removed, and trypsin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, separated by HPLC, and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry as described above. The peak list from each fraction was exported to the Automated Spectrum Assignment Program website, and the software was configured to search for potential cross-links between lysine residues and/or the amino terminus of meprin (28.Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Parameters for detection included an error of no more than 100 parts per million and an allowance of one missed cleavage site for endoproteinase Glu-C and two missed cleavage sites for trypsin. Only peptides with unique masses were considered. Generation of Cysteine Mutants—Single cysteine mutations were created using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutation of meprin βCys-492 to an alanine was accomplished using the primers 5′-TCAATTACAGTGGCCGGCTCCTTGGCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGCTGCCAAGGAGCCGGCCACTGTAATTGA-3′. Polymerase chain reaction established the mutation in the rat meprin β cDNA, and transformation of the construct was conducted as previously described (7.Bertenshaw G.P. Norcum M.T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2522-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29.Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This DNA was then stably transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (30.Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25577-25584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The meprin βC274A mutation was generated as described above using the primers 5′-TTTTGAGCTGGAGAATATCGCTGGCATGATCCAAAGTTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGAACTTTGGATCATGCCAGCGATATTCTCCAGCTCAAAA-3′. Activity and Stability Assays—Activity of wild-type and mutant meprin B against the fluorogenic peptide substrate 2-aminobenzoic acid-MGWM-DEID-2,4-dinitrophenyl-SG-OH (OCK+) and the protein substrate azocasein were performed as previously described (10.Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29.Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tryptic stability experiments were carried out by incubating activated wild-type or mutant meprin B (each at a concentration of 33 ng/μl) with 0, 12.5, 25, 40, or 80 ng/μl trypsin (final concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was added at 2-fold excess over trypsin to stop the reaction. These samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot to determine the extent of meprin degradation by trypsin. Susceptibility to heat inactivation was assessed by incubation of activated wild-type meprin β protein, βC274A, and βC492A mutants at 45 °C for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 min. The samples were allowed to cool to 25 °C, and then activity was measured against OCK+. Oligomeric State of Meprin B—To determine whether meprin B forms higher order oligomers at high protein concentrations, the enzyme was subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation using sedimentation equilibrium. A representative plot of an equilibrium experiment is shown in Fig. 2. A global fit of the data using the program WinNonlin yielded a molecular mass of 177 kDa. The monomeric molecular mass of meprin was previously determined to be 85 kDa by electrophoretic and mass spectrometry techniques. Thus, the obtained molecular mass of 177 kDa is consistent with dimer formation and previous experimental determinations of the meprin B molecular mass using light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy (7.Bertenshaw G.P. Norcum M.T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2522-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The data fit best to a single ideal species, indicating that no oligomers higher than dimer formed even at the millimolar concentrations achieved during centrifugation. Disulfide Bonding Pattern of Meprin B—Rat meprin B contains 16 cysteine residues (Fig. 1). A dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid assay of meprin B under denaturing conditions detected 0.9 free thiols per subunit, indicating that there is one free cysteine residue. Because the remaining 15 cysteines must be involved in disulfide bridges, an odd number of intersubunit disulfide bonds is required to fulfill oxidation of all cysteine residues. Disulfide mapping experiments were conducted using proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry to determine inter- and intrasubunit disulfide bonds. Because meprin B is a homooligomer, intersubunit disulfide bonds can only be identified if the site is symmetric (i.e. Cys-306 to Cys-306). Asymmetric disulfide bonds as detected by mass spectrometry could be either intra- or intersubunit. Meprin B was exposed to NEM under denaturing conditions to alkylate free thiols, digested with endoproteinase Glu-C alone or with chymotrypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A mass was identified as Cys-341 modified with NEM, indicating that this residue is the free cysteine (Table I). Masses were identified corresponding to disulfide bond formation between Cys-104 and Cys-256, Cys-274 and Cys-274, and Cys-306 and Cys-306.Table IDisulfide mapping of rat meprin B using electrospray mass spectrometry Meprin B was denatured, mixed with NEM to alkylate free thiols, and digested with endoproteinase Glu-C alone or in combination with chymotrypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The column labeled “Fragment” lists peptides containing a cysteine residue disulfide linked to another peptide with a cysteine residue or a peptide modified by NEM.

The Automated Spectrum Assignment Program software was used to search the peak list obtained from MALDI mass spectrometry of each fraction for potential disulfide bonds (28.Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This software searches for all possible combinations of Cys-Cys pairs and allows restrictions to be set based on accuracy (an error of less than 100 parts per million), missed cleavages (one allowable missed cleavage per peptide), and potential modifications (i.e. oxidation of methionine residues). Using these parameters, masses corresponding to all of the above mentioned disulfide bonds were identified (Table II). In addition, masses corresponding to linkage of Cys-125 to Cys-145, Cys-266 to Cys-428, and Cys-492 to Cys-492 were also found.Table IIDisulfide mapping of rat meprin B using MALDI mass spectrometry Meprin B was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C alone or in combination with chymotrypsin, and peptides were separated by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each fraction was analyzed by MALDI, and peptides containing disulfide linkages are shown.

Within the protease domain there are two disulfide bonds (Cys-104 to Cys-256, Cys-125 to Cys-145), whereas in the MAM domain there is one intradomain disulfide bond (Cys-266 to Cys-428). These mapping experiments could not elucidate the disulfide-bonding pattern in the EGF-like domain. There was a lack of cleavage sites between multiple cysteine residues, preventing the generation of single disulfide-linked fragments. However, based on comparison to structures of other EGF-like domains, the six cysteines that lie in the EGF-like domain are well conserved and form intradomain disulfides based on available crystal and NMR structures (31.Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys Residues Involved in Disulfide Bond Formation— Previous experiments by Chevallier et al. (21.Chevallier S. Ahn J. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that rat meprin B was secreted as a monomer when Cys-306 was mutated to a serine residue (21.Chevallier S. Ahn J. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because the results of the disulfide mapping experiment above showed that there were at least three intersubunit disulfide bonds, the question arose as to why this single mutation resulted in failure to form any disulfide linkages. Therefore, Cys-492 and Cys-274 were mutated to alanine residues in separate experiments to assess whether loss of these intersubunit disulfide bonds would also result in the inability to form the c"
https://openalex.org/W2039156965,"A dynamic equilibrium between multiple sorting pathways maintains polarized distribution of plasma membrane proteins in epithelia. To identify sorting pathways for plasma membrane delivery of the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit in polarized cells, the protein was expressed as a yellow fluorescent protein N-terminal construct in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and LLC-PK1 cells. Confocal microscopy and surface-selective biotinylation showed that 80% of the surface amount of the β subunit was present on the apical membrane in LLC-PK1 cells, but only 40% was present in MDCK cells. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the isolated membranes showed that a significant fraction of the H,K-ATPase β subunits associate with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase α1 subunits in MDCK but not in LLC-PK cells. Hence, co-sorting of the H,K-ATPase β subunit with the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells may determine the differential distribution of the β subunit in these two cell types. The major fraction of unassociated monomeric H,K-ATPase β subunits is detected in the apical membrane. Quantitative analysis showed that half of the apical pool of the β subunit originates directly from the trans-Golgi network and the other half from transcytosis via the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells. A minor fraction of monomeric β subunits detected in the basolateral membrane represents a transient pool of the protein that undergoes transcytosis to the apical membrane. Hence, the steady state distribution of the H,K-ATPase β subunit in polarized cells depends on the balance between (a) direct sorting from the trans-Golgi network, (b) secondary associative sorting with a partner protein, and (c) transcytosis.

Alternatively, they are initially delivered first to one membrane (e.g. the basolateral membrane) but then retrieved from that membrane by the process of endocytosis and then delivered to the opposite membrane (i.e. the apical membrane).

Specific machinery essential for the sorting process is present within the cell and recognizes sorting signals such as minimal amino acid motifs, carbohydrate or lipid moieties, embedded within individual proteins (1Ikonen E.

Several different sorting signals can be present in a protein, but they may vary in their importance in the targeting process. A particular motif might be preferentially recognized by the sorting machinery or be dominant over other signals (1Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Targeting of heterodimeric proteins may depend on signals embedded in one of the subunits, with the other subunit tagging along after synthesis of stable complexes in the ER (6Muth T.R. Gottardi C.J. Roush D.L. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C688-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The gastric H,K-ATPase and the Na,K-ATPase are two homologous transport enzymes that go through a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation coupled to ion transport, protons or hydronium in exchange for potassium (H,K-ATPase) and sodium in exchange for potassium (Na,K-ATPase). Both enzymes are heterodimers consisting of an α subunit, which contains the catalytic site, and a glycosylated β subunit, which is thought to be necessary for normal maturation and delivery of the enzyme out of the ER (7Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase α subunit was shown to form a stable complex also with the H,K-ATPase β subunit that, similar to its natural partner, enabled maturation and plasma membrane delivery of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit in various cell expression systems (8Koenderink J.B.

Commun. 1992; 182: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the similarities in structure and catalytic properties, the Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase reside in the opposite membrane domains in epithelial cells. The Na,K-ATPase is targeted to basolateral surfaces in most polarized cells (14Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1304-G1313PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the gastric H,K-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for acid secretion by the stomach, is located in tubulovesicular elements in the resting parietal cell and relocates to the secretory canalicular (apical) membrane upon stimulation of acid secretion (15Smolka A. Helander H.F. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: G589-G596PubMed Google Scholar, 16Urushidani T. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G458-G465PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the targeting information contained within each subunit has been deduced from studies of MDCK and LLC-PKI cells in which both subunits are coexpressed or the β subunit is expressed alone. Studies in which the α subunit is expressed alone cannot be done, because this subunit is degraded and fails to be delivered to the plasma membrane (7Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Coexpression studies in LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated the presence of apical sorting signals in both the α and β subunits (17Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) of the H,K-ATPase and a basolateral sorting signal in the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (6Muth T.R. Gottardi C.J. Roush D.L. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C688-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sorting signals in both Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase catalytic subunits were shown to reside in their N-terminal halves (6Muth T.R. Gottardi C.J. Roush D.L. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C688-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An apical sorting signal of the H,K-ATPase β subunit was demonstrated to be encoded in its N-glycosylation sites (18Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39026-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the H,K-ATPase β subunit is expressed alone, it can be distributed to either the apical or the basolateral membrane, depending on the cell type examined. It is distributed to the apical membrane in LLC-PK1 cells and mostly to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells (19Roush D.L. Gottardi C.J. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results indicate the β subunit may contain both apical and basolateral sorting signals.Therefore, the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit has several properties that make it an excellent model to use in studies of the sorting pathways involved in distribution of membrane proteins and the factors modulating the sorting process. It can be expressed alone or in association with its natural partner or other subunits in cultured cells, it has embedded in it both apical and basolateral sorting signals, and it is delivered predominantly to the apical or basolateral membranes in different polarized cell systems.In the present studies, the H,K-ATPase β subunit was expressed as a YFP N-terminal fusion protein in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. Using confocal microscopy, surface-selective biotinylation, and biotin cleavage, we were able to assess the steady state distribution of the protein, determine its fate after it was inserted into either membrane domain, and measure accumulation of the newly delivered protein in the apical membrane. The results indicate the presence of both direct and indirect routes for apical delivery of the protein. By selectively inhibiting a direct or indirect apical pathway, we were able to evaluate the relative quantity of the β subunit, which was directly delivered from the TGN to the apical membrane compared with that which arrived there by transcytosis from the basolateral membrane. Using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, we determined whether association of the expressed protein with the endogenous partner affects its sorting and final distribution. We found that promiscuous association with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit in MDCK but not LLC-PK1 cells is probably responsible for differential distribution of the H,K-ATPase β subunit in the two cell types.The results of these studies indicate that membrane proteins containing both apical and basolateral sorting signals, such as the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit, which are resident in the apical membrane, can arrive there by both direct delivery from the TGN and transcytosis via the basolateral membrane. Moreover, association with another subunit, if this has a dominant sorting signal, can cause it to be delivered to a membrane different than in its native state. Furthermore, these data emphasize that sorting is a complex process involving an interaction between sorting machinery unique to specific cells, signals embedded in proteins, and, in the case of heterodimeric proteins, the relative dominance of the sorting information in the particular subunit.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of cDNAs Encoding YFP-β Fusion Proteins and Mutants Lacking Glycosylation Sites—pcDNA3(+)β (20Lambrecht N. Munson K. Vagin O. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4041-4048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used as a source for cDNA encoding the rabbit H,K-ATPase β-subunit (21Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Sachs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6767-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number M35544). The cDNA encoding the β-subunit was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pEYFP-C1 (BD Bioscience Clontech) using BglII and BamHI restriction sites to form pEYFP-β that encodes YFP-β, a fusion protein of YFP linked to the amino terminus of the H,K-ATPase β-subunit. Mutants were generated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using pEYFP-β as a template.Stable Transfection—In order to obtain cell lines stably expressing wild type YFP-β or mutant YFP-β fusion proteins, LLC-PK1 cells were grown on 10-cm plates until 20% confluent and transfected with wild type or mutant pEYFP-β using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Stable cell lines were selected by adding, 24 h after transfection, the eukaryotic selection marker G-418 at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. This concentration of G-418 was maintained until single colonies appeared. 15–20 colonies were isolated, expanded, and grown in the presence of 0.25 mg of G-418/ml of medium in a 24-well plate. Two clones with the highest expression of YFP-β were selected and expanded for further studies.The cell lines expressing YFP-β were subjected to a second transfection with pcDNA3.1 (zeo+)α encoding the rabbit H,K-ATPase α subunit (GenBank™ accession number X64694). By addition of the second selection marker zeocin at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in addition to maintenance of a concentration of G-418 of 0.25 mg/ml, 15–20 cell lines expressing both α- and β-subunits were selected. Two clones with the best ratio of expressed H,K-ATPase to total protein were expanded for biotinylation experiments. The maintenance concentration for zeocin was 0.1 mg/ml.Confocal Microscopy Identification of Site of Expression of YFP-β— Cells stably expressing wild type or mutant YFP-β were grown for at least 5 days after becoming confluent on glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.). Confocal microscopic images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope using LSM 510 software, version 3.2.Estimation of Surface YFP-β Content by Surface-specific Biotinylation—LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant YFP-β were maintained for at least 5 days after becoming confluent in Corning Costar brand polyester transwell inserts (Corning Glass) in 6-well plates. Biotinylation of the apical or basolateral membrane proteins was performed by previously described procedures (22Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kroepfl J.F. Gardinier M.V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) that was added from either the apical or basolateral side. After quenching the biotinylation reaction, cells were washed and then lysed, and membranes were solubilized by incubation with 200 μl of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 1% Triton X-100 and 4 mm EGTA. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). Samples containing 20 μl of supernatant mixed with 15 μl of SDS-containing sample buffer were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine the total YFP-β content in the supernatant. To isolate biotinylated proteins, the rest of each supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in a total volume of 800 μl of the lysing buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. The bead-adherent complexes were washed three times on the beads, and then proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8) for 5 min at 80 °C, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blot using 2B6 monoclonal antibody against the H,K-ATPase β subunit (MBL, Inc.) or the monoclonal antibody against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (Novus Biologicals), the monoclonal antibody against the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or the monoclonal antibody against the H,K-ATPase subunit (monoclonal antibody 12.18; a generous gift from Dr. A. Smolka) as a primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) as the secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using Kodak 1D 3.6 software.In all experiments, the specific basolateral location of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit was considered as a control for intact tight junctions, and the absence of high mannose type YFP-β in biotinylated samples was used as an indication of plasma membrane integrity during biotinylation. The presence of biotinylated high mannose type YFP-β protein would show that the biotinylation reagent had access to the intracellular pool of high mannose type YFP-β because of plasma membrane leak to the reagent during the experiment (18Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39026-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Endocytosis and Recycling Assay by Surface-selective Biotinylation and Surface-selective Biotin Cleavage—Polarized cells stably expressing wild type YFP-β were biotinylated from either apical or basolateral side as described above with different incubation times. Cells were then incubated at 18 °C to impede further apical membrane delivery of intracellular protein for 20, 60, or 120 min. After this low temperature incubation, apical biotin was stripped off (Fig. 4A) by incubating with 50 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 100 mm NaCl with 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 8.4, twice for 20 min. This procedure selected for internalized biotinylated protein. After cell lysis, the previously internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted from streptavidinagarose beads, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blot analysis as described above. In the negative control, biotin was stripped off immediately after biotinylation. To determine the total biotinylated YFP-β, in the positive control, cells were lysed immediately after biotinylation. To account for any instability of biotinylated protein, in a separate experiment, cells were incubated at 18 °C for 120 min and then lysed.To measure recycling, cells were incubated at 18 °C for 120 min, and the surface biotin was removed as above. Then these cells that now only contained internalized YFP-β were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 4A) to estimate delivery of this fraction to the plasma membrane. After this procedure, in the control, cells were lysed immediately, whereas in the experimental cells, surface biotin was stripped off again to account for the fraction of internalized YFP-β that was returned to the plasma membrane. After cell lysis, biotinylated proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted, and analyzed as described above.Transcytosis Assay by Surface-selective Biotinylation and Surface-selective Biotin Cleavage—A diagram of the experimental procedure to measure transcytosis from the apical to the basolateral membrane is shown in Fig. 5A. Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing the wild type YFP-β were biotinylated from either apical or basolateral side. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C in the control experiment, cells were lysed immediately. In the three separate experiments, biotin was stripped off by incubating with 50 mm reduced glutathione from the apical surface only, from the basolateral surface only, or from both the apical and basolateral surfaces before cell lysis. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated and analyzed as described above. The amount of protein that was transcytosed to the opposite membrane domain was calculated as the difference between the amount detected in the experiment where biotin was stripped off from the side of biotinylation and the amount detected in the experiment where biotin was stripped off from both sides. Transcytosis from the basolateral to the apical membrane was measured according to a similar scheme, with the only difference being that the cells were biotinylated from the basolateral surface rather than the apical surface.Fig. 5Detection of transcytosis from the apical to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells. MDCK cells expressing the wild type YFP-β were grown on transwell inserts. A, scheme showing the experimental procedure. Cells were biotinylated from the apical side. T0, total biotinylated YFP-β (positive control); N, biotin was stripped off immediately after biotinylation (negative control); T, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (control for stability of biotinylated YFP-β); in the next three inserts, after cell incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, biotin was stripped off from the apical side only (T–A), from both apical and basolateral sides (I), or from the basolateral side only (T–B). After completion of the above procedures and cell lysis, biotinylated proteins were precipitated on streptavidin-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blot. B, a representative immunoblot and quantification of the data from three independent experiments. C, calculation of the amounts of YFP-β that were transcytosed to the basolateral membrane, internalized, or retained in the apical membrane after a 4-h incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Blue Native Gel of Microsomal Membranes Isolated from MDCK and LLC-PK1 Cells to Detect Associated Na,K-ATPase—The microsomal membranes from MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing YFP-β were isolated as described before (24Vagin O. Denevich S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C968-C976Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected in buffer A (10 mm PIPES/Tris, pH 7.0, with 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm EDTA) containing 250 mm sucrose, homogenized, layered onto the 42% sucrose solution, and spun in the Beckman SW28 swinging bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The fraction at the buffer/sucrose interface was collected, diluted with buffer A, and centrifuged in a Beckman 75Ti rotor (35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer (Wheaton, Millwille, NY). The total protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry protein assay reagent (Pierce). The typical protein concentration was 5–10 μg/μl.Blue native gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). All buffers and solutions were at pH 7.0 at 4 °C. 1 mg of protein of microsomal membranes isolated from MDCK or LLC-PK1 cells was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm BisTris buffer containing 0.75 m aminocaproic acid (Fluka). After adding 12.5 μl of 10% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Roche Applied Science) and a 20-min incubation on ice with vortexing every 5 min, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Then 6.3 μl of a 5% suspension of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva, Germany) in 0.5 m aminocaproic acid was added to 100 μl of supernatant. Samples were then stored on ice for no more than 30 min prior to gel loading. A 4–12% gradient gel with 4% stacker was used (Invitrogen). The anode buffer contained 50 mm BisTris. The cathode buffer contained 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris, and 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The gel, buffers, and electrophoretic apparatus were chilled to 4 °C before samples were loaded (35 μl/well with 40–80 μg of protein). Electrophoresis was carried out at 34 V and 0.05 mA overnight. Then the cathode buffer was exchanged for one-tenth the amount of 0.001% Coomassie Blue, and electrophoresis was resumed at 60 V, 0.05 mA. Staining was carried out as described above for the various ATPase subunits.RESULTSSteady State Surface Distribution of the Wild Type and Mutant YFP-β in Polarized MDCK and LLC-PK1 Cells—Expression of the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit as a YFP N-terminal construct in eukaryotic cells results in a synthesis of a fusion protein that retains correct folding, post-translational modifications, and ability to assemble with its α subunit and supports the active conformation of the α,β complex, as was shown before in nonpolarized HEK-293 cells (24Vagin O. Denevich S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C968-C976Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and polarized LLC-PK1 cells (18Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39026-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expressed fusion protein of YFP and the H,K-ATPase β subunit (YFP-β) was detected by Western blot in cell lysates of MDCK cells as two bands, a major band at 80–100 kDa and a minor band at ∼75 kDa (Fig. 1A, MDCK, wt, lane T) similar to the pattern found previously in HEK-293 and LLC-PK1 cells (18Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39026-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Vagin O. Denevich S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C968-C976Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A similar pattern was observed in the cell lines expressing the wild type protein and Y20A and Y20F mutants (Fig. 1A, lanes T).
