https://openalex.org/W2076507262,"Obtaining high-resolution information from a complex system, while maintaining the global perspective needed to understand system function, represents a key challenge in biology. Here we address this challenge with a method (termed CLARITY) for the transformation of intact tissue into a nanoporous hydrogel-hybridized form (crosslinked to a three-dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers) that is fully assembled but optically transparent and macromolecule-permeable. Using mouse brains, we show intact-tissue imaging of long-range projections, local circuit wiring, cellular relationships, subcellular structures, protein complexes, nucleic acids and neurotransmitters. CLARITY also enables intact-tissue in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry with multiple rounds of staining and de-staining in non-sectioned tissue, and antibody labelling throughout the intact adult mouse brain. Finally, we show that CLARITY enables fine structural analysis of clinical samples, including non-sectioned human tissue from a neuropsychiatric-disease setting, establishing a path for the transmutation of human tissue into a stable, intact and accessible form suitable for probing structural and molecular underpinnings of physiological function and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990226486,"In 2010 there were more than 200 million cases of malaria, and at least 655,000 deaths. The World Health Organization has recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide with potent antimalarial properties, produced by the plant Artemisia annua. However, the supply of plant-derived artemisinin is unstable, resulting in shortages and price fluctuations, complicating production planning by ACT manufacturers. A stable source of affordable artemisinin is required. Here we use synthetic biology to develop strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) for high-yielding biological production of artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin. Previous attempts to produce commercially relevant concentrations of artemisinic acid were unsuccessful, allowing production of only 1.6 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Here we demonstrate the complete biosynthetic pathway, including the discovery of a plant dehydrogenase and a second cytochrome that provide an efficient biosynthetic route to artemisinic acid, with fermentation titres of 25 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Furthermore, we have developed a practical, efficient and scalable chemical process for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin using a chemical source of singlet oxygen, thus avoiding the need for specialized photochemical equipment. The strains and processes described here form the basis of a viable industrial process for the production of semi-synthetic artemisinin to stabilize the supply of artemisinin for derivatization into active pharmaceutical ingredients (for example, artesunate) for incorporation into ACTs. Because all intellectual property rights have been provided free of charge, this technology has the potential to increase provision of first-line antimalarial treatments to the developing world at a reduced average annual price."
https://openalex.org/W2005757388,"Under stress conditions such as infection or inflammation the body rapidly needs to generate new blood cells that are adapted to the challenge. Haematopoietic cytokines are known to increase output of specific mature cells by affecting survival, expansion and differentiation of lineage-committed progenitors, but it has been debated whether long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are susceptible to direct lineage-specifying effects of cytokines. Although genetic changes in transcription factor balance can sensitize HSCs to cytokine instruction, the initiation of HSC commitment is generally thought to be triggered by stochastic fluctuation in cell-intrinsic regulators such as lineage-specific transcription factors, leaving cytokines to ensure survival and proliferation of the progeny cells. Here we show that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also called CSF1), a myeloid cytokine released during infection and inflammation, can directly induce the myeloid master regulator PU.1 and instruct myeloid cell-fate change in mouse HSCs, independently of selective survival or proliferation. Video imaging and single-cell gene expression analysis revealed that stimulation of highly purified HSCs with M-CSF in culture resulted in activation of the PU.1 promoter and an increased number of PU.1(+) cells with myeloid gene signature and differentiation potential. In vivo, high systemic levels of M-CSF directly stimulated M-CSF-receptor-dependent activation of endogenous PU.1 protein in single HSCs and induced a PU.1-dependent myeloid differentiation preference. Our data demonstrate that lineage-specific cytokines can act directly on HSCs in vitro and in vivo to instruct a change of cell identity. This fundamentally changes the current view of how HSCs respond to environmental challenge and implicates stress-induced cytokines as direct instructors of HSC fate."
https://openalex.org/W1973279971,"Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes in a wide variety of systems. Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations. However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems needs to be examined empirically. Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold bifurcation (tipping point), to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call 'recovery length'. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time, recovery length is the distance necessary for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems."

To understand the extent of public health risk attributed to supply water in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, Escherichia coli isolated from tap water samples collected from different locations of the city were characterized for their antibiotic resistance, pathogenic properties and genetic diversity.A total of 233 E. coli isolates obtained from 175 tap water samples were analysed for susceptibility to 16 different antibiotics and for the presence of genes associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance. Nearly 36% (n = 84) of the isolates were multi-drug(≥ 3 classes of antibiotics) resistant (MDR) and 26% (n = 22) of these were positive for extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). Of the 22 ESBL-producers, 20 were positive for bla CTX-M-15, 7 for bla OXA-1-group (all had bla OXA-47) and 2 for bla CMY-2. Quinolone resistance genes, qnrS and qnrB were detected in 6 and 2 isolates, respectively. Around 7% (n = 16) of the isolates carried virulence gene(s) characteristic of pathogenic E. coli; 11 of these contained lt and/or st and thus belonged to enterotoxigenic E. coli and 5 contained bfp and eae and thus belonged to enteropathogenic E. coli. All MDR isolates carried multiple plasmids (2 to 8) of varying sizes ranging from 1.2 to >120 MDa. Ampicillin and ceftriaxone resistance were co-transferred in conjugative plasmids of 70 to 100 MDa in size, while ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline resistance were co-transferred in conjugative plasmids of 50 to 90 MDa. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed diverse genetic fingerprints of pathogenic isolates.Multi-drug resistant E. coli are wide spread in public water supply in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Transmission of resistant bacteria and plasmids through supply water pose serious threats to public health in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W2141719314,"Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) leads to amelioration of Huntington’s-disease-relevant phenotypes in yeast, fruitfly and mouse models; here the crystal structures of free and inhibitor-bound yeast KMO are presented, which could aid the development of targeted therapies for human neurodegenerative diseases. The kynurenine pathway is the major route of tryptophan degradation in mammals, and some metabolites generated by tryptophan degradation have an important role in neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibition of the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) enzyme leads to the amelioration of Huntington's-disease-relevant phenotypes in various animal models. This paper presents the structure of KMO in the free form and in complex with an inhibitor. This study will provide the basis for the development of inhibitors for possible therapeutic use in neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), an enzyme in the eukaryotic tryptophan catabolic pathway (that is, kynurenine pathway), leads to amelioration of Huntington’s-disease-relevant phenotypes in yeast, fruitfly and mouse models1,2,3,4,5, as well as in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease3. KMO is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase and is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane where it converts l-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Perturbations in the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of a spectrum of brain disorders6, as well as cancer7,8 and several peripheral inflammatory conditions9. Despite the importance of KMO as a target for neurodegenerative disease, the molecular basis of KMO inhibition by available lead compounds has remained unknown. Here we report the first crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO, in the free form and in complex with the tight-binding inhibitor UPF 648. UPF 648 binds close to the FAD cofactor and perturbs the local active-site structure, preventing productive binding of the substrate l-kynurenine. Functional assays and targeted mutagenesis reveal that the active-site architecture and UPF 648 binding are essentially identical in human KMO, validating the yeast KMO–UPF 648 structure as a template for structure-based drug design. This will inform the search for new KMO inhibitors that are able to cross the blood–brain barrier in targeted therapies against neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2166968703,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key soluble effector of the innate immune system that recognizes pathogen-specific surface glycans. Surprisingly, low-producing MBL genetic variants that may predispose children and immunocompromised individuals to infectious diseases are more common than would be expected in human populations. Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances. Consequently, the low and intermediate MBL levels commonly found in human populations might be the result of balancing selection. Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2110660851,"There will be winners and losers as climate change alters the habitats of polar organisms. For an Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony on Beaufort Island (Beaufort), part of a cluster of colonies in the southern Ross Sea, we report a recent population increase in response to increased nesting habitat as glaciers have receded. Emigration rates of birds banded as chicks on Beaufort to colonies on nearby Ross Island decreased after 2005 as available habitat on Beaufort increased, leading to altered dynamics of the metapopulation. Using aerial photography beginning in 1958 and modern satellite imagery, we measured change in area of available nesting habitat and population size of the Beaufort colony. Population size varied with available habitat, and both increased rapidly since the 1990s. In accord with glacial retreat, summer temperatures at nearby McMurdo Station increased by ∼0.50°C per decade since the mid-1980s. Although the Ross Sea is likely to be the last ocean with an intact ecosystem, the recent retreat of ice fields at Beaufort that resulted in increased breeding habitat exemplifies a process that has been underway in the Ross Sea during the entire Holocene. Furthermore, our results are in line with predictions that major ice shelves and glaciers will retreat rapidly elsewhere in the Antarctic, potentially leading to increased breeding habitat for Adélie penguins. Results further indicated that satellite imagery may be used to estimate large changes in Adélie penguin populations, facilitating our understanding of metapopulation dynamics and environmental factors that influence regional populations."
https://openalex.org/W2011109079,"The Large Tumor Suppressor 1 (LATS1) is a serine/threonine kinase and tumor suppressor found down-regulated in various human cancers. LATS1 has recently been identified as a central player of the emerging Hippo signaling pathway, which plays important roles in organ size control, tumorigenesis, and stem cell differentiation and renewal, etc. Although mounting evidence supports a role of LATS1 in tumor suppression and tumorigenesis, how LATS1 is regulated at the molecular level is not fully understood. Recently several positive regulators of LATS1 (Mst1/2, MOB1, Kibra, etc) have been identified but how LATS1 is negatively regulated is still largely unknown. We have recently identified Itch, a member of the NEDD4-like family E3 ubiquitin ligases, as a novel negative regulator of LATS1. However, whether other ubiquitin ligases modulate LATS1 stability and function is unclear. By screening many E3 ligases of the NEDD4-like family using over-expression and short-interference RNA knockdown approaches, we have identified WWP1 E3 ligase as another novel negative regulator of LATS1. We have provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that WWP1 is essential for LATS1 stability and negatively regulate LATS1 by promoting LATS1 degradation through polyubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway. Importantly, we also showed that degradation of LATS1 is critical in mediating WWP1-induced increased cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Since WWP1 is an oncogene and LATS1 is a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer, our studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy in which developed drugs targeting WWP1 cause activation of LATS1 in suppressing breast cancer cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2077854588,"Background The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) is a new instrument that assesses subjective feelings of well-being and ill-being and overcome several limitations of previous popular instruments. The current study examined the scale's psychometric properties with a large Chinese sample. Principal Findings Data were collected form 21,322 full-time workers from the power industry. The psychometric properties were assessed in term of internal consistency reliability, factorial validity, convergent validity, and measurement invariance across gender, age, marital status, education level, and income level. The results demonstrate that the SPANE has high internal consistency reliability, a correlated two-factor structure (with the uniqueness of three general and specific items of positive and negative feelings allowed to correlate with each other), strict equivalence across gender, age and marital status, and strong equivalence across education and income. Furthermore, the SPANE converges well with two measures of life satisfaction. Conclusion The Chinese version of the SPANE behaves consistently with the original and can be used in future studies of emotional well-being. The scale norms are presented in terms of percentile rankings, and implications and directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2036182307,"In a screen for delayed floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis, we have identified a novel mutant of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), the F-box protein that has been shown to be the jasmonic acid (JA) co-receptor. While JA has been shown to have an important role in senescence, root development, pollen dehiscence and defense responses, there has been little focus on its critical role in floral organ abscission. Abscission, or the detachment of organs from the main body of a plant, is an essential process during plant development and a unique type of cell separation regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals. Previous studies have indicated that auxin and ethylene are major plant hormones regulating abscission; and here we show that regulation of floral organ abscission is also controlled by jasmonic acid in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our characterization of coi1-1 and a novel allele (coi1-37) has also revealed an essential role in apical dominance and floral meristem arrest. In this study we provide genetic evidence indicating that delayed abscission 4 (dab4-1) is allelic to coi1-1 and that meristem arrest and apical dominance appear to be evolutionarily divergent functions for COI1 that are governed in an ecotype-dependent manner. Further characterizations of ethylene and JA responses of dab4-1/coi1-37 also provide new information suggesting separate pathways for ethylene and JA that control both floral organ abscission and hypocotyl growth in young seedlings. Our study opens the door revealing new roles for JA and its interaction with other hormones during plant development."

https://openalex.org/W2058389007,"Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a widespread plant pathogen, is found in tobacco (including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco) as well as in many other plants. Plant viruses do not replicate or cause infection in humans or other mammals. This study was done to determine whether exposure to tobacco products induces an immune response to TMV in humans. Using a sandwich ELISA assay, we detected serum anti-TMV antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgM) in all subjects enrolled in the study (20 healthy smokers, 20 smokeless-tobacco users, and 20 non-smokers). Smokers had a higher level of serum anti-TMV IgG antibodies than non-smokers, while the serum level of anti-TMV IgA from smokeless tobacco users was lower than smokers and non-smokers. Using bioinformatics, we also found that the human protein TOMM40L (an outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog--like translocase) contains a strong homology of six contiguous amino acids to the TMV coat protein, and TOMM40L peptide exhibited cross-reactivity with anti-TMV antibodies. People who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products experience a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Our results showing molecular mimicry between TMV and human TOMM40L raise the question as to whether TMV has a potential role in smokers against Parkinson's disease development. The potential mechanisms of molecular mimicry between plant viruses and human disease should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2318538832,"The nature of the olfactory receptor in crustaceans, a major group of arthropods, has remained elusive. We report that spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, express ionotropic receptors (IRs), the insect chemosensory variants of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Unlike insects IRs, which are expressed in a specific subset of olfactory cells, two lobster IR subunits are expressed in most, if not all, lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), as confirmed by antibody labeling and in situ hybridization. Ligand-specific ORN responses visualized by calcium imaging are consistent with a restricted expression pattern found for other potential subunits, suggesting that cell-specific expression of uncommon IR subunits determines the ligand sensitivity of individual cells. IRs are the only type of olfactory receptor that we have detected in spiny lobster olfactory tissue, suggesting that they likely mediate olfactory signaling. Given long-standing evidence for G protein-mediated signaling in activation of lobster ORNs, this finding raises the interesting specter that IRs act in concert with second messenger-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2032971816,"The development of neuronal polarity is essential for the establishment of the accurate patterning of neuronal circuits in the brain. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that control rapid axon elongation during neuronal development. Here, we report that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein-3 (JIP3) is highly expressed at axon tips during the critical period for axon development. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, immunofluorescence analysis, and in utero electroporation, we find that JIP3 can enhance axon elongation in primary hippocampal neurons and cortical neurons in vivo. We further demonstrate that JIP3 promotes axon elongation in a kinesin- and JNK-dependent manner using several deletion mutants of JIP3. Next, we demonstrate that the successful transportation of JIP3 to axon tips by kinesin is a prerequisite for enhancing JNK phosphorylation in this area and therefore promotes axon elongation, constituting a novel mechanism for coupling JIP3 anterograde transport with JNK signaling at the distal axons and axon elongation. Finally, our immunofluorescence data suggest that the activation of JNK at axon tips facilitates axon elongation by modulating cofilin activity and actin filament dynamics. These findings may have important implications for our understanding of neuronal axon elongation during development."
https://openalex.org/W2076604472,"The present study was aimed at investigating the expression of metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its relationship with β-catenin, Met expression and the clinicopathological features of NPC, and its roles in carcinogenesis of NPC. Our results showed that MACC1 expression was higher in NPC cells and tissues than that in normal nasopharyngeal cells and chronic inflammation of the nasopharynx tissues, respectively. MACC1 expression was closely related to the clinical stage (p = 0.005) and the N classification (p<0.05) of NPC. Significant correlations between MACC1 expression and Met expression (p = 0.003), MACC1 expression and β-catenin abnormal expression (p = 0.033) were found in NPC tissues. MACC1 knockdown dramatically inhibited cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation, but induced apoptosis in NPC cells compared with the control group. Furthermore, MACC1 down-regulation inhibited phosphorylated-Akt (Ser473) and β-catenin expression in NPC cells, but phosphorylated-Erk1/2 expression was not altered. Further study showed that phosphotidylinsitol-3-kinase inhibitor downregulated β-catenin and Met expression in NPC cells. There was a significant relationship between MACC1 expression and phosphorylated-Akt expression (p = 0.03), β-catenin abnormal expression and phosphorylated-Akt expression (p = 0.012) in NPC tissue, respectively. In addition, Epstein Barr virus-encoded oncogene latent membrane protein 1 upregulated MACC1 expression in NPC cells. Our results firstly suggest that MACC1 plays an important role in carcinogenesis of NPC through Akt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Targeting MACC1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2014772837,"Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that ultimately results in major pathophysiological complications in the cardiovascular system. Diabetics are predisposed to higher incidences of sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). Several studies have associated diabetes as a major underlying risk for heart diseases and its complications. The diabetic heart undergoes remodeling to cope up with the underlying changes, however ultimately fails. In the present study we investigated the changes associated with a key ion channel and transcriptional factors in a diabetic heart model. In the mouse db/db model, we identified key transcriptional regulators and mediators that play important roles in the regulation of ion channel expression. Voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv4.2) is modulated in diabetes and is down regulated. We hypothesized that Kv4.2 expression is altered by potassium channel interacting protein-2 (KChIP2) which is regulated upstream by NFkB and miR-301a. We utilized qRT-PCR analysis and identified the genes that are affected in diabetes in a regional specific manner in the heart. At protein level we identified and validated differential expression of Kv4.2 and KChIP2 along with NFkB in both ventricles of diabetic hearts. In addition, we identified up-regulation of miR-301a in diabetic ventricles. We utilized loss and gain of function approaches to identify and validate the role of miR-301a in regulating Kv4.2. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies we conclude that miR-301a may be a central regulator for the expression of Kv4.2 in diabetes. This miR-301 mediated regulation of Kv4.2 is independent of NFkB and Irx5 and modulates Kv4.2 by direct binding on Kv4.2 3'untranslated region (3'-UTR). Therefore targeting miR-301a may offer new potential for developing therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2070657848,"The calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus (TAC), inhibits the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin, leading to suppression of the nuclear translocation of NFAT and inhibition of T cell activation. Apart from NFAT also the transcription factor NF-κB plays a key functional role in T cell activation. Therefore, blockade of the NF-κB activation cascade by immunosuppressive drugs prevents immune activation. Here we studied whether TAC blocks NF-κB activation in peripheral human T cells. After anti-CD3/CD28-activation of T cells from healthy volunteers, NF-κB (p65) phosphorylation was measured by flow cytometry in CD3+ T cells, CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the absence and presence of TAC 10 ng/mL, sotrastaurin 500 nM (positive control) and mycophenolic acid 10 µg/mL (negative control; n = 6). NF-κB transcriptional activity was measured by ELISA and intracellular TNFα protein, a downstream target, was measured by flow cytometry to assess the functional consequences of NF-κB blockade. Anti-CD3/28-activation induced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells by 34% (mean), 38% and 30% resp. (p<0.01). Sotrastaurin inhibited NF-κB activation in the respective T cell subsets by 93%, 95% and 86% (p<0.01 vs. no drug), while mycophenolic acid did not affect this activation pathway. Surprisingly, TAC also inhibited NF-κB phosphorylation, by 55% (p<0.01) in CD3+ T cells, by 56% (p<0.01) in CD4+ T cells and by 51% in CD8+ T cells (p<0.01). In addition, TAC suppressed NF-κB DNA binding capacity by 55% (p<0.05) in CD3+ T cells and TNFα protein expression was inhibited in CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells by 76%, 71% and 93% resp. (p<0.01 vs. no drug), confirming impaired NF-κB signaling. This study shows the suppressive effect of TAC on NF-κB signaling in peripheral human T cell subsets, measured at three specific positions in the NF-κB activation cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2000051400,"Background It has been suggested that autophagy-related Beclin 1 plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor development and/or progression, but its prognostic significance and relationship with Bcl-xL expression in ovarian carcinoma are unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, the methods of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to investigate the expression status of Beclin 1 and Bcl-xL in fresh ovarian tissues and paraffin-embedded epithelial ovarian tumor tissues. Decreased expression of Beclin 1 was examined by IHC in 8.3% of normal ovaries, in 15.4% of cystadenomas, in 20.0% of borderline tumors, and in 55.6% of ovarian carcinomas, respectively. In ovarian carcinomas, decreased expression of Beclin 1 was correlated closely with ascending histological grade, later pT/pN/pM status and/or advanced clinical stage (P<0.05). In univariate survival analysis, a highly significant association between low-expressed Beclin 1 and shortened patient survival was evaluated in ovarian carcinoma patients (P<0.01), and Beclin 1 expression was an independent prognostic factor as evidenced by multivariate analysis (P = 0.013). In addition, decreased expression of Beclin 1 was inversely correlated with altered expression of Bcl-xL in ovarian carcinoma cohort, and combined analysis further showed that the low Beclin 1/high Bcl-xL group had the lowest survival rate. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that Beclin 1 expression, as examined by IHC, could be served as an additional tool in identifying ovarian carcinoma patients at risk of tumor progression, and predicting patient survival in ovarian carcinomas with increased expression of Bcl-xL."
https://openalex.org/W2001738161,"The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China resulted in great loss of life and property, and previous studies have focused on psychopathological symptoms in survivors after disasters. This study examined perceived family functioning and its predictors in disaster bereaved individuals eighteen months after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 264 bereaved individuals. The instruments used in the study included Family APGAR Index, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation ScaleãÀ, Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale, and a range of items eliciting demographic characteristics and disaster-related variables. The results indicated that the rates of moderate family dysfunction and severe family dysfunction in bereaved individuals were 37.1% and 12.9%, respectively. Less financial loss during the earthquake was a significant predictor for positive family function. Better self-rated health status after the earthquake was significantly related to positive family function, cohesion, and adaptability. Scores on family cohesion and adaptability in bereaved individuals from extended or nuclear families were significantly higher than those from single-parent families. The ability to give birth to another baby of bereaved parents was a significant predictor for positive family function and cohesion. Poorer family function, cohesion and adaptability were significantly related to greater loneliness.This study found a high prevalence of family dysfunction in bereaved individuals eighteen months after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Strategies can be designed to facilitate post-disaster recovery, particularly for the bereaved at high risk for family dysfunction. The study provides useful information for post-disaster rebuilding and relief work."
https://openalex.org/W2037535235,"Background Cystine-knot miniproteins, also known as knottins, have shown great potential as molecular scaffolds for the development of targeted therapeutics and diagnostic agents. For this purpose, previous protein engineering efforts have focused on knottins based on the Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor (EETI) from squash seeds, the Agouti-related protein (AgRP) neuropeptide from mammals, or the Kalata B1 uterotonic peptide from plants. Here, we demonstrate that Agatoxin (AgTx), an ion channel inhibitor found in spider venom, can be used as a molecular scaffold to engineer knottins that bind with high-affinity to a tumor-associated integrin receptor. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a rational loop-grafting approach to engineer AgTx variants that bound to αvβ3 integrin with affinities in the low nM range. We showed that a disulfide-constrained loop from AgRP, a structurally-related knottin, can be substituted into AgTx to confer its high affinity binding properties. In parallel, we identified amino acid mutations required for efficient in vitro folding of engineered integrin-binding AgTx variants. Molecular imaging was used to evaluate in vivo tumor targeting and biodistribution of an engineered AgTx knottin compared to integrin-binding knottins based on AgRP and EETI. Knottin peptides were chemically synthesized and conjugated to a near-infrared fluorescent dye. Integrin-binding AgTx, AgRP, and EETI knottins all generated high tumor imaging contrast in U87MG glioblastoma xenograft models. Interestingly, EETI-based knottins generated significantly lower non-specific kidney imaging signals compared to AgTx and AgRP-based knottins. Conclusions/Significance In this study, we demonstrate that AgTx, a knottin from spider venom, can be engineered to bind with high affinity to a tumor-associated receptor target. This work validates AgTx as a viable molecular scaffold for protein engineering, and further demonstrates the promise of using tumor-targeting knottins as probes for in vivo molecular imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2043363350,"Peripheral membrane proteins can be targeted to specific organelles or the plasma membrane by differential recognition of phospholipid headgroups. Although molecular determinants of specificity for several headgroups, including phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides are well defined, specific recognition of the headgroup of the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) is less well understood. In cytosolic proteins the cation-π box provides a suitable receptor for choline recognition and binding through the trimethylammonium moiety. In PC, this moiety might provide a sufficient handle to bind to peripheral proteins via a cation-π cage, where the π systems of two or more aromatic residues are within 4-5 Å of the quaternary amine. We prove this hypothesis by engineering the cation-π box into secreted phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus, which lacks specific PC recognition. The N254Y/H258Y variant selectively binds PC-enriched vesicles, and x-ray crystallography reveals N254Y/H258Y binds choline and dibutyroylphosphatidylcholine within the cation-π motif. Such simple PC recognition motifs could be engineered into a wide variety of secondary structures providing a generally applicable method for specific recognition of PC."
https://openalex.org/W2054873260,"To prevent surgical site infection (SSI), the airborne microbial concentration in operating theaters must be reduced. The air quality in operating theaters and nearby areas is also important to healthcare workers. Therefore, this study assessed air quality in the post-operative recovery room, locations surrounding the operating theater area, and operating theaters in a medical center. Temperature, relative humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (CO2), suspended particulate matter (PM), and bacterial concentrations were monitored weekly over one year. Measurement results reveal clear differences in air quality in different operating theater areas. The post-operative recovery room had significantly higher CO2 and bacterial concentrations than other locations. Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. bacteria often existed in the operating theater area. Furthermore, Acinetobacter spp. was the main pathogen in the post-operative recovery room (18%) and traumatic surgery room (8%). The mixed effect models reveal a strong correlation between number of people in a space and high CO2 concentration after adjusting for sampling locations. In conclusion, air quality in the post-operative recovery room and operating theaters warrants attention, and merits long-term surveillance to protect both surgical patients and healthcare workers."
https://openalex.org/W2157664340,"Objective The FTO A/T polymorphism (rs9939609) is a strong candidate to influence obesity-related traits. Elite athletes from many different sporting disciplines are characterized by low body fat. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether athletic status is associated with the FTO A/T polymorphism. Subjects and Methods A large cohort of European Caucasians from Poland, Russia and Spain were tested to examine the association between FTO A/T polymorphism (rs9939609) and athletic status. A total of 551 athletes were divided by type of sport (endurance athletes, n = 266 vs. sprint/power athletes, n = 285) as well as by level of competition (elite-level vs. national-level). The control group consisted of 1,416 ethnically-matched, non-athletic participants, all Europeans. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between FTO A/T genotypes and athletic status/competition level. Results There were no significantly greater/lesser odds of harbouring any type of genotype when comparing across athletic status (endurance athletes, sprint/power athletes or control participants). These effects were observed after controlling for sex and nationality. Furthermore, no significantly greater/lesser odds ratios were observed for any of the genotypes in respect to the level of competition (elite-level vs. national-level). Conclusion The FTO A/T polymorphism is not associated with elite athletic status in the largest group of elite athletes studied to date. Large collaborations and data sharing between researchers, as presented here, are strongly recommended to enhance the research in the field of exercise genomics."
https://openalex.org/W1980049377,"Phytate is the major storage form of organic phosphorus in soils and plant seeds, and phosphorus (P) in this form is unavailable to plants or monogastric animals. In the present study, the phytase genes phyA and appA were introduced into Brassica napus cv Westar with a signal peptide sequence and CaMV 35S promoter, respectively. Three independent transgenic lines, P3 and P11 from phyA and a18 from appA, were selected. The three transgenic lines exhibited significantly higher exuded phytase activity when compared to wild-type (WT) controls. A quartz sand culture experiment demonstrated that transgenic Brassica napus had significantly improved P uptake and plant biomass. A soil culture experiment revealed that seed yields of transgenic lines P11 and a18 increased by 20.9% and 59.9%, respectively, when compared to WT. When phytate was used as the sole P source, P accumulation in seeds increased by 20.6% and 46.9% with respect to WT in P11 and a18, respectively. The P3 line accumulated markedly more P in seeds than WT, while no significant difference was observed in seed yields when phytate was used as the sole P source. Phytase activities in transgenic canola seeds ranged from 1,138 to 1,605 U kg–1 seeds, while no phytase activity was detected in WT seeds. Moreover, phytic acid content in P11 and a18 seeds was significantly lower than in WT. These results introduce an opportunity for improvement of soil and seed phytate-P bioavailability through genetic manipulation of oilseed rape, thereby increasing plant production and P nutrition for monogastric animals."
https://openalex.org/W2033544542,"Impaired olfaction is an early pre-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease. The neuropathology underlying olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is unknown, however α-synuclein accumulation/aggregation and altered neurogenesis might play a role. We characterized olfactory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease expressing human wild-type α-synuclein under the control of the mouse α-synuclein promoter. Preliminary clinical observations suggest that rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, improves olfaction in Parkinson's disease. We therefore examined whether rasagiline ameliorates olfactory deficits in this Parkinson's disease model and investigated the role of olfactory bulb neurogenesis. α-Synuclein mice were progressively impaired in their ability to detect odors, to discriminate between odors, and exhibited alterations in short-term olfactory memory. Rasagiline treatment rescued odor detection and odor discrimination abilities. However, rasagiline did not affect short-term olfactory memory. Finally, olfactory changes were not coupled to alterations in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. We conclude that rasagiline reverses select olfactory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease. The findings correlate with preliminary clinical observations suggesting that rasagiline ameliorates olfactory deficits in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031456695,"Data on objectively measured physical activity (PA) in preschoolers are controversial. Direct accelerometry was performed in children aged 3-6 years, and differences in PA patterns over the course of the week were evaluated. Data were analyzed with gender, BMI, lifestyle, and socioeconomic parameters as covariates.PA was measured in 119 children by the SensewearPro® accelerometer and analyzed in the 92 (40 girls) that wore it for at least 4 days including one day of the weekend. Median measuring time in this group was 7 consecutive days (median/mean daily measuring time: 23.5 h/d and 21.8 h/d, respectively), corresponding to 834,000 analyzed minutes. PA questionnaires were completed by 103 parents and 87 preschool teachers to collect anthropometric, lifestyle, and socioeconomic data.Median daily PA (MET>3) was 4.3 hours (mean: 4.4 hours). Boys spent an estimated 52 min/week more being very active (MET>6) than girls (95% CI [6, 96] min/week, p = 0.02). PA was lower during the weekend (3.7 h/d) compared to weekdays (4.5 h/d), p = 3 × 10(-6)), where a 95% CI for the difference is [0.5, 1.0] h/d. PA levels did not differ between overweight/obese children (median 4.7 h/d) and normal-weight peers (median 4.2 h/d). Daily media consumption increased with decreasing social class on weekdays (p = 0.05) and during the weekend (p = 0.01), but was not related to the amount of daily PA. A multivariate regression with BMI-SDS as independent variable and gender, age, amount of PA>6 MET, parental BMI, media time and socioeconomic status as explanatory variables revealed that only SES had a significant contribution.The negative impact of obesity-promoting factors in older children is rather low for preschoolers, but there is evidently a gradient in PA between weekdays and weekends already in this age group. Weight status of preschoolers is already considerably influenced by SES, but not physical activity levels."
https://openalex.org/W2052738080,"Background Revised dengue guidelines were published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 addressing severe dengue cases not classified by dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and shock syndrome (DSS). Methods and Principal Findings We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare WHO 2009 and 1997 classifications using 1278 adult dengue cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction assay from Singapore epidemics in 2004 and 2007 (predominantly serotype 1 and 2 respectively).DHF occurred in 14.3%, DSS 2.7% and severe dengue 16.0%. The two WHO dengue classifications were discordant in defining severe disease (p<0.001). Five DSS patients (15%) were classified as non-severe dengue without warning signs. Of severe dengue patients, 107 did not fulfil DHF criteria. Of these, 14.9% had self-resolving isolated elevated aminotransferases, 18.7% gastrointestinal bleeding without hemodynamic compromise and 56.1% plasma leakage with isolated tachycardia. We compared both guidelines against requirement for intensive care including the single death in this series: all six had severe dengue; only four had DHF as two lacked bleeding manifestations but had plasma leakage. Increasing length of hospitalization was noted among severe cases with both classifications but the trend was only statistically significant for WHO 2009. Length of hospitalization was significantly longer for severe plasma leakage compared with severe bleeding or organ impairment. Requirement for hospitalization increased using WHO 2009 from 17.0% to 51.3%. Conclusions While the WHO 2009 dengue classification is clinically useful, we propose retaining criteria for plasma leakage and hemodynamic compromise from WHO 1997, and refining definitions of severe bleeding and organ impairment to improve clinical relevance having found that differences in these accounted for the discordance between classifications. Findings from our retrospective study may be limited by the study site - a tertiary referral center in a hyperendemic country - and should be evaluated in a wider range of geographic settings."
https://openalex.org/W1994689190,"Natural killer (NK) cells are highly specialized effectors of the innate immune system that hold promise for adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Their cell killing activity is primarily mediated by the pro-apoptotic serine protease granzyme B (GrB), which enters targets cells with the help of the pore-forming protein perforin. We investigated expression of a chimeric GrB fusion protein in NK cells as a means to augment their antitumoral activity. For selective targeting to tumor cells, we fused the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) peptide ligand transforming growth factor α (TGFα) to human pre-pro-GrB. Established human NKL natural killer cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressed this GrB-TGFα (GrB-T) molecule in amounts comparable to endogenous wildtype GrB. Activation of the genetically modified NK cells by cognate target cells resulted in the release of GrB-T together with endogenous granzymes and perforin, which augmented the effector cells' natural cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive tumor cells. Likewise, GrB-T was released into the extracellular space upon induction of degranulation with PMA and ionomycin. Secreted GrB-T fusion protein displayed specific binding to EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells, enzymatic activity, and selective target cell killing in the presence of an endosomolytic activity. Our data demonstrate that ectopic expression of a targeted GrB fusion protein in NK cells is feasible and can enhance antitumoral activity of the effector cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995139242,"Background Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a first-line treatment for asthma for their anti-inflammatory effects, but they also hinder the repair of airway epithelial injury. The anti-inflammatory protein GC-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) is reported to inhibit the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which promotes the repair of airway epithelial cells around the damaged areas. We investigated whether the inhibition of airway epithelial repair imposed by the GC dexamethasone (DEX) is mediated by GILZ. Methods We tested the effect of DEX on the expressions of GILZ mRNA and GILZ protein and the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway in human airway epithelial cells, via RT-PCR and Western blot. We further evaluated the role of GILZ in mediating the effect of DEX on the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway and in airway epithelium repair by utilizing small-interfering RNAs, MTT, CFSE labeling, wound-healing and cell migration assays. Results DEX increased GILZ mRNA and GILZ protein levels in a human airway epithelial cell line. Furthermore, DEX inhibited the phosphorylation of Raf-1, Mek1/2, Erk1/2 (components of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway), proliferation and migration. However, the inhibitory effect of DEX was mitigated in cells when the GILZ gene was silenced. Conclusions The inhibition of epithelial injury repair by DEX is mediated in part by activation of GILZ, which suppressed activation of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway, proliferation and migration. Our study implicates the involvement of DEX in this process, and furthers our understanding of the dual role of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W2073768196,"Tryptase, the most abundant mast cell (MC) granule protein, plays an important role in atherosclerosis plaque development. To test the hypothesis that tryptase participates directly in atherosclerosis plaque haemorrhage, the gene sequence and siRNA for tryptase were cloned into a lentivirus carrier and atherosclerosis plaque haemorrhage models in ApoE-/- mice were constructed. After a cuffing-cervical artery operation, the mice were randomly divided into 6 groups. Hematoxylin and eosin(HE) staining showed that the cervical artery plaque area was much larger in the tryptase overexpression group compared to the other groups, and there was greater artery stenosis. The artery stenosis from the cuff-side in all groups was more than 90%, except the siRNA group. Tryptase promotes plaque haemorrhage distinctively because 50% of the mice in the tryptase overexpression group had plaque haemorrhage, while only 10% in the siRNA group did. The immunohistochemistry of the cervical artery plaque showed that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression was the lowest while tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), CD31, CD34 and VEGF was the highest in the tryptase overexpression groups. This observation was completely contrary to what was observed in the siRNA group. Tryptase promoted bEnd.3 cell growth, migration and capillary-like tube formation, which suggests that tryptase can promote microvessel angiogenesis. PAI-1 expression was inhibited, while tPA expression was increased by tryptase in bEnd.3 cells. Our in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that trypase can promote atherosclerotic plaque haemorrhage by promoting angiogenesis and regulating the balance of PAI-1 and tPA. Thus, regulating tryptase expression in MCs may provide a potential target for atherosclerosis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2006670377,"Mortality in heart failure (AHF) remains high, especially during the first days of hospitalization. New prognostic biomarkers may help to optimize treatment. The aim of the study was to determine metabolites that have a high prognostic value.We conducted a prospective study on a training cohort of AHF patients (n = 126) admitted in the cardiac intensive care unit and assessed survival at 30 days. Venous plasmas collected at admission were used for (1)H NMR--based metabonomics analysis. Differences between plasma metabolite profiles allow determination of discriminating metabolites. A cohort of AHF patients was subsequently constituted (n = 74) to validate the findings.Lactate and cholesterol were the major discriminating metabolites predicting 30-day mortality. Mortality was increased in patients with high lactate and low total cholesterol concentrations at admission. Accuracies of lactate, cholesterol concentration and lactate to cholesterol (Lact/Chol) ratio to predict 30-day mortality were evaluated using ROC analysis. The Lact/Chol ratio provided the best accuracy with an AUC of 0.82 (P < 0.0001). The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system provided an AUC of 0.76 for predicting 30-day mortality. APACHE II score, Cardiogenic shock (CS) state and Lact/Chol ratio ≥ 0.4 (cutoff value with 82% sensitivity and 64% specificity) were significant independent predictors of 30-day mortality with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.11, 4.77 and 3.59, respectively. In CS patients, the HR of 30-day mortality risk for plasma Lact/Chol ratio ≥ 0.4 was 3.26 compared to a Lact/Chol ratio of < 0.4 (P = 0.018). The predictive power of the Lact/Chol ratio for 30-day mortality outcome was confirmed with the independent validation cohort.This study identifies the plasma Lact/Chol ratio as a useful objective and simple parameter to evaluate short term prognostic and could be integrated into quantitative guidance for decision making in heart failure care."

Three hundred and fifty eight cats captured in the street or brought in by owners to the Animal Control Center Unit, a unit of State Government, from June 2010 to May 2011, were included in the study. All cats were examined for the presence of fleas and gastrointestinal worms. One-hundred and ninety (53%) cats were infested with at least one flea species. Single infestations were observed in 106 (30%) cats and mixed infestations in 84 (23%) cats. Four species of fleas were recovered: Ctenocephalides felis in 53% of the cats, C. canis in 18%, Echidnophaga gallinacea in 7% and Pulex irritans in 1%. One-hundred and sixty three (45%) cats were infected with one or more species of gastrointestinal parasites: 48 (13%) with nematodes, 145 (40%) with cestodes, and one animal presented Moniliformis moniliformis.

https://openalex.org/W1991430386,"In their 2005 study, Adamic and Glance coined the memorable phrase ""divided they blog"", referring to a trend of cyberbalkanization in the political blogosphere, with liberal and conservative blogs tending to link to other blogs with a similar political slant, and not to one another. As political discussion and activity increasingly moves online, the power of framing political discourses is shifting from mass media to social media. Continued examination of political interactions online is critical, and we extend this line of research by examining the activities of political users within the Wikipedia community. First, we examined how users in Wikipedia choose to display (or not to display) their political affiliation. Next, we more closely examined the patterns of cross-party interaction and community participation among those users proclaiming a political affiliation. In contrast to previous analyses of other social media, we did not find strong trends indicating a preference to interact with members of the same political party within the Wikipedia community. Our results indicate that users who proclaim their political affiliation within the community tend to proclaim their identity as a ""Wikipedian"" even more loudly. It seems that the shared identity of ""being Wikipedian"" may be strong enough to triumph over other potentially divisive facets of personal identity, such as political affiliation."
https://openalex.org/W1980332147,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a nanoporous CREG-eluting stent (CREGES) in inhibiting neointimal formation in a porcine coronary model.In vitro proliferation assays were performed using isolated human endothelial and smooth muscle cells to investigate the cell-specific pharmacokinetic effects of CREG and sirolimus. We implanted CREGES, control sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) or bare metal stents (BMS) into pig coronary arteries. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the efficacy of CREGES in inhibiting neointimal formation.CREG and sirolimus inhibited in vitro vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation to a similar degree. Interestingly, human endothelial cell proliferation was only significantly inhibited by sirolimus and was increased by CREG. CREGES attenuated neointimal formation after 4 weeks in porcine coronary model compared with BMS. No differences were found in the injury and inflammation scores among the groups. Scanning electron microscopy and CD31 staining by immunohistochemistry demonstrated an accelerated reendothelialization in the CREGES group compared with the SES or BMS control groups.The current study suggests that CREGES reduces neointimal formation, promotes reendothelialization in porcine coronary stent model."
https://openalex.org/W2045178376,"The mortality caused by snakebites is more damaging than many tropical diseases, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever, cholera, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis and Chagas disease. For this reason, snakebite envenoming adversely affects health services of tropical and subtropical countries and is recognized as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. One of the main components of snake venoms is the Lys49-phospholipases A2, which is catalytically inactive but possesses other toxic and pharmacological activities. Preliminary studies with MjTX-I from Bothrops moojeni snake venom revealed intriguing new structural and functional characteristics compared to other bothropic Lys49-PLA2s. We present in this article a comprehensive study with MjTX-I using several techniques, including crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, myographic studies, bioinformatics and molecular phylogenetic analyses.Based in all these experiments we demonstrated that MjTX-I is probably a unique Lys49-PLA2, which may adopt different oligomeric forms depending on the physical-chemical environment. Furthermore, we showed that its myotoxic activity is dramatically low compared to other Lys49-PLA2s, probably due to the novel oligomeric conformations and important mutations in the C-terminal region of the protein. The phylogenetic analysis also showed that this toxin is clearly distinct from other bothropic Lys49-PLA2s, in conformity with the peculiar oligomeric characteristics of MjTX-I and possible emergence of new functionalities inresponse to environmental changes and adaptation to new preys."

Biol. 2007; 17: 1879-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ESP family peptides, however, share no sequence similarity with known proteins, and thus three-dimensional structural information should provide a clue as to the evolutionary origin of the family. The ESP peptides, including ESP1, are detected by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located beneath the nasal septum (11Kimoto H. Sato K. Nodari F. Haga S. Holy T.E. Touhara K.

Among the hundreds of vomeronasal receptors, ESP1 is recognized by only one specific vomeronasal type 2 receptor (V2R), V2Rp5 (10Haga S. Hattori T. Sato T. Sato K. Matsuda S. Kobayakawa R. Sakano H.

Evolution, structure, and activation mechanism of family 3/C G-protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The ESP1 signal received by V2Rp5 in the female VNO is transmitted to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and to the brain, where it elicits lordosis behavior (10Haga S. Hattori T. Sato T. Sato K. Matsuda S. Kobayakawa R. Sakano H. Yoshihara Y. Kikusui T. Touhara K. The male mouse pheromone ESP1 enhances female sexual receptive behaviour through a specific vomeronasal receptor.Nature. 2010; 466: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). ESP1-V2Rp5 is the only peptide pheromone-receptor pair identified thus far in mammals. To determine the origin of ESP1 and the ESP family and how specific pheromone recognition is established, we attempted to solve the three-dimensional structure of ESP1 and thereby obtain information regarding the structural basis for the ESP1-V2Rp5 interactions. We herein report the NMR structure of ESP1 and the identification of amino acids involved in receptor recognition. We also describe the specific binding of ESP1 to the extracellular region of V2Rp5. Based on these experimental results, we propose a ligand-receptor binding model of ESP1 and V2Rp5 in which the charged amino acids provide the interactions determining specificity. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate a direct interaction between a mammalian peptide pheromone and its receptor. The structural information obtained in this study may allow us to develop agonists or antagonists to regulate the specific recognition of ESP1 by V2Rp5 and thus control sexual behavior in mice. To create the expression vector for the ESP1(22–102) protein, the ESP1 gene (exon 3) encoding ESP1(24–102) of BALB/c mice was subcloned into the NdeI–EcoRI sites of the pET-28a vector (Merck), and the NdeI sequence encoding His-Met on the 5′ side of the ESP1(24–102) gene was changed using site-directed mutagenesis to encode Gly-Arg to correspond to ESP1(22Koradi R.

Sawasaki T. Endo Y. Practical cell-free protein synthesis system using purified wheat embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To prepare the vector for the ESP1(48–102) protein, we deleted the sequence encoding the His-Met and ESP1(24–47) using site-directed mutagenesis. To obtain vectors for ESP1(36–99) point mutants or deletion mutants of ESP1(36–X), site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the original expression vector (9Kimoto H. Haga S. Sato K. Touhara K. Sex-specific peptides from exocrine glands stimulate mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.Nature. 2005; 437: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To generate the other ESP1(X–99) deletion mutants, DNA fragments of the truncated ESP1 genes were inserted into the pCold TF vector (Takara Bio). All ESP1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). For expression of unlabeled protein, transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium. For NMR analyses, we prepared uniformly 13C/15N- and 15N-labeled ESP1(22–102) and ESP1(48–102) proteins by growing the E. coli in M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl (CIL) and CELTONE-CN or -N (CIL) with [U-13C]glucose (Isotec) or unlabeled glucose. The ESP1(22–102) and (48–102) proteins were purified using Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) columns, and thrombin protease (GE Healthcare or ILS Inc.) was used to remove His tags. These proteins were purified further with a second round of Ni-affinity chromatography followed by sequential anion exchange (Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare)), size exclusion (Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare)), and reversed-phase (Symmetry300 C4 (Waters Corp.)) chromatography. The ESP1(36–99 or 36–X) proteins were purified using reversed-phase chromatography (PEGASIL-300 C4P (Senshu Scientific)). The other ESP1(X–99) deletion mutants were purified with His·Bind Resin (Merck), cleaved by Factor Xa (Merck), and then subjected to reversed-phase chromatography (PEGASIL-300 C4P). The identity and integrity of all purified proteins were confirmed using MALDI/TOF MS and SDS-PAGE. c-Fos-inducing activity in the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) and AOB neurons was assayed as described previously (9Kimoto H. Haga S. Sato K. Touhara K. Sex-specific peptides from exocrine glands stimulate mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.Nature. 2005; 437: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 10Haga S.

A piece of cotton (30 mg) was transfused with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5 μg of ESP1 proteins, dried in a MicroVac vacuum-centrifugal evaporator, and placed into a mouse cage for a 90-min exposure to a BALB/c female mouse. ESP1(36–99), which is the major form of ESP1 in male extraorbital lacrimal gland, was used as a positive control (9Kimoto H. Haga S. Sato K. Touhara K.

A mixture containing multiple forms of ESP1(22–102) obtained after the second Ni-affinity step and ESP1 monomers, dimers, and tetramers obtained after additional anion exchange, size exclusion, and reversed-phase chromatography were used in the biological assay and for SDS-PAGE analysis. The anti-c-Fos antibodies ab7963 (Abcam) and Ab-5 (Merck) were used to stain VNO and AOB sections, respectively. Experiments were performed in accordance with the animal experimentation protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Tokyo. Purified ESP1(22–102) monomers were incubated with or without 9 mm DTT in 18 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, all samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with ethanol, and dissolved in 1% SDS and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) with or without 10 mm AMS (Invitrogen). All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in darkness and then fractionated on an 18% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. For NMR studies, purified ESP1(22–102) and (48–102) monomers were concentrated to 150 μm in an H2O/D2O (0.9/0.1 or 0.95/0.05, v/v) or D2O solution (pH 4.0, direct pH meter reading). NMR measurements were performed at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance 700 or Avance 600 spectrometer with a cryogenic probe. Sequence-specific assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N in ESP1(22–102) and (48–102) were achieved primarily by through-bond heteronuclear correlations along the backbone and side chains with the following 1H, 13C, and 15N triple resonance spectra: three-dimensional HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, H(CCO)NH, C(CO)NH, and HC(C)H total correlation spectroscopy (15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer 3rd, A. Skelton N. Rance M. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2007Google Scholar), recorded on the 13C/15N-labeled sample. Information regarding the distance between protons was obtained from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY (15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer 3rd, A. Skelton N. Rance M. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2007Google Scholar), recorded with mixing times of 150 and 300 ms on the 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled sample. The φ dihedral angle information was obtained from three-dimensional HNHA (16Vuister G.W. Bax A.

Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), recorded on the 15N-labeled sample. The {1H}–15N NOE measurements (17Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M.

The NMRPipe software suite (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11527) Google Scholar) was used to process NMR data and to pick the resonance peaks. Olivia software (M. Yokochi, S. Sekiguchi, and F. Inagaki, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) was used to assign the resonance peaks semiautomatically. The NOE peak assignments and the structure calculations were performed with the CYANA program (19Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K.

Fairbrother W. Palmer 3rd, A. Skelton N. Rance M. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2007Google Scholar). The ψ and φ dihedral angle restraints that were not obtained from the HNHA spectrum were determined from a chemical shift analysis using the program TALOS (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The restraints on the disulfide bridge were applied between Cys63 and Cys95. The restraint range was 2.0–2.1 Å for the Sγ–Sγ pair and 3.0–3.1 Å for the Sγ–Cβ pairs. A total of 100 structures were obtained after structure calculations based on the manual and 6-cycle-iterative NOE peak assignments and the dihedral angle restraints and disulfide bridge restraints. The 20 structures of ESP1(48–102) with the lowest CYANA target function were analyzed (Table 1).TABLE 1NMR and refinement statistics for the structure determination of ESP1(48–102)ParametersValuesNOE distance constraintsTotal1014Short range |i–j| ≤ 1799Medium range 1 < |i–j| < 5152Long range |i–j| ≥ 563Dihedral angle constraintsφ17ψ10Disulfide bridge constraints3 (1 disulfide bridge)CYANA target function (Å2)0.52 ± 0.12Residual NOE violationsNumber > 0.30 Å7 (0.35/structure)Residual angle violationsNumber > 3.0°0Ramachandran statistics (%)Residues in most favored regions66.4Residues in additional allowed regions33.4Residues in generously allowed regions0.2Residues in disallowed regions0.0Structural coordinates r.m.s.d.aRoot mean square deviation.

MOLMOL: a program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Schematic diagrams and molecular surface representations were generated with the program PyMOL (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, L.L.C.). Purified cysteine mutants (C63S, C95S, and C63S/C95S) of ESP1(36–99), ESP1(51–99), ESP1(48–102) wild type and its mutant monomer proteins were concentrated to 20 μm in PBS (pH 7.4) for CD studies. As for C63S and C95S, 1 mm DTT was added to prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges. CD measurements were performed at room temperature on a JASCO J-820 spectropolarimeter. A recombinant protein comprising the extracellular region of V2Rp5 (amino acids 19–584) and a C-terminal FLAG tag was produced by CellFree Sciences Co., Ltd., using purified wheat embryos and the cell-free protein synthesis system (23Takai K. Sawasaki T. Endo Y. Practical cell-free protein synthesis system using purified wheat embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The preparation of the ESP4 monomers will be described elsewhere. 4M. Taniguchi, S. Yoshinaga, S. Haga-Yamanaka, K. Touhara, and H. Terasawa, unpublished data. Both ESP1 and ESP4 were covalently attached to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) using the standard amine coupling conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ESP1-attached beads were incubated with V2Rp5 in 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8) buffer containing 0.1% digitonin (Merck), then washed with the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The bound V2Rp5 was eluted with buffer containing 560 μm free ESP1 or ESP4. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma-Aldrich). In a separate experiment, the ESP1- and ESP4-attached beads, as well as unattached beads, were incubated with V2Rp5 and washed with 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8) buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and 100 mm NaCl. The bound V2Rp5 was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and 500 mm NaCl. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed as described above. Each of the V2Rp5 homology models in active and resting states was constructed with MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc.) using the structures of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) (PDB codes 1EWK and 1EWT) (24Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Structural basis of glutamate recognition by a dimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor.Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) as model building templates. The model of V2Rp5 complexed with ESP1 was constructed by manual fitting of the ESP1 structure onto the cleft of the V2Rp5 model in the active state and was energy-minimized using MOE. A recombinant ESP1 protein without the signal sequence predicted by SignalP 3.0 (25Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Locating proteins in the cell using TargetP, SignalP and related tools.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This protein is hereafter referred to as ESP1(22–102) (Fig. 1A). ESP1(22–102) was resolved as a multiband protein by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1B, lane 1, Mix). Under reducing conditions, it was resolved as a single band, corresponding to the molecular mass of the monomer (9,150 Da) (lane 5), which indicated that different oligomers exist. Mix and purified monomers (lane 2, M) induced c-Fos expression in female VSNs at the same level as ESP1(36–99) (Fig. 1A), which is one of the native forms in male extraorbital lacrimal gland (9Kimoto H. Haga S. Sato K. Touhara K. Sex-specific peptides from exocrine glands stimulate mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.Nature. 2005; 437: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), whereas purified dimers (lane 3, D) and tetramers (lane 4, T) barely induced c-Fos expression (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that ESP1 monomers induce the vomeronasal neural activation. ESP1(22–102) contains two cysteines (Cys63 and Cys95) (Fig. 1A). Under reducing conditions, ESP1 monomers were modified by the thiol-alkylating agent AMS (26Vestweber D. Schatz G. Mitochondria can import artificial precursor proteins containing a branched polypeptide chain or a carboxy-terminal stilbene disulfonate.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the electrophoretic migration was retarded (Fig. 1D, lane 2), although they were not modified and the migration did not change under nonreducing conditions (lane 4), compared with those without the AMS treatment (lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that the monomers contain an intramolecular disulfide bridge. None of cysteine mutants (C63S, C95S, and C63S/C95S) induced c-Fos expression, highlighting the importance of the disulfide bridge to the biological activity of ESP1 (Fig. 1E). To obtain structural information regarding ESP1, backbone mobility was investigated by NMR (17Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Backbone dynamics of a free and phosphopeptide-complexed Src homology 2 domain studied by 15N NMR relaxation.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Negative {1H}–15N NOE indicated that residues 22–48 and 99–102 have a higher mobility, whereas positive NOE indicated that residues 50–98 have a lower mobility. A comparison of the 1H–15N HSQC spectra of ESP1(48–102), lacking the N-terminal mobile region (Fig. 1A), and ESP1(22–102) revealed that the signals derived from the same residues 52–102 are superimposable (Fig. 2B). Consequently, ESP1 includes both a flexible region (residues 22–48) and a structural region (residues 50–98), and these two regions do not interact with each other. The structural region is referred to as the “core domain.” Deletion analysis was performed to define the functional region of ESP1 using the c-Fos induction assay (Fig. 2C). Two N-terminal deletion mutants, ESP1(51–99) and ESP1(52–99), both of which lack residue Asp50, exhibited markedly impaired c-Fos-inducing activity, whereas the other N-terminal deletion mutants bearing Asp50 retained activity.

Hp phenotype affects cardiovascular disease risk and treatment response to antioxidant vitamins in some non-pregnant populations. We previously demonstrated that preeclampsia risk was doubled in white Hp 2-1 women, compared to Hp 1-1 women. Our objectives were to determine whether we could reproduce this finding in a larger cohort, and to determine whether Hp phenotype influences lack of efficacy of antioxidant vitamins in preventing preeclampsia and serious complications of pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH). This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in which 10,154 low-risk women received daily vitamin C and E, or placebo, from 9-16 weeks gestation until delivery. Hp phenotype was determined in the study prediction cohort (n = 2,393) and a case-control cohort (703 cases, 1,406 controls). The primary outcome was severe PAH, or mild or severe PAH with elevated liver enzymes, elevated serum creatinine, thrombocytopenia, eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, medically indicated preterm birth or perinatal death. Preeclampsia was a secondary outcome. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression. Sampling weights were used to reduce bias from an overrepresentation of women with preeclampsia or the primary outcome. There was no relationship between Hp phenotype and the primary outcome or preeclampsia in Hispanic, white/other or black women. Vitamin supplementation did not reduce the risk of the primary outcome or preeclampsia in women of any phenotype. Supplementation increased preeclampsia risk (odds ratio 3.30; 95% confidence interval 1.61–6.82, p<0.01) in Hispanic Hp 2-2 women. Hp phenotype does not influence preeclampsia risk, or identify a subset of women who may benefit from vitamin C and E supplementation to prevent preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2127490470,"Telling a lie takes longer than telling the truth but precisely why remains uncertain. We investigated two processes suggested to increase response times, namely the decision to lie and the construction of a lie response. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were directed or chose whether to lie or tell the truth. A colored square was presented and participants had to name either the true color of the square or lie about it by claiming it was a different color. In both experiments we found that there was a greater difference between lying and telling the truth when participants were directed to lie compared to when they chose to lie. In Experiments 3 and 4, we compared response times when participants had only one possible lie option to a choice of two or three possible options. There was a greater lying latency effect when questions involved more than one possible lie response. Experiment 5 examined response choice mechanisms through the manipulation of lie plausibility. Overall, results demonstrate several distinct mechanisms that contribute to additional processing requirements when individuals tell a lie."
https://openalex.org/W2047115828,"All spoken languages encode syllables and constrain their internal structure. But whether these restrictions concern the design of the language system, broadly, or speech, specifically, remains unknown. To address this question, here, we gauge the structure of signed syllables in American Sign Language (ASL). Like spoken languages, signed syllables must exhibit a single sonority/energy peak (i.e., movement). Four experiments examine whether this restriction is enforced by signers and nonsigners. We first show that Deaf ASL signers selectively apply sonority restrictions to syllables (but not morphemes) in novel ASL signs. We next examine whether this principle might further shape the representation of signed syllables by nonsigners. Absent any experience with ASL, nonsigners used movement to define syllable-like units. Moreover, the restriction on syllable structure constrained the capacity of nonsigners to learn from experience. Given brief practice that implicitly paired syllables with sonority peaks (i.e., movement)--a natural phonological constraint attested in every human language--nonsigners rapidly learned to selectively rely on movement to define syllables and they also learned to partly ignore it in the identification of morpheme-like units. Remarkably, nonsigners failed to learn an unnatural rule that defines syllables by handshape, suggesting they were unable to ignore movement in identifying syllables. These findings indicate that signed and spoken syllables are subject to a shared phonological restriction that constrains phonological learning in a new modality. These conclusions suggest the design of the phonological system is partly amodal."
https://openalex.org/W2017615072,"It is estimated that half of all proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells are transferred across or into at least one cellular membrane to reach their functional location. Protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical to the subsequent localization of secretory and transmembrane proteins. A vital component of the translocation machinery is the signal peptidase complex (SPC)--which is conserved from yeast to mammals--and functions to cleave the signal peptide sequence (SP) of secretory and membrane proteins entering the ER. Failure to cleave the SP, due to mutations that abolish the cleavage site or reduce SPC function, leads to the accumulation of uncleaved proteins in the ER that cannot be properly localized resulting in a wide range of defects depending on the protein(s) affected. Despite the obvious importance of the SPC, in vivo studies investigating its function in a multicellular organism have not been reported. The Drosophila SPC comprises four proteins: Spase18/21, Spase22/23, Spase25 and Spase12. Spc1p, the S. cerevisiae homolog of Spase12, is not required for SPC function or viability; Drosophila spase12 null alleles, however, are embryonic lethal. The data presented herein show that spase12 LOF clones disrupt development of all tissues tested including the eye, wing, leg, and antenna. In the eye, spase12 LOF clones result in a disorganized eye, defective cell differentiation, ectopic interommatidial bristles, and variations in support cell size, shape, number, and distribution. In addition, spase12 mosaic tissue is susceptible to melanotic mass formation suggesting that spase12 LOF activates immune response pathways. Together these data demonstrate that spase12 is an essential gene in Drosophila where it functions to mediate cell differentiation and development. This work represents the first reported in vivo analysis of a SPC component in a multicellular organism."
https://openalex.org/W2049507708,"Branching morphogenesis is a mechanism used by many species for organogenesis and tissue maintenance. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the sprouty protein family are believed to be critical regulators of branching morphogenesis. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of Sprouty-2 (SPRY2) in the mammary gland and study its role in branching morphogenesis. Human breast epithelial cells, breast tissue and mouse mammary glands were used for expression studies using immunoblotting, real rime PCR and immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of SPRY2 in the breast epithelial stem cell line D492 was done by lentiviral transduction of shRNA constructs targeting SPRY2. Three dimensional culture of D492 with or without endothelial cells was done in reconstituted basement membrane matrix. We show that in the human breast, SPRY2 is predominantly expressed in the luminal epithelial cells of both ducts and lobuli. In the mouse mammary gland, SPRY2 expression is low or absent in the virgin state, while in the pregnant mammary gland SPRY2 is expressed at branching epithelial buds with increased expression during lactation. This expression pattern is closely associated with the activation of the EGFR pathway. Using D492 which generates branching structures in three-dimensional (3D) culture, we show that SPRY2 expression is low during initiation of branching with subsequent increase throughout the branching process. Immunostaining locates expression of phosphorylated SPRY2 and EGFR at the tip of lobular-like, branching ends. SPRY2 knockdown (KD) resulted in increased migration, increased pERK and larger and more complex branching structures indicating a loss of negative feedback control during branching morphogenesis. In D492 co-cultures with endothelial cells, D492 SPRY2 KD generates spindle-like colonies that bear hallmarks of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These data indicate that SPRY2 is an important regulator of branching morphogenesis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the mammary gland."

All patients were screened for 19 polymorphisms in 9 candidate genes to evaluate their association with difficult asthma.The results indicated that LTA4H A-9188>G, TNFα G-308>A and IL-4Rα A1727>G polymorphisms were significantly associated with the development of difficult asthma in paediatric patients (p<0.001, p = 0.019 and p = 0.037, respectively). Haplotype analysis also revealed two haplotypes (ATA haplotype of IL-4Rα A1199>C, IL-4Rα T1570>C and IL-4Rα A1727>G and CA haplotype of TNFα C-863>A and TNFα G-308>A polymorphisms) which were significantly associated with difficult asthma in children (p = 0.04 and p = 0.018, respectively).The study revealed multiple SNPs and haplotypes in LTA4H, TNFα and IL4-Rα genes which constitute risk factors for the development of difficult asthma in children. Of particular interest is the LTA4H A-9188>G polymorphism which has been reported, for the first time, to have strong association with severe asthma in children. Our results suggest that screening for patients with this genetic marker could help characterise the heterogeneity of responses to leukotriene-modifying medications and, hence, facilitate targeting these therapies to the subset of patients who are most likely to gain benefit."
https://openalex.org/W1973736117,"Background Glucokinase (GCK) plays an important role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the liver, phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by GCK is the first step for both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. However, some vertebrate species are deficient in GCK activity in the liver, despite containing GCK genes that appear to be compatible with function in their genomes. Glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) is the most important post-transcriptional regulator of GCK in the liver; it participates in the modulation of GCK activity and location depending upon changes in glucose levels. In experimental models, loss of GCKR has been shown to associate with reduced hepatic GCK protein levels and activity. Methodology/Principal Findings GCKR genes and GCKR-like sequences were identified in the genomes of all vertebrate species with available genome sequences. The coding sequences of GCKR and GCKR-like genes were identified and aligned; base changes likely to disrupt coding potential or splicing were also identified. Conclusions/Significance GCKR genes could not be found in the genomes of 9 vertebrate species, including all birds. In addition, in multiple mammalian genomes, whereas GCKR-like gene sequences could be identified, these genes could not predict a functional protein. Vertebrate species that were previously reported to be deficient in hepatic GCK activity were found to have deleted (birds and lizard) or mutated (mammals) GCKR genes. Our results suggest that mutation of the GCKR gene leads to hepatic GCK deficiency due to the loss of the stabilizing effect of GCKR."
https://openalex.org/W2065052949,"Introduction Visualization of tumor angiogenesis using radionuclide targeting provides important diagnostic information. In previous study, we proved that an arginine-arginine-leucine (RRL) peptide should be a tumor endothelial cell specific binding sequence. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate whether 99mTc-radiolabeled RRL could be noninvasively used for imaging of malignant tumors in vivo, and act as a new molecular probe targeting tumor angiogenesis. Methods The RRL peptide was designed and radiosynthesized with 99mTc by a one-step method. The radiolabeling efficiency and radiochemical purity were then characterized in vitro. 99mTc-RRL was injected intravenously in HepG2 xenograft-bearing BALB/c nude mice. Biodistribution and in vivo imaging were performed periodically. The relationship between tumor size and %ID uptake of 99mTc-RRL was also explored. Results The labeling efficiencies of 99mTc-RRL reached 76.9%±4.5% (n = 6) within 30–60 min at room temperature, and the radiochemical purity exceeded 96% after purification. In vitro stability experiment revealed the radiolabeled peptide was stable. Biodistribution data showed that 99mTc-RRL rapidly cleared from the blood and predominantly accumulated in the kidneys and tumor. The specific uptake of 99mTc-RRL in tumor was significantly higher than that of unlabeled RRL blocking and free pertechnetate control test after injection (p<0.05). The ratio of the tumor-to-muscle exceeded 6.5, tumor-to-liver reached 1.98 and tumor-to-blood reached 1.95. In planar gamma imaging study, the tumors were imaged clearly at 2–6 h after injection of 99mTc-RRL, whereas the tumor was not imaged clearly in blocking group. The tumor-to-muscle ratio of images with 99mTc-RRL was comparable with that of 18F-FDG PET images. Immunohistochemical analysis verified the excessive vasculature of tumor. There was a linear relationship between the tumor size and uptake of 99mTc-RRL with R2 = 0.821. Conclusion 99mTc-RRL can be used as a potential candidate for visualization of tumor angiogenesis in malignant carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2083218018,"Lymph node (LN) vascular growth, at the level of the main arteriole, was recently characterized for the first time during infection. Arteriole diameter was shown to increase for at least seven days and to occur via a CD4(+) T cell dependent mechanism, with vascular expansion playing a critical role in regulating induction of adaptive immune response. Here, using intravital microscopy of the inguinal LN during herpes simplex type II (HSV-2) infection, the data provides the first studies that demonstrate arteriole expansion during infection is a reversible vascular event that occurs via eutrophic outward remodeling. Furthermore, using genetic ablation models, and pharmacological blockade, we reveal arteriole remodeling and LN hypertrophy to be dependent upon both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and TNFα expression. Additionally, we reveal transient changes in nitric oxide (NO) levels to be a notable feature of response to viral infection and LN vascular remodeling and provide evidence that mast cells are the critical source of TNFα required to drive arteriole remodeling. Overall, this study is the first to fully characterize LN arteriole vascular changes throughout the course of infection. It effectively reveals a novel role for NO and TNFα in LN cellularity and changes in LN vascularity, which represent key advances in understanding LN vascular physiology and adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1979449198,"While gene knockout technology can reveal the roles of proteins in cellular functions, including in mast cells, fetal death due to gene manipulation frequently interrupts experimental analysis. We generated mast cells from mouse fetal liver (FLMC), and compared the fundamental functions of FLMC with those of bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells (BMMC). Under electron microscopy, numerous small and electron-dense granules were observed in FLMC. In FLMC, the expression levels of a subunit of the FcεRI receptor and degranulation by IgE cross-linking were comparable with BMMC. By flow cytometry we observed surface expression of c-Kit prior to that of FcεRI on FLMC, although on BMMC the expression of c-Kit came after FcεRI. The surface expression levels of Sca-1 and c-Kit, a marker of putative mast cell precursors, were slightly different between bone marrow cells and fetal liver cells, suggesting that differentiation stage or cell type are not necessarily equivalent between both lineages. Moreover, this indicates that phenotypically similar mast cells may not have undergone an identical process of differentiation. By comprehensive analysis using the next generation sequencer, the same frequency of gene expression was observed for 98.6% of all transcripts in both cell types. These results indicate that FLMC could represent a new and useful tool for exploring mast cell differentiation, and may help to elucidate the roles of individual proteins in the function of mast cells where gene manipulation can induce embryonic lethality in the mid to late stages of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2014565898,"Background Previous studies have indicated that type 1 diabetes may have an infectious origin. The presence of temporal clustering—an irregular temporal distribution of cases—would provide additional evidence that occurrence may be linked with an agent that displays epidemicity. We tested for the presence and form of temporal clustering using population-based data from northeast England. Materials and Methods The study analysed data on children aged 0–14 years diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during the period 1990–2007 and resident in a defined geographical region of northeast England (Northumberland, Newcastle upon Tyne, and North Tyneside). Tests for temporal clustering by time of diagnosis were applied using a modified version of the Potthoff-Whittinghill method. Results The study analysed 468 cases of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. There was highly statistically significant evidence of temporal clustering over periods of a few months and over longer time intervals (p<0.001). The clustering within years did not show a consistent seasonal pattern. Conclusions The study adds to the growing body of literature that supports the involvement of infectious agents in the aetiology of type 1 diabetes in children. Specifically it suggests that the precipitating agent or agents involved might be an infection that occurs in “mini-epidemics”."
https://openalex.org/W1998536420,"Global levels of reactive nitrogen are predicted to rise in the coming decades as a result of increased deposition from the burning of fossil fuels and the large-scale conversion of nitrogen into a useable form for agriculture. Many plant communities respond strongly to increases in soil nitrogen, particularly in northern ecosystems where nitrogen levels are naturally very low. An experiment in northern Canada that was initiated in 1990 has been investigating the effects of long-term nutrient enrichment (fertilizer added annually) on a boreal forest understory community. We used this experiment to investigate why some species increase in abundance under nutrient enrichment whereas others decline. We focused on four species that differed in their responses to fertilization: Mertensia paniculata and Epilobium angustifolium increased in abundance, Achillea millefolium remained relatively constant and Festuca altaica declined. We hypothesized that the two species that were successful in the new high-nutrient, light-limited environment would be taller, have higher specific leaf area, change phenology by growing earlier in the season and be more morphologically plastic than their less successful counterparts. We compared plant height, specific leaf area, growth spurt date and allocation to leaves in plants grown in control and fertilized plots. We demonstrated that each of the two species that came to dominate fertilized plots has a different combination of traits and responses that likely gave them a competitive advantage; M. paniculata has the highest specific leaf area of the four species whereas E. angustifolium is tallest and exhibits morphological plasticity when fertilized by increasing biomass allocation to leaves. These results indicate that rather than one strategy determining success when nutrients become available, a variety of traits and responses may contribute to a species' ability to persist in a nutrient-enriched boreal forest understory."
https://openalex.org/W2090484868,"Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) -2 and -4 expression and TLR-induced cytokine response of inflammatory cells are related to atherogenesis and atherosclerotic plaque progression. We examined whether immediate TLR induced changes in CD11b and L-selectin (CD62L) expression are able to discriminate the presence and severity of atherosclerotic disease by exploring single dose whole blood TLR stimulation and detailed dose-response curves. Blood samples were obtained from 125 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 28 controls. CD11b and L-selectin expression on CD14+ monocytes was measured after whole blood stimulation with multiple concentrations of the TLR4 ligand LPS (0.01-10 ng/ml) and the TLR2 ligand P3C (0.5-500 ng/ml). Subsequently, dose-response curves were created and the following parameters were calculated: hillslope, EC50, area under the curve (AUC) and delta. These parameters provide information about the maximum response following activation, as well as the minimum trigger required to induce activation and the intensity of the response. CAD patients showed a significantly higher L-selectin, but not CD11b response to TLR ligation than controls after single dose stimulations as well as significant differences in the hillslope and EC50 of the dose-response curves. Within the CAD patient group, dose-response curves of L-selectin showed significant differences in the presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary occlusion and degree of stenosis, whereas CD11b expression had the strongest discriminating power after single dose stimulation. In conclusion, single dose stimulations and dose-response curves of CD11b and L-selectin expression after TLR stimulation provide diverse but limited information about atherosclerotic disease severity in stable angina patients. However, both single dose stimulation and dose-response curves of LPS-induced L-selectin expression can discriminate between controls and CAD patients."
