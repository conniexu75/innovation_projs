https://openalex.org/W2077612844,"Calorie restriction increases life span in many organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From a large-scale analysis of 564 single-gene-deletion strains of yeast, we identified 10 gene deletions that increase replicative life span. Six of these correspond to genes encoding components of the nutrient-responsive TOR and Sch9 pathways. Calorie restriction of tor1D or sch9D cells failed to further increase life span and, like calorie restriction, deletion of either SCH9 or TOR1 increased life span independent of the Sir2 histone deacetylase. We propose that the TOR and Sch9 kinases define a primary conduit through which excess nutrient intake limits longevity in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2024009242,"Interneurons of the cerebral cortex represent a heterogeneous population of cells with important roles in network function. At present, little is known about how these neurons are specified in the developing telencephalon. To explore whether this diversity is established in the early progenitor populations, we conducted in utero fate-mapping of the mouse medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE, respectively), from which most cortical interneurons arise. Mature interneuron subtypes were assessed by electrophysiological and immunological analysis, as well as by morphological reconstruction. At E13.5, the MGE gives rise to fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, whereas the CGE generates predominantly regular-spiking interneurons (RSNP). Later at E15.5, the CGE produces RSNP classes distinct from those generated from the E13.5 CGE. Thus, we provide evidence that the spatial and temporal origin of interneuron precursors in the developing telencephalic eminences predicts the intrinsic physiological properties of mature interneurons."

https://openalex.org/W2030092068,"Projection neurons (PNs) in the locust antennal lobe exhibit odor-specific dynamic responses. We studied a PN population, stimulated with five odorants and pulse durations between 0.3 and 10 s. Odor representations were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting 1-2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient, lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition, the PNs' own target neurons respond least when their PN-population input stabilized at a fixed point. Steady-state measures of activity thus seem inappropriate to understand the neural code in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2057823004,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) composed of ASIC1a subunit exhibit a high Ca2+ permeability and play important roles in synaptic plasticity and acid-induced cell death. Here, we show that ischemia enhances ASIC currents through the phosphorylation at Ser478 and Ser479 of ASIC1a, leading to exacerbated ischemic cell death. The phosphorylation is catalyzed by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, as a result of activation of NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) during ischemia. Furthermore, NR2B-specific antagonist, CaMKII inhibitor, or overexpression of mutated form of ASIC1a with Ser478 or Ser479 replaced by alanine (ASIC1a-S478A, ASIC1a-S479A) in cultured hippocampal neurons prevented ischemia-induced enhancement of ASIC currents, cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation, as well as neuronal death. Thus, NMDAR-CaMKII cascade is functionally coupled to ASICs and contributes to acidotoxicity during ischemia. Specific blockade of NMDAR/CaMKII-ASIC coupling may reduce neuronal death after ischemia and other pathological conditions involving excessive glutamate release and acidosis."

https://openalex.org/W2150172090,"The long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF) synapses onto Purkinje cells plays a central role in motor learning. Endocannabinoid release and LTD induction both depend upon activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1, require postsynaptic calcium increases, are synapse specific, and have a similar dependence on the associative activation of PF and climbing fiber synapses. These similarities suggest that endocannabinoid release could account for many features of cerebellar LTD. Here we show that LTD induction is blocked by a cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) antagonist, by inhibiting the synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), and is absent in mice lacking the CB1R. Although CB1Rs are prominently expressed presynaptically at PF synapses, LTD is expressed postsynaptically. In contrast, a previously described transient form of inhibition mediated by endocannabinoids is expressed presynaptically. This indicates that Purkinje cells release 2-AG that activates CB1Rs to both transiently inhibit release and induce a postsynaptic form of LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1968734935,"To hear a sequence of words and repeat them requires sensory-motor processing and something more—temporary storage. We investigated neural mechanisms of verbal memory by using fMRI and a task designed to tease apart perceptually based (“echoic”) memory from phonological-articulatory memory. Sets of two- or three-word pairs were presented bimodally, followed by a cue indicating from which modality (auditory or visual) items were to be retrieved and rehearsed over a delay. Although delay-period activation in the planum temporale (PT) was insensible to the source modality and showed sustained delay-period activity, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activated more vigorously when the retrieved items had arrived to the auditory modality and showed transient delay-period activity. Functional connectivity analysis revealed two topographically distinct fronto-temporal circuits, with STG coactivating more strongly with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and PT coactivating more strongly with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These argue for separate contributions of ventral and dorsal auditory streams in verbal working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2130984786,"Saliva of blood-sucking arthropods contains a complex and diverse mixture of antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory compounds. The D7 salivary family of proteins is abundantly expressed in blood-feeding Diptera and is distantly related to the odorant-binding protein superfamily. In mosquitoes, two subfamilies exist, the long and short D7 proteins. Ticks and kissing bugs evolved salivary lipocalins that act as efficient scavengers of biogenic amines, and a similar function was postulated for the D7 proteins. Accordingly, we expressed the five members of the small D7 family of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae and a D7 long form from Aedes aegypti and showed by isothermal microcalorimetry, a modified and very sensitive non-equilibrium chromatography/spectrum distortion method, and by smooth muscle bioassay that four of these five short D7 proteins and the D7 long form bind serotonin with high affinity, as well as histamine and norepinephrine. The nonbinding D7 protein is poorly expressed in the salivary glands and appears to be on the path to becoming a pseudogene. Scavenging of host amines would antagonize their vasoconstrictor, platelet-aggregating, and pain-inducing properties. It appears that counteracting biogenic amines is of strong adaptive value in the convergent evolution of arthropods to hematophagy. This adaptation has been solved independently in ticks, bugs, and mosquitoes by co-option of either member of the lipocalin or, as shown here, by the odorant-binding protein families.

This adaptation has been solved independently in ticks, bugs, and mosquitoes by co-option of either member of the lipocalin or, as shown here, by the odorant-binding protein families. At least 14 orders or families of arthropods (containing over 400 different genera and more than 15,000 species) independently evolved to feed on vertebrate blood (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). To accomplish this task, these animals evolved sophisticated cocktails of salivary pharmacologic reagents that affect blood clotting, platelet aggregation, vascular contraction, host immunity, inflammation, and angiogenesis. With the development of transcriptome analysis, the salivary compositional diversity of several hematophagous arthropods is being revealed at a fast pace; however, the majority of these proteins have no known function (2Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Among many different families of proteins unique to hematophagous arthropods, the D7 family has been recognized to be specifically expressed in the salivary glands of adult Diptera. These proteins are distant relatives of the odorant-binding protein superfamily, of which they are a distinct branch. In mosquitoes, two D7 subfamilies exist, the short family having molecular mass of 15–20 kDa and the long with 27–30 kDa, whereas sand flies appear to have only the long forms (3Valenzuela J.G.

Biol. 2002; 11: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). According to a recent sialotranscriptome analysis, Anopheles gambiae, the main African malaria vector, has three long and five short D7 proteins in chromosome arm 3R (6Arcà B. Lombardo F. Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M.B. Marinotti O. Coluzzi M. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 3971-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), arranged in an inverted tandem repeat. In the closely related mosquito Anopheles stephensi, one short D7 protein, named hamadarin, has been expressed and shown to have anticlotting activity (7Isawa H. Yuda M. Orito Y. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 13: 13Google Scholar). No other function has been described for the other protein members, which are so different as to have <40% amino acid identity to hamadarin. It has previously been hypothesized that the D7 proteins could function as scavengers of biogenic amines or other hemostasis agonists (5Arca B. Lombardo F. Lanfrancotti A. Spanos L. Veneri M. Louis C. Coluzzi M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as happens with the salivary lipocalins of ticks and kissing bugs (8Andersen J.F. Gudderra N.P. Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2005; 58: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Sangamnatdej S. Paesen G.C. Slovak M. Nuttall P.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this work, we expressed all five short D7 proteins of An. gambiae and one long D7 from Aedes aegypt and demonstrate that four of the short proteins, including the hamadarin homolog, avidly bind serotonin as well as histamine and norepinephrine (NE), 3The abbreviations used are: NE, norepinephrine; 5-HT, serotonin. as does the Aedes protein. The nonbinding D7, the last gene in the short D7 gene cluster, which has two instead of three exons, is poorly expressed in the salivary glands and appears to be on the way to becoming a pseudogene. It thus appears that scavenging biogenic amines has been of strong adaptive value in the evolution to hematophagy and that this has been solved independently in ticks, mosquitoes, and bugs by co-option of members of either the lipocalin or odorant-binding protein families. Mosquitoes and cDNA Preparation—Mosquitoes were reared in the National Institutes of Health Medical Entomology Section as described previously (10Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2429-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult female An. gambiae (Giles strain) were dissected at day 2–3 post-emergence to remove the salivary glands. Salivary glands (20 pairs) were dissected under a stereomicroscope in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, plus 150 mm NaCl and used immediately for total RNA extraction (TRIzol; Invitrogen) and cDNA synthesis (SuperScript™ RT; Invitrogen) following standard procedures. Expression and Purification of D7 Proteins in a Mammalian Expression System—PCR fragments coding for mature D7 proteins were amplified (Platinum Spermix; Invitrogen) from salivary gland cDNA using gene-specific primers as follows: D7rp1 forward 5′-aacacggttaagaagtgtgagaag-3′ and reverse 5′-ttagttgcaaatcttgtcatcgattt-3′; D7rp2 forward 5′-cgaaaggagtcaacggtggagg-3′ and reverse 5′-ctagcacaaaccatcatcgatttcc-3′; D7rp3 forward 5′-agacaagaggaaacggttgaagaatgc-3′ and reverse 5′-tcagttacacagcccatcatcaa-3′; D7rp4 forward 5′-gagactgtgcaagattgtgagaat-3′ and reverse 5′-tcagcagtttaatgccttatcataatc-3′; D7rp5 forward 5′-gtgagtgattgtgtgaggcatg-3′ and reverse 5′-ttagcaccgtaactgactgttcaac-3′. The PCR-amplified products were cloned into VR2001-TOPO vector (modified version of the VR1020 vector; Vical Inc., San Diego, CA) and their sequences and orientation verified by DNA sequencing (DTCS Quick Start kit; Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Recombinant proteins were produced by transfecting FreeStyle™ 293-F cells (Invitrogen) with 30 μg of purified VR2001-D7rp plasmids following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). After 72 h, transfected cell cultures were harvested and the supernatant (containing secreted D7 recombinant proteins) concentrated 60-fold in AmiconR Ultra-15 (10 kDa MWCO; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Recombinant D7 protein separation was carried out in two-step high pressure liquid chromatography purification using a Spectra System P400 pump in conjunction with a dual-wavelength UV-visible detector model SM4100 (Thermo Separation Products, Riviera Beach, FL). Briefly, recombinant D7 recombinant proteins were loaded on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractions eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions corresponding to 15–20-kDa range from the gel filtration chromatography were loaded on a C18 analytic column (Vydac™, 1 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution of D7 recombinant proteins was performed with a linear gradient of 10–80% acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a 0.1 ml/min flow rate. Fractions were vacuum dried and reconstituted in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. See supplement for additional data. Bacterial Protein Expression and Purification—cDNA for D7r1, D7r2, D7r3, D7r4, and D7r5 were obtained from an An. gambiae cDNA library and were modified by PCR methods so that the mature proteins (signal peptide as predicted with SignalP removed) all obtained an N-terminal NdeI and a C-terminal XhoI restriction site. The NdeI site added a 5′-methionine codon to all sequences that acts as start codon in the bacterial expression system, whereas the XhoI site was incorporated after the stop codon to facilitate directional cloning into the pET17b expression vector. PCR products were first cloned into the TOPO 2.1 vector and sequences confirmed before moving into the pET 17b vector by subcloning. pET 17b constructs were again confirmed before transformation of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys-E. For recombinant protein production, 50 ml of Luria Bertani broth (with added chloramphenicol and carbenicilin) was inoculated with a single colony and grown overnight (maximum of 16 h). Luria Bertani broth (1 liter, with added chloramphenicol and carbenicilin) was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until an optical density of 0.6–0.8 was reached before isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) was added to induce expression. The flask was shaken for 3 h under the same conditions; cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before the cell pellet was frozen and stored until use. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and cells disrupted using a probe sonicator before collecting the inclusion bodies by centrifugation. Inclusion bodies were extracted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100 for 3 h followed by centrifugation. The remaining pellet was washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before solubilization in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The solubilized material was diluted into 1 liter of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.4 m arginine monohydrochloride and incubated overnight. Protein was bulk precipitated using saturated ammonium sulfate, and the resultant precipitate was collected by filtration. The filtrate was solubilized in 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and further concentrated by ultrafiltration. Samples were then purified using size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-100 (16/60 column; Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 mm NaCl. D7r2, D7r3, D7r4, and D7r5 were also subjected to another round of purification using anion exchange with a mono-Q column. Most of the D7 short proteins gave appreciable levels of expression in an E. coli expression system, with final yields of purified protein being 1.1, 3.5, 2.7, and 3.2 mg for D7r2, D7r3, D7r4, and D7r5, respectively. D7r1, the ortholog of hamadarin, showed signs of cytotoxicity, as cell growth was halted after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Expression of D7r1 was scaled up to 3-liter cultures, and the final yield obtained was 274 μg. Purity and the correct identity of the preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing (See supplement for additional data). Spectral Distortion/Size-exclusion Chromatography Experiments—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed with a 4.6 × 300-mm Super SW2000 column obtained from Tosoh Bioscience (Montgomeryville, PA), eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at either 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 ml/min. Recombinant proteins (10 μg) were injected in each run, either preincubated with 100 μm serotonin chloride or not. The eluate was monitored by a scanning light-absorbance detector (Model SPD-M10AV; Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD). The absorbance data were exported to an Excel spreadsheet and normalized by zeroing the absorbance value at 320 nm and setting to 1 the maximum value observed between 320 and 240 nm. An average of three-five experiments was used to compare spectra of native or serotonin-treated recombinant protein. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Northhampton, MA). Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and dialysis buffer was used to prepare all ligands tested. All solutions were degassed under vacuum for 5 min before use. Cell concentrations between 0.75 and 3.0 μm protein were used, and ligand concentrations from 7.5–30 μm were used in the syringe. Aliquots (10 μl) were injected every 120 s, and the syringe was stirred at 290 rpm while measuring heat of binding at 30 °C. After subtraction of the heats of dilution, the net enthalpy data were analyzed with a single binding model using the Microcal Origin software package. Anticlotting Measurements—These were obtained by measuring either the recalcification time as described before (11Ribeiro J.M.C. Schneider M. Guimaraes J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time as supplied by the ALEXIN LS kit (Sigma Diagnostics). Sample (10 μl) and normal (50 μl) plasma was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before adding ALEXIN LS (50 μl) and incubating for a further 5 min. Clotting was induced with 50 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 and measured at 650 nm every 11 s with shaking before and after each reading step. Clotting time was measured at ∼50% of the control clot absorbance. Smooth Muscle Bioassays—The guinea pig ileum contractions to histamine and the rat uterus contractions to serotonin were measured isotonically, and the rat aortic ring preparation contractures elicited by NE were measured isometrically. A modified Tyrode solution (with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) was used for the ileum and aortic assays (12Webster M. Prado E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 681-699Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and low calcium HEPES-buffered solution was used for the uterus assay (13Gaddum J.H. Hameed K.A. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1949; 108: 240-248Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All solutions were kept oxygenated by bubbling air. Uncovering of the An. gambiae genome (14Holt R.A. Subramanian G.M.

Science. 2002; 298: 129-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar) and random sequencing of 3,000 clones of a salivary gland cDNA library from adult female mosquitoes identified three long and five short D7 proteins on chromosome 3R, arranged as an inverted tandem repeat (Fig. 1; modified from Ref. 6Arcà B. Lombardo F. Valenzuela J.G. Francischetti I.M.B. Marinotti O. Coluzzi M. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 3971-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These genes were abundantly expressed in adult female salivary glands except for the last sequence on each cassette (in the transcription order), which had one less exon/intron. No expression of these genes was found in adult male salivary glands when 1,500 randomly picked clones from a cDNA library were sequenced, 4E. Calvo and J. Riberro, unpublished data. confirming the sex-specific nature of this gene family as previously described (5Arca B. Lombardo F. Lanfrancotti A. Spanos L. Veneri M. Louis C. Coluzzi M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because male mosquitoes do not feed on blood, these salivary proteins must be associated with a blood-feeding function. The An. gambiae homolog of hamadarin (7Isawa H. Yuda M. Orito Y. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 13: 13Google Scholar), the salivary anticlotting and bradykinin production inhibitory protein from An. stephensi, is the first sequence on the short D7 cassette, named D7r1, to which it shares 58% identity. To study the function of the short D7 proteins, these were expressed in a eukaryotic cell expression system. To investigate whether the short D7 proteins could bind serotonin (5-HT), we incubated 10 μg of protein in 10 μl with 0.1 mm 5-HT and injected the mixture into a molecular sieving column. Because UV absorption of proteins in the 250–300-nm region is dominated by tyrosine and tryptophane residues and because Tyr has an absorption spectrum skewed to the UV region when compared with Trp, we expected that tight binding of one serotonin to the protein would cause an increase in the absorbance in the longer region of the UV spectrum and a relative decrease in the shorter region of the spectrum. D7r1 was not assayed because it did not elute from the column under the conditions used. This is the only basic short D7 protein (pI, 9.2), and basic proteins are known to bind to silica-based columns (15Schluter H. Zidek W. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 639: 17-22Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preincubation of proteins D7r2, D7r3, and D7r4 with 5-HT led to a significant distortion of the spectrum in the mode predicted (p <0.01 when the average change of spectrum at 300 nm was compared with that at 250 nm) (Fig. 2), whereas the D7r5 spectrum was not affected by 5-HT. The smaller spectral distortion seen in D7r4 compared with the other two proteins can be attributed to the presence of seven Tyr residues in the mature molecule, compared with three on the other proteins. The spectral distortion did not change with flow rates of 0.1–0.4 ml/min leading to retention times (e.g. separation of free 5-HT from protein) of 7–28 min, indicating that the Koff of the complexes were well above these values. Such values are seen with dissociation constants of the order of nm to pm range, indicating a very tight association of these D7 proteins with 5-HT. To further characterize the biology of the short D7 proteins, these were expressed in a bacterial system that produces more protein necessary for microcalorimetric binding studies (on the mg protein range). We also succeeded in expressing Ae. aegypti D7 protein (NCBI accession number P18153) in high yields by the eukaryotic expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that all short D7 proteins except D7r5 bind serotonin and histamine, and some also bind NE and epinephrine (Fig. 3; Table 1), whereas the Aedes long D7 protein bound all amines. In all cases, stoichiometries of 0.6–1 were obtained, suggesting a single binding site for all ligands tested. Results of competition experiments using serotonin at saturated concentrations of histamine suggested that all ligands bind to the same site (results not shown). The binding affinities calculated for a one-binding site model indicated that serotonin is bound with highest affinity (Kd values in the low nm range) by all the D7-related proteins. NE is bound with second highest affinity by D7r2 and D7r3, with Kd values also in the low nm range. Significant differences between the D7-related proteins could, however, be distinguished, with D7r1 not binding NE at all and D7r4 binding with relatively low affinity (Kd ∼650 nm) that suggested that NE binding would not be physiologically significant. Histamine was bound by all four D7-related proteins and the Aedes long D7 with comparable affinities (Kd ∼40–140 nm), suggesting that this would be physiologically significant. Significant differences appeared again with epinephrine binding, where D7r1 and D7r4 did not bind this ligand at detectable levels, whereas D7r2 and D7r3 showed Kd values comparable with those found for histamine.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for binding of biogenic amines to mosquito D7 proteins obtained from isothermal calorimetery analysisStoichiometryKdΔHTΔSnmKcal/molKcal/molSerotoninD7r10.7831.99 ± 0.398-33.3 ± 0.36-21.31D7r20.8282.93 ± 0.586-27.1 ± 0.20-15.27D7r30.6420.16 ± 0.074-22.1 ± 0.11-8.57D7r40.8640.93 ± 0.316-20.2 ± 0.14-7.73AeD7L1.3100.39 ± 0.565-11.7 ± 0.211.33NorepinephrineD7r20.8492.84 ± 0.79-21.8 ± 0.23-10.00D7r30.6503.19 ± 0.70-17.7 ± 0.15-5.91D7r40.907645 ± 75-11.6 ± 0.45-3.03AeD7L0.9250.119 ± 0.05-16.2 ± 0.21-3.85HistamineD7r10.793103 ± 15-28.5 ± 1.24-18.88D7r20.72990 ± 7-24.4 ± 0.26-14.64D7r30.63141 ± 6-20.0 ± 0.29-9.76D7r40.806111 ± 9-19.0 ± 0.21-9.39AeD7L0.647140 ± 47-9.5 ± 0.680.003EpinephrineD7r20.70264 ± 6-18.9 ± 0.23-8.97D7r30.713312 ± 36-14.3 ± 0.40-5.27AeD7L0.792102 ± 13-11.1 ± 0.23-1.45 Open table in a new tab Microcalorimetric measurements of the binding affinities of short D7 proteins to biogenic amines indicated that they would be able to remove the amines from their vertebrate receptors if supplied in sufficient amounts, because receptor affinities for these biogenic amines are on the order of 2–3 orders of magnitude lower (10–7-10–6 m). Accordingly, we tested the ability of short D7 proteins to antagonize the contractions of the rat uterus to serotonin, of the guinea pig ileum to histamine, and of the rat aorta to NE (D7r1 was only tested in the rat uterus assay due to lack of enough recombinant protein). Results (Fig. 4) indicated that D7r2, D7r3, and D7r4 were effective inhibitors of histamine and serotonin in smooth muscle preparations, whereas only D7r2 and D7r3 were strong inhibitors of NE (Fig. 4). D7r4 gave a partial inhibition of the NE contraction when added at a concentration of 1.5 μm (when NE was added to the aortic ring at 0.5 μm), and D7r5 was inactive at 1.5 μm (results not shown). The Aedes long D7 protein also efficiently counteracted contraction of NE in the rat aortic ring (Fig. 4C). Smooth muscle bioassays thus correlated as expected with the binding affinities measured by microcalorimetric measurements. When the recombinant short D7 proteins of Anopheles were tested for their anticlotting effect, only D7r1, the ortholog of hamadarin, showed significant inhibition of the activated partial thromboplastin time test, with an activity comparable with that observed for the An. stephensi protein (∼40% prolongation of clotting time compared with the control at concentrations of ∼145 nm) (7Isawa H. Yuda M. Orito Y. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 13: 13Google Scholar). The other D7-related proteins showed no inhibition at concentrations 10–30 times higher than that used for D7r1 (Fig. 5). D7 proteins are among the most abundantly expressed salivary proteins recovered from SDS-PAGE gels (10Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp.

Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), this nonenzymatic, nonreceptormediated way of antagonizing hemostasis needs large amounts of the binding protein, which would presumably have to achieve a concentration of 0.2–2 μm (the normal receptor saturating concentration of endogenous physiologic mediators such as histamine, serotonin, or ADP) or between 0.003 and 0.03 μg/μl of protein at the feeding wound site for the short D7 proteins, assuming stoichiometric binding and an average molecular mass of 15 kDa. This contrasts with the activity of compounds that bind to cellular receptors such as the salivary vasodilatory maxadilan, which is active at nanomolar concentrations (21Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), or with enzymatic inhibitors such as apyrase that are active at subnanomolar quantities (22Ribeiro J.M.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that between 0.003 and 0.03 μg/μl of short D7 proteins are needed for their effective function and that the feeding lesion would have an effective volume of 10 μl, then 0.03–0.3 μg of the protein is required to mop local biogenic amines. Considering that mosquito salivary glands have a protein content of 1–3 μg and that half of the protein is discharged during a blood meal (23Marinotti O. James A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J.

Synaptotagmin 1 functions as a Ca(2+) sensor for synchronous release, but its role in asynchronous release remains unclear. We now show that in cultured cortical neurons stimulated at low frequency (<or.1 Hz), deletion of synaptotagmin 1 blocks synchronous GABA and glutamate release without significantly increasing asynchronous release. At higher stimulation frequencies (>or Hz), deletion of synaptotagmin 1 also alters only synchronous, not asynchronous, release during the stimulus train, but dramatically enhances ""delayed asynchronous release"" following the stimulus train. Thus synaptotagmin 1 functions as an autonomous Ca(2+) sensor independent of asynchronous release during isolated action potentials and action potential trains, but restricts asynchronous release induced by residual Ca(2+) after action potential trains. We propose that synaptotagmin 1 occupies release ""slots"" at the active zone, possibly in a Ca(2+)-independent complex with SNARE proteins that are freed when action potential-induced Ca(2+) influx activates synaptotagmin 1."

https://openalex.org/W1983115827,"Complement is a powerful host defense system that contributes to both innate and acquired immunity. There are three pathways of complement activation, the classical pathway, lectin pathway, and alternative pathway. Each generates a C3 convertase, a serine protease that cleaves the central complement protein, C3. Nearly all the biological consequences of complement are dependent on the resulting cleavage products. Properdin is a positive regulator of complement activation that stabilizes the alternative pathway convertases (C3bBb). Properdin is composed of multiple identical protein subunits, with each subunit carrying a separate ligand-binding site. Previous reports suggest that properdin function depends on multiple interactions between its subunits with its ligands. In this study I used surface plasmon resonance assays to examine properdin interactions with C3b and factor B. I demonstrated that properdin promotes the association of C3b with factor B and provides a focal point for the assembly of C3bBb on a surface. I also found that properdin binds to preformed alternative pathway C3 convertases. These findings support a model in which properdin, bound to a target surface via C3b, iC3b, or other ligands, can use its unoccupied C3b-binding sites as receptors for nascent C3b, bystander C3b, or pre-formed C3bB and C3bBb complexes. New C3bP and C3bBP intermediates can lead to in situ assembly of C3bBbP. The full stabilizing effect of properdin on C3bBb would be attained as properdin binds more than one ligand at a time, forming a lattice of properdin: ligand interactions bound to a surface scaffold.

The full stabilizing effect of properdin on C3bBb would be attained as properdin binds more than one ligand at a time, forming a lattice of properdin: ligand interactions bound to a surface scaffold. The complement system contributes to both innate and acquired immunity (1Volanakis J.E. Cooper M.D. Koprowski H. Interface between Innate and Acquired Immunity. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2002: 41-56Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that complement has additional biological roles, participating in tissue regeneration (2Mastellos D. Lambris J. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 485-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in sperm: egg recognition (3Riley-Vargas R.C. Gill D.B. Kemper C. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 496-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There are three pathways of complement activation (4Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-32Crossref Google Scholar), the classical pathway (CP), 2The abbreviations used are: CP, classical pathway; LP, lectin pathway; AP, alternative pathway; DAF, decay acceleration factor; CR1, complement receptor 1; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; NHS, N-hydroxyl succinimide; EDC, ethyl diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide; RUs, resonance units; CR, complement receptor; MCP, membrane cofactor protein. lectin pathway (LP), and alternative pathway (AP). Although each pathway is induced by a different set of activators, all three pathways lead to the enzymatic cleavage of C3. That step is catalyzed by the C3 convertases. Two homologous C3 convertases occur, one generated by the AP and the other by the CP and LP. Both convertases are serine proteases that cleave C3 at a single site, generating C3a and C3b. Nascent C3b covalently binds to macromolecules, immune complexes, and cell surfaces, where it promotes immune adherence and phagocytosis or membrane lysis, and C3a directs proinflammatory and vasoactive reactions. The AP presents a unique role in the complement activation cascade. Because it is activated by C3b, its own product, it functions as a positive feedback loop, producing a rapid and vigorous local response. Through C3b, the AP also amplifies activation initially triggered by the CP and LP. The first step in the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase is the association of factor B (a zymogen) with C3b in the presence of Mg2+ (4Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-32Crossref Google Scholar). Once bound to C3b, factor B is cleaved by the serine protease factor D, producing the Ba and Bb fragments. Ba dissociates from the complex while Bb and the cation remain bound to C3b, forming the active AP C3 convertase, C3bBb. The C3 convertases are serine proteases that cleave only C3. Nascent C3b (C3b*) generated by convertase activity binds to a target surface or water molecule via reaction of its metastable thioester moiety. That reaction takes place within ∼60 μs of cleavage, and during that time C3b* can diffuse up to 30 nm before it becomes covalently bound to a target (5Sim R.B. Twose T.M. Paterson D.S. Sim E. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). C3b can also bind the C3 convertase, forming the C5 convertase, C3bBbC3b. C5 convertase activity leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex. The C3 convertases are deactivated upon spontaneous dissociation or by facilitated dissociation (decay acceleration) mediated by the regulators of complement activation proteins decay acceleration factor (DAF), complement receptor one (CR1), C4b-binding protein, and factor H (6Hourcade D. Holers V.M. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 45: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 7Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 149-166Google Scholar). Convertase assembly is suppressed by the proteolytic cleavage of C3b (and C4b) as mediated by factor I in the presence of membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), C4b-binding protein, CR1, or factor H (6Hourcade D.

These negative control processes are essential for the protection of self-tissue from C-mediated damage and for the prevention of unregulated C3 turnover and depletion. Properdin is the only known naturally occurring positive regulator of complement activation (8Schwaeble W.J. Reid K.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 17-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Individuals deficient for properdin are prone to lethal pyogenic (especially neisserial) infections (9Braconier J.H. Sjoholm A.G. Soderstrom C. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 15: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Densen P. Weiler J.M. Griffiss J.M. Hoffmann L.G. N. Engl. J.

Properdin increases the stability of the AP convertases 10-fold on target surfaces and immune complexes (12Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and inhibits the factor H-mediated cleavage of C3b by factor I (13Medicus R.G. Gotze O. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1076-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We want to understand how properdin influences the AP convertase, and in particular how it directs AP activation to surface targets. Native properdin occurs in head-to-tail dimers, trimers, and tetramers in the fixed ratio of 22:52:28 (14Smith C.A. Pangburn M.K. Vogel C.W. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4582-4588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The higher oligomers have greater C-regulatory activity (14Smith C.A. Pangburn M.K. Vogel C.W. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4582-4588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, Farries et al. (15Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that properdin has a greater affinity for cell-bound C3bB and cell-bound C3bBb than for cell-bound C3b. Moreover, they offered a model for properdin; convertase interactions based on the multivalent nature of properdin:ligand associations (15Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, I used surface plasmon resonance-based assays to examine properdin interactions with C3b and factor B. I demonstrated that properdin accelerates the association of C3b with factor B and provides a focal point for the assembly of C3bBb on a surface. I also observed that properdin binds preformed AP C3 convertases. These findings support a model in which properdin, bound to a target surface via C3b, iC3b, or other ligands, can use its unoccupied C3b-binding sites as receptors for nascent C3b, bystander C3b, or preformed C3bB and C3bBb complexes. Further C3bBb is formed from the new C3bP and C3bBP intermediates. This model accounts for the capacity of properdin to direct C activation to surface targets. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methodology provides a sensitive real time measure of protein: protein interactions (16Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). SPR analysis was conducted with a BIAcore 2000 instrument and the manufacturer's software package (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore catalog number BR-1000-14) were used throughout with Mg2+-HEPES running buffer (filtered and degassed 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Kinetic values were obtained using the manufacturer's software. BIAcore flow paths were activated with a fresh 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxyl succinimide and 0.2 m ethyl diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide injected at 5 ml/min for 7 min. Complement proteins were then covalently attached to the activated surface. Properdin, C3b, or iC3b (10 μg/ml in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.8) was injected in the experimental flow path, at 10 μl/min for 3-7 min followed by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, at 5 μl/min for 7 min. A control flow path was produced as above but without protein in the buffer. Combinations of purified complement proteins in running buffer (or running buffer alone to observe protein dissociation) were injected at 30 μl/min for varying times. Output was expressed in resonance units (RUs). Changes in RUs, indicative of changes in mass bound to the biosensor surface, were expressed as the difference between the experimental and control flow paths. Because RUs are linear units, quantitation of ligand binding can be calculated directly from changes in RUs. Non-covalently bound protein was stripped from the properdin-coated surface with a 20-s pulse of 5 m NaCl. N-Hydroxyl succinimide, ethyl diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, and ethanolamine solutions were purchased from BIAcore and stored at -20 °C. Proteins—Native human complement proteins (properdin, C3b, iC3b, factor B, Bb, factor H, and factor D) were obtained from Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego, CA. Soluble DAF, CPPs 2-4, which carries the active site of DAF, was a gift of Dr. Feng Lin of Case Western University. Impact of Properdin on the Association of Factor B with C3b-coated Biosensor Surfaces—The impact of properdin on C3bBb stability has long been appreciated (12Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). C3bBb has a half-life of ∼2-3 min at 37° C. Properdin extends that half-life 10-fold. Previous biochemical studies also suggest that properdin can promote C3b:B association (17DiScipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 485-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility further, we examined the association of factor B with surface-bound C3b in the presence or absence of properdin. Each SPR biosensor is composed of a series of up to four activated surfaces. Injected fluids flow over each surface in rapid succession. C3b was covalently attached to two flow path surfaces. Subsequently, properdin was bound to one of the two surfaces via non-covalent association with C3b. The properdin:C3b association was relatively stable (t1/2 of 23 min) and likely involved concomitant attachment of polyvalent properdin to multiple C3b ligands. The C3b-coated and the C3bP-coated surfaces were simultaneously treated with fluid phase factor B, and the generation of C3bB and C3bBbP was examined. As shown in Fig. 1, 5-fold more C3bBP than C3bB accumulated during the treatment period. These results suggest that C3bP could be an important intermediate in the formation of AP convertases. Interactions of AP Proteins with a Properdin-coated Biosensor Surface—I next used SPR to investigate the monovalent binding of properdin to C3b, C3bB, and C3bBb (Fig. 2A). Properdin was covalently attached to a biosensor surface and treated with a succession of protein mixtures in Mg2+-HEPES buffer for 60 s followed by Mg2+-HEPES buffer alone. The biosensor was injected with C3b, factor B, Bb, or factor D. Small amounts of C3b (less than 10 RUs) bound the properdin-coated surface. No factor B, Bb, or factor D binding was detected (not shown). In contrast, a mixture of C3b and factor B resulted in a substantial increase in signal to ∼25 RUs, or several times the sum of each component alone. This is best explained by the formation of a C3bBP complex on the biosensor surface. The mixture of C3b, factor B, and factor D together led to much greater signal (200 RUs), which was sensitive to factor H and DAF (Fig. 2B), and thus identified as C3bBbP. These results can be explained by two different mechanisms. 1) C3bB and C3bBb were assembling in the fluid phase prior to their association with properdin on the biosensor surface, and 2) C3b associated with the surface-bound properdin and the resulting C3bP intermediates provided sites for in situ C3bBP and C3bBbP assembly. Experiments were performed to determine whether surface-bound properdin can provide new sites for C3bBb formation. The properdin-coated biosensor was first treated with relatively high concentrations of C3b [50 μg/ml], and C3bP complexes were formed. This was quickly followed with either a factor B/factor D mixture or factor B alone. As seen in Fig. 3A, addition of a mixture of factor B and factor D to C3bP results in a complex with greater stability than C3bP that is sensitive to DAF (C3bBbP). Addition of factor B alone to the C3bP complexes (Fig. 3B) results in a complex that is resistant to DAF (C3bBP). These experiments demonstrate the in situ assembly of C3bBbP from C3bP and C3bBP intermediates on the properdin-coated biosensor surface. Experiments were next designed to determine whether preformed convertase would bind to the properdin-coated biosensor surface. The strategy was to allow C3bBb to form prior to injection and then block assembly of new C3bBb thereafter with the anti-human factor B mAb 14-III-03. This mAb is a mouse anti-human factor B that inhibits the assembly of human C3bBb (18Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It does not affect preformed C3bBb because it binds to the Ba portion of factor B, a region released during C3bBb formation. Thus, in one case C3b, factor B, and factor D were preincubated together in Mg2+-HEPES buffer for 3 min to allow for C3bBb assembly and treated with anti-Ba mAb just prior to injection into the biosensor. In a second case, factor B was first treated in buffer with mAb for 3 min, and C3b and factor D were added to the mixture just prior to injection. In the third case, C3b, factor B and factor D were mixed together in buffer and preincubated for 3 min prior to injection (no mAb). It takes ∼2 additional min for the mixtures to reach the flow cells after injection. The results (Fig. 4) show that anti-Ba mAb of factor B treatment prior to the preincubation period suppresses the formation of properdin C3bBb complexes. However, after the 3-min incubation, anti-Ba treatment does not suppress the formation of C3bBb-properdin complexes. This experiment demonstrated that preformed fluid phase C3bBb binds surface-bound properdin. Interactions of AP Proteins with iC3b-coated Biosensor Surfaces—I wished to test whether a single properdin protein could first bind to a surface ligand via one active site and then promote the assembly of C3bBb at an adjacent subunit. Properdin is also known to bind iC3b (19Lambris J.D. Alsenz J. Schultz T.F. Dierich M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a fragment generated from C3b through cleavage by factor I in the presence of cofactors MCP or factor H. Unlike C3b, iC3b is unable to directly participate in convertase formation with factor B and factor D. Thus, if the C3bBb complex were assembled on an iC3bP-coated surface, it would by necessity be assembled by virtue of a direct association with properdin, not iC3b. A biosensor surface was coated with iC3b, another with iC3b subsequently bound non-covalently with properdin (t1/2 of 30 min), and a third surface was coated with C3b. Complement components were injected simultaneously over these three surfaces and the control surface (Fig. 5). When factor B and factor D were added together, as expected, a complex formed on the C3b-coated surface (20Harris C.L. Abbott R.J.M. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The complex was shown to be C3bBb because it was sensitive to DAF. No complex was formed on the iC3b and the iC3bP coated biosensors, because neither carried the necessary C3b subunit. In contrast, when a mixture of C3b, factor B, and factor D was injected together, a complex was formed on the iC3bP surface. Again, the complex was determined to be C3bBb, as it was sensitive to DAF. A complex was not formed on the iC3b-coated surface, because properdin was not present. These experiments demonstrate that properdin bound to a surface by one ligand-binding site promotes convertase assembly at ligand-binding sites of adjoining subunits. Properdin is a positive regulator of the alternative pathway convertases. Its capacity to stabilize AP has been long known (12Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In this report I used SPR technology to demonstrate that properdin can also accelerate convertase assembly by several mechanisms. 1) Properdin bound to C3b promotes subsequent association of C3b with factor B. 2) Properdin bound to a C3b-coated target surface through one subunit can provide, through its other subunits, receptors for nascent and bystander C3b, preformed C3bB, and preformed C3bBb. C3bP and C3bBP intermediates can then fully assemble to C3bBb in situ. 3) Properdin bound to an iC3b-coated target surface can provide receptor sites for C3bBb formation. Previous models have properdin bind to a pre-existing cluster of surface-bound C3b (15Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our findings support a new model in which properdin first binds to a surface ligand (C3b, iC3b, C3bB, or C3bBb) via one of its subunits and then promotes the assembly of further C3bBb at the ligand-binding sites of its adjoining subunits (Fig. 6). The full stabilizing effect of properdin on C3bBb would be attained when properdin binds more than one ligand at a time, with some of those ligands (i.e. C3b) covalently attached to the surface. A lattice of properdin:ligand interactions supported by C3b- or iC3b-dependent covalent bonds to a surface scaffold is more strongly stabilized than each isolated C3bP interaction. Consistent with the model, although not directly supported by the experiments in this study, nascent C3b bound to a target via properdin might be advantageously positioned to form a covalent bond with the target surface. Using surface-bound C3b, I determined that factor B binds C3bP better than it binds C3b (Fig. 1). Using surface-bound properdin, I found that properdin binds C3bB and C3bBb better than it binds C3b (Fig. 2A). Two simple explanations could account for these observations. 1) The C3bBP and C3bBbP complexes are more stable than C3bP, C3bB, or C3bBb because in the trimolecular complexes, properdin binds directly with factor B and Bb in addition to C3b (21Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 2) C3b may take on two different conformations, one conformation that binds both factor B and properdin with relatively high affinity and a second conformation that binds both proteins with relatively low affinity. By this view, association of properdin or factor B with C3b would partially stabilize its high affinity binding conformation, thus promoting association of C3bB with properdin or of C3bP with factor B. The results of this study have several other interesting implications. First, properdin is a potent complement activator that binds to surface ligands, creating new sites for C3bBb generation. This process is possible because the multiple properdin subunits work together. Although it is known that properdin binds to C3b and iC3b (19Lambris J.D. Alsenz J. Schultz T.F. Dierich M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), products of an ongoing complement response, properdin is also known to bind sulfatides (sulfated glycosphingolipids (22Holt G.D. Pangburn M.K. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2852-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These or other ligands could be the basis for the antibody-independent initiation of the AP on certain target surfaces (see Ref. 23Pillemer L. Blum L. Lepow I.H. Ross O.A. Todd E.W. Wardlaw A.C. Science. 1954; 120: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Second, properdin could be useful in the immunotherapeutic targeting of complement activation to the surfaces of harmful agents. Thus, a bifunctional agent composed of a targeting element and a properdin sequence could bind a cell or viral surface site and activate complement at that site. Vuagnat et al. (24Vuagnat B.B. Mach J. Le Doussal J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrate that a cell surface that expresses a transmembrane form of properdin can activate the AP. Their result suggests that a properdin-dependent targeting strategy may be feasible. Third, iC3b is a degradative product of C3b that interacts with complement receptor 3 (CR3) and complement receptor 4 (CR4) on macrophages during phagocytosis (25Berger M. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 285-308Crossref Google Scholar). Previously, it was thought that C activation ceased once C3b was converted to iC3b. The results presented here indicate that iC3b can have a continued role in complement activation, through its affinity for properdin. As with C3b, this activity would occur on a surface. This model would make the stability of surface-bound iC3b a critical parameter for complement activation/regulation. iC3b is degraded to C3dg and C3c by factor I in the presence of the regulator CR1. The resulting surface-bound C3dg fragments do not bind properdin and so cannot promote further complement activation. If iC3b is not processed to C3dg efficiently, the accumulation of iC3b on a cell surface could limit cell lifespan or contribute to pathogenesis.

The role of properdin and its ligands in these and other cases should be reevaluated. In summary, I used SPR to examine properdin interactions with C3b and factor B. I demonstrated that properdin accelerates the association of C3b with factor B and provides a focal point for the assembly of C3bBb on a C3b- or iC3b-coated surface. I presented a model in which properdin, bound to a target surface via C3b, iC3b, or other ligands, employs its unoccupied binding sites on its remaining subunits as receptors for nascent C3b, bystander C3b, or preformed C3bB and C3bBb complexes. The new C3bP and C3bBP act as intermediates in the generation of C3bBbP. Thus, properdin amplifies complement AP activation on a target surface through an organized assembly process. I am especially grateful to John Atkinson for his steadfast enthusiasm for properdin. His interest was a major determinant in the initiation of these studies. I also thank Feng Lin for DAF, John Atkinson for a critical reading of the manuscript, and Madonna Bogacki for help in preparing the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2108333707,"Ephrin-As and their receptors, EphAs, are expressed in the developing cortex where they may act to organize thalamic inputs. Here, we map the visual cortex (V1) in mice deficient for ephrin-A2, -A3, and -A5 functionally, using intrinsic signal optical imaging and microelectrode recording, and structurally, by anatomical tracing of thalamocortical projections. V1 is shifted medially, rotated, and compressed and its internal organization is degraded. Expressing ephrin-A5 ectopically by in utero electroporation in the lateral cortex shifts the map of V1 medially, and expression within V1 disrupts its internal organization. These findings indicate that interactions between gradients of EphA/ephrin-A in the cortex guide map formation, but that factors other than redundant ephrin-As are responsible for the remnant map. Together with earlier work on the retinogeniculate map, the current findings show that the same molecular interactions may operate at successive stages of the visual pathway to organize maps."

The protein levels of Runx2 are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In previous studies we discovered that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) induces Runx2 degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner, and Smurf1 plays an important role in osteoblast function and bone formation. In the present studies we investigated the molecular mechanism of Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Smurf1 interacts with the PY motif of substrate proteins, and a PY motif has been identified in the C terminus of the Runx2 protein. To determine whether Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation through the interaction with the PY motif of Runx2, we created a mutant Runx2 with a PY motif deletion and found that Smurf1 retained some of its ability to induce the degradation of the mutant Runx2, suggesting that Smurf1 could induce Runx2 degradation through an indirect mechanism. Smurf1 has been shown to interact with Smads 1, 5, 6, and 7, and Smads 1 and 5 also interact with Runx2. In the present studies we found that Smads 1 and 5 had no effect on Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Although Smads 6 and 7 bind Smurf1, it is not known if Smads 6 or 7 interacts with Runx2 and mediate Runx2 degradation. We performed immunoprecipitation assays and found that Smad6 but not Smad7 interacts with Runx2. Smad6 enhances Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that in addition to its interaction with the PY motif of Runx2, Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation in a Smad6-dependent manner.

Cells were transfected with an equal amount of FLAG-Runx2. 24 h after transfection cells were starved with Met/Cys-free DMEM (Invitrogen Cell Culture) with 5% dialyzed FCS (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cells were then pulsed with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 40 min followed by a chase in regular DMEM medium with 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. The sample at each time point was collected for immunoprecipitation using 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE gel, then dried and followed by autoradiographic exposure. The signals were quantified using Lab Works 4.0 Image analysis software (UVP, Inc. Upland, CA). Immunoprecipitation—COS or 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h before analysis. After transfection cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4), and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were pre-cleared with EZ View Red protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 5 μg of antibodies specific for each target protein were added in each sample. Immune complexes were precipitated by EZ View red protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C, washed 5 times with the lysis buffer. The immune complexes were boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed after immunoprecipitation (IP). Western Blot Analysis—The epitope-tagged Runx2, mRunx2(-PY), Runx3, mRunx3(-PY), Smurf1, mSmurf1, Smurf2, WWP1, and Smads 1, 5, 6, and 7 expression plasmids were transfected into COS cells. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected using the following antibodies: anti-FLAG M2, anti-Myc (clone 9E10), and anti-HA (clone HA-7) monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) and anti-Smad6 and anti-Smad7 polyclonal antibodies (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). Immunostaining was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Virus—Platinum-E cells in the 6-well plate were cultured in DMEM medium (2 ml) containing 10% FCS, 1 μg/ml puromycin, 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). When cells reached 30% confluence, retrovirus vector (pRetro-H1G), which expresses Smurf1- or Smad6-small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or control shRNA (Cellogenetics Inc., Baltimore, MD), was transfected into the cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 1 μg of vector was incubated with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 in DMEM (0.1 ml) for 15 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was added to the cells. After 2 days supernatants were harvested and filtered with a 0.45-μm membrane filter. Infection of Smurf1 or/and Smad6-shRNA—Cell density of 2T3 cells was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free αMEM. An equal volume of virus supernatant and Polybrene (32 μg/ml) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to the cell suspension, and then 2 ml of cell mixture was plated into a 6-cm dish (final: Polybrene, 8 μg/ml; 2T3 cells, 2 × 105 cells/dish). After cells were cultured in a CO2 incubator for 4 h, 2 ml of αMEM containing 10% FCS was added to cells to dilute the Polybrene concentration (total medium volume 4 ml). When cells reached 90% confluence, they were washed with serum-free αMEM (3 ml) 3 times and cultured for 48 h in αMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were lysed with M-PER (50 μl, Pierce) containing Complete Mini (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjected to Western blot analysis. The experiment was performed twice, Western blot data were quantified using Lab Works 4.0 Image Analysis Software (UVP, Inc. Upland, CA), and the average fold change was provided in Fig. 5, c and d. Smurf1 Mediates Runx2 Degradation in COS Cells—In previous studies we found that E3 ligase Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation in myoblast precursor C2C12 cells (24Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the present studies we have examined the effect of Smurf1 on Runx2 degradation using COS cells. COS and 293 cells have been extensively used for studies of protein degradation of Smad2 and transforming growth factor β and BMP receptors (26Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Expressed Runx2 has been demonstrated to have a similar phosphorylation pattern in COS and 293 cells compared with that of endogenous Runx2 in SAOS-2 cells (33Wee H. Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito Y. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When Runx2 expression plasmid was co-transfected with different amounts of Smurf1 or mSmurf1 (C710A, lacking catalytic activity) expression plasmid into COS cells, Smurf1 induced Runx2 degradation in a dose-dependent manner, and mSmurf1 had no significant effect on Runx2 degradation (Fig. 1a). When these expression plasmids were co-transfected with Runx2 reporter construct, 6xOSE2-OC-Luc, Smurf1 inhibited Runx2-induced luciferase activity of the reporter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas mSmurf1 had no significant effect on Runx2-activated 6xOSE2-OC-Luc reporter (Fig. 1b). Smurf1 Induces Runx2 Degradation through a PY Motif-independent Mechanism—It has been reported that Smurf1 interacts with the PY motif of its substrate Smads 1 and 5 (22Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In the Runx family members a conserved PY motif has been identified by amino acid sequence analysis, and the PY motif of Runx2 is located in the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 1c). It has been recently reported that Smurf1 mediates Runx3 degradation and that this activity is partially lost in 293 cells transfected with a mutant Runx3 having a PY motif deletion (34Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L. Lee Y.H. Choi J.K. Kim W.J. Lee K.Y. Bae S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29409-29417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation requires the PY motif of Runx2, we generated a mRunx2 expression plasmid with a PY motif deletion (Fig. 1c). Wild-type and mRunx2 expression plasmids were co-transfected with Smurf1 expression plasmid into COS cells. Although Smurf1 induced degradation of both wild-type and mRunx2, the level of Runx2 degradation was reduced in COS cells expressing mRunx2 compared with the wild-type Runx2 (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the PY motif of Runx2 is not essential for Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. To compare the effects of Smurf1 on the degradation of Runx2 to that of Runx3, Smurf1 was co-transfected with either wild-type or mRunx3(-PY) expression plasmids. Similar to Runx2, Smurf1 induced mRunx3 degradation, although the degree of the degradation was reduced compared with wild-type Runx3 (Fig. 1e). To confirm the effects of Smurf1 on mRunx2 and mRunx3 degradation, we transfected Smurf1 with either mRunx2 or mRunx3 into C2C12 cells and found that Smurf1 induced the degradation of mRunx2 and mRunx3 in a manner similar to that observed in COS cells (Fig. 1f). Altogether, the results suggest that in addition to the direct involvement of the PY motif of Runx2 and Runx3 proteins, Smurf1 also induces the degradation of Runx2 and Runx3 by another PY motif-independent mechanism. Smad6 Interacts with Runx2—Comparing the protein stability of Runx2 in C2C12 and COS cells, we noticed that the levels of expressed Runx2 protein were decreased over a 48-72-h period after transfection in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2a). In contrast, levels of expressed Runx2 protein are not changed up to 72 h in COS cells (Fig. 2b). The expression levels of Smurf1 are similar in C2C12 and COS cells (data not shown). To compare the degradation rates of Runx2 protein in these two types of cells, we performed pulse-chase experiments and found that the Runx2 degradation rate is much slower in COS cells compared with C2C12 cells (Fig. 2, c and d). It has been reported that Smurf1 has an ability to interact with Smads 1, 5, 6, and 7 (26Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and Smads 1 and 5 also interact with Runx2 (35Hanai J.I. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W-H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31577-31582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the Smad protein(s) may serve as an adaptor to mediate Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. We first tested if Smad1 mediates Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Transfection of Smad1 with Runx2 and Smurf1 expression plasmids did not change Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation in COS cells (Fig. 2e). A similar result was also obtained with Smad5 (data not shown). These results suggest that Smads 1 and 5 are not involved in Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Very low expression of Smad7 was detected in both C2C12 and COS cells (data not shown). In contrast, expression levels of Smad6 in C2C12 cells were significantly higher (28-fold) compared with COS cells (Fig. 2f). Although Smads 6 and 7 bind Smurf1 and co-localize with Smurf1 in the nucleus (26Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki C. Murakami G. Fukuchi M. Shimanuki T. Shikauchi Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it is not known if Smads 6 or 7 interact with Runx2 and mediate Runx2 degradation. We performed IP assays in COS cells after transfection of Myc-tagged Runx2 with FLAG-tagged Smurf1, Smad6, and Smad7 expression plasmids. Runx2 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-Myc antibody, and Smurf1 and Smad6, which interacted with Runx2, were detected by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3a). In this experiment, we found that Smad6 but not Smad7 interacts with Runx2. Because Smad7 may co-migrate with IgG heavy chain, we then performed IP with an anti-FLAG antibody. Again, Smad6, but not Smad7, was co-precipitated with Runx2 in COS cells (Fig. 3b). To determine whether the PY motif of Runx2 is required for its interaction with Smad6, we performed IP experiments using mRunx2(-PY) and found that Smad6 also co-precipitated with mRunx2(-PY) (Fig. 3c), indicating that the PY motif deletion in Runx2 protein does not interfere with its interaction with Smad6. To further confirm the interaction of Smad6 with Runx2 in other cells, we transfected Myc-tagged Runx2 with FLAG-tagged Smad6 or Smad7 into 293 cells. The IP was performed using an anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody. The result demonstrated that only Smad6 interacts with Runx2 in 293 cells (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that Smad6 may be involved in Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation.FIGURE 3Interaction of Smad6 with Runx2. a, Myc-tagged Runx2 (M-Runx2) expression plasmid was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad6, Smad7, and mSmurf1(CA) expression plasmids into COS cells. IP assays were performed using an anti-Myc antibody followed by Western blot (WB) analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. Smad6 and Smurf1 but not Smad7 were co-precipitated with Runx2 in COS cells. b, M-Runx2 was co-transfected with F-Smad6 and F-Smad7 in COS cells. IP assays were performed using an anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody. Smad6 but not Smad7 was co-precipitated with Runx2 into COS cells. c, Myc-tagged Runx2 and mRunx2(-PY) were co-transfected with F-Smad6 and F-Smad7 into COS cells. Smad6 but not Smad7 was detected by Western blot after Myc-Runx2 or Myc-mRunx2(-PY) proteins were immunoprecipitated by the anti-Myc antibody. d, Myc-tagged Runx2 was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad6 or Smad7 into 293 cells. IP was performed using the anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot using the anti-Myc antibody. Only Smad6 interacts with Runx2 in this IP assay in 293 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Smad6 Mediates Smurf1-induced Runx2 Degradation—To determine whether Smad6 is involved in Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation, we co-transfected Smad6 with Runx2 and Smurf1 in COS cells and examined changes in Runx2 degradation by Western blot analysis. Transfection of Smad6 significantly enhanced Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Smad6 was also degraded, along with Runx2, by Smurf1 (Fig. 4a). We then examined the effect of Smad6 on Smurf1-induced Runx2 ubiquitination. HA-ubiquitin expression plasmid was co-transfected with Runx2 and Smurf1 expression plasmids in the presence or absence of Smad6. Smurf1 induced Runx2 ubiquitination, and Smad6 further enhanced Smurf1-induced Runx2 ubiquitination (Fig. 4b). To confirm that the Smad6-mediated Runx2 degradation is proteasome-dependent, we treated COS cells with proteasome inhibitor 1 (PS-1) (5 μm) for 4 h after transfection of Runx2, Smurf1, and Smad6 expression plasmids. Proteasome inhibitor 1 effectively reversed Smurf1 alone or Smad6/Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation (Fig. 4c), demonstrating that the Smurf1- and Smad6/Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation is proteasome-dependent. To determine the effect of Smad6 on Runx2 activity, Smad6 expression plasmid was co-transfected with Smurf1 and 6xOSE2-OC-Luc reporter. Smad6 enhanced the inhibitory effect of Smurf1 on Runx2-induced luciferase activity of the 6xOSE2-OC-Luc reporter (Fig. 4d). It is interesting to point out that Smad6 alone had only a minor effect on Runx2 degradation, although it significantly enhanced the effect of Smurf1 on Runx2 degradation (Fig. 4, a, c, and d). These results demonstrate that Smad6 plays an important role in Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Inhibition of Smurf1 and Smad6 Enhances Endogenous Runx2 Protein Levels—To further determine the role of Smurf1 and Smad6 in regulation of Runx2 protein stability in osteoblasts, we infected osteoblast precursor 2T3 cells with retrovirus expressing double-stranded shRNA of Smurf1 and Smad6. The shRNA of Smurf1 and Smad6 are highly effective in blocking endogenous Smurf1 (81%) or Smad6 (77%) expression in 2T3 cells (Fig. 5, a and b). In 2T3 cells expressing small hairpin Smurf1, protein levels of endogenous Runx2 were increased 1.9-fold. Alone, Smad6 shRNA had no significant effect on Runx2 protein levels. When both Smurf1 and Smad6 shRNAs were infected in 2T3 cells, Runx2 protein levels were increased 3.7-fold (Fig. 5c). Infection of 2T3 cells with retrovirus expressing Smurf1 induced complete Runx2 degradation, and infection of shRNA of Smad6 reversed the effect of Smurf1 on Runx2 degradation in 2T3 cells (Fig. 5d). These results further demonstrate that Smurf1 and Smad6 cooperate to regulate Runx2 protein levels in osteoblast precursor cells. Smurf2 and WWP1 Induce Runx2 Degradation with Smad6—To determine whether other Hect-domain E3 ligases also regulate Runx2 degradation, we examined the effects of Smurf2 and WWP1 (31Komuro A. Imamura T. Saitoh M. Yoshida Y. Yamori T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6914-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) on Runx2 degradation in COS cells. Although Smurf2 had a weak effect on Runx2 degradation compared with Smurf1 (Fig. 6a), WWP1 effectively induced Runx2 degradation (Fig. 6b). In the presence of Smad6, Smurf2- and WWP1-induced Runx2 degradation was enhanced (Fig. 6, a and b). These results show that Smurf2 and WWP1 also regulate the protein stability of Runx2 through a mechanism that involves Smad6. Previously we discovered that Smurf1 interacts with bone-specific transcription factor Runx2 and induces Runx2 degradation in osteoblast precursor cells (24Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the present studies we provide new evidence that the interaction of Smurf1 to the PY motif of Runx2 is not essential for Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Here we demonstrate that Smurf1 can degrade Runx2 in a PY motif-independent manner through formation of a complex that includes Smad6. These findings provide new insights about the mechanism of Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. In the present studies we found that Smad6 interacts with Runx2 in COS and 293 cells, and Smurf1 induces the degradation of PY-mutant Runx2 or Runx3 in COS and C2C12 cells. More importantly, we also demonstrate that endogenous Runx2 protein levels are increased by the shRNA of Smurf1 and Smad6. These results demonstrate that this Smad6-mediated Runx2 degradation is not simply due to the overexpression of Smurf1 or Smad6 in a specific cell line. Recent studies show that Smad6 has a synergistic effect with Smurf1 on inhibition of BMP signaling. Smad6 binds type I BMP receptors and prevents binding and phosphorylation of Smads 1 and 5 (36Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Smad6 also facilitates Smurf1-induced type I BMP receptor degradation (23Murakami G. Watabe T. Takaoka K. Miyazono K. Imamura T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Smad6 and Smurf1 in chondrocyte maturation, Horiki et al. (37Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) developed Col11-Smad6 and Col11-Smurf1 transgenic mice and demonstrate that Smurf1 enhances the effect of Smad6 on inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation and maturation (37Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our results provide new evidence that Smad6 mediates Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Because Smad6 and Smurf1 are co-localized in the nucleus as is Runx2, it is likely that Smad6-mediated Runx2 degradation occurs in the 26 S proteasome, which is located in the nucleus of cells. Hect-domain E3 ligases frequently use adaptor proteins to mediate the degradation of substrate proteins. For example, Smurf2, another member of the Smurf family, induces the protein degradation of SnoN, a transcriptional repressor of transforming growth factor β signaling, using Smad2 as an adaptor (30Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similarly, Smurfs 1 and 2 target type I transforming growth factor β and BMP receptors for degradation using Smads 6 and 7 as adaptor proteins (23Murakami G. Watabe T. Takaoka K. Miyazono K.

It binds E6 protein of human Papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and targets the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of tumor suppressor p53 (39Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Our previous results demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing the Smurf1 transgene (Col1a1-Smurf1) in osteoblasts have impaired bone formation and osteoblast activity (25Zhao M. Qiao M. Harris S.E. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12854-12859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that bone mass is increased in adult Smurf1 null mutant mice (40Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E. Cell. 2005; 121: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Smurf1 null mutant mice had normal levels of Smads 1 and 5 and Runx2 proteins that have all previously been shown to be targeted by Smurf1 (22Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J. Thomsen G.H.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 24Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because these proteins are also targeted by Smurf2 or other E3 ligases (31Komuro A. Imamura T. Saitoh M. Yoshida Y. Yamori T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6914-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it is possible that Smurf2 and other E3 ligases may have played a redundant role in the degradation of these proteins in Smurf1 knock-out cells. In the present studies we found that the degradation of Runx2 is not only induced by Smurf1 but also induced by Smurf2 and WWP1. These findings demonstrate that Runx2 degradation involves multiple E3 ligases and is mediated through both PY motif-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In summary, our findings indicate that Smad6 interacts with Runx2 and mediates Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. These results show that Smad6 and Smurf1 coordinately down-regulate Runx2 protein, which may serve as a negative regulatory mechanism for the BMP-Smad-Runx2 signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2048371394,"We previously demonstrated that apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) potentiates lysosomal leakage and apoptosis induced by amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in cultured Neuro-2a cells and hypothesized that the low pH of lysosomes accentuates the conversion of apoE4 to a molten globule, inducing reactive intermediates capable of destabilizing cellular membranes. Here we report that neutralizing lysosomal pH with bafilomycin or NH4Cl abolished the apoE4 potentiation of Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells. Consistent with these results, apoE4 at acidic pH bound more avidly to phospholipid vesicles and disrupted them to a greater extent than at pH 7.4. Comparison of “Arctic” mutant Aβ, which forms multimers, and GM6 mutant Aβ, which remains primarily monomeric, showed that aggregation is essential for apoE4 to potentiate Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis. Both apoE4 and Aβ1–42 had to be internalized to exert these effects. Blocking the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein with small interfering RNA abolished the enhanced effects of apoE4 and Aβ on lysosomes and apoptosis. In cultured Neuro-2a cells, Aβ1–42 increased lysosome formation to a greater extent in apoE3- or apoE4-transfected cells than in Neo-transfected cells, as shown by immunostaining for lysosome-associated membrane protein 1. Similarly, in transgenic mice expressing apoE and amyloid precursor protein, hippocampal neurons displayed increased numbers of lysosomes. Thus, apoE4 and Aβ1–42 may work in concert in neurons to increase lysosome formation while increasing the susceptibility of lysosomal membranes to disruption, release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol, and neuronal degeneration. We previously demonstrated that apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) potentiates lysosomal leakage and apoptosis induced by amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in cultured Neuro-2a cells and hypothesized that the low pH of lysosomes accentuates the conversion of apoE4 to a molten globule, inducing reactive intermediates capable of destabilizing cellular membranes. Here we report that neutralizing lysosomal pH with bafilomycin or NH4Cl abolished the apoE4 potentiation of Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells. Consistent with these results, apoE4 at acidic pH bound more avidly to phospholipid vesicles and disrupted them to a greater extent than at pH 7.4. Comparison of “Arctic” mutant Aβ, which forms multimers, and GM6 mutant Aβ, which remains primarily monomeric, showed that aggregation is essential for apoE4 to potentiate Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis. Both apoE4 and Aβ1–42 had to be internalized to exert these effects. Blocking the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein with small interfering RNA abolished the enhanced effects of apoE4 and Aβ on lysosomes and apoptosis. In cultured Neuro-2a cells, Aβ1–42 increased lysosome formation to a greater extent in apoE3- or apoE4-transfected cells than in Neo-transfected cells, as shown by immunostaining for lysosome-associated membrane protein 1. Similarly, in transgenic mice expressing apoE and amyloid precursor protein, hippocampal neurons displayed increased numbers of lysosomes. Thus, apoE4 and Aβ1–42 may work in concert in neurons to increase lysosome formation while increasing the susceptibility of lysosomal membranes to disruption, release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol, and neuronal degeneration. Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; apo, apolipoprotein; Aβ, amyloid β; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; MEM, minimum essential medium; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease. With no effective treatment available, the incidence of AD is likely to increase as the population continues to age. Although in most cases the exact cause is unknown, two proteins have been implicated in its pathogenesis: apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) and amyloid β (Aβ). ApoE has important functions in lipid transport in the blood and in the redistribution of lipids among cells in the brain (1Mahley R.W.

Most studies have shown that to be taken up by the LRP, Aβ must form a complex with an LRP ligand, such as apoE or α2-macroglobulin, both of which bind to the LRP and other low density lipoprotein receptors (41Narita M.

We will show that increasing lysosomal pH blunts the enhanced lysosomal leakage induced by apoE4 in the context of Aβ1–42. ApoE4 avidly interacts with phospholipid vesicles and disrupts them more readily at pH 4 than at pH 7.4. Likewise, the physical state of Aβ is altered at low pH, stimulating aggregation and enhancing membrane interactions (54Su Y. Chang P.-T.

Furthermore, we will demonstrate that apoE in the context of Aβ1–42 stimulates the appearance of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway in cultured neuronal cells. Likewise, coexpression of APP in apoE transgenic mice increases this pathway in hippocampal neurons. Reagents—Heparinase I, Lucifer Yellow, bafilomycin, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide were from Sigma. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was from Avanti (Alabaster, AL), Aβ1–42 from Bachem (Torrance, CA), and LysoSensor DND-160 was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-LRP antibody was a gift from Dr. E. Koo (University of California, San Diego, CA). LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1) monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant human apoE3 and apoE4 (provided by Karl H.

Cell Culture—Neuro-2a cells and astroglial cells (C6 cells) were transfected with human apoE3 or apoE4 cDNA ligated into the CMV3 vector and selected in medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml). Colonies of transfected Neuro-2a cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. C6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. Cell colonies were further selected that secreted about 50 ng/ml apoE3 or apoE4 (Neuro-2a cells) and 120 ng/ml (C6 cells) per 24 h as estimated by apoE immunoblots (62Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C.

They were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), according to the following sequences: si-LRP6600, sense 5′-UGGCAUCUCAGUAGACUAUUU-3′ and antisense 5′-AUAGUCUACUGAGAUGCCAUU-3′; si-LRP12348, sense 5′-UGUGUACUGGACCGAUUCAUU-3′ and antisense 5′-UGAAUCGGUCCAGUACACAUU-3′. For transfection, Neuro-2a cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to reach 60% confluence. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA (1.5 μg/ml) with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection complex was diluted in Opti-MEM (final volume, 1 ml), which was replaced after 4 h. Aβ1–42 (20 μm) was added 48 h after transfection. Cells were lysed for immunoblotting at 72 h. After blocking of LRP expression with siRNA, other cells were homogenized, and the cytosol was isolated by centrifugation and assayed for hexosaminidase activity. Some cells were also examined for apoptosis by measuring cellular DNA fragmentation with cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Roche Applied Science). For LAMP1 immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in ethyl alcohol. Measurement of Lysosomal Membrane Stability—The stability of lysosomal membranes was assessed by measuring the leakage of the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase or the concentrated lysosomal fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow into the cytosol of Neuro-2a cells. The cells were incubated with Lucifer Yellow (100 μg/ml) for 16 h, washed three times, and incubated with Aβ1–42 at 37 °C for 8–40 h. After incubation, the cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Radiance 2000 KR3; Bio-Rad) for Lucifer Yellow in the cytosol. The percentage of cells showing diffuse fluorescence indicative of lysosomal leakage was determined by counting 10–20 cells in each of 12–20 fields at ×60 magnification. β-Hexosaminidase was measured as described (63Kaback M.M. Shapiro L.J. Hirsch P. Roy C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1977; 18: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). Alteration of Lysosomal pH—The cells were prelabeled with LysoSensor DND-160 (2 μm) for 16 h at 37 °C. LysoSensor DND-160 accumulates in lysosomes and, at the low pH in lysosomes, is robustly fluorescent with an emission peak of 540 nm and an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. The labeled cells were incubated with bafilomycin or NH4Cl to raise the pH of endosomes and lysosomes (64Kane M.D. Schwarz R.D. St. Pierre L. Watson M.D. Emmerling M.R. Boxer P.A. Walker G.K. J.

As the pH of the lysosomes approaches neutral levels, the fluorescence intensity of the LysoSensor DND-160 is greatly reduced (67Lin H.-J. Herman P. Kang J.S. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was monitored with a BD FACS Vantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Turbidity Clearance of DMPC—DMPC was dissolved in benzene, lyophilized, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5.5% KBr, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4 or 4.0), and preincubated in water at 23.9 °C. DMPC multilamellar vesicles (0.5 ml, 500 μg/ml) were added to a cuvette, and 250 μg of apoE was added to the solution. The decrease in turbidity was monitored and recorded with a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer; excitation and emission were set at 600 nm. Aβ Preparation—Except where noted, Aβ1–42 was solubilized in Me2SO and water and incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h, as described (51Ji Z.-S. Miranda R.D. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. Huang Y.

Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Briefly, each form of Aβ was dissolved in cold hexafluoroisopropanol, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged to remove hexafluoroisopropanol. The Aβ was dried, resuspended in a small amount of Me2SO, diluted in water, and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The Aβ solution was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined. To assess Aβ aggregation, each Aβ sample (100 ng) was separated on Tris-Tricine (Bio-Rad) gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody (3D6). Aβ was visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Internalization of 125I-Aβ in Neuro-2a Cells—Neo-, apoE3-, and apoE4-transfected cells were grown to about 90% confluence in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, washed with serum-free medium, and incubated with 125I-Aβ (3 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were then placed on ice. After five washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and two with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were washed with 10 mm suramin at 4 °C for 30 min, and radioactivity was counted with a γ-counter. Wild type and mutant Aβ were iodinated with Iodogen (Pierce). Aβ (0.5 mg) was incubated with Iodogen beads on ice for 15 min, and the 125I-labeled Aβ was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific cell association was determined by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled Aβ. DNA Fragmentation Assay—Apoptotic cell death was measured with a cellular DNA fragmentation assay as described (51Ji Z.-S. Miranda R.D. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. Huang Y. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

LAMP1 Immunoblotting and Immunostaining—Neo- and apoE-transfected cells were incubated with or without Aβ for 0, 8, or 16 h. The cells were then lysed for LAMP1 immunoblotting or fixed in 100% cold ethyl alcohol for 15 min for immunostaining. Proteins (40 μg) from lysed cells were separated on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the LAMP1 immunoreactive bands were scanned. For immunostaining, the cells were treated with Triton X-100 (0.1%) and Tween 20 (0.005%) in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl buffer. Nonspecific reactivity was blocked with 10% goat serum and incubated with rat anti-LAMP1 antibody (1 μg of IgG/ml). Fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rat IgG was used as the second antibody. LAMP1 quantitation, as determined by immunoactivity, was measured with a BioQuant image analysis system (R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN). Briefly, the pixel number (intensity) of immunofluorescence in each cell from Neo- and apoE-transfected cells was measured. The mean pixel number of immunofluorescence was obtained from 10 cells randomly chosen for each condition. LAMP1 immunocytochemistry was also performed on brain sections of Apoe-/- mice and transgenic mice expressing apoE3 or apoE4 under control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter (68Buttini M.

All of the mice were on an Apoe-/- background and studied at ∼12 months of age. The construct for the APP mice was platelet-derived growth factor-APP with the Swedish and Indiana mutations (K670N/M671L and V717F, respectively) (69Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.-Q. Mallory M.

Immunocytochemistry was performed on 50-μm free floating vibratome sections of brains fixed in paraformaldehyde. The staining procedure is described above. The sections were examined under a BX-60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY). The intensity of LAMP1 immunofluorescence in the CA3 region of the hippocampus was quantitated with a BioQuant image analysis system, which measures the area of the CA3 region (183,302–197,677 μm2) and determines the mean number of pixels of LAMP1 immunofluorescence in each area. Co-culture of ApoE-transfected C6 Cells and Neuro-2a Cells—Neo-transfected Neuro-2a cells were grown in 6-well culture plates or chamber slides. ApoE-transfected and nontransfected C6 astrocytic cells were grown in separate cell culture inserts with pores (0.3 μm in diameter) in the bottom, which allows free exchange of culture medium through the pores (BD Biosciences). The inserts were placed in culture dishes containing Neuro-2a cells. Aβ1–42 (20 μm) was added to the Neuro-2a cells, and incubation was continued for 24 h. The cells were fixed i"

Perpendicular divisions are more likely to be asymmetric and generate one progenitor and one neuronal precursor. Whether the orientation of the mitotic spindle actually determines their asymmetric outcome is unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian homolog of Inscuteable (mInsc), a key regulator of spindle orientation in Drosophila. mInsc is expressed temporally and spatially in a manner that suggests a role in orienting the mitotic spindle in the developing nervous system. Using retroviral RNAi in rat retinal explants, we show that downregulation of mInsc inhibits vertical divisions. This results in enhanced proliferation, consistent with a higher frequency of symmetric divisions generating two proliferating cells.

Our results suggest that the orientation of neural progenitor divisions is important for cell fate specification in the retina and determines their symmetric or asymmetric outcome. During development of the mammalian nervous system a relatively small number of progenitor cells gives rise to a huge variety of different neurons and glial cells. How this diversity is achieved is still unclear. Recent results have suggested that oriented asymmetric cell divisions generating two different daughter cells are important for lineage diversity in the nervous system (Wodarz and Huttner, 2003Wodarz A. Huttner W.B. Asymmetric cell division during neurogenesis in Drosophila and vertebrates.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Zhong, 2003Zhong W. Diversifying neural cells through order of birth and asymmetry of division.Neuron. 2003; 37: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the developing cerebral cortex, proliferating progenitor cells are mostly found in the ventricular zone (VZ), a pseudostratified neuroepithelium lining the lateral ventricles. During early neurogenesis, the progenitor pool increases exponentially by symmetric divisions generating two proliferating daughter cells (Rakic, 1995Rakic P. A small step for the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical expansion during evolution.Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Later, progenitors can also divide asymmetrically into one daughter progenitor and one differentiating neuron (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Finally, proliferation is terminated by symmetric divisions that generate two differentiating neurons (Miyata et al., 2001Miyata T. Kawaguchi A. Okano H. Ogawa M. Asymmetric inheritance of radial glial fibers by cortical neurons.Neuron. 2001; 31: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Live imaging experiments in the vertebrate cortex have revealed a correlation between the orientation of progenitor divisions and their symmetric or asymmetric outcome: while horizontal divisions (“horizontal” refers to the orientation of the mitotic spindle) are symmetric, vertical divisions often generate two different daughter cells (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F.

The cell fate determinant Numb localizes apically in dividing VZ progenitors and is therefore unequally distributed during vertical divisions only and might be responsible for their asymmetric outcome (Zhong et al., 1996Zhong W. Feder J.N. Jiang M.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Asymmetric localization of a mammalian numb homolog during mouse cortical neurogenesis.Neuron. 1996; 17: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A similar correlation between the orientation of progenitor cell divisions and their symmetric or asymmetric outcome was found in the rat retina (Cayouette and Raff, 2003Cayouette M. Raff M. The orientation of cell division influences cell-fate choice in the developing mammalian retina.Development. 2003; 130: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although these correlations are highly suggestive, the consequences of misorientation of progenitor divisions have not been analyzed. In fact, it is not clear whether the precise orientation of the mitotic spindle is important for mammalian development at all (Davidson, 1991Davidson E.H. Spatial mechanisms of gene regulation in metazoan embryos.Development. 1991; 113: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). In invertebrates, the molecular machinery for spindle orientation has been discovered. At the heart of this machinery is a Drosophila protein called Inscuteable (Insc) (Kraut et al., 1996Kraut R. Chia W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Knoblich J.A. Role of inscuteable in orienting asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila.Nature. 1996; 383: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). During early Drosophila embryogenesis, Insc is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of the procephalic neurogenic ectoderm (PNE). While other epithelial cells divide parallel to the embryo surface, these cells rotate their mitotic spindle into an apical-basal orientation. They divide asymmetrically into one daughter cell that remains epithelial and another daughter cell that comes to lie underneath the epithelium and gives rise to neurons. In insc mutants, spindle reorientation in the PNE does not occur. Conversely, insc can induce spindle reorientation when expressed in epithelial cells outside the PNE. Insc is a molecular linker that connects two conserved protein complexes. It localizes apically by binding to Par-3/Par-6/aPKC, a complex that is required for epithelial polarity and is expressed in all epithelial cells irrespective of their division plane (Schober et al., 1999Schober M. Schaefer M. Knoblich J.A. Bazooka recruits Inscuteable to orient asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila neuroblasts.Nature. 1999; 402: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, Wodarz et al., 1999Wodarz A. Ramrath A. Kuchinke U. Knust E. Bazooka provides an apical cue for Inscuteable localization in Drosophila neuroblasts.Nature. 1999; 402: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Insc also interacts with the GoLoco domain protein Pins (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer M. Shevchenko A. Knoblich J.A. A protein complex containing Inscuteable and the Galpha-binding protein Pins orients asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2000Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W. Analysis of partner of inscuteable, a novel player of Drosophila asymmetric divisions, reveals two distinct steps in inscuteable apical localization.Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and its binding partner Gαi (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer M. Shevchenko A. Knoblich J.A. A protein complex containing Inscuteable and the Galpha-binding protein Pins orients asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Pins and Gαi are basolateral in epithelial cells but are recruited to the apical side upon Insc expression. Pins can activate heterotrimeric G proteins in a receptor-independent way, and it is thought that polarized activation of heterotrimeric G proteins attracts one of the two spindle poles and thereby induces reorientation of the mitotic spindle (Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004Betschinger J. Knoblich J.A. Dare to be different: asymmetric cell division in Drosophila, C. elegans and vertebrates.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R674-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Two Pins homologs have been characterized in vertebrates: while AGS-3 is expressed only in certain tissues, LGN is ubiquitously expressed and shows higher sequence similarity with Drosophila Pins (Yu et al., 2003Yu F. Morin X. Kaushik R. Bahri S. Yang X. Chia W. A mouse homologue of Drosophila pins can asymmetrically localize and substitute for pins function in Drosophila neuroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Vertebrate homologs also exist for Par-3, Par-6, and aPKC (Ohno, 2001Ohno S. Intercellular junctions and cellular polarity: the PAR-aPKC complex, a conserved core cassette playing fundamental roles in cell polarity.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), but a functional vertebrate homolog of Insc has not yet been described. Here, we show that Inscuteable is functionally conserved in mammals and is required for correct orientation of the mitotic spindle in precursor cells of the rat retina. We use mammalian Inscuteable to show that misorientation of the mitotic spindle leads to proliferation and cell fate specification defects in the rat retina. Insc sequence homologs can be found in other insect species, like Drosophila pseudoobscura or Anopheles gambiae (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). Using iterative BLAST searches (see the Supplemental Data), we could also define Insc-related genes in honeybee, pufferfish, chicken, mouse (Katoh, 2003Katoh M. Identification and characterization of human Inscuteable gene in silico.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 11: 111-116PubMed Google Scholar), rats, and humans. Although the homology is highly significant within vertebrate and within insect species, conservation between these two groups is generally low. The vertebrate and invertebrate groups are connected by highly significant matches between the honeybee and pufferfish proteins, suggesting that the genes we identified represent a family of true orthologs. This is further supported by the fact that sequence homology is highest in a region that includes the asymmetry domain, a part of Insc required and sufficient for all functions (Knoblich et al., 1999Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Deletion analysis of the Drosophila Inscuteable protein reveals domains for cortical localization and asymmetric localization.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figure S1D). Homology searches indicate that this domain is part of a stretch of armadillo repeats, which often serve as interaction platforms for binding partners. Since Drosophila Insc exists in a complex with Pins and Gαi, we analyzed the evolutionary conservation of the heterotrimeric complex between mInsc and its binding partners. In vitro translated mInsc binds to a GST-LGN fusion protein (Figure 1A). Conversely, in vitro translated LGN binds to bacterially expressed MBP-mInsc but not to a truncated form lacking the first 101 amino acids of the protein, which includes the part of mInsc homologous to the Pins binding region of Drosophila Insc (aa 302–459). To test whether mInsc can bind LGN in vivo, COS-7 cells were transfected with tagged versions of mInsc, LGN, and Gαi1. The three proteins (but not mInsc and Gαi1 alone) can be coimmunoprecipitated, suggesting that they form a protein complex analogous to the one described for Drosophila (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained for rat AGS-3, the second vertebrate homolog of Pins (data not shown). To analyze the subcellular localization of mInsc, NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with a functional GFP-tagged form of mInsc that retains the ability to bind to endogenous LGN (data not shown). During interphase, mInsc-GFP is uniformly cytoplasmic (Figure 1C). In mitosis, however, the protein translocates to the plasma membrane and often concentrates in the cortical area overlying the two spindle poles. This distribution is consistent with a function in spindle orientation and is similar to the one described for LGN (Yu et al., 2003Yu F. Morin X. Kaushik R. Bahri S. Yang X. Chia W. A mouse homologue of Drosophila pins can asymmetrically localize and substitute for pins function in Drosophila neuroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether Insc is expressed in the nervous system at the time of asymmetric cell divisions, we performed in situ hybridizations of whole mouse embryos (Figure 2A). No mInsc expression was detected at E8, but at E10.5, the gene becomes strongly expressed in dorsal root ganglia and cranial ganglia. At E12.5, the expression pattern becomes more complex and includes tissues inside and outside the nervous system (data not shown). mInsc expression is also detected in the developing retina and forebrain. In situ hybridization of cortical sections reveals weak mInsc expression at E11.5 that increases over time and becomes strong at E13.5 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, this expression pattern correlates with the fraction of vertical divisions in the developing telencephalon which peaks at E14 (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P. Mitotic spindle rotation and mode of cell division in the developing telencephalon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To analyze the subcellular distribution of mInsc, we generated a specific antibody against the MBP-tagged C-terminal part of the protein that detects a single strong band of the predicted molecular weight in mouse brain extracts (Figure 2E). The immunoreactivity can be competed by preincubation of the antibody with bacterially expressed mInsc protein (data not shown). In mouse embryo sections at E12.5, the antibody primarily stains dorsal root and cranial ganglia, and the overall staining pattern correlates well with the in situ pattern in consecutive sections (data not shown). In the E12.5 developing cortex, however, immunostaining is primarily observed on the apical side of the cells in the VZ (Figure 2C). This may indicate translational control of mInsc protein expression. Such a translational control mechanism has been described in Drosophila where Insc translation is regulated by Abstrakt, an RNA-binding protein conserved in vertebrates (Irion et al., 2004Irion U. Leptin M. Siller K. Fuerstenberg S. Cai Y. Doe C.Q. Chia W. Yang X. Abstrakt, a DEAD box protein, regulates Insc levels and asymmetric division of neural and mesodermal progenitors.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To address the function of mInsc in mammalian nervous system development, we used the rat retina explants and monitored the division planes of neural progenitors in real time. Retroviral infection allowed us to both unambigously determine cleavage orientation of a single progenitor cell and perform a clonal analysis of its progeny (Cayouette and Raff, 2003Cayouette M. Raff M. The orientation of cell division influences cell-fate choice in the developing mammalian retina.Development. 2003; 130: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). mInsc is almost completely conserved between mice and rats (Figure S1), and the mInsc antibody specifically detects mInsc in extracts of E19 rat brains (Figure 2E). During retinal development, mInsc protein is detected primarily on the apical side of the retinal neuroepithelium (Figure 2D). In interphase, the protein is found in the apical and basal processes (Figure 2D′, open arrowhead). When cells move apically, mInsc concentrates in the apical half of the cell body (Figure 2D′, arrowhead). During mitosis, mInsc localizes into a distinct apical crescent in some progenitor cells that divide vertically (Figure 2D″). However, in the progenitors dividing with the mitotic spindle oriented horizontally it localizes to the apical and also lateral cell cortex (Figure 2D′″). This localization is strikingly similar to the Drosophila protein. To investigate the requirement of mInsc for spindle orientation in neural progenitors, we knocked down mInsc by a retrovirus expressing a short hairpin RNA corresponding to a part of the mInsc coding region. The construct strongly reduces Insc expression in fibroblasts, thus demonstrating its feasibility for Insc loss-of-function experiments (Figure 3C). E19–E20 retinal explants were infected with GFP-expressing control RNAi or mInsc RNAi retroviruses. Orientation of progenitor divisions was determined by live imaging of dividing GFP-labeled progenitor cells in retinal explant cultures. Examples of vertical and horizontal divisions are shown in Figure 3A. In control explants, almost 50% of the progenitor divisions were within 30° of the apical basal axis. Upon mInsc RNAi, however, almost 40% of the divisions were within 15° to the retinal surface; however, a large part of the divisions had an oblique orientation (Figure 3B). We conclude that mInsc is required for the correct orientation of vertical progenitor divisions in the rat retina. We used mInsc RNAi to test the consequences of spindle misorientation for proliferation and cell fate specification in the rat retina. Retinal explants were infected at day E20, and the progeny of GFP-expressing infected cells were analyzed at P10, when proliferation in the retina has largely ceased and progenitor cells have differentiated. Control infected cells rarely generate more than four daughter cells. Upon mInsc RNAi, however, a significant fraction of clones had five, six, or even seven GFP-positive cells (Figure 4A). Such large clones can either be generated when progenitor cells divide into two daughter cells that both continue to proliferate and undergo more than one round of subsequent divisions or by a failure to exit the cell cycle. However, mInsc RNAi has no effect on proliferation when applied at P2 (Figure 4B), a stage when a large proportion of retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle. To test whether the increase in proliferation is paralleled by a decrease in differentiating cells, we analyzed the frequency of different retinal cell types among the progeny of retrovirally infected cells. Cell types were identified by their morphology and location within the retinal cell layers. Identification of bipolar cells was confirmed by staining with the trancription factor Islet-1, a neuronal differentiation marker (Figure 4D). The major cell type generated at E21 are rod photoreceptor cells (Figure 4C). Upon mInsc RNAi, the number of photoreceptor cells is significantly reduced while the number of later-differentiating bipolar neurons is increased (Figure 4C). To additionally exclude the possibility that the cell fate change upon mInsc RNAi is not due to mislocalization of the cell fate determinant Numb, we have analyzed Numb localization in mInsc RNAi infected retinal progenitors. As shown in Figures S2A and S2B, apical asymmetric Numb localization is not affected by the mInsc RNAi, showing that the cell fate change is due to mInsc disruption. Taken together, these data suggest that the change in spindle orientation caused by the depletion of mInsc protein increases the proliferative potential of retinal progenitor cells and causes a transformation of photoreceptor cells into bipolar neurons. While the orientation of cell division is important for invertebrate development, it has been suggested that vertebrates develop differently and rely entirely on cell migration and diffusible morphogens (Davidson, 1991Davidson E.H. Spatial mechanisms of gene regulation in metazoan embryos.Development. 1991; 113: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). Although the significance of the mitotic spindle orientation for cell fate determination has been anticipated for a long time (Martin, 1967Martin A.H. Significance of mitotic spindle fibre orientation in the neural tube.Nature. 1967; 216: 1133-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), only more recent live imaging techniques in the developing mammalian brain have allowed clearer correlations between the orientation of a division and the fate of the resulting daughter cells. In the ventricular zone of the developing ferret (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) or the developing mouse brain (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P. Mitotic spindle rotation and mode of cell division in the developing telencephalon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as well as in the rat retina (Cayouette and Raff, 2003Cayouette M. Raff M. The orientation of cell division influences cell-fate choice in the developing mammalian retina.Development. 2003; 130: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), progenitor divisions along the vertical axis are more likely to generate two different daughter cells, while parallel divisions are usually symmetric. Whether this is just a correlation or actually reflects a determining role of spindle orientation for daughter cell specification was unclear. In this study, we use the mammalian homolog of Insc as a tool to influence spindle orientation in vertebrates. We show that mInsc depletion ablates vertical mitotic spindle orientations in retinal progenitors and leads to defects in cell fate specification and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that spindle orientation not only predicts but actually determines the fate of the two daughter cells. We favor a model in which vertically oriented retinal progenitor divisions are important for generating differentiating daughter cells at the expense of proliferating progenitors. Upon mInsc RNAi, cells that would normally differentiate into photoreceptor cells change their fate and remain proliferating progenitor cells instead. When they differentiate at later stages, they are more likely to adopt the later bipolar neuron fate. In contrast to bipolar cells, the number of Müller glia is not increased, although they also differentiate at a late stage. Müller glia are generated in small numbers and formally, our data suggest that their number is regulated independently of progenitor pool size. Although this model provides an attractive explanation of our data, we cannot exclude that the clone size and cell fate phenotypes are actually unlinked. For example, progenitor cells that normally generate one bipolar cell via an asymmetric division might be forced to divide symmetrically upon mInsc knock-down and thereby give rise to two bipolar cells instead. How does mInsc orient mitotic spindles? In Drosophila, Insc is thought to act by polarizing G protein signaling and thereby attracting astral microtubules to the apical cell cortex. In vertebrates, overexpression of heterotrimeric G proteins causes oscillations of the mitotic spindle (Du and Macara, 2004Du Q. Macara I.G. Mammalian Pins is a conformational switch that links NuMA to heterotrimeric G proteins.Cell. 2004; 119: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), suggesting that G protein activity—like in flies—regulates the attachment of astral microtubules to the cell cortex. The mammalian Pins homolog LGN is present in the mouse ventricular zone (Yu et al., 2003Yu F. Morin X. Kaushik R. Bahri S. Yang X. Chia W. A mouse homologue of Drosophila pins can asymmetrically localize and substitute for pins function in Drosophila neuroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and might activate G proteins. Although the existing LGN antibodies did not allow us to determine its subcellular localization in mouse brain (data not shown), mInsc might act by recruiting LGN to the apical and lateral cell cortex, resulting in polarized G protein activation. This model predicts that it is the asymmetric distribution of mInsc in vertically dividing progenitors rather than its presence that influences spindle orientation. Consistently, mInsc overexpressed in fibroblasts is without consequence (data not shown). While this report was under revision, the identification of mouse Inscuteable has been described independently (Lechler and Fuchs, 2005Lechler T. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote stratification and differentiation of mammalian skin.Nature. 2005; 437: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). When expressed as a GFP fusion protein, mInsc colocalizes with LGN and Par-3 in mitotic basal cells of developing mouse epidermis. These cells divide asymmetrically and give rise to basal and suprabasal cells with mitotic spindles perpendicular to the basement membrane. The same mechanism of spindle reorientation could therefore lead to specification of different cell types in the developing retina and to stratification in the epidermis. The identification of mInsc provides a unique tool to analyze the importance of oriented divisions in various other vertebrate tissues. For example, it was proposed that adult mammalian neural stem cells divide asymmetrically along the apical basal axis (Johansson et al., 1999Johansson C.B. Momma S. Clarke D.L. Risling M. Lendahl U. Frisen J. Identification of a neural stem cell in the adult mammalian central nervous system.Cell. 1999; 96: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test whether spindle orientation is essential for asymmetric stem cell divisions as well. If so, this will be an important factor in exploiting the regenerative capacity of these cells. NIH/3T3 and COS-7 cells were cultured under standard conditions. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer was performed by using the Phoenix packaging cell line as described previously (Kondo and Raff, 2000Kondo T. Raff M. The Id4 HLH protein and the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1998-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Vienna Medical University. E19–E20 and P2 rat retinal explants were prepared and infected with retroviruses as previously described (Cayouette et al., 2001Cayouette M. Whitmore A.V. Jeffery G. Raff M. Asymmetric segregation of Numb in retinal development and the influence of the pigmented epithelium.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5643-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For clonal analysis, the explants were infected at E20 or P2 and kept 12 days in culture. Clones derived by each infected retinal progenitor cell were scored and analyzed for the cell number and cell composition on cryosections of fixed retinal explants. Cells were identified on the basis of their morphology and position within the retina. DNA oligos for shRNA silencing were designed by RNAi oligo retriever (http://katahdin.cshl.org/RNAi/html/rnai.html). CTACAACCCCACCTTCCTTGGCTATGATGAAGCTTGATCATAGTCAGGGGAGGTGGGGTTGTAGTCCTTTTTT as Oligo A and GATCAAAAAAGGACTACAACCCCACCTCCCCTGACTATGATCAAGCTTCATCATAGCCAAGGAAGGTGGGGTTGTAGC as OligoB were used for the mInsc-RNAi (targeting the Inscuteable region conserved in mouse and rat Inscuteable). Oligonucleotides were cloned into pSHAG vector (Invitrogen), and the U6-shRNA cassette was transferred to the Gateway compatible retroviral vector pMSCV-PGK-GFP (provided by Beug H.). Controls were empty pBird retrovirus (Tang et al., 2001Tang D.G. Tokumoto Y.M. Apperly J.A. Lloyd A.C. Raff M.C. Lack of replicative senescence in cultured rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells.Science. 2001; 291: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Figures 4A and 4C) or pMSCV-PGK-GFP retrovirus containing firefly luciferase RNAi oligos (Paddison et al., 2002Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) induce sequence-specific silencing in mammalian cells.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B, 3C, and 4B). The mInsc-EGFP retrovirus was constructed by cloning the 1.7 kb mInsc cDNA into the pLEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). GST-LGN was a gift from Ian G. Macara. Human Gαi1, mInsc, and human LGN were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vectors with KT3 (PPEPET), HA, Flag, or myc epitope tags, respectively, as described (Kimple et al., 2004Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Hains M.D. Jones M.B. Nweke G.K. Siderovski D.P. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity of the triple GoLoco motif protein G18: alanine-to-aspartate mutation restores function to an inactive second GoLoco motif.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A Zeiss 200M inverted microscope equipped with a custom-made motorized xyz stage, CO2 controled incubator (37°C, 5% CO2), and 25× objective was used for time-lapse imaging with a CCD video camera (Proper Scientific). Images were aquired on multiple positions every 5 min for 24–48 hr. Time-lapse experiments were analyzed using Metamorph software. Each time-stack of images, representing one position, was reconstructed into a stack. The angle of the mitotic spindle was determined by drawing a line along the axis of the mitotic spindle and a line along the migrational pathway of cells prior to division. The resulting data were analyzed using Origin 6.1 (OriginLab). Mouse embryos were dissected in cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, frozen in O.C.T compound (Sakura), and stored at −70°C. Retinal explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and frozen as described before (Cayouette et al., 2001Cayouette M. Whitmore A.V. Jeffery G. Raff M. Asymmetric segregation of Numb in retinal development and the influence of the pigmented epithelium.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5643-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen tissue sections of 10–15 μm were used for in situ and antibody stainings. Rabbit anti-mouse Inscuteable antibody was generated against an MBP fusion of mInsc lacking amino acids 1–198 and affinity purified against the antigen. For Figures 2D–2D′″, a tyramide signal amplification kit (TSA™ kit #12, Molecular Probes) was used after incubation with primary antibody. Anti-Islet-1 (T. Jessell) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Goat polyclonal NUMB and rabbit polyclonal GFP antibody were purchased from Abcam. Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs) was used to visualize DNA and mount the sections. Images were recorded on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described in Wilkinson and Nieto, 1993Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Detection of messenger RNA by in situ hybridization to tissue sections and whole mounts.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, and in situs on O.C.T. (Sakura) sections were performed as described previously (Neubuser et al., 1995Neubuser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Characterization and developmental expression of Pax9, a paired-box-containing gene related to Pax1.Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. A DIG-labeling kit (Roche) was used to synthesize RNA probes that were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG antibodies by using BM purple (Boehringer Mannheim). 1.7 kb of mInsc cDNA in pBluescript II KS+ was used as a template. MBP- and GST-fusion proteins were expressed under standard conditions and immobilized onto amylose or gluthation linked agarose beads (Sigma), respectively. For binding and washing, binding buffer (PBS/0.1% NP40) was used. In vitro translations were performed using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). 20 μl of fusion protein coupled to the respective beads were mixed with 100 μl binding buffer and 20 μl in vitro translated 35S-methionine containing protein, incubated for 2 hr at 4°C, and washed for 30 min with the binding buffer. Transfections of COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitations, and Western blots were performed as previously described (Kimple et al., 2004Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Hains M.D. Jones M.B. Nweke G.K.

Here we investigate the signaling pathways that enable excitatory synapses to undergo activity-dependent structural modifications. We report that activation of NMDA receptors in cultured cortical neurons induces spine morphogenesis and activation of the small GTPase Rap1. Rap1 bimodally regulates spine morphology: activated Rap1 recruits the PDZ domain-containing protein AF-6 to the plasma membrane and induces spine neck elongation, while inactive Rap1 dissociates AF-6 from the membrane and induces spine enlargement. Rap1 also regulates spine content of AMPA receptors: thin spines induced by Rap1 activation have reduced GluR1-containing AMPA receptor content, while large spines induced by Rap1 inactivation are rich in AMPA receptors. These results identify a signaling pathway that regulates activity-dependent synaptic structural plasticity and coordinates it with functional plasticity.

Dendritic spine morphogenesis plays a central role in brain development and plasticity (Hering and Sheng, 2001Hering H. Sheng M. Dendritic spines: structure, dynamics and regulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001Yuste R. Bonhoeffer T. Morphological changes in dendritic spines associated with long-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1071-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). During development, activity-dependent structural plasticity of dendrites and synapses is essential for the formation and refinement of neuronal circuits (Lendvai et al., 2000Lendvai B. Stern E.A.

Experience-dependent plasticity of dendritic spines in the developing rat barrel cortex in vivo.Nature. 2000; 404: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2000Wong W.T.

Morphological changes in dendritic spines associated with long-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1071-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). This is well exemplified by the massive spine turnover during the critical period in the barrel and visual cortices and its regulation by experiences such as whisker trimming or monocular deprivation (Lendvai et al., 2000Lendvai B.

In mature animals, activity-dependent changes of the postsynaptic structure are thought to contribute to the plasticity of neural circuits and possibly to learning and memory (Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001Yuste R. Bonhoeffer T. Morphological changes in dendritic spines associated with long-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1071-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). For example, modulation of sensory experience in live animals, such as whisker trimming, results in increased spine turnover in the barrel cortex, and these changes contribute to circuit refinement (Trachtenberg et al., 2002Trachtenberg J.T. Chen B.E. Knott G.W. Feng G. Sanes J.R. Welker E. Svoboda K.

At the cellular level, induction of long-lasting potentiation of CA1 synapses by high-frequency stimulation results in the input-specific appearance of new spines or remodeling of the existing spines (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T.

Bidirectional activity-dependent morphological plasticity in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2004; 44: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Such structural changes are thought to complement functional changes in synaptic strength (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Long-term potentiation—a decade of progress?.Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) and provide neural circuits the ability to rewire (Chklovskii et al., 2004Chklovskii D.B. Mel B.W. Svoboda K. Cortical rewiring and information storage.Nature. 2004; 431: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In addition, many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with defects in dendritic spine morphology and activity-dependent structural plasticity (Fiala et al., 2002Fiala J.C. Spacek J. Harris K.M. Dendritic spine pathology: cause or consequence of neurological disorders?.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Brain Res. 2005; 147: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated NMDA receptors and CaMKII in regulating activity-dependent structural plasticity (Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999Maletic-Savatic M. Malinow R. Svoboda K.

However, the molecular details of the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms regulating structural plasticity are largely unknown. Because structural and functional plasticity appear to be coordinated, it is particularly important to identify and characterize the common regulators of functional and structural plasticity that may coordinate these two aspects of synaptic plasticity (Luscher et al., 2000Luscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Synaptic plasticity and dynamic modulation of the postsynaptic membrane.Nat.

Structure-stability-function relationships of dendritic spines.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Synaptic signal transduction molecules play a critical role in regulating and coordinating different aspects of synaptic plasticity (Sheng and Kim, 2002Sheng M. Kim M.J. Postsynaptic signaling and plasticity mechanisms.Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, Kasai et al., 2003Kasai H. Matsuzaki M. Noguchi J. Yasumatsu N. Nakahara H. Structure-stability-function relationships of dendritic spines.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). One such signaling molecule is the Ras-like small GTPase Rap1, a regulator of multiple cellular events, including adhesion, cell polarity, and proliferation (Caron, 2003Caron E. Cellular functions of the Rap1 GTP-binding protein: a pattern emerges.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Stork, 2003Stork P.J. Does Rap1 deserve a bad Rap?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recent work implicated Rap1 in the regulation of AMPA receptor synaptic endocytosis during LTD (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu J.J. Qin Y. Zhao M. Van Aelst L. Malinow R. Ras and Rap control AMPA receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity.Cell. 2002; 110: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, Imamura et al., 2003Imamura Y. Matsumoto N. Kondo S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Possible involvement of Rap1 and Ras in glutamatergic synaptic transmission.Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in dendritic development (Chen et al., 2005Chen Y. Wang P.Y. Ghosh A. Regulation of cortical dendrite development by Rap1 signaling.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in regulation of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Morozov et al., 2003Morozov A. Muzzio I.A. Bourtchouladze R. Van-Strien N. Lapidus K. Yin D. Winder D.G. Adams J.P. Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R. Rap1 couples cAMP signaling to a distinct pool of p42/44MAPK regulating excitability, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.Neuron. 2003; 39: 309-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, a RapGAP, SPAR, regulates dendritic spine morphology (Pak et al., 2001Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Regulation of dendritic spine morphology by SPAR, a PSD-95-associated RapGAP.Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rap1 may be a key regulator of activity-dependent and -independent spine morphogenesis and a coordinator of functional and structural plasticity. Little is known about the targets of Rap1 or, in particular, about those that may have synaptic functions (Hering and Sheng, 2001Hering H. Sheng M. Dendritic spines: structure, dynamics and regulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). One of the few known Rap1-binding proteins is AF-6, a protein associated with epithelial adhesion junctions (Kuriyama et al., 1996Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Yamamoto D. Prasad R. Croce C. Canaani E. Kaibuchi K. Identification of AF-6 and canoe as putative targets for Ras.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). AF-6 binds activated Rap1 with a higher affinity than Ras or Rap2 (Linnemann et al., 1999Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the interaction between the Ras binding domain of AF6 and members of the Ras subfamily.J. Biol.

The junctional multidomain protein AF-6 is a binding partner of the Rap1A GTPase and associates with the actin cytoskeletal regulator profilin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and in Drospohila the AF-6 homolog canoe functions as a Rap1 effector (Boettner et al., 2003Boettner B. Harjes P. Ishimaru S. Heke M. Fan H.Q. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Gaul U. The AF-6 homolog canoe acts as a Rap1 effector during dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo.Genetics. 2003; 165: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Rap1 may be an in vivo AF-6 target. Two splice variants of AF-6 are expressed in the brain, a short (170 kDa) and a long isoform (205 kDa) (Mandai et al., 1997Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. et al.Afadin: A novel actin filament-binding protein with one PDZ domain localized at cadherin-based cell-to-cell adherens junction.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). L-AF-6 has two Ras/Rap-binding (RA) motifs, a kinesin-like and a myosin-like domain, followed by a PDZ domain. At the C terminus, L-AF-6 has a filamentous actin-binding domain. AF-6 has been previously shown to localize to synapses (Buchert et al., 1999Buchert M. Schneider S. Meskenaite V. Adams M.T. Canaani E. Baechi T. Moelling K. Hovens C.M. The junction-associated protein AF-6 interacts and clusters with specific Eph receptor tyrosine kinases at specialized sites of cell-cell contact in the brain.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Nishioka et al., 2000Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Takahashi K. Kimura K. Satoh-Moriya A. Takai Y.

Neurol. 2000; 424: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, AF-6 is a strong candidate to mediate Rap1 effects on spine morphogenesis. In this study, we investigated the intracellular signaling pathways that confer neurons the ability to alter their dendritic and synaptic morphology in response to changes in synaptic activity. We report that activation of NMDA receptors in neuronal cultures induces dramatic spine morphogenesis. We show that Rap1, which is activated after NMDA receptor activation, regulates synaptic structural plasticity in a bimodal fashion. We identify AF-6 as a postsynaptic target of activated Rap1 and show that Rap1 regulates the membrane recruitment of AF-6. AF-6 regulates spine morphogenesis in a similar manner as NMDA receptor activation and activated Rap1. In addition, Rap1 regulates AMPA receptor content in spines. Altogether, we provide evidence that Rap1 and AF-6 function in a postsynaptic signaling pathway that regulates synaptic structural changes during synaptic plasticity. Recent studies suggested that patterned synaptic activity induces dendritic spine morphogenesis in experimental systems such as brain slices and in intact animals (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F.

Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Spaced stimuli stabilize MAPK pathway activation and its effects on dendritic morphology.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular mechanisms of activity-dependent structural plasticity of synapses, we set out to identify and characterize the mechanisms and signal transduction pathways that link NMDA receptor activation with structural plasticity of spines. We therefore sought to find a method to induce spine formation by activation of NMDA receptors with stimuli that also induced activity-dependent functional plasticity in cultured neurons. We used primary cultures of cortical neurons to allow for a better visualization of morphological events and as a model system to study the underlying intracellular signaling mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that activation of NMDA receptors by withdrawal of the NMDA receptor antagonist APV from neurons cultured in APV resulted in insertion of AMPA receptors into silent synapses and induction of potentiation of the mEPSCs (Liao et al., 1999Liao D.

Liao D. Temporal dynamics of NMDA receptor-induced changes in spine morphology and AMPA receptor recruitment to spines.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether this treatment also induced spine morphogenesis. To visualize the morphology of spines, neurons were transfected with GFP and then subjected to APV withdrawal (APV wd). Control neurons were maintained in APV (+APV). We observed that removal of APV for 30 min from 4-week-old cortical neurons cultured in presence of 200 μM APV, followed by a recovery of 2 hr in APV-containing medium, resulted in dramatic spine morphogenesis. This structural plasticity appeared as an increase in the number of thin and long spines with elongated necks and an overall increase in the number of dendritic protrusions (Figure 1A-B). Double staining of these cultures with an antibody against the presynaptic marker bassoon revealed that the majority of these elongated spines contacted presynaptic terminals, suggesting that they may be functional spines (Figure 1C). We used single-factor ANOVA analysis to quantify this and all other data sets and to determine the statistical significance of the differences between experimental groups (Penzes et al., 2003Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L. Rapid induction of dendritic spine morphogenesis by trans-synaptic ephrinB-EphB receptor activation of the Rho-GEF Kalirin.Neuron. 2003; 37: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In treated neurons (APV wd) versus control (+APV) neurons, the averages of spine areas (1.33 ± 1.0 μm2 versus 0.50 ± 0.3 μm2, ANOVA: p < 0.0001), length (2.81 ± 1.53 μm versus 1.16 ± 0.75 μm, p < 0.0001), and density (44.5 ± 4.5 spines/100 μm versus 29.1 ± 4.2 spines/100 μm, p < 0.0001) were significantly different (Figure 1D). We next sought to identify signaling mechanisms that mediated spine morphogenesis induced by NMDA receptor activation upon APV withdrawal. Because the small GTPase Rap1 has recently been implicated in the regulation of dendritic development, AMPA receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity, neuronal excitability, and learning and memory, it was likely that it was also important for structural plasticity (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu J.J.

Regulation of cortical dendrite development by Rap1 signaling.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rap1 was activated following NMDA receptor activation in 4-week-old dissociated primary cortical neuronal cultures, we activated NMDA receptors by APV withdrawal, and 2 hr later we examined the activation of endogenous Rap1 using an affinity binding-based activity assay (Rebhun et al., 2000Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. Identification of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rap1 GTPase: regulation of MR-GEF by M-Ras-GTP interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34907Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Western blotting revealed that while there was a low level of basal Rap1 activation, APV withdrawal resulted in a significant enhancement in Rap1 activation (statistically significant difference by Student's t test, p < 0.01) (Figures 1E and 1G). To determine whether another chemical treatment known to induce plasticity-like phenomena in cultured neurons also regulated Rap1 activation, we treated cortical neurons cultured in the absence of APV with 100 μM glycine for 3 min (Figures 1F and 1G; ∗p < 0.05) (Lu et al., 2001Lu W.Y. Man H.Y. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This treatment is thought to activate exclusively synaptic NMDA receptors and results in an increase in mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In accordance with the previous experiment, treatment with glycine also resulted in activation of Rap1. These experiments demonstrate that activation of NMDA receptors by stimuli that also induce functional plasticity-like events results in activation of Rap1, suggesting that Rap1 may be a mediator of NMDA receptor activation-dependent spine structural plasticity. Rap1 is present in the PSD (Mizoguchi et al., 1990Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. Localization and subcellular distribution of smg p25A, a ras p21-like GTP-binding protein, in rat brain.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a regulator of Rap, the Rap-GAP SPAR, has been shown to induce changes in spine morphology, suggesting that Rap signaling may regulate spine morphogenesis (Pak et al., 2001Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Regulation of dendritic spine morphology by SPAR, a PSD-95-associated RapGAP.Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that Rap1 may also play a key role in regulating synaptic structural plasticity. To examine the function of Rap1 in regulating spine morphogenesis, we transfected cortical neuronal cultures (DIV 21) with constitutively active Rap1-63E (Rap1-CA) or RapGAP1 to inactivate Rap, along with GFP (Figure 2) (Rubinfeld et al., 1991Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Molecular cloning of a GTPase activating protein specific for the Krev-1 protein p21rap1.Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two days later (at DIV 23), we fixed and stained the neurons. In transfected neurons, Rap1-CA was in the soma and dendritic shafts, but it was also present in the spine heads of a considerable fraction of spines, suggesting that it may be partially targeted to spines (arrowheads) (Figure 2A). Neurons expressing Rap-CA had significantly longer spines compared to neurons expressing GFP alone (Figure 2A, arrowheads): length (2.82 ± 1.6 μm versus 1.24 ± 0.5 μm, p < 0.0001); area (1.25 ± 1.08 μm2 versus 0.47 ± 0.29 μm2, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B). However, the spine densities were similar between the control and Rap-CA-expressing neurons (31.77 ± 5.4 spines/100 μm versus 28.7 ± 4.0 spines/100 μm, p = 0.2). An intriguing feature of these spines was that they were thin and long and closely resembled those induced by APV withdrawal. In contrast, in neurons expressing RapGAP1, we observed an increase in spine sizes that resulted in increased average spine area compared to those on control or Rap1-CA-expressing neurons (RapGAP1: area, 1.97 ± 1.1 versus 0.47 ± 0.29, p < 0.0001; length, 1.74 ± 1.0 versus 1.25 ± 0.5, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2A, open arrowheads). Expression of Rap1-CA or RapGAP1 had no effect on spine density. Statistical analysis revealed that the spine elongation morphologies induced by APV withdrawal and Rap1 activation were similar and statistically indistinguishable (area, 1.33 ± 1.0 μm2 versus 1.25 ± 1.08 μm2, p = 0.75; length, 2.81 ± 1.53 μm versus 2.82 ± 1.6 μm, p = 0.37), suggesting that Rap1 may link synaptic NMDA receptor activation to spine morphogenesis. Because we have shown that Rap1 regulates spine morphogenesis, we became interested in identifying Rap1 targets that may mediate its function in structural plasticity. Little is known about direct binding targets of activated Rap1 in general and in synapses in particular. We therefore searched for proteins that contained Rap1-binding motifs and that could potentially be localized to synapses. One such protein was AF-6, previously characterized as a component of epithelial adherens junctions (Kuriyama et al., 1996Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A.

The formation of dendritic spines is a critical aspect of synaptic development. Dendritic spine morphogenesis is characterized by filopodia shortening followed by the formation of mature mushroom-shaped spines. Here we show that activation of the EphB receptor tyrosine kinases in cultured hippocampal neurons by their ephrinB ligands induces morphogenesis of dendritic filopodia into dendritic spines. This appears to occur through assembly of an EphB-associated protein complex that includes focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, Grb2, and paxillin and the subsequent activations of FAK, Src, paxillin, and RhoA. Furthermore, Cre-mediated knock-out of loxP-flanked fak or RhoA inhibition blocks EphB-mediated morphogenesis of dendritic filopodia. Finally, EphB-mediated RhoA activation is disrupted by FAK knock-down. These data suggest that EphB receptors are upstream regulators of FAK in dendritic filopodia and that FAK-mediated RhoA activation contributes to assembly of actin filaments in dendritic spines.

These data suggest that EphB receptors are upstream regulators of FAK in dendritic filopodia and that FAK-mediated RhoA activation contributes to assembly of actin filaments in dendritic spines. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases constitute one of the largest families of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. The family is divided into type A and type B receptor subclasses based on their sequence similarity and ability to bind ephrinA or ephrinB ligands, although some binding interactions between two groups have also been reported (1Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Ephephrin interactions are unique because they generate bi-directional signals, with signaling from the Ephs being termed “forward signaling” and signaling from the ephrins being termed “reverse signaling.” The intracellular domains of both ephrinBs and Ephs are tyrosine-phosphorylated following tetramerization, and intracellular signaling pathways are activated (3Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). EphB-ephrinB interactions are implicated in repulsive axonal guidance, cell migration, topographic mapping, and angiogenesis (4Krull C.E. Lansford R. Gale N.W. Collazo A. Marcelle C. Yancopoulos G.D.

Besides their roles in development, the connection between EphBs and the formation of mature dendritic spines in neurons has been recently demonstrated (9Ethell I.M. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R.

Dendritic spines are small protrusions on the surface of neuronal dendrites that represent the postsynaptic components of most excitatory synapses in the brain. It is believed that a synaptic contact between dendritic filopodia and axon terminals induces morphogenesis of dendritic filopodia into dendritic spines, which is characterized by filopodia shortening and formation of mature mushroom-shaped spines (13Ethell I.M. Pasquale E.B. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 161-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Abnormal development of dendritic spines has been shown to be associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, among them Rett syndrome, Down's syndrome, Angleman's syndrome, and Fragile X mental retardation (13Ethell I.M. Pasquale E.B. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 161-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 14Fiala J.C. Spacek J. Harris K.M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The inhibition of EphB forward signaling by the overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of EphB2 (kiEphB2) or triple EphB1/B2/B3 knock-out in cultured hippocampal neurons blocked normal spine formation, resulting in retention of the filopodia (9Ethell I.M.

In contrast, the activation of EphB receptors resulted in filopodia retraction and shortening (12Henkemeyer M. Itkis O.S. Ngo M. Hickmott P.W. Ethell I.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which EphBs drive spine formation have begun to emerge and may involve the phosphorylation and subsequent clustering of syndecan-2 (9Ethell I.M. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R.

Here we show that activation of EphB2 in cultured hippocampal neurons by its ephrinB ligands results in shortening of dendritic filopodia through the assembly of a protein complex resembling a focal adhesion complex. This complex includes focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, Grb2, and paxillin. Furthermore, EphB2 activation leads to the activations of FAK, Src, and paxillin, potentially initiating a number of downstream signaling pathways. Disruption of FAK expression through either Cre-mediated deletion of loxP-flanked fak or siRNA-mediated knock-down of FAK blocks EphB-mediated dendritic filopodia morphogenesis. Moreover, this downstream signaling appears to involve the activation of RhoA because overexpression of constitutively active RhoAV14 mimics the effects of ephrinB2-Fc administration, and EphB-mediated filopodia shortening is blocked by the expression of dominant negative RhoA. Our data suggest that EphB receptors are upstream regulators of FAK in dendritic filopodia, and FAK-mediated RhoA activation contributes to assembly of actin filaments in dendritic spines.

Secondary antibodies used for WB were: HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (0.08 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (0.08 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat (0.04 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.).

Hippocampal Neuron Culture Transfection—Cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons were prepared from mouse E15–16 embryos (wild type and mutant) as previously described with modifications (9Ethell I.M. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R. Pasquale E.B. Yamaguchi Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 1001-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The hippocampal cultures were transiently transfected with GFP at 1–5 days in vitro (DIV) using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (20Ethell I.M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Ligand Induction of EphB2 Receptor—To activate the EphBs in cultured hippocampal neurons, we used ephrinB1-Fc or ephrinB2-Fc (R & D) preclustered with anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) prior to the application. To precluster, ephrinB1-Fc, ephrinB2-Fc, or control human Fc fragments were mixed with goat anti-human Fc antibody in a 1:2 ratio and incubated on ice for 1 h before being applied to the cultured neurons. Incubations prior to biochemical assays lasted 15 min, whereas those preceding immunofluorescent labeling lasted 30–60 min. Cell-bound preclustered ephrinB2-Fc/goat anti-human Fc antibody complex was visualized at the cell surface with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG. Two-dimensional Electrophoretic Identification of EphB2-associated Proteins—Briefly, cultured hippocampal neurons were treated at 7 DIV with preclustered ephrinB2-Fc or preclustered human Fc (control) for 15 min. EphB2-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-EphB2 antibody (9Ethell I.M. Kalo M.S. Couchman J.R. Pasquale E.B. Yamaguchi Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 1001-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) from Triton-soluble extracts of the treated cells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated using a two-dimensional system (Ettan IPGhor; Amersham Biosciences) with 13-cm strips, pH 3–10, for the first dimension and an isoelectric focusing step in conjunction with 6–18% gradient SDS-PAGE mini-gel for the second dimension. The gels were silver-stained in a fashion optimized to be compatible with subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Spots representing proteins associated with the EphB2 were compared between EphrinB2-Fc-induced versus Fc-treated control cultures. Single protein spots reproducible in three independent experiments were cut, destained, and “in-gel” trypsin-digested, and the peptides were extracted for mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer DE-STR (PE Biosystems). Biochemical Assays—For co-immunoprecipitations, cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with 2 μg/ml preclustered ephrinB1-Fc, ephrinB2-Fc, or control Fc for 15 min, and the cell lysates of cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared as previously described (12Henkemeyer M. Itkis O.S. Ngo M. Hickmott P.W. Ethell I.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The lysates were incubated with 1 μg of one of the following antibodies: anti-EphB2, anti-FAK, anti-Src, anti-Grb2, or anti-paxillin and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The bound materials were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 8–16% Tris-glycine gels, and immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies followed by incubation with corresponding secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and ECL detection. To assess the role of Src in the EphB2-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin, 7-DIV cultured hippocampal neurons were pretreated with 0.5 μm PP2 (Calbiochem) or PP3 (Calbiochem) for 45 min prior to induction with preclustered recombinant ephrinB2-Fc or control Fc as described above. The ligand inductions were performed for 15 min, the cultures were lysed and immunoprecipitated against paxillin (1 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin; BD Transduction Laboratories), and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibody (1.25 μg/ml; BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-Tyr(P)31 paxillin antibody (1 μg/ml; BIOSOURCE International, Inc.), or total paxillin with mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (0.75 μg/ml; BD Transduction Laboratories). For quantification purposes, the densitometric values of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were normalized to the values of the corresponding total protein bands using Adobe Photoshop. To assess RhoA activation, preclustered ephrinB2-Fc or control human Fc was applied to 7-DIV hippocampal neuron cultures for 15 min. Following treatment, the cells were lysed, a portion of the lysate was retained for use in the assessment of total RhoA, and GTP-RhoA (active form of RhoA) was immunoprecipitated from the remainder of the lysate using GST-RBD beads (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed four times, the bound material was eluted with Laemmli buffer, and Western immunoblot analysis was performed. The membranes were probed with anti-Rho antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The level of GTP-RhoA was quantified by densitometry and normalized to total RhoA levels in the lysates (GTP-RhoA/total RhoA). Immunostaining—Preclustered ephrinB2-Fc or control human Fc was applied to 7-DIV cultures. After 30–60 min of treatment, the cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-EphB2, goat anti-EphB2, mouse anti-FAK, mouse anti-paxillin, rabbit anti-Src, rabbit anti-Tyr(P)397 FAK, rabbit anti-Tyr(P)418 Src; and rabbit anti-Tyr(P)31 paxillin. Bound antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies: Alexa 594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated chicken anti-mouse IgG (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.). Immunostaining was analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) or an inverted fluorescent microscope (model TE300; Nikon) as previously described (12Henkemeyer M. Itkis O.S. Ngo M. Hickmott P.W. Ethell I.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20Ethell I.M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Digital images were imported into Photoshop 7.0 (21Rossner M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Image Analysis—The effects of EphB activation on dendritic filopodia were examined in 7-DIV GFP-expressing hippocampal neurons as previously described (20Ethell I.M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proximal dendrites (identified as processes extended from the neuronal cell body, at least 1 μm in diameter and also microtubule-associated protein 2-positive) were selected for the analysis of the length and number of dendritic protrusions. Hidden protrusions that protruded toward the back or front of the viewing plane were not counted. 10–15 GFP-expressing neurons were randomly selected for each experimental group, and three or four proximal dendrites/each neuron were analyzed. The length of a protrusion was determined by measuring the distance between its tip and base using Image Pro Plus software. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Statistical differences between Fc-treated control and ephrinB2-Fc-treated experimental groups of dendritic protrusions were compared by Student's t test. Statistical differences for multiple groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. For quantification of immunoreactive clusters, inverted fluorescent images (single channel) were analyzed using Image Pro Plus Software. Immunoreactive clusters were defined as 0.1–1.0-μm puncta along the proximal dendrites (with an average pixel intensity at least 50% above that in the adjacent dendritic region) and were counted manually. 10–15 neurons were randomly selected for each experimental group, and three or four proximal dendrites/each neuron were analyzed. The statistical differences between Fc-treated controls and the ephrinB2-Fc-treated group were compared with Student's t test. Conditional FAK Knock-out—Hippocampal neurons were harvested from E15–16 fak conditional (Cre-loxP) knock-out mice (22Beggs H.E. Schahin-Reed D. Zang K. Goebbels S. Nave K.A. Gorski J. Jones K.R. Sretavan D. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 2003; 40: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and cultured as previously described (12Henkemeyer M. Itkis O.S. Ngo M. Hickmott P.W. Ethell I.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The pPGK-Cre vector was obtained from Dr. Marc Schmidt-Supprian (Harvard Medical School). The cultures were transfected at 4–5 DIV using the calcium phosphate method with pEGFP alone or pEGFP + pPGK-Cre. At 7 DIV, the cultures were treated with preclustered Fc or ephrinB2-Fc for 60 min as described under “Ligand Induction of EphB2 Receptor” and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Dendritic protrusions were visualized by GFP fluorescence, counted, and measured as described under “Image Analysis.” FAK knock-out was assessed through FAK immunofluorescent labeling. The double GFP/Cre transfected neurons with no FAK immunoreactive fluorescence above the background were considered FAK knock-outs (see Fig. 5A, arrow). The untransfected counterparts (see Fig. 5A, arrowheads) or control GFP-transfected neurons (see Fig. 5B) showed FAK immunoreactivity. RhoA Activation or Inhibition—To directly assess the effects of RhoA activation or inhibition on dendritic morphology, 5 DIV hippocampal neurons were double transfected with GFP and Myc-tagged constitutively active RhoA V14 or GFP and hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative RhoA N19 (both kind gifts of Dr. Katie Defea). Control samples were transfected with GFP only. At 7 DIV, the cultures were treated with preclustered Fc or ephrinB2-Fc for 60 min and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. RhoA V14-transfected cells were labeled with rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.), RhoA N19-transfected cells were labeled with mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The dendritic protrusions were visualized through GFP fluorescence, counted, and measured as described under “Image Analysis.” siRNA Knockdown of FAK—FAK siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (catalog number sc-35353) and transfected into 4-DIV cultured hippocampal neurons using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1.8 μl of siRNA and 1.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/well were reacted together, and transfection was carried out in antibiotic-free Neurobasal medium for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5%CO2, 10%O2 atmosphere. Dendritic spines were visualized by labeling with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin, counted, and measured using Scion Image software. The knock-down efficiency was evaluated through Western immunoblot analysis of FAK expression and FAK immunofluorescent labeling in siRNA-treated versus control samples. EphB2 Receptor Recruits FAK, Src, and Grb2 following Ligand-mediated Activation—To identify the signaling molecules that associate with ligand-activated EphB2 in 7-DIV hippocampal neuron cultures following treatment with ephrinB2-Fc, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument. A number of proteins were identified in samples from ephrinB2-Fc treated cultures that were not present in Fc-treated cultures. FAK (p125FAK; Swiss Protein Data Base accession number P34152) was identified among the proteins associated with ephrinB2-induced EphB2. To further confirm our mass spectrometry data, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. For these studies, 7-DIV cultures of hippocampal neurons were treated with either preclustered Fc (control) or preclustered recombinant ephrinB1-Fc or ephrinB2-Fc for 15 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation against EphB2 and were probed via Western blot for FAK. FAK was found to associate with EphB2 following EphB2 activation, a finding also confirmed by FAK immunoprecipitation followed by EphB2 immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Further reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation study identified the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src (Fig. 1B) and the adaptor protein Grb2 (Fig. 1B, right panel) in the EphB2 immunoreactive complex following EphB activation. Because FAK binds numerous proteins itself, we were also interested in assessing FAK-associated proteins. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations identified Src and Grb2 as FAK binding partners following EphB2 activation as well (Fig. 1, B, right panel, and C, respectively). EphB2 activation was confirmed throughout these studies by immunoblotting against phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2A). These data show that EphB2 recruits FAK, Src, and Grb2 following its activation, which suggests that EphB2 might act through a FAK/Src-based mechanism. FAK and Src Are Activated in Response to EphB2 Activation—With the realization that FAK and Src were components of the EphB2-associated protein complex came the question of how EphB2 activation might be affecting the activation of these kinases. Immunoprecipitations against EphB2, Src, or FAK and immunoblots against phosphotyrosine confirmed increases in EphB2, Src, and FAK phosphorylation following EphB2 activation (Fig. 2, A and B). A robust increase (∼48%) in the phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 397, a known activator of FAK, was seen in response to treatment with ephrinB2-Fc (Fig. 2B). The increases in FAK phosphorylation on tyrosine 397 were comparable with changes in Src phosphorylation on tyrosine 418 (∼40%; Fig. 2, A and B). These data show that levels of specific FAK phosphorylation on tyrosine 397 and Src phosphorylation on tyrosine 418 are significantly increased following ephrinB2-mediated EphB2 activation, indicating that EphB receptors activate FAK and Src following their recruitments. EphB2, Tyr(P)397FAK, and Tyr(P)418Src Form Discrete Puncta in Dendrites of Hippocampal Neurons Following Treatment with EphrinB2-Fc—Although it was clear from our previous experiments that EphB2, FAK, and Src become associated with one another and activated following treatment with ephrinB2-Fc, we wished to assess whether these associations and activations were occurring specifically in the dendrites. Therefore, we next turned our attention to the cellular distribution of EphB2, FAK, and Src in ephrinB2-induced and control Fc-induced 7-DIV cultured hippocampal neurons through immunocytochemistry. Both EphB2 and active Tyr(P)397FAK formed discrete clusters along the dendritic cell surfaces following treatment with ephrinB2-Fc (Fig. 3, A and C). The distributions of these proteins were relatively diffuse in the absence of EphB2 activation, suggesting that treatment with ephrinB2-Fc drives the formation of these clusters. The double immunolabeling also showed co-localization of EphB puncta and Tyr(P)397FAK clusters as a result of the ephrinB2-mediated activation of EphB2 (Fig. 3E, arrows). Although Src distribution did not appear to change following EphB activation (Fig. 3B), the phosphorylation of Src on tyrosine 418 significantly increased (Fig. 3, D and G), specifically at the sites of EphB clustering (Fig. 3F, arrows). These data show that ephrinB2-mediated activation of EphB receptors induces clustering and co-localization of Tyr(P)397FAK, Tyr(P)418Src, and EphB2 in hippocampal neurons. Paxillin Phosphorylation Induced by EphB2 Activation Depends on Src Activity—Recruitment of Src and FAK to the EphB2-associated complex and their increased phosphorylation suggested that other proteins of focal adhesion complexes such as paxillin might also associate with the complex. Immunoprecipitations against FAK and immunoblotting against paxillin showed that FAK association with paxillin was also induced following EphB2 activation (Fig. 2C), thus leading to the conclusion that the protein complex that associates with EphB2 following its activation includes FAK, Grb2, Src, and paxillin. Interestingly, the total tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and the specific phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosine 31 (Figs. 2C and 4, A and B) increased significantly from base levels following EphB2 activation. These increases were ablated by pretreatment with PP2 (a Src inhibitor; Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that Src serves to activate paxillin following EphB activation. Although paxillin appeared to be relatively abundant in our neurons, and visible clustering was difficult to detect following treatment with ephrinB2-Fc (Fig. 4C), the immunolabeling of hippocampal neurons with an antibody specifically recognizing phosphorylated/activated paxillin (Tyr(P)31pax) showed a significant increase in clustering of phosphorylated paxillin at the sites of EphB clustering following treatment with ephrinB2-Fc (Fig.4D, arrows). These data suggest that EphB2 activation initiates signaling events that include the recruitment and activation of FAK, Src, and paxillin, all of which may lead to the activation of numerous downstream signaling pathways. Disruption of FAK Expression Blocks EphB2-mediated Dendritic Filopodia Shortening—We previously reported that ephrinB2-mediated activation of EphB receptors had pronounced effects on dendritic protrusions in vitro (12Henkemeyer M.

https://openalex.org/W2086964976,"During mitosis, kinesin and dynein motor proteins play critical roles in the equal segregation of chromosomes between two daughter cells. Kinesin-2 is composed of two microtubule-based motor subunits, KIF3A/3B, and a kinesin-associated protein known as KAP3, which links KIF3A/3B to cargo that is carried to cellular organelles along microtubules in interphase cells. We have shown here that the kinesin-2 complex is localized with components of the mitotic apparatus such as spindle microtubules and centrosomes. Furthermore, we found that expression of a mutant KIF3B, which is able to associate with KIF3A but not KAP3 in NIH3T3 cells, caused chromosomal aneuploidy and abnormal spindle formation. Our data suggested that the kinesin-2 complex plays an important role not only in interphase but also in mitosis. During mitosis, kinesin and dynein motor proteins play critical roles in the equal segregation of chromosomes between two daughter cells.

Chromosomes are equally segregated into two daughter cells during mitosis, and errors in this process may result in chromosomal aneuploidy, cancer, or cell death. The kinesin superfamily of proteins (KIFs), 3The abbreviations used are: KIF, kinesin superfamily of proteins; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. as well as cytoplasmic dynein, play critical roles in centrosome separation, spindle formation, and chromosome alignment and segregation (1.Heald R.

For example, Kid, a member of the chromosome-associated KIFs, is important for chromosome alignment and orientation (3.Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). KIF4, together with microtubule-bundling protein PRC1, participates in the organization of central spindle midzone formation (6.Kurasawa Y. Earnshaw W.C. Mochizuki Y. Dohmae N. Todokoro K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Caenorhabditis elegans ZEN-4/MKLP1 is required for central spindle assembly and cytokinesis (7.Mishima M. Pavicic V. Gruneberg U. Nigg E.A. Glotzer M. Nature. 2004; 430: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric kinesin-2 complex was first identified by Cole et al. (8.Cole D.G. Cande W.Z. Baskin R.J. Skoufias D.A. Hogan C.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 291-301PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Cole D.G. Chinn S.W. Wedaman K.P. Hall K. Vuong T. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Kinesin-2 is one of the most ubiquitously expressed KIFs (10.Kondo S. Sato-Yoshitake R. Noda Y. Aizawa H. Nakata T. Matsuura Y.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the intracellular transport of membrane-bound organelles and protein complexes in various tissues such as neurons, melanosomes, and epithelial cells (12.Tuma M.C.

A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The KIF3A/3B heterodimer possesses a plus-end-directed microtubule sliding activity that uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (11.Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). On the other hand, KAP3 links KIF3A/3B with various cargo proteins, including fodrin and the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). By binding to fodrin, the kinesin-2 heterotrimer transports fodrin-associating vesicles that are important for neurite building (13.Takeda S. Yamazaki H. Seog D.H. Kanai Y. Terada S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Also, the kinesin-2 heterotrimer transports APC along microtubules to the tips of membrane protrusions (14.Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although kinesin-2 has mainly been reported to participate in intracellular transport in interphase cells, it has been shown to localize at the mitotic apparatus. In Chlamydomonas, the KIF3A homolog FLA10 protein is most abundant near the centrioles and the mitotic spindle during mitosis (17.Vashishtha M. Walther Z. Hall J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 541-549PubMed Google Scholar). The sea urchin kinesin-2 homolog, kinesin II, is present transiently in the mitotic apparatus of dividing embryos (18.Henson J.H. Cole D.G. Terasaki M. Rashid D. Scholey J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, detailed functional analyses have revealed that kinesin-2 is not critical for the progression of mitosis in both Chlamydomonas and sea urchin embryos (see “Discussion”) (19.Miller M.S. Esparza J.M. Lippa A.M. Lux III, F.G. Cole D.G. Dutcher S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3810-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20.Morris R.L. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have attempted to investigate the function and regulation of kinesin-2 during mitosis in mammalian cells and have found that kinesin-2 localizes to the mitotic apparatus and contributes to molecular events important for the progression of mitosis. Cell Culture—HeLa, HEK293T and Plat-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceuticals, Taito, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody to KAP3 (N1 and C2) were prepared as described previously (14.Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to KIF3A and KIF3B were prepared by immunizing rabbits with peptides containing amino acids 563–671 of KIF3A and 657–747 of KIF3B, respectively. Antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using columns to which the antigens used for immunization had been linked. Monoclonal antibody to KIF3A/3B (Kinesin II) was obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Monoclonal antibodies to α-tubulin and cyclin B1 were from Oncogene Research (Boston, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-245, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to GFP were from Quantum (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and Clontech, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.5, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF) containing 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 4° C. The immuno complexes were adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Blocking of antibodies was performed by preincubating antibodies (1–2 μg) for 1 h at4°C with a 100-fold molar excess of the antigens used for immunization. After washing extensively with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was analyzed by immunoblotting with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega BioSciences, San Luis Obispo, CA) as a secondary antibody. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-KAP3 C2 polyclonal antibody, 1:1,000; anti-KIF3A/3B monoclonal antibody, 1: 1,000; anti-KIF3A and KIF3B polyclonal antibody, 1:1,000; anticyclin B1 monoclonal antibody, 1:250; anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, 1:250; anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody, 1:1,000. Immunostaining—HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C and then fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1, v/v) for 10 min at –20 °C. Fixed cells were incubated with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and were double-stained with antibodies against KAP3 C2 (polyclonal) and α-tubulin (monoclonal), KIF3A or KIF3B (polyclonal) and α-tubulin (monoclonal), or GFP (polyclonal) and α-tubulin (monoclonal). Staining patterns obtained with these antibodies were visualized by incubation with secondary antibodies: fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (for KAP3, KIF3A/3B, and GFP) and tetramethylrhodamine-5 (and -6)-isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (for α-tubulin). Chromosomes were stained with TOTO3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Dilutions of primary antibodies were as follows: anti-KAP3 C2 polyclonal antibody, 1:100; anti-KIF3A or KIF3B polyclonal antibody, 1:50; anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, 1:100, anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody, 1:100. Cells were photographed with a Carl Zeiss LSM510 laser microscope (Göttingen, Germany). Phosphatase Treatment—KAP3 immunoprecipitates were washed three times with bacterial alkaline phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min with 0.2 units of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan) in the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm NaF). Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa cells were synchronized by thymidine at the G1/S boundary as described (21.Heintz N. Sive H.L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for an additional 12 h under normal growth conditions. Finally, thymidine was added again for 12 h to block cells at the G1/S boundary. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and placed under fresh growth medium. Cells were harvested at various time points as indicated. To obtain more enriched M phase cells, exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 24 h. Mitotic rounded-up cells were collected by gentle pipetting. Retroviral Infection—DNA fragments encoding GFP-KIF3A or GFP-KIF3B were cloned into the retroviral vector pMX-puro (22.Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). The retroviral vectors were transiently transfected into Plat-E cells using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After 24 h, cells were changed into fresh medium. After an additional 24 h, culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants, together with 10 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), were added to NIH3T3 cells. The infected cells were selected using 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 3 days. KAP3 Is Phosphorylated during Mitosis—To investigate the role of kinesin-2 in mitosis, we first examined the expression and modification of KIF3A/3B and KAP3 using HeLa cells released from double thymidine block. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the levels of KIF3A/3B and KAP3 expression increased slightly during G2/M progression (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a protein larger than the normal KAP3 was found to appear concomitant with the start of cyclin B destruction. Treatment of KAP3 immunoprecipitates with bacterial alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of this protein and a concomitant increase in the normal migrating form of KAP3, and this conversion was not observed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that KAP3 is phosphorylated during mitosis. KIF3A/3B and KAP3 Form a Complex during Mitosis—We next examined whether KIF3A/3B is associated with KAP3 in HeLa cells that were synchronized at mitosis by nocodazole treatment. Lysates from nocodazole-treated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-KAP3 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-KIF3A/3B antibodies. We found that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of KAP3 coprecipitated with KIF3A/3B and that coprecipitation was inhibited by preincubation of anti-KAP3 antibody with the antigen used for immunization (Fig. 2). Thus, KIF3A/3B are associated with KAP3 during mitosis. Regions Required for KIF3A/3B and KAP3 Interaction—To determine the regions of KIF3A/3B responsible for their interaction with KAP3, we generated various deletion mutants of KIF3A/3B. When ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells, the two KIF3A/3B mutants lacking the C-terminal regions failed to coprecipitate with KAP3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, KIF3A/3B mutants containing the C-terminal regions coprecipitated with KAP3. Thus, the C-terminal regions of KIF3A/3B are important for their interaction with KAP3. Similar experiments with various deletion mutants of KAP3 revealed that a fragment containing amino acids 528–694 is able to interact with KIF3A/3B (Fig. 3B). In addition, a fragment of KAP3 containing amino acids 1–614 was found to retain KIF3A/3B binding activity. Thus, amino acids 528–614 of KAP3 may be important for its interaction with KIF3A/3B. KIF3A/3B and KAP3 Localize to the Mitotic Apparatus—We next examined the subcellular localization of KIF3A/3B and KAP3 in mitosis. Since commercially available anti-KIF3A/3B monoclonal antibodies were not suitable for immunostaining analysis, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal regions of KIF3A and KIF3B, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis using HeLa cell lysates revealed that each antibody specifically recognizes KIF3A and KIF3B, respectively (Fig. 4A). This result is consistent with the fact that there is little amino acid sequence similarity among the C-terminal regions of the KIF family of proteins. Immunostaining analysis with these antibodies revealed intense KIF3A staining localized at the centrosomes in interphase and prophase cells but only weak staining at the centrosomes after prometaphase (Fig. 4B). When chromosomes began to condense and the mitotic spindle was formed in prometaphase, KIF3A was localized mainly at the spindle microtubules. From metaphase through telophase, KIF3A was concentrated at the midzone and was present mainly at the centrosomes during cytokinesis. KIF3A was also localized around the cellular cortex throughout mitosis. We also examined KAP3 localization during mitosis using a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of KAP3 (C2) (14.Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). When cells entered prometaphase, KAP3 was found to be localized at the centrosomes and spindle microtubules (Fig. 4C). In metaphase, KAP3 was also detected on the chromosomes, and this localization was especially prominent on the chromosomes. From metaphase to telophase, KAP3 was concentrated intensively at centrosomes and midzone and remained at the centrosome during cytokinesis. Thus, the immunostaining patterns of KAP3 were partially similar to those of KIF3A. These results suggested that a certain population of KIF3A/3B and KAP3 colocalizes at the mitotic apparatus. Effects of KIF3 Mutants on Mitotic Progression—To elucidate the function of kinesin-2 in mitosis, we expressed a fragment of KIF3B fused to GFP (Fig. 3A, GFP-KIF3B Mutant 3 (Mut 3)) in NIH3T3 cells by retrovirus and examined its effects on the progression of mitosis. This fragment lacks the C-terminal one-third of KIF3B and is unable to form a complex with KAP3 (Fig. 3A) but can still associate with KIF3A (data not shown). Although this mutant was localized at the spindle microtubules, similar to wild-type KIF3B, cells expressing this mutant showed an unusual number of centrosomes and abnormal spindle formation (Fig. 5A). By contrast, cells expressing the full-length KIF3B fused to GFP or control retrovirus vector did not show any abnormality in mitosis. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the frequency of chromosomal aneuploidy in cells expressing this mutant was about three times higher than that of cells expressing the full-length KIF3B fused to GFP or control retrovirus vector (Fig. 5B). Similar aberrant mitosis was found to occur when a fragment of KIF3A fused to GFP (Fig. 3A, GFP-KIF3A Mutant 3 (Mut 3)), which can form a complex with KIF3B but cannot interact with KAP3, was expressed in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the interaction of KIF3A/3B with KAP3 may be important for the proper progression of mitosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that human KIF3A/3B and KAP3 form a complex in mitosis and that they localize at the mitotic apparatus, mainly at the spindle microtubules and centrosomes in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we showed that expression of a dominant-negative mutant of KIF3A/3B results in aberrant mitosis. Our findings suggested that the kinesin-2 complex plays a critical role not only in interphase but also in mitosis. Our domain analysis revealed that amino acids 528–614 of KAP3 may interact with the C-terminal regions of KIF3A/3B. This result is consistent with previous data obtained by low angle rotary-shadowing electron microscopy showing that KAP3 is a globular protein and is associated with the tail domain of KIF3A/3B (16.Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We utilized deletion constructs of KIF3A/3B used for domain analysis (Fig. 3A, Mutant 3 (Mut 3)) to assess the significance of the kinesin-2 complex in mitosis since we could not efficiently knock down expression of KIF3A/3B and KAP3 using small interfering RNA. These mutants could form a heterodimer but could not interact with KAP3. Interestingly, when expressed in NIH3T3 cells, these mutants caused chromosomal aneuploidy and aberrant spindle formation. Thus, the interaction between KIF3A/3B and KAP3 may be required for spindle formation and chromosome segregation, although one cannot exclude the possibility that a protein(s) other than KAP3 also interacts and is critical for this function. We speculate that there may be an important mitosis-specific cargo protein(s) to which KIF3A/3B associate via an interaction with KAP3. Intriguingly, it has been reported that APC localizes to the ends of microtubules embedded in kinetochores and plays a critical role in chromosome segregation (24.Fodde R. Kuipers J. Rosenberg C. Smits R. Kielman M. Gaspar C. van Es J.H. Breukel C. Wiegant J. Giles R.H. Clevers H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 25.Kaplan K.B. Burds A.A. Swedlow J.R. Bekir S.S. Sorger P.K. Nathke I.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Since we have previously found that APC is associated with KIF3A/3B via an association with KAP3 (14.Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), APC may be one of these critical cargo proteins involved in the progression of mitosis. It was reported that mutations in the kinesin-2 motor subunit genes result in chromosome loss phenotypes in Chlamydomonas (19.Miller M.S. Esparza J.M. Lippa A.M. Lux III, F.G. Cole D.G. Dutcher S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3810-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it was suggested that these phenotypes arise due to toxic effects of the mutant gene products. Also, microinjection of a kinesin-2-specific monoclonal antibody in sea urchin embryos inhibits ciliogenesis but has no effect on mitosis or cytokinesis (20.Morris R.L. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous KIF3A and KIF3B knock-out mice apparently undergo many cell divisions until they die during the midgestational period (26.Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 27.Takeda S. Yonekawa Y. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Hirokawa N. J.

A. 1999; 96: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), suggesting that kinesin-2 is not critical for the progression of mitosis. These findings appear to conflict with our results. However, it may be possible that the importance of kinesin-2 function in mitosis may differ depending on the cell type and developmental stage. To further clarify the role of kinesin-2 in mitosis, it would be necessary to establish knock-out cell lines and to scrutinize the function of kinesin-2 in mitosis. We showed that KAP3 is phosphorylated during mitosis. In this regard, it is interesting that some members of the KIF family have been reported to be phosphorylated by mitotic kinases. For example, CENP-E and Eg5 are phosphorylated by cdc2-cyclin B1 (29.Liao H. Li G. Yen T.J. Science. 1994; 265: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30.Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Xenopus Aurora kinase pEg2-mediated phosphorylation of Eg5 is required for spindle formation and stabilization (31.Giet R. Uzbekov R. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Prigent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15005-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Also, cdc2-cyclin B1-mediated phosphorylation of Kid controls its distribution to spindle and chromosomes (32.Ohsugi M. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Shiroguchi K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Inoue J. Yamamoto T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2091-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation of KAP3 may play a role in the regulation of mitotic progression. Although phosphorylation of KAP3 did not affect its KIF3A/3B binding ability, it is interesting to speculate that phosphorylation of KAP3 may regulate its interaction with cargo proteins that are involved in spindle formation and chromosome segregation. Identification of mitosis-specific cargo proteins and kinases responsible for KAP3 phosphorylation may provide insights into the significance of KAP3 phosphorylation. We thank O. Higuchi, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2019260651,"Reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase (Rex, EC 3.2.1.156) is an inverting GH that hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides (≥X3) to release X1 at their reducing end. The wild-type enzyme exhibited the Hehre resynthesis hydrolysis mechanism, in which α-X2F was hydrolyzed to X2 and HF in the presence of X1 as an acceptor molecule. However, the transglycosidation product (X3) was not detectable in the reaction. To convert reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase to glycosynthase, derivatives with mutations in the catalytic base (Asp-263) were constructed by saturation random mutagenesis. Nine amino acid residue mutants (Asp-263 to Gly, Ala, Val, Thr, Leu, Asn, Cys, Pro, or Ser) were found to possess glycosynthase activity forming X3 from α-X2F and X1. Among them, D263C showed the highest level of X3 production, and D263N exhibited the fastest consumption of α-X2F. The D263C mutant showed 10-fold lower hydrolytic activity than D263N, resulting in the highest yield of X3. X2 was formed from the early stage of the reaction of the D263C mutant, indicating that a portion of the X3 formed by condensation was hydrolyzed before its release from the enzyme. To acquire glycosynthase activity from inverting enzymes, it is important to minimize the decrease in F–-releasing activity while maximizing the decrease in the hydrolytic activity. The present study expands the possibility of conversion of glycosynthases from inverting enzymes."

Using in utero electroporation-mediated gene transfer, we show that EphA7-mediated signaling on neocortical axons controls the within-nucleus topography of CT projections in the thalamus. Notably, CT axons that mis-express EphA7 do not shift the relative positioning of their pathway within the subcortical telencephalon (ST), indicating that they do not depend upon EphA7/ephrin-A signaling in the ST for establishing this topography. Moreover, mis-expression of cortical EphA7 results in disrupted topography of CT projections, but unchanged inter- and intra-areal topography of TC projections. Our results support a model in which EphA/ephrin-A signaling controls independently the precision with which CT and TC projections develop, yet is essential for establishing their topographic reciprocity."
https://openalex.org/W2084249410,"The release of monoamine neurotransmitters from cell bodies and dendrites has an important role in behavior, but the mechanism (vesicular or non vesicular) has remained unclear. Because the location of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) defines the secretory vesicles capable of monoamine release, we have studied its trafficking to assess the potential for monoamine release by exocytosis. In neuroendocrine PC12 cells, VMAT2 localizes exclusively to large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), and we now show that cytoplasmic signals target VMAT2 directly to LDCVs within the biosynthetic pathway. In neurons, VMAT2 localizes to a population of vesicles that we now find undergo regulated exocytosis in dendrites. Although hippocampal neurons do not express typical LDCV proteins, transfected chromogranins A, B, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) colocalize with VMAT2. VMAT2 thus defines a population of secretory vesicles that mediate the activity-dependent somatodendritic release of multiple retrograde signals involved in synaptic function, growth, and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1996334134,"Trypanosoma rangeli sialidase is a glycoside hydrolase (family GH33) that catalyzes the cleavage of α-2→3-linked sialic acid residues from sialoglycoconjugates with overall retention of anomeric configuration. Retaining glycosidases usually operate through a ping-pong mechanism, wherein a covalent intermediate is formed between the carbohydrate and an active site carboxylic acid of the enzyme. Sialidases, instead, appear to use a tyrosine as the catalytic nucleophile, leaving the possibility of an essentially different catalytic mechanism. Indeed, a direct nucleophilic role for a tyrosine was shown for the homologous trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi, although itself not a typical sialidase. Here we present the three-dimensional structures of the covalent glycosyl-enzyme complexes formed by the T. rangeli sialidase with two different mechanism-based inactivators at 1.9 and 1.7Å resolution. To our knowledge, these are the first reported structures of enzymatically competent covalent intermediates for a strictly hydrolytic sialidase. Kinetic analyses have been carried out on the formation and turnover of both intermediates, showing that structural modifications to these inactivators can be used to modify the lifetimes of covalent intermediates. These results provide further evidence that all sialidases likely operate through a similar mechanism involving the transient formation of a covalently sialylated enzyme.

Sialidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis or trans-glycosylation (trans-sialidases) of sialic acid residues from various glycoconjugates. Exosialidases (E.C. 3.2.1.18) remove terminal sialyl residues with overall retention of the stereoisomeric configuration of the anomeric carbon. Endosialidases (E.C. 3.2.1.129) on the other hand, break the internal glycosidic bonds present in 2,8-linked sialic acid oligomers or polymers (colominic acid). Although these two enzyme classes share important structural features, including the catalytic β-propeller domain and several residues that interact directly with the sialyl moiety (1.Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2.Stummeyer K. Dickmanns A. Muhlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The great majority of exosialidases have been classified into three different sequence-based families, GH33, -34, and -83 (4.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Naturally sialylated glycoconjugates include a variety of glycoproteins, glycopeptides, glycolipids, and cell-surface oligosaccharides (5.Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These glycoconjugates mediate a wide range of crucial biological processes, such as cell-cell communication and signal transduction events (6.Franz C.K. Rutishauser U. Rafuse V.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7.Fujimoto I. Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Biol.

Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 254-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As such, sialidases represent attractive targets for chemical intervention in the treatment of various diseases. In particular, Zanamivir® and Oseltamivir® are two sialidase inhibitors currently on the market for the treatment of human influenza and are of great interest currently as frontline drugs against the threat of pandemic influenza (9.Dreitlein W.B.

To generate novel inhibitors of sialidases, a detailed understanding of their catalytic mechanism is necessary. The formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is a trait common to most retaining glycosidases (13.Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14.Rye C.S. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 15.Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), wherein a glutamate (or an aspartate) performs the nucleophilic attack. However, the only well located residue in the sialidase active site is a tyrosine, raising concerns as to whether sialidases actually follow the same mechanism as other glycosidases, considering the rather poor nucleophilic tendency of the phenolic Tyr OH group. We have previously reported the first direct evidence supporting a typical ping-pong mechanism for sialidases through mechanistic and structural investigations of a GH33 trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTS) 3The abbreviations used are: TcTS, T. cruzi trans-sialidase; TrSA, T. rangeli sialidase; KDN, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid.

TcTS operates through the transient formation of a covalent sialosyl-enzyme intermediate, demonstrating a direct role of the active site tyrosine as the catalytic nucleophile. Is this a particular trait of TcTS, implying that true, strictly hydrolytic sialidases work through a different mechanism? To answer this question, we recently obtained preliminary evidence using a mechanism-based inactivator in conjunction with mass spectrometry showing that the sialidase from Trypanosoma rangeli also operates through the involvement of a covalent sialosyl-enzyme intermediate formed with the equivalent tyrosine, suggesting that this may be a mechanism common to all exosialidases (17.Watts A.G. Withers S.G. Can. J. Chem. 2004; 82: 1581-1588Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We now present the first crystal structures of the covalent intermediates for the strict hydrolytic sialidase TrSA using the fluorinated sialic acid analogues (1) and (2) as mechanism-based inactivators (Fig. 1A). These structures have been determined to 1.95 and 1.7 Å, respectively. Fluorinated substrate analogues, such as (1), have proved to be useful compounds for studying the catalytic mechanism of exosialidases (3.Amaya M.F. Watts A.G. Damager I. Wehenkel A. Nguyen T.

The introduction of an electronegative fluorine atom adjacent to the anomeric (reaction) center serves to inductively destabilize the formation of a positive charge during the transition states, thereby reducing the rates of glycosylation (k1) and deglycosylation (k2) (Fig. 1B). The introduction of a good “leaving group” at the anomeric position, such as fluoride, increases k1 only, allowing the covalent intermediate to be kinetically accessible (18.Wicki J. Rose D.R.

A full kinetic analysis of inactivation and reactivation rates for T. rangeli sialidase with the sialic acid analogues (1) and (2) is also reported. This analysis shows how subtle structural modifications to mechanism-based inactivators can be used to dramatically alter their kinetic behavior. We believe that the ability to “tune” the inactivation and reactivation rates of mechanism-based inactivators represents an important step toward the development of therapeutically useful compounds directed to specific glycosidase targets. Recombinant TrSA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen), purified, and crystallized as described previously (20.Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Crystals of the covalent intermediates were obtained by soaking TrSA crystals for 1 h with either compound (1) or (2) at a concentration of 5 mm at 25 °C in the crystallization liquor. Crystals were rapidly passed through 50% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and conserved until data collection. Diffraction data were collected on single frozen crystals (100 K) using synchrotron radiation and processed (Table 1) using MOSFLM (version 6.2.4), SCALA (version 3.2.5), and TRUNCATE (version 5.0) of the CCP4 version 5.0.2 software suite (21.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Complex with Compound (1)—Having collected several data sets, the best diffracting one in terms of resolution (1.9 Å) was chosen, despite the presence of two ice rings (2.28–2.21 and 1.95–1.9 Å) that were deliberately omitted in the integration of the diffraction intensities. This introduces some distortions in the Wilson distribution of intensities, which results in somewhat unstable isotropic B factor refinement. To confirm the results obtained, a second data set (obtained from a different crystal similarly treated with 2-deoxy-2,3-difluoro-sialic acid) extending to 2.2 Å resolution was also processed and fully refined (supplemental data Table 1; to avoid redundancy, atomic coordinates and structure factors for this second data set were not deposited in the Protein Data Bank but are available on request from A. Buschiazzo). Both crystals were shown to be isomorphous to the previously solved structure of unbound TrSA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1N1S), hence allowing immediate crystallographic refinement with Crystallography and NMR System software version 1.1 (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using all the data after setting aside 5% of the reflections for Rfree calculations. Both structures resulted in indistinguishable atomic models. Major peaks in difference Fourier maps (>10σ) were localized in the active site pocket with clear features allowing the modeling of a 3-fluoro-β-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid moiety covalently bound to tyrosine 343. Based on β-sialic acid topology parameters derived from the Cambridge Structural Data Base, a suitable dictionary of stereochemical restraints was generated, including the protein–ligand covalent bond taken initially as a β-glycosidic linkage between the 3-fluoro-sialyl residue and the aromatic side chain of Tyr-343 (ideal bond distance of 1.398 Å, C–O distance is slightly shorter than usual when carbon is anomeric (24.Jeffrey G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1990; 46: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). The length of this covalent bond (1.43 Å) was kept at chemically sensible values by raising 4-fold the corresponding stereochemical restraint force (corresponding to a σ = 0.01) in this structure as well as in the 3-fluoro-KDN and the TcTS refinements detailed below (see supplemental data). Iterative cycles of model rebuilding were performed with the program O version 8.0 (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) from inspection of σA-weighted 2mFo – DFc and composite omit maps. The presence of a hydrogen bond within the sialyl moiety between the oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group (O-10) and the first oxygen of the glycerol group (O-7) was also accounted for by iteratively adjusting the corresponding nonbonded van der Waals radii of the concerned oxygen atoms, as well as by releasing the restraints that fixed the C-6/C-5/N-5/C-10 dihedral angle to typical values (∼120°). At later stages, water molecules were automatically added based on unexplained Fobs – Fcalc peaks (>3.5σ) and visually inspected for stereochemistry and stability during refinement. The final refined model at 1.95 Å resolution consists of 632 amino acids, one 3-fluoro-sialyl residue, two sulfate molecules, and 615 water molecules. All protein residues are well defined in the electron density map with the exception of the highly exposed loop 403–410, where residues 406–407 could not be modeled. The refined structure displays good stereochemistry, as judged with PROCHECK version 3.5 (26.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 99.1% of the non-Pro/non-Gly residues fall in the most favored or the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Protein residues Val-180, Glu-231, Arg-312, and Ser-425 display unfavorable dihedral angles. However, they are well defined in the electron density maps and have similar Φ,ψ values as found in previous unliganded and complexed TrSA structures (20.Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that this is a genuine feature of the protein. Complex with Compound (2)—Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal that diffracted to 1.7 Å. Refinement was performed with REFMAC5 following a similar strategy to that used for the complex with compound (1). The modeling of a 3-fluoro-β-KDN residue covalently bound to Tyr-343 was straightforward. Water molecules were added as described previously. The final refined model at 1.7 Å resolution consists of 634 amino acids, one 3-fluoro-KDN residue, two sulfate molecules, and 805 water molecules. 98.9% of the non-Pro/non-Gly residues fell in the most favored or the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Residues 406 and 407 were modeled as alanines, because the loop is mobile and density is not well defined. Kinetics studies were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. A continuous spectrophotometric assay based on the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenol-sialic acid was used to monitor enzyme activity by measurement of the rate of 4-nitrophenolate release (λ = 400 nm) using a Varian Cary 4000 spectrophotometer. The time-dependent inactivation of TrSA by 2,3-difluoro-KDN was monitored by incubation of the enzyme under the above conditions in the presence of several concentrations (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mm) of 2,3-difluoro-KDN. Residual enzyme activity was determined at appropriate time intervals by the addition of an aliquot (10 μl) of the inactivation mixture to an assay solution (800 μl) containing 4-nitrophenol-sialic acid (3 mm), pH 6.8. Pseudo-first-order rate constants at each concentration (kobs) were determined by fitting the residual activity versus time to a single exponential equation using GraFit version 5.0 (27.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit version 5.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., London2001Google Scholar). The inactivation rate constant (ki) and the dissociation constant for the inactivator (Ki) were determined by fitting to the equation kobs = ki[I]/(Ki + [I]). The spontaneous reactivation of 2,3-difluoro-KDN-inactivated TrSA was studied as follows. TrSA (100 μl, inactivated as above) was applied to a microspin G-25 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess inactivator. Enzyme activity was measured at appropriate time intervals by the addition of an aliquot (10 μl) of eluent to an assay solution (800 μl) containing 4-nitrophenol-sialic acid (3 mm), pH 6.8. Measured activities were corrected for decreases in activity due to denaturation over this time course using data from non-inactivated control samples. The reactivation rate constant (kcat) was determined by fitting the data to a first-order rate equation as described above. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under codes 2A75 and 2AGS. The Covalent Glycosyl-Enzyme Structure of TrSA with Difluoro-sialic Acid (1)—The fluorinated sialic acid analogue 2-deoxy-2,3-difluoro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (1) was shown by mass spectrometric analysis to form a covalent sialosyl-enzyme intermediate with TrSA involving the catalytic nucleophile Tyr-343 (17.Watts A.G. Withers S.G. Can. J. Chem. 2004; 82: 1581-1588Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To perform a detailed structural analysis of this kinetically trapped intermediate, the three-dimensional structure of the complex formed was solved using TrSA crystals that were soaked with (1). Refinement of one data set that extends to a resolution of 1.95 Å, readily allowed the modeling of a β-3-fluoro-sialosyl moiety covalently bound to the side chain of Tyr-343 (Fig. 2). A covalent bond is clearly observed in the 2mFo – DFc electron density map, between C-2 of sialic acid and the phenolic oxygen of the tyrosine. The sialyl pyranose ring is seen to sit in a standard and seemingly unstrained 2C5 conformation, similar to that observed previously for the covalent intermediate of (1) with the trans-sialidase from T. cruzi (3.Amaya M.F. Watts A.G. Damager I. Wehenkel A. Nguyen T. Buschiazzo A. Paris G. Frasch A.C. Withers S.G. Alzari P.M. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The 3-fluoro-sialoside intermediate forms many of the H-bond interactions observed in previous complexes of TrSA with its substrates (20.Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The sialic acid carboxylate forms several electrostatic interactions with the strictly conserved arginine triad of Arg-36, Arg-246, and Arg-315 (Fig. 3A). The glycerol side chain of the sialic acid forms only a weak H-bond with Trp-121. The 4-OH group forms H-bonds to Arg-54 and Asp-97, whereas the nitrogen atom of the N-acetyl group also forms a single H-bond with Asp-97. The N-acetyl group establishes an intramolecular H-bond through its O-10 atom with the O-7 of the sialyl glycerol group. Kinetic Analysis of the Interaction of (1) with TrSA—Although the covalent sialyl-enzyme intermediate is now shown to form when compound (1) is allowed to interact with TrSA, time-dependent inactivation could not be observed by removing aliquots over time for assay of residual activity. Nonetheless, the activity actually measured was lower than that of the control reaction containing no inhibitor and was also found to be inversely dependent on inhibitor concentration. This behavior is similar to that observed for the inhibition of some α-glycosidases by 5-fluoro-α-glycosyl fluorides, where apparent tight binding was also observed but found to be due to the accumulation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate that turns over on a time scale shorter than the assay time (19.Howard S. He S. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2067-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Successful observation of the intermediate by electrospray mass spectrometry (17.Watts A.G. Withers S.G. Can. J. Chem. 2004; 82: 1581-1588Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) presumably depended upon the low pH condition of the analysis decreasing the deglycosylation rates. Several attempts were made to reduce the rate of inactivation, such that time-dependent inactivation could be observed, by lowering the inhibitor concentration, reducing the temperature of the assay, and incubating (1) with TrSA in the presence of a competitive inhibitor (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl neuraminic acid). Time-dependent inactivation could not be observed using any of these methods, quite likely because formation of the intermediate was too fast. Attempts were therefore made to measure the rate of reactivation by removing excess inactivator from a sample of TrSA labeled with (1) and then measuring the increase in enzymatic activity over time associated with hydrolytic turnover of the intermediate. Unfortunately, an accurate determination of the reactivation rate was not possible, as labeled TrSA had regained ∼95% of its initial activity after only 5 min. To perform a more detailed kinetic analysis of the covalent intermediate for TrSA, the generation of a more “long-lived” intermediate was required. Inactivation and Reactivation Rates of TrSA Labeled with 2,3-Difluoro-KDN (2)—Previous structural and kinetic studies have identified the N-acetyl group of sialic acid to be crucial for substrate binding and, presumably, catalysis by TrSA and TcTS (20.Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28.Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Based upon this knowledge, we chose to investigate the kinetic behavior of the 2,3-difluoro-KDN derivative (2) (in which the N-acetyl group had been replaced with a hydroxyl) toward TrSA. The synthesis of (2) was accomplished following a similar sequence to that used for the synthesis of (1), except that mannose is used in the first step rather than N-acetyl mannosamine (see supplemental data). In contrast to what was seen with (1) and consistent with our expectations, 2,3-difluoro-KDN was observed to inactivate wild-type TrSA at 30 °C in a time-dependent manner according to first-order kinetics (Fig. 4A). The apparent first-order rate constants (kobs) at each concentration of inactivator were fitted to the expression kobs = ki[I]/([I] + Ki), yielding the values ki = 0.31 ± 0.02 min–1 and Ki = 11.4 ± 0.8 mm. The lifetime of the covalent intermediate was measured by removing excess (2) from an inactivated sample of TrSA by centrifugal dialysis and monitoring the spontaneous increase of enzymatic activity over time (Fig. 4B). A first-order recovery of enzymatic activity was observed with a rate constant kcat = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10–2 min–1, which corresponds to an intermediate half-life of t = 37 min. These results clearly show that the rate constants for inactivation and reactivation have been significantly reduced as a consequence of replacing the N-acetyl group at C-4 with a hydroxyl group, supporting our contention that lifetimes of intermediates on sialidases can be manipulated by modifying enzyme-substrate interactions. The Covalent Glycosyl-Enzyme Structure of TrSA with (2)—Having successfully manipulated relative rate constants for formation and turnover of the intermediate, we wished to develop some understanding of the physical basis for these effects via crystallographic analysis of the two trapped reaction intermediates. The x-ray structure of the covalent intermediate formed between TrSA and 2-deoxy-2,3-difluoro-KDN (2) was also solved by soaking crystals of the protein with the inactivator (2), and refined to 1.7 Å. The covalency of the intermediate is clearly seen, with a bond length of 1.43 Å between the sialic acid and the catalytic tyrosine (Fig. 5). Once again, the carboxylate group of the inactivator is tightly bound to the arginine triad (Fig. 3B). The OH-4 group conserves the H-bonds with Arg-54 and Asp-97, whereas the OH-5 group, introduced to replace the N-acetyl group, forms a short (2.5 Å) H-bond with Asp-97. Interestingly, Met-96 is seen to adopt a very different position in the intermediate of TrSA with (2), where it “swings” around to fill the hole that is left in the active site upon removal of the N-acetyl group (Fig. 5). This “moved” condition for Met-96 is not observed in the free enzyme (1N1S); hence it is probably actively induced, resulting in van der Waals contact with the engineered OH-5 oxygen, which partially compensates for the loss of several hydrophobic interactions that the two carbon atoms of the N-acetyl group normally establish. The absence of the N-acetyl group also results in a major reorganization of the network of crystalline water molecules in the site. The oxygen atom of the N-acetyl moiety (O-10) normally establishes an intramolecular H-bond with O-7 in the glycerol group of the sugar. In KDN, the absence of this feature allows for the appearance of several water molecules, among which especially W360 and W369 strongly interconnect O-5 and O-7 of the sialyl residue with the Ser-120 and Asp-60 of the enzyme, both of which are observed to adopt modified positions with respect to the compound (1) complex, as well as to other previously reported TrSA structures (1N1S, 1N1T). In particular, Asp-60 oxygen δ1, which is the acid/base catalyst, moves 0.5 Å away compared with other structures.

https://openalex.org/W2062767834,"In the course of a large scale analysis of late-expressed genes in the human epidermis, we identified a new member of the α2-macroglobulin (α2M) protease inhibitor family, A2ML1 (for α2-macroglobulin-like 1). Like A2M and PZP, A2ML1 is located on chromosome 12p13.31. A2ML1 encodes a protein of 1454 amino acids, which fits the characteristics of α2Ms: 1) strong conservation in amino acid sequence including most of cysteine positions with α2M; 2) a putative central bait domain; 3) a typical thiol ester sequence. Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR studies revealed a single 5-kb A2ML1 mRNA, mainly in the epidermis granular keratinocytes. A2ML1 is also transcribed in placenta, thymus, and testis. By Western blot analysis, α2ML1 is detected as a monomeric, ∼180-kDa protein in human epidermis. In vitro keratinocyte differentiation is associated with increased expression levels. By immunohistochemistry, α2ML1 was detected within keratinosomes in the granular layer of the epidermis, and as a secreted product in the extracellular space between the uppermost granular layer and the cornified layer. Recombinant α2ML1 displayed inhibitory activity toward chymotrypsin, papain, thermolysin, subtilisin A, and to a lesser extent, elastase but not trypsin. Incubation with chymotrypsin and the chymotrypsin-like kallikrein 7 protease indicated that α2ML1 binds covalently to these proteases, a feature shared with other members of the family. Therefore, α2ML1 is the first α2M family member detected in the epidermis. It may play an important role during desquamation by inhibiting extracellular proteases.

Therefore, α2ML1 is the first α2M family member detected in the epidermis. It may play an important role during desquamation by inhibiting extracellular proteases. Regulation of proteolytic enzyme activity is essential for cell and tissue homeostasis. In epidermis, proteolysis of adhesive structures is a prerequisite for desquamation. Several members of the four protease classes with suggested roles in desquamation have been described in epidermis (reviewed in Ref. 1Zeeuwen P.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A wide variety of protease inhibitors is also present in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum and participates in the regulation of desquamation-associated proteolysis. Disturbance of the protease-antiprotease balance may have dramatic consequences as demonstrated by the discovery of the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 5 (SPINK5) also known as lymphoepithelial Kazal type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome (2Chavanas S. Bodemer C. Rochat A. Hamel-Teillac D. Ali M. Irvine A.D. Bonafe J.L. Wilkinson J. Taieb A. Barrandon Y. Harper J.I. de Prost Y. Hovnanian A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The importance of regulated proteolysis in epidermis has also been reported in mouse models. Targeted epidermal overexpression of the serine protease kallikrein 7 (KLK7), 2The abbreviations used are: KLK7, kallikrein 7; αM, α-macroglobulin; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; PZP, pregnancy zone protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1. 2The abbreviations used are: KLK7, kallikrein 7; αM, α-macroglobulin; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; PZP, pregnancy zone protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1. also known as stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), results in a severe phenotype (3Hansson L. Backman A. Ny A. Edlund M. Ekholm E. Ekstrand Hammarstrom B. Tornell J. Wallbrandt P. Wennbo H. Egelrud T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 444-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Conversely, a null mutation in the mouse cystatin M/E gene (Cst6), encoding a cysteine protease inhibitor, induces neonatal lethality and abnormalities in cornification and desquamation, highlighting the essential role for protease inhibitors during the final stages of epidermal differentiation (4Zeeuwen P.L. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M. Hendriks W. Merkx G.F. Schalkwijk J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of a large scale search for genes specifically expressed by the last transcriptionally active keratinocytes in the granular layer of the human epidermis, we identified a new member of the α-macroglobulin (αM) superfamily, which we named A2ML1 (α2-macroglobulin-like 1). The αM superfamily comprises both protease inhibitors and components of the complement. The αM protease inhibitor family, typified by the human tetrameric α2-macroglobulin (α2M), is a class of protease inhibitors with broad specificity (for review, see Refs. 5Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because of their abundance in plasma (up to 10% of total serum proteins), they are considered as backup protease inhibitors although their precise function remains incompletely defined. The ability of αMs to inhibit all four protease classes resides in their unique mechanism of inhibition by steric hindrance called the “trap mechanism” (8Feldman S.R. Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5700-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The αM subunits harbor a central bait domain sensitive to proteolytic cleavage (9Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the bait region by a protease induces a major conformational change in the αM and as a consequence, the entrapment of the protease. Thereby, the access of possible substrates to the protease active site is hindered (6Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Because of physical constraints, entrapped protease molecules are unable to hydrolyze large substrates but retain almost full activity against small ones (11Ganrot P.O. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 14: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11428-11435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitantly to the entrapment, the internal thiol ester bond, distinctive of the αM, becomes highly reactive and mediates covalent binding with the attacking protease via ∈-lysyl-γ-glutamyl bonds (13Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14Salvesen G.S. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the conformational change of the αM exposes their C-terminal domain, allowing binding to specific receptors such as the α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (15Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and hence clearance of the αM-protease complexes. In addition to proteases, α2M binds non-covalently to various distinct proteins, such as inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, β-amyloid peptide, or apolipoprotein E (16LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K.

Paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from breast skin. Primary keratinocytes were from human foreskin. All human specimens were kindly provided by Professor J. P. Chavoin (Chirurgie plastique, Hôpital Rangueil, Toulouse) after informed consent of the patients and in accordance with Helsinki principles. Preparation of a Granular Layer Keratinocyte-enriched Cell Population and EST Production—The procedure to recover total RNA from human epidermis fragments enriched with either basal (sample T1) or granular keratinocytes (sample T4) was described in detail elsewhere (26Toulza E. Galliano M.F. Jonca N. Gallinaro H. Méchin M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Serre G. Guerrin M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, dermo-epidermal cleavage of the abdominal skin sample was performed after thermolysin incubation. Iterative trypsin incubations of the epidermis led to three samples of dissociated cells named T1, T2, and T3. The T4 sample corresponds to the epidermal fragments left over after the third incubation and is mainly composed of granular keratinocytes and corneocytes. From the latter sample, poly(A+) mRNA was used to generate mini-libraries of cDNA by the open reading frame EST method, essentially performed as described (26Toulza E. Galliano M.F. Jonca N.

Analysis of A2ML1 mRNA Expression—Northern blotting of total RNA extracted from human epidermis after dermo-epidermal cleavage was performed with the digoxigenin technology, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). An A2ML1 probe was produced with the PCR digoxigenin synthesis kit using primers designed from A2ML1 on exons digoxigenin 18 and 19. After hybridization, detection was performed with an anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (digoxigenin Nucleic Acid Detection kit). For reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments, a primer pair chosen on different exons to avoid amplification of potential contaminating DNA, generated amplicons of 206 nucleotides (exon 29 to 30 of A2ML1). The primer sequences were designed using Primer3 software (28Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Blast analysis (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) for the absence of similarity to any other human sequence. Human Multiple Tissue cDNA (MTC) panels I and II obtained from BD Biosciences were used as templates for PCR analysis. A control reaction with epidermis cDNA was carried out in parallel. The reactions were conducted for 35 cycles in standard conditions. Normalization of the samples was assessed after 22 cycles of amplification using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers provided in the kit. For quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments, reverse transcription was performed by standard procedures, starting from 100 ng of total RNA of T1 and T4 samples and using a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primers. A2ML1 expression was quantified using two pairs of specific primers amplifying exons 29 to 30 and exons 27 to 28. Assays were performed with the ABI prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and analyzed with the corresponding software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen). The arbitrary defined number of PCR cycles in which each PCR amplification graph is in the linear range corresponds to the cycle threshold (Ct). The relative amount of A2ML1 to LGALS7 internal control and the -fold induction were calculated by using the equation 2-ΔΔCt, where ΔCt = Ct,A2ML1 - Ct,LGALS7 and ΔΔCt =ΔCt,T4 sample - ΔCt,T1 sample. Samples were analyzed in triplicate and differences between the values within triplicates were lower than 0.3 cycles. Amplicons for KRT14, encoding cytokeratin 14 and for KLK7 were analyzed in parallel as additional controls (data not shown). Production of Rabbit Antiserum—A peptide was synthesized according to the predicted amino acid sequence of human α2ML1 in the N-terminal region (487ISFYYLIGKGSLVM501). Anti-peptide antibodies were produced by injecting the synthetic peptide conjugated via an added C-terminal cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-peptide antibodies titer was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Millegen, Toulouse, France). The antiserum was affinity-purified using the peptide coupled to an agarose-activated affinity column (Sulfolink® kit, Pierce). Production of Recombinant α2ML1—The full-length coding sequence of AL832139 (DKFZp686O1010) was cloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) in C-terminal fusion with the V5-His epitope and was expressed in stable pools of 293/EBNA cells (Invitrogen). Transfection was performed with JetPEI reagent (QBiogen, Llkirch, France). Cells were grown in the presence of 150 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks. After cell washing, serum-free media was conditioned for 48 h, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and concentrated on Vivaspin centricons (Viva-science AG, Hannover, Germany). The α2ML1 protein was then purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA Spin Columns, Qiagen). In parallel, control medium, conditioned from mocked-transfected cells was submitted to identical purification procedures. The purified protein was monitored after SDS-PAGE by staining with Protogold (BB International, Cardiff, UK). Epidermal Extracts, Keratinocyte Extracts, Immunoblotting Experiments, and Deglycosylation—Epidermal proteins were extracted in TENP-40 lysis buffer (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm EDTA containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors). Primary keratinocytes were established from human foreskin and grown either in Rheinwald and Green medium (30Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) or in KGM medium (Promocell). To induce differentiation, sub-confluent cells were either maintained 48 h in the medium of Green (30Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) or switched into KGM medium supplemented with Ca2+ at a final concentration of 1.5 mm. Total proteins were extracted in TENP-40 lysis buffer. For Western blotting, Laemmli buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol was added to the extracts. The blots were probed with the purified polyclonal antiserum or mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody. For deglycosylation experiments, N-glycosidase F, neuraminidase, O-glycosidase, or both neuraminidase and O-glycosidase were added to purified denatured recombinant α2ML1, for 3 h at 37 °C in the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunohistochemistry was performed on Bouin-fixed skin samples embedded in paraffin using the peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-biotin amplification method. Immunoelectron microscopy using ultrathin cryosections of normal non-palmoplantar human epidermis were performed as previously described using the purified polyclonal antiserum and gold particle-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (31Ishida-Yamamoto A. Simon M. Kishibe M. Miyauchi Y. Takahashi H. Yoshida S. O'Brien T.J. Serre G. Iizuka H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Negative controls consisted in incubations in the presence of secondary antibody alone or with an unrelated primary antibody. Hide Powder Azure Assay—Human α2M and affinity-purified recombinant α2ML1 were compared for their ability to prevent the various proteases from digesting the “hide powder azure” substrate, essentially as previously described (12Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11428-11435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration of α2ML1 was estimated by Protogold staining with respect to various quantities of human α2M (in the nanogram range) loaded on the same gel. α2ML1 molarity was calculated assuming its monomeric status. Purified recombinant α2ML1 protein (0.6-15 pmol) was reacted with 2 pmol each of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and papain, 1.9 pmol of subtilisin A, and 3 pmol of thermolysin. At least two different concentrations of inhibitor with respect to each protease were tested. Enzyme solutions were freshly prepared and assumed to be 100% active by weight. In parallel, increasing amounts from 0.2 to 2 pmol of human α2M were reacted with each of the enzymes. Papain was activated by adding dithiothreitol (2 mm) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. A final concentration of dithiothreitol of 0.02 mm was shown not to interfere with α2M inhibition. Reactants were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in 0.2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (or 5 mm CaCl2 instead of EDTA when thermolysin was used) before 0.8 ml of the same buffer containing 5.5 mg of hide powder azure substrate was added. Incubation was performed under agitation for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by placing on ice. The high molecular weight substrate was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and proteolytic activity was determined by measuring the A595 optical density of the supernatants. Each protease was tested with both α2M and α2ML1 in the same experiment. Reactions were performed in duplicates and repeated at least twice. The data were collected from two independent experiments and analyzed by using the StatSoft STATISTICA program, version 6. To compare α2ML1 inhibitory capacities to that of α2M, we determined R50% as the molar ratio of each inhibitor with respect to protease, whereby the proteolytic activity of the protease is decreased to 50%. Binding Assays—For zymography assay, 20 ng of chymotrypsin were incubated with 15 ng of purified α2ML1 or control medium for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline. α2ML1 or control medium were incubated in parallel without addition of chymotrypsin. Non-reducing Laemmli buffer was added to the samples and the reactants were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1% casein. The gel was renatured in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, then incubated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 37 °C, and finally stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Safes® Coomassie, Bio-Rad). Casein digestion was evidenced as white, unstained bands. Covalent binding to KLK7 was checked using affinity-purified recombinant α2ML1 (50 ng or 0.3 pmol) incubated with either active KLK7 or the inactive pro-KLK7 (10 ng each or 0.3 pmol) for 10 min at 22 °C or 5 min at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Laemmli buffer. Reactants incubated on ice were used as controls. Control medium was used as an additional control. The reactants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a polyclonal antibody recognizing both pro-KLK7 and KLK7 (32Caubet C. Jonca N.

Characterization of A2ML1—To identify epidermis late-expressed genes, successive rounds of proteolysis of normal human skin were performed to isolate four batches of cells that roughly represent the successive steps of keratinocyte differentiation. The last batch, mostly containing granular keratinocytes and corneocytes, was used to produce EST mini-libraries by the open reading frame EST method (27Neto E.D. Harrop R. Correa-Oliveira R. Wilson R.A. Pena S.D. Simpson A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One EST showed complete identity with a full-length cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AL832139) encoding a hypothetical protein displaying strong conservation with α2M. Thus, in agreement with the HUGO gene nomenclature committee, we named this new gene A2ML1 (for α2 macroglobulin-like 1). The alias name of A2ML1 is CPAMD9 (for C3 and PZP-like α2-macroglobulin containing domain 9). According to the May 2004 human genome assembly (33Consortium I.H.G.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17711) Google Scholar), the A2ML1 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.31, telomeric to the two other human genes of the αM family, A2M and PZP (Fig. 1). The locus of A2ML1, A2M, and PZP encompasses a 385-kb region. The predicted A2ML1 exon-intron organization (36 exons spanning 54 kb) is similar to that of A2M (36 exons spanning 48 kb) and PZP (36 exons spanning 59.5 kb). A notable difference is the opposite orientation of A2ML1. Twelve mRNA matched the A2ML1 gene (Fig. 1, box), among which AK057908, referred to as the predicted gene FLJ25179, spans only the 3′ part of the A2ML1 transcript. The corresponding hypothetical protein of 158 amino acids (NP653271) was recently classified as a member of the α2M family (34Puente X.S. Lopez-Otin C. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To note, AK122624 mRNA lacks the 3′ part of exon 20, exons 21-26, and the 5′ part of exon 27. The gene has two alternative, non-coding last exons. Searching for mRNA and EST originating from putative orthologs of A2ML1 resulted in the identification of three mRNA from chimpanzee, dog, and pig that appeared closely related to α2ML1 by using the Multalin algorithm (35Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4303) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). No mRNA or EST from rat or mouse was identified as transcribed from a potential A2ML1 ortholog. As illustrated by the phylogenetic tree, even if α2ML1 and the cluster α2M/PZP arose from a common ancestor, they diverged long ago. The cluster of the monomeric murinoglobulins, which evolved after divergence of the rodents and therefore are not present in the human genome (34Puente X.S. Lopez-Otin C. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), were also distinct from α2ML1. The A2ML1 mRNA encodes a putative protein of 1454 amino acids that displays a similar organization to that of the prototyped α2M (Fig. 3). The α2ML1 protein displays a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids, a divergent bait domain near the center of the molecule (residues 695-726), and a typical thiol ester sequence (969Gly-Cys-Gly-Glu-Gln973 with the putative thiol ester bond formed by Cys970 and Gln973). Of the 10 potential N-glycosylated residues, eight showed striking conservation of position with α2M. The disulfide bridge pattern of α2M as determined by Jensen and Sottrup-Jensen (36Jensen P.E. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15863-15869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains 25 cysteinyl residues, 23 of which were found in conserved positions in α2ML1, as illustrated in Fig. 4. However, the two cysteinyl residues involved in the formation of interchain disulfide bridges for α2M were missing in α2ML1. The conservation scores between α2ML1 and the main proto-types of the α2M family assessed by the Clustal W algorithm (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar) are presented in Table 1. The best overall amino acid sequence identity was found with human α2M (40% of identity), a score higher than, albeit very similar, to those obtained with human PZP, mouse α2M, or rat α1I3. As expected, the identity score was greatly reduced when the bait domains were compared, in agreement with the typical divergence of these regions.FIGURE 4Proposed disulfide bridge pattern of α2ML1 based on that of human α2M.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Expression of A2ML1 Transcripts in Epidermis and Other Human Tissues—The expression of A2ML1 was analyzed by Northern blot performed on total RNA extracted from normal human epidermis. A single 5-kb band was detected, consistent with the size expected from the AL832139 cDNA sequence (Fig. 5A). To further investigate the transcription of A2ML1 during epidermal differentiation, we quantitatively analyzed the expression of A2ML1 in epidermal samples representative of the basal (T1) and granular (T4) layers. The cell separation method was validated by a previous work (26Toulza E. Galliano M.F. Jonca N. Gallinaro H. Méchin M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Serre G. Guerrin M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) through the analysis of two genes highly specific to the basal and granular layer, KRT14 and KLK7, respectively. Expression levels were calibrated using LGALS7, a gene previously shown by in situ hybridization to be expressed in all epidermal layers (38Magnaldo T. Fowlis D. Darmon M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A2ML1 displayed a 10-fold T4/T1 expression ratio (Fig. 5B), and is thus clearly an epidermis late-expressed gene.

https://openalex.org/W2153050302,"How cone synapses encode light intensity determines the precision of information transmission at the first synapse on the visual pathway. Although it is known that cone photoreceptors hyperpolarize to light over 4–5 log units of intensity, the relationship between light intensity and transmitter release at the cone synapse has not been determined. Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize release of the synaptic vesicle dye FM1-43 from cone terminals in the intact lizard retina, in response to different stimulus light intensities. We then employ electron microscopy to translate these measurements into vesicle release rates. We find that from darkness to bright light, release decreases from 49 to ∼2 vesicles per 200 ms; therefore, cones compress their 10,000-fold operating range for phototransduction into a 25-fold range for synaptic vesicle release. Tonic release encodes ten distinguishable intensity levels, skewed to most finely represent bright light, assuming release obeys Poisson statistics."

This cell shrinkage is the result of ion redistribution that is crucial for both the activation and execution of apoptosis. Here we report that UV-C but not Fas ligand treatment results in a significant decrease in intracellular chloride that can be abolished by modulation of chloride flux using either the chloride channel inhibitor SITS or medium with a reduced chloride concentration. Accordingly, downstream events are diminished during UV-C-induced apoptosis following chloride flux modulation, whereas Fas ligand-induced apoptotic characteristics are not affected. Moreover, the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway early in the apoptotic signaling cascade was affected by chloride flux in Jurkat T-cells.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an important role in the removal of unwanted cells in multicellular organisms. An impaired or increased rate of apoptosis can lead to diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, AIDS, and autoimmune diseases. A typical morphological feature observed during apoptosis is the reduction of cellular volume (apoptotic volume decrease), a feature that distinguishes this form of cell death from necrosis (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Healthy cells maintain a constant cell size by keeping a delicate balance of their intracellular ions and osmolytes. Small variations in intracellular ionic composition in response to external osmolarity changes or cell cycle alterations are compensated via inherent volume-regulatory mechanisms (2Bortner C.D.

Furthermore, the physiological concentration of potassium in non-apoptotic cells has been shown to constrain the activation of caspases and to inhibit the activity of apoptotic nucleases (6Bortner C.D.

Although the role of potassium and sodium during volume regulation and apoptotic volume decrease has been extensively studied (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the function of the anion chloride is less well understood. Clearly, a flux of anions should occur in parallel with the loss of sodium or potassium to ensure electroneutrality. Along these lines, the involvement of a volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying chloride channel following several apoptotic stimuli including Fas receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells has been suggested (10Shimizu T. Numata T. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6770-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Szabo I. Lepple-Wienhues A. Kaba K.N. Zoratti M. Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl.

In addition in a rat liver cell line (HTC) an increase of outwardly rectifying potassium current was coincident with a chloride current following tumor necrosis factor α stimulation (8Nietsch H.H.

However, none of these reports directly evaluate the actual intracellular chloride concentration change; nor do they link chloride to changes in other intracellular ions, such as sodium and potassium, which are necessary requisites for apoptotic volume decrease and the activation of downstream events such as cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, there is little understanding of how changes in ions such as chloride affect the signal transduction pathways during apoptosis. In the current paper, we seek to determine the role of chloride ions early in the process of apoptosis under conditions where the intrinsic (UV-C) and extrinsic (FasL) 2The abbreviations used are: FasL, Fas ligand; SITS, disodium 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; AVD, apoptotic volume decrease; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEQ, 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium iodide; SBFI, sodium binding benzofuran isophthalate; AM, acetoxymethylester; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PARP, poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase; PBFI, potassium binding benzofuran isophthalate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; DIC, differential interference contrast; diH-MEQ, 6-methoxy-N-ethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline; DiBAC4(3), bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol. pathway of apoptosis are not overlapping (15Vu C.C.

Here we report studies using a medium with reduced chloride to deplete the intracellular chloride content as well as SITS, a chloride channel inhibitor, to block chloride fluxes. We show for the first time that UV-C but not FasL treatment results in intracellular chloride decrease during apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. Furthermore, we show that chloride flux modulation is linked to intracellular sodium and potassium changes and also that chloride ion flux specifically regulates the UV-C induced activation of the kinase signaling cascade upstream of the mitochondria. Antibodies and Inhibitors—Mouse antibody anti-caspase-3, rabbit anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, rabbit anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, rabbit anti-SEK1/MKK4, and rabbit anti-phospho-SEK1/MKK4 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (MA). Mouse antibody anti-PARP and mouse antibody against α-tubulin were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody to mouse was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Disodium 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2′-disulfonate (SITS) was dissolved at a final concentration of 100 mm in Me2SO and stored at 4 °C. If not otherwise stated, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Cell Culture and Treatments—Jurkat T-cells (clone E6.1) were cultured at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. For chloride-reduced medium, RPMI 1640 was initially made lacking KCl and NaCl, which account for 99.5% of the total chloride content. To substitute the chloride anion, 5.3 mm potassium gluconate and 103.5 mm sodium gluconate were added to the medium, followed by adjustment to pH 7.5. The medium was examined for isotonicity using a 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc.). For modulation of chloride flux, cultured cells were either treated with the chloride channel inhibitor SITS or resuspended in chloride-reduced RPMI 1640 medium followed by incubation for 30–60 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells was induced by either application of 25 ng/ml recombinant FasL (Kamiya Biomedical Co.) or treatment with 30 mJ/cm2 UV-C light in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). After UV-C exposure (exposure time ∼30 s) the cells were placed back into the incubator. Using various dishes for UV-C exposure, the ratio of suspension volume per dish area was kept constant to ensure an equal energy dose in each case. Determination of Intracellular Chloride by Flow Cytometry—To determine intracellular chloride changes, the dye MEQ (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used. Prior to each experiment, the iodide salt of the dye was reduced to the cell-permeable form diH-MEQ with sodium borohydride as recommended by the manufacturer (16Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Inglefield J.R. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. Methods. 1999; 18: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Zhou J.G. Ren J.L. Qiu Q.Y. He H. Guan Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7301-7308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The resulting yellow oil was dissolved in 320 μl of Me2SO under nitrogen, resulting in a 50 mm stock solution. 5 μl of the 50 mm diH-MEQ stock solution were added to 1 ml of cells (5 × 105 cells/ml), yielding a final concentration of 250 μm. The membrane-permeable diH-MEQ was loaded by diffusion into the cells, where it was oxidized for 30 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere prior to examination. Changes in the MEQ fluorescence were determined by flow cytometry on a LSRII (BD Biosciences) equipped with FACSDiva software. For each sample, 10,000 cells were examined on a forward scatter versus MEQ fluorescence dot blot. A gate was used to obtain the mean MEQ fluorescence of stained cells with normal cell size. For calibration (Stern-Volmer analysis), cells were equilibrated for 15–20 min at room temperature in media ranging from 0 to 100 mm chloride containing 7.4 μm tributyltin and 10 μm nigericin. Sodium gluconate was used as a substitute for chloride in the media to maintain isotonicity. A plot of the ratio F0/F versus [Cl-] provides a straight line (see Fig. 1A). Changes in intracellular chloride concentration can be estimated with respect to changes in the mean MEQ fluorescence using the resulting equation representing the linear regression of the Stern-Volmer plot. For the determination of intracellular chloride, Jurkat T-cells were incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature in standard RPMI, RPMI containing 500 μm SITS, or chloride-reduced RPMI medium followed by flow cytometric analysis. Chloride measurements were made 4 h after the induction of apoptosis. Immediately prior to analysis by flow cytometry, propidium iodide (PI) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The difference in the mean MEQ fluorescence of apoptotic samples and the corresponding negative controls was used to calculate the decrease in intracellular chloride, applying the calibration equation from the Stern-Volmer analysis. Intracellular Sodium and Potassium Analysis by Flow Cytometry—For intracellular sodium and potassium measurements, 2 μl of 2.5 mm SBFI-AM (Na+) or PBFI-AM (K+) (Molecular Probes) stock (in Me2SO) were added to 1 ml of cells (5–10 × 105 cells/ml), yielding a final concentration of 5 μm. The dye was loaded into the cells for 1 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere prior to the time of examination. Immediately prior to analysis by flow cytometry, PI was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. 10,000 cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing either SBFI-AM or PBFI-AM and PI at 340–350 and 488 nm, respectively, using an LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Measurement of Plasma Membrane Potential Changes—For the analysis of changes in plasma membrane potential by flow cytometry, DiBAC4 (3Lang F. Ritter M. Gamper N. Huber S. Fillon S. Tanneur V. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Gulbins E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes) was used. Prior to the measurements, 7.5 μl of a 20 μm DiBAC4 (3Lang F. Ritter M. Gamper N. Huber S. Fillon S. Tanneur V. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Gulbins E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) stock (in Me2SO) were individually added to 1 ml of cells (5–10 × 105 cells/ml), yielding a final concentration of 150 nm. The dye was loaded into the cells for 30 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately prior to analysis by flow cytometry, PI was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. 10,000 cells were examined using a LSRII flow cytometer and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) with an excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 and 585 nm for DiBAC4 (3Lang F. Ritter M. Gamper N. Huber S. Fillon S. Tanneur V. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Gulbins E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and PI, respectively. Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Jurkat T-cells (2–4 × 107) were collected by centrifugation at times indicated after apoptosis induction and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by using a mitochondria/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision). The protein content of each sample was analyzed using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Extracts were stored at -70 °C until further use. The amount of released cytochrome c in the cytosolic extracts was analyzed with a Quantikine human cytochrome c enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems). Cell Lysate Preparation—Jurkat T-cells (5–7 × 106) were collected by centrifugation 5 h after apoptosis induction and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 tablet/10 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, the protein content was analyzed using a protein assay, and the lysates were stored at -70 °C until further use. Cell Lysate Preparation for Kinase Phosphorylation Analysis—Jurkat T-cells (2.25 × 106) were collected by centrifugation 1 h after apoptosis induction and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 tablet/10 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by sonification for 10 × 1 s on ice. The protein content was analyzed using a protein assay, and the lysates were stored at -70 °C until further use. Protein Detection by Western Blotting—30 or 50 μg of protein/sample were diluted in Laemmli loading buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol and denatured at 100 °C for 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% precast Tris/glycine gels (Bio-Rad) at 150 V. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran 0.2 μm; Schleicher and Schuell) at 250 mA for 80 min, following standard protocols. After blocking with bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated with the various primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL-based detection (Amersham Biosciences). Hoechst Staining—Jurkat T-cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 prior to apoptotic stimulation. Cells were washed, resuspended in normal or chloride reduced medium, and induced to undergo apoptosis. After 5 h, a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 NLO mounted on an Axiovert 100M microscope; Zeiss), operating in 2-photon excitation mode, was used to obtain the fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images. The images were obtained simultaneously using the 750 line from the included titanium sapphire laser as the light source and the Zeiss Plan-Apo ×63 oil numerical aperture = 1.4 as the objective lens. For fluorescence, a 390–465-nm band pass filter was used for the emission. The software used for acquisition was Zeiss LSM510 version 3.2 for Windows 2000. DNA Degradation Analysis by Flow Cytometry—From various samples, 1–2 ml of cells (5–10 × 105 cells/ml) were pelleted 6 h after induction of apoptosis. The cells were fixed by the slow addition of 5 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored overnight at -20 °C. For flow analysis, the fixed cells were pelleted, washed in ice-cold PBS, and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml PI, 10 units/ml RNase One (Promega) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. 7,500 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSort by gating on a PI area versus width dot plot. The percentage of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of examined cells. DNA Degradation Analysis by Agarose Gel—For the analysis of DNA degradation, 2–5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation 6 h after induction of apoptosis and resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA) and stored at -70 °C until further use. DNA content was determined at 260 nm, and 2.0 μg of DNA/sample were analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as average ± S.E. Averages were compared by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc testing using Dunnett's analysis for single comparison with a sample of interest. A p value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. UV-C- but Not FasL-induced Cell Death Results in an Intracellular Chloride Decrease—During programmed cell death, an iso-osmotic loss of cellular volume or apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) is routinely observed. This process is driven by the loss of intracellular ions, particularly sodium and potassium, but the role of anions and in particular chloride ions during AVD is far less understood (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 9Barbiero G. Duranti F. Bonelli G. Amenta J.S. Baccino F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated changes in intracellular chloride concentration during FasL- or UV-C-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. Cells were loaded with the reduced, cell-permeable dye diH-MEQ to analyze intracellular chloride changes. This dye has previously been used to monitor intracellular chloride changes in various cell types (16Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Inglefield J.R. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. Methods. 1999; 18: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Zhou J.G.

Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but not in apoptotic cells. Inside the cell, diH-MEQ is oxidized to the polar MEQ molecule, which is trapped in the cell, resulting in a uniform staining without significant dye compartmentation (16Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The MEQ fluorescence is quenched by increasing halide concentrations. We measured by flow cytometry the mean MEQ fluorescence of stained Jurkat T-cells with normal size equilibrated in media ranging from 0 to 100 mm chloride ([Cl-]). A Stern-Volmer analysis was performed, plotting the ratio F0/F versus [Cl-], resulting in a straight line (Fig. 1A). F0/F is the ratio of fluorescence without chloride (F0) to fluorescence values measured in the presence of the different chloride concentrations (F). The resulting values from the linear regression analysis of the Stern-Volmer plot were used to calculate the actual intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) from measured mean fluorescence values of cells in different media. To measure the intracellular chloride content under different conditions, we suspended human Jurkat T-cells in standard RPMI 1640 medium, RPMI 1640 medium containing 500 μm SITS, a concentration previously shown to inhibit chloride channels (21Butt A.G. McLaughlin C.W. Bowler J.M. Purves R.D. Macknight A.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or RMPI 1640 medium with reduced chloride content (see “Experimental Procedures”) to deplete intracellular chloride (21Butt A.G. McLaughlin C.W. Bowler J.M. Purves R.D. Macknight A.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Takeuchi S. Ando M. Irimajiri A. Hear. Res. 1997; 113: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Lambert A. Lowe A.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 275: 51-63Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Aull F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The measured mean MEQ fluorescence values were used to calculate the intracellular chloride concentration under each condition. The intracellular chloride concentration of Jurkat T-cells in standard RPMI 1640 was ∼58 mm (Fig. 1B). This value is in accordance with a previously reported value for intracellular chloride in lymphocytes (25Pilas B. Durack G. Cytometry. 1997; 28: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of the chloride channel inhibitor SITS resulted in an increase of intracellular chloride of ∼20 mm (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells cultured in chloride-reduced RPMI 1640 showed a significant decrease in intracellular chloride to ∼12 mm (Fig. 1B). Having validated a technique to quantitate chloride, we then determined how intracellular chloride changes after induction of apoptosis with either FasL or UV-C light, a well studied inducer of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. For these experiments, human Jurkat T-cells were cultured in standard RPMI 1640 medium, RPMI 1640 medium containing 500 μm SITS, or chloride-depleted RPMI 1640 medium. Apoptosis was induced either by the addition of 25 ng/ml FasL or treatment with 30 mJ/cm2 UV-C (exposure time is about 30 s). The mean MEQ fluorescence of normal sized cells was analyzed 4 h after induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry using a forward scatter versus MEQ fluorescence dot blot. The difference in the mean fluorescence values of treated cells to the corresponding negative controls was calculated. The resulting difference was used with the Stern-Volmer regression values to calculate the intracellular chloride change in apoptotic samples. Only UV-C and not FasL treatment resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular chloride of about 30 mm (Fig. 1C). The loss in intracellular chloride is blocked by incubation of the cells with SITS (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, no chloride decrease occurs in cells treated with UV-C that were already depleted of their intracellular chloride due to the culturing in a medium with reduced chloride content (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no difference was observed in the intracellular chloride content of cells treated with FasL in the presence of SITS or following intracellular chloride depletion. These data suggest that UV-C- but not FasL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells results in an intracellular chloride decrease that can be abolished by chloride flux modulation. Chloride Flux Modulation Reduces the Number of Cells Showing UV-C-induced AVD Mediated by Potassium Efflux—AVD is a characteristic hallmark of apoptotic cell death, and it is linked to a loss of intracellular potassium (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to evaluate if chloride flux modulation alters the efflux of intracellular potassium. Jurkat T-cells were cultured and treated with either FasL or UV-C to initiate apoptosis as described above. Cell size and intracellular potassium content were simultaneously analyzed after 4 h by flow cytometry using a forward scatter (cell size) versus PBFI fluorescence (potassium content) three-dimensional plot. Compared with the control cells, treatment with FasL or UV-C in normal medium resulted in an increased population of cells with reduced intracellular potassium (red circle) and a corresponding smaller cell size (Fig. 2A, first row). The treatment with FasL in the presence of SITS enhanced potassium depletion accompanied by cell shrinkage (Fig. 2A, second row). In contrast, UV-C exposure in the presence of SITS reduced cell shrinkage and the corresponding loss of potassium (Fig. 2A, second row). FasL treatment in medium with reduced chloride content did not significantly change the number of cells that shrunk and had low potassium (Fig. 2A, third row). In contrast, UV-C treatment of cells in medium with reduced chloride concentration decreased the number of cells undergoing apoptotic volume decrease and potassium loss (Fig. 2A, third row). These data were also analyzed on a forward scatter versus PBFI fluorescence dot plot, and the percentage of cells gated in a region for cells with decreased intracellular potassium content and decreased cell size is summarized in Fig. 2B. Clearly, FasL and UV-C treatment results in an increased percentage of cells having lost potassium and decreased cell size. In the case of UV-C, either the chloride channel inhibitor or the chloride-reduced medium significantly reduced the number of cells with a smaller cell size and a loss of potassium. In contrast, treatment with FasL in the presence of SITS even enhanced significantly potassium depletion and cell shrinkage. Together, these data suggest that modulation of chloride flux by using either a chloride channel inhibitor or depleting intracellular chloride affects only the UV-C-induced loss of potassium and thus the number of cells exhibiting AVD in Jurkat T-cells. Chloride Flux Modulation Inhibits the Rise in Intracellular Sodium during Apoptosis—It has recently been shown that induction of apoptosis is associated with changes in intracellular sodium (6Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39176-39184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine how chloride flux modulation affects changes in intracellular sodium in response to stimulation of apoptosis. Following pretreatment with SITS or the change to chloride reduced medium, Jurkat T-cells were examined 4 h after either FasL or UV-C treatment. Shown are histogram plots for the SBFI fluorescence (sodium content). Interestingly, treatment with either FasL or UV-C resulted in a second population"
https://openalex.org/W2043638353,"A tetramer model for HIV-1 integrase (IN) with DNA representing 20 bp of the U3 and U5 long terminal repeats (LTR) termini was assembled using structural and biochemical data and molecular dynamics simulations. It predicted amino acid residues on the enzyme surface that can interact with the LTR termini. A separate structural alignment of HIV-1, simian sarcoma virus (SIV), and avian sarcoma virus (ASV) INs predicted which of these residues were unique. To determine whether these residues were responsible for specific recognition of the LTR termini, the amino acids from ASV IN were substituted into the structurally equivalent positions of HIV-1 IN, and the ability of the chimeras to 3 ′ process U5 HIV-1 or ASV duplex oligos was determined. This analysis demonstrated that there are multiple amino acid contacts with the LTRs and that substitution of ASV IN amino acids at many of the analogous positions in HIV-1 IN conferred partial ability to cleave ASV substrates with a concomitant loss in the ability to cleave the homologous HIV-1 substrate. HIV-1 IN residues that changed specificity include Val72, Ser153, Lys160–Ile161, Gly163–Val165, and His171–Leu172. Because a chimera that combines several of these substitutions showed a specificity of cleavage of the U5 ASV substrate closer to wild type ASV IN compared with chimeras with individual amino acid substitutions, it appears that the sum of the IN interactions with the LTRs determines the specificity. Finally, residues Ser153 and Val72 in HIV-1 IN are among those that change in enzymes that develop resistance to naphthyridine carboxamide- and diketo acid-related inhibitors in cells. Thus, amino acid residues involved in recognition of the LTRs are among these positions that change in development of drug resistance.

DNA integration is a concerted process that occurs in defined stages. After assembly of a stable complex of the viral integrase (IN) and host cell proteins with specific DNA sequences at the end of the HIV-1 LTR, the terminal dinucleotides are removed from each 3′ end by endonucleolytic processing. The viral DNA 3′ ends are then covalently linked to the host cell target DNA in a concerted reaction. Biochemical details concerning the processing and joining steps in the integration process have been reported for several retroviruses including avian sarcomaleukosis virus (ASV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and HIV-1. Specific DNA sequences at the 3′ end of the viral LTR are required for recognition by the assembled viral integrase complex. Typically, the terminal 12–20 nucleotides are sufficient. After 3′ processing of the CAXX sequence from the ends, viral DNA ends are joined by the viral integrase and the gapped intermediates are repaired, and unpaired viral 5′ ends are excised by host nucleases. This results in a 4–6-base pair duplication of host cell DNA, depending upon the virus, flanking the integrated viral DNA. Both the 3′ processing and viral DNA-host DNA joining steps require integrase to be assembled on the specific viral DNA substrate. Integration of viral into host DNA occurs with limited sequence specificity (1.Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several cell proteins have been reported to affect the integration process (2.Aiyar A. Hindmarsh P. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3571-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Farnet C.M.

Much of the information available concerning the molecular mechanism of integration comes from the use of reconstituted systems employing duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos). The ASV IN, for example, catalyzes specific cleavage at the 3′ end of the strands adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide using 15-bp substrates corresponding to the ASV U3 or U5 termini (9.Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 20: 2556-2567Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar substrates were used to demonstrate the joining reaction in which one oligo integrated into another (11.Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12.Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For HIV-1 duplex oligo substrates of comparable size, selected nucleotide substitutions in the U5 and U3 LTR regions were shown to affect one or both of the catalytic functions of HIV-1 integrase. Nucleic acid substitutions in the HIV-1 U5 LTR region, for example, can inhibit 3′ processing (e.g. positions 1–5 and 9–11) or not (e.g. positions 6–8 and 12–14) (13.Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Other changes at specific nucleic acid positions in the HIV-1 U3 and U5 LTR regions can affect each of the catalytic reactions, although changes in one region can be more pronounced than in the other. Single LTR end duplex oligos are valuable tools for examining IN catalytic activity. Nevertheless, most do not display the concerted nature of the DNA integration reaction that was first demonstrated by Goff and co-worker (14.Murphy J.E. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, deletions were introduced 5′ to the conserved CA dinucleotide in the MuLV U3 LTR region. When cells were infected with the mutant viruses, processing at the ends of both the U3 and U5 LTR regions was affected adversely. This finding implies that the two ends of the viral DNA were brought together at the insertion site such that mutations in one affected the processing of the other. A homodimer of IN supports 3′ processing and one-ended joining, whereas a homotetramer of IN supports these activities in a two-ended concerted DNA integration reaction (15.Faure A. Calmels C. Desjobert C. Castroviejo M. Caumont-Sarcos A. Tarrago-Litvak L. Litvak S. Parissi V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus the biologically important form of IN is likely to be a tetramer. Several assay systems that display concerted DNA integration properties have been described and used to demonstrate that changes in retroviral DNA integration are context-dependent. For example, base pair substitutions in the dominant LTR (HIV-1 U5 and ASV U3) cause significant decreases in the rate of catalysis. In contrast, comparable substitutions in the nondominant LTR, the HIV-1 U3 and ASV U5 LTR regions, are associated with changes in the mechanism from concerted to nonconcerted DNA integration (2.Aiyar A.

Virology. 1996; 226: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Like HIV-1, ASV and MuLV concerted DNA integration is affected by changes in the LTR region, although the critical positions differ among the different retroviruses. HIV-1 integrase is a 288-amino acid protein composed of three functional domains that are required for each of the catalytic reactions (25.Engelman A. Englund G. Orenstein J. Martin M. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The conserved N-terminal domain (residues 1–50) contains a HHCC zinc-binding site, and binding of Zn2+ to this domain may participate in promoting the formation of IN oligomers (26.Lee S.P. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27.Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain, the least conserved of the three domains in terms of amino acid sequence, is composed of a bundle of three α-helices that form a Src homology-3 fold. This domain has nonspecific DNA binding activity and determinants for multimerization (30.Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The catalytic core domain contains residues required for catalytic activity, including a conserved DDE motif that binds the required metal cofactor (1.Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Photo-cross-linking reagents have defined areas of the HIV-1 IN surface in close proximity to the LTR ends (13.Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 31.Heuer T.S. Brown P.O.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The viral DNA sequences stimulate high affinity binding of drugs that target the catalytic functions of integrase, suggesting that integrase may assume a distinct enzymatically active conformation following assembly (35.Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nature. 2005; 4: 236-248Google Scholar, 36.Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 351-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No full-length integrase structure has yet been determined by x-ray crystallography. Therefore, little is known about how the three domains are positioned relative to one another in the active oligomeric state (37.Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 38.Petit C. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or what specific amino acid residues are involved in recognition of the viral DNA substrate. Some insight into the assembly of a stable complex of integrase with specific DNA sequences can be gleaned from DNA transposable elements. Such elements share a common mechanism of integration with retroviruses, and the catalytic domains of ASV and HIV integrases are highly homologous to those of Mu, Tn5, and Tc3 transposases (39.Davies D. Goryshin I. Reznikoff W. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 40.Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 41.Mizuuchi K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 42.Graig N.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11904-11913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Tc3 transposase is a 329-amino acid protein with an N-terminal DNA binding domain, a discreet second DNA binding domain flanking the N-terminal domain, and a catalytic core domain with a DDE motif (44.van Pouderoyen G. Ketting R.F. Perrakis A. Plasterk R.H. Sixma T.K. EMBO. 1997; 16: 6044-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the following study, we developed a structural model for HIV-1 IN with bound LTR DNA ends. This model was used to predict amino acid interactions between residues on the IN surface and the LTRs. By substituting amino acids from ASV IN into the structurally related positions of HIV-1, we identified a series of residues that participate in the specific recognition of the LTR ends. Reagents—[γ-33P]ATP (2500 Ci/mmol), HiTrap™ chelating HP resin, and HiTrap™ heparin HP resin were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from United States Biochemical (Cleveland, OH). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Roche Applied Science. A Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette was obtained from Pierce. Centriprep centrifugal filter devices with YM-10 MW membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Acrylamide and bisacrylamide solutions were from Bio-Rad. Simple Blue Safestain was from Invitrogen. DE81 filters were purchased from Whatman. Unless specified, all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). ASV IN was provided by Dr. Ann Skalka (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The protein expression host cells, BL21 (DE3), were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). An expression construct for HIV-1 IN 1–288 residues (p28bIN-3CS-F185H) was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Ann Skalka and was constructed by Dr. Mark Andrake. The construct contains the wild type NY5 HIV-1 sequence of the IN gene (Parke-Davis clone) from the NdeI to the HindIII site in the pET28b plasmid vector. The IN sequence encodes four substitutions (C56S, C65S, C280S, and F185H) to increase the solubility of HIV-1 IN and a six-amino acid His tag and thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the gene. A translation stop codon was added after residue Asp288. Preparation of Duplex Oligo Substrates—The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used in the integrase activity assay shown in Scheme 1. The plus-strand substrates (100 pmol, containing the conserved “CA” dinucleotides) were 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (30 U) and 2 μl of [γ-33P]ATP as described previously (45.Johnson M. Morris S. Chen A. Stavnezer E. Leis J. BMC Biol. 2004. 2004; 2/8Google Scholar). The specific activity of the radiolabeled substrates was diluted to 105 cpm/pmol using an unlabeled processed strand oligo, and the mixture was purified and recovered from a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Duplex oligos were formed by annealing to a molar excess of unlabeled complementary strand as described (46.Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Construction of Chimera HIV-1/ASV INs—Mutagenesis oligodeoxyribonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA) and are listed in the table found in the supplemental data. The mutations were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's directions. Codon preferences for Escherichia coli were used in the design of the oligos. For chimeras S54–57, the mutations were introduced by the PCR overlap extension method (47.Aiyar A. Leis J. BioFeedback. 1993; 14: 366-367Google Scholar). The presence of all mutations was confirmed by sequencing the complete individual DNA clones. A gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to purify all PCR products. The Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to prepare DNAs. Purification of HIV-1 IN and Chimeras—His-tagged HIV-1 IN and chimeras were purified as described previously (48.Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, expression of proteins was induced in BL21 (DE3) cells at 20 °C by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm after the bacteria had grown to optical density at an A600 of 0.8. Bacteria were lysed in 25 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.1, 1 m KCl, 1 m urea, 1% thiodiglycol, and 5 mm imidazole and then filtered through an 0.2-μm membrane from Nalgene (Rochester, NY). The lysates fraction was applied to a HiTrap™ chelating HP nickel-affinity column (5 ml) (Amersham Biosciences), and IN was eluted with a 5 mm to 1.0 m linear imidazole gradient. Fractions containing partially purified IN, detected by absorbency at 280 nm, were pooled and applied to a HiTrap™ heparin HP column (5 ml), and His-tagged IN was eluted with a 0.25–1.0 m linear KCl gradient. The pooled heparin IN fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep filter with YM-10 MW membrane and then dialyzed against 25 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.1, 0.5 m KCl, 1% thiodiglycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay as described by the manufacturer. The N-terminal poly His tag was removed from S160–161 and S153 chimeras using a thrombin kit from Novagen as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cleavage reaction in 50 μl contained cleavage buffer, 10 μg of IN, and 0.1 unit of thrombin (diluted 1:10) and was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. An additional 0.1 unit of thrombin was then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min. Twenty μl of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins (Novage) equilibrated with 25 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.1, was added to the reaction mixture and stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant containing the thrombin was discarded. The resin was washed with 25 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.1, and then the processed IN was eluted with 150 mm imidazole buffer. Integrase 3′ End Processing Assay Using Duplex Oligodeoxyribonucleotide Substrates—The processing reactions for the HIV-1 U5 LTR substrate were carried out as described previously (46.Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Reactions were in a volume of 10 μl with 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm potassium glutamate, 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 5% Me2SO, 500 ng of HIV-1, or HIV-1 chimeras and 1 pmol of labeled HIV-1 U5 duplex substrate as indicated. Reaction mixtures were assembled from individual components and preincubated on ice overnight. To start the processing reaction, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then placed on ice. Products of the reaction were separated through a 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Labeled reaction products were visualized using Kodak MR film exposed overnight. For reactions containing ASV U5 or U3 LTR substrate, the final reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 ng of ASV IN, and 1 pmol of labeled duplex substrates as indicated. Structural Model for HIV-1 IN with Bound LTR DNA—The initial model for the full-length three-domain IN structure was constructed using the separate two-domain crystal structures of the N-terminal domain and catalytic core (PDB code 1K6Y (49.Wang J.-Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar)) and the catalytic core and C-terminal domain (PDB code 1EX4 (50.Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)). The two-domain structures were combined to form a three-domain structure by superimposing the catalytic core domains. The 1K6Y tetramer built from crystal lattice contacts was the basis for forming the tetramer of full-length IN. The zinc coordination complex was covalently modeled using 2.25-Å bond length restraints to the coordinating histidines and 2.35 Å to the coordinating cysteines. Residues 271–288 are disordered at the C terminus (50.Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and were omitted from the model. Residues 47–55 between the N-terminal and catalytic domains and the loop of residues 140–148 are disordered in the N-terminal two-domain structure (49.Wang J.-Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The missing loops were produced by obtaining initial Cα–Cα distances from a dynamic programming search of overlapping 30-mers generated from the whole PDB protein structure data base (51.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27937) Google Scholar). The program AMMP (52.Harrison R.W. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 14: 1112-1122Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was used with the current all-atom sp4 potential set (53.Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 54.Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 11: 2365-2374Google Scholar). The charge generation parameters were taken from Bagossi et al. (55.Bagossi P. Zahuczky G. Tozser J. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. J. Mol. Model. 1999; 5: 143-152Crossref Google Scholar). The new atoms were built using the Kohonen and analytic model-building features of AMMP (56.Harrison R.W. J. Math. Chem. 1999; 26: 125-137Crossref Google Scholar), minimized with conjugate gradients. The amortized fast multipole algorithm in AMMP was used for the long-range terms in the nonbonded and electrostatic potentials so that no cut-off radius was employed. The model contained 4 potassium and 4 phosphate ions from the crystal structures. The tetramer model was solvated in 16,195 water molecules. This solvated integrase was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for 1.0 ns on a 1-GHz Linux PC. Frames were saved every 1 ps. The initial model for viral DNA was taken from the crystal structure of 1K61, which contained 20 base pairs of B-DNA. The DNA was converted to the HIV U5 sequence using the AMMP molecular mechanics and dynamics program (52.Harrison R.W. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 14: 1112-1122Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). AMMP was used to generate new atomic positions by means of an analytic coordinate generator (56.Harrison R.W. J. Math. Chem. 1999; 26: 125-137Crossref Google Scholar) followed by conjugate gradients minimization for each substituted base pair. Then the entire DNA molecule was minimized using conjugate gradients with all nonbonded and geometric terms. The DNA was positioned approximately using the DNA at the catalytic site of Tn5 transposase as a guide to place the processed 3′-OH at the catalytic site of IN. The two processed deoxyribonucleotides GT were removed from the 3′ end. A magnesium ion was placed between the 3′-OH, and the side chains of Asp64 and Asp116 at the catalytic site of each subunit. The DNA was rotated and translated into the groove formed between the catalytic domain of subunit B and the N- and C-terminal domains of subunit D approximately using the program O (57.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The fit to IN was optimized using the GDock routine of AMMP with harmonic restraints to atomic positions for critical atoms (tethers) and restraints on the DNA interatomic distances followed by conjugate gradients minimization. The GDock routine uses a genetic algorithm to search rotational and translational space where the rotational components are represented with unit quaternions. The use of unit quaternions instead of orthogonal rotation matrices avoids artificial singularities in the search space and greatly enhances the convergence of the algorithm. The two unpaired nucleotides 1 and 2 were moved out of the B-form using torsion searches to eliminate collisions with the protein. The 3′-OH was restrained to coordinate with the magnesium ion at the catalytic site. Once the first DNA was placed in the groove, the second LTR end was placed by symmetry in the adjacent groove between the catalytic domains of subunit D and the N- and C-terminal domains of subunit B followed by alternating rigid body movements of the LTR and C-terminal domain using GDock to overcome collisions (as the tetramer is not completely symmetric). Finally, the complex was minimized by conjugate gradients to ensure good nonbonded interactions. Structural Model of HIV-1 IN with LTR DNA—Although a crystal structure for full-length HIV-1 integrase is not yet available, we developed a model for an IN homotetramer bound to its LTR DNA substrate using knowledge of existing integrase two-domain structures, the retrotransposon transposase (Tc3 and Tn5), and the deduced amino acid sequence alignment of known retroviral integrases. Fig. 1 shows our structural model for HIV-1 integrase. We assembled the three functional domains of integrase into an integrated structure by superimposing the separate two-domain crystal structures for integrase: the N-terminal domain and catalytic core (PDB code 1K6Y (44.van Pouderoyen G.

Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1A). A tetramer model of IN was assembled using crystal lattice contacts (Fig. 1B). In this model the N- and C-terminal domains were arranged on the same side of the subunit and lay relatively close to each other. Molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated IN tetramer model were used to explore the conformational variation of the three domains in t"

A variety of conditions can alter the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to properly fold proteins, thus resulting in ER stress. Cells respond to ER stress by activating different signal transduction pathways leading to increased transcription of chaperone genes, decreased protein synthesis, and eventually to apoptosis. In the present paper we analyzed the role that the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) plays in regulating cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from TRAF2-/- mice were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by ER stress than the wild type counterpart. This increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis was because of an increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species following ER stress, and was abolished by the use of antioxidant. In addition, we demonstrated that the NF-κB pathway protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, controlling ROS accumulation. Our results underscore the involvement of TRAF2 in regulating ER stress responses and the role of NF-κB in protecting cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.

The ER has evolved specific signaling pathway to deal with the potential danger represented by the misfolded proteins. This adaptive response is named unfolded protein response (3Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Activation of unfolded protein response results in attenuation of protein synthesis, and up-regulation of genes encoding chaperones that facilitate the protein folding process in the ER. Thus, unfolded protein response reduces accumulation and aggregation of malfolded proteins, giving the cell the possibility of correcting the environment inside the ER (3Kaufman R.J.

Ire1s and PERK are kept in an inactive state through association of their N-terminal lumen domain with the chaperone BiP. Following accumulation of malfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER, BiP dissociates to bind the malfolded proteins and Ire1s and PERK undergo oligomerization and transphosphorylation within their cytoplasmic kinase domains (8Bertolotti A.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Other stress response pathways are activated following ER stress, such as the JNK/SAPK and NF-κB pathways (10Urano F.

Consiglio E. Formisano S. Di Jeso B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways following ER stress is mediated by the physical and functional interaction of Ire1α and TRAF2 (10Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). The central role played by TRAF2 in mediating cellular response to ER stress has been proposed based upon the observation that ectopic expression of a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 lacking the N terminus Ring finger domain, blocks ER stress-induced NF-κB and JNK/SAPK activation, and that mouse embryonic fibroblast derived from TRAF2 knock-out mice failed to activate NF-κB following ER stress (10Urano F.

Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRAF2-deficient MEFs are very sensitive to cell death induced by TNF and other members of the TNF receptor family (14Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

At least part of the anti-apoptotic effect of TRAF2 can be explained by its function as a mediator of NF-κB activation, thus leading to NF-κB-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic genes. The anti-apoptotic activity of NF-κB also involves inhibition of the JNK cascade via at least two distinct mechanisms: through GADD45-β-mediated blockade of MKK7 and interference with ROS production (16Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Bubici C. Jayawardena S. Alvarez K. Matsuda S. Nguyen D.U. Pham C.G. Nelsbach A.H. Melis T. De Smaele E. Tang W.J. D'Adamio L. Franzoso G. Nat. Cell.

It is well known that ROS or oxidative stress plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes such as aging, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases (18Bray T.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 195Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Forsberg L. deFaire U. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that accumulation of misfolded protein within the lumen of the ER causes accumulation of ROS and cell death (21Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether some of the key molecules involved in ER stress response, such as TRAF2, are involved in modulation of ROS and induction of apoptosis. Here we use MEFs derived from TRAF2 knock-out mice to study the role of TRAF2 in the regulation of pro-survival or pro-apoptotic pathways following ER stress. Cell Culture and Biological Reagents—Wild type (WT) and TRAF2-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were provided by Drs. T. W. Mak and W. C. Yeh (14Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J.

Franzoso, respectively (22Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Thapsigargin was from Calbiochem and used at 5–50 nm; tunicamycin was purchased from Roche and used at 50–150 ng/ml. Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 5 μm; l-NAC was dissolved in sterile water and used at 5 mm. Anti-TRAF2, anti-IκBα, and anti-JNK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The TRAF2 full-length expression vector was previously described (24Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent monolayer of murine embryonic fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche). Equal amounts of total proteins (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 4 °C for Western blot analysis. Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Then, filters were probed with specific antibodies in the same buffer for 14–16 h at 4 °C. After TBS-T washing to remove excess primary antibodies, the blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins with Hyper-film ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assay, WT, TRAF2-/-, and TRAF2FL MEFs (4 × 105 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well (35 mm) plates. After 12 h cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Ig-κB-LUC reporter gene plasmid using Lipofectamine. Cells were stimulated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin for 8 h, and reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase assay system (Promega). A pRSV-β-galactosidase vector (0.2 μg) was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies. Retroviral Infection—Full-length hemagglutinin-tagged TRAF2 was subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pBMN by standard cloning techniques. pBMN vector was then transfected in a packaging cell line using Lipofectamine. 48 h after transfection, the viral supernatants were supplemented with Polybrene (9 mg/ml) and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter. TRAF2-/- fibroblasts (1 × 106) were incubated with viral supernatants for 48 h. The expression of exogenous protein was assayed by Western blot analysis on total cell extracts using anti-TRAF2 antibodies. ER Stress Induction and Measurements of Apoptosis—5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C with different concentrations of thapsigargin or tunicamycin. Cell survival was examined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cell death was assessed by staining the exposed phosphatidylserine on cell membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (BD Pharmingen), or propidium iodide staining according to Nicoletti et al. (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (Beck-p65 man Coulter, Fullerton, CA), equipped with ModFit Software. Results were mean ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments. Measurement of ROS Production—Reactive oxygen species were detected with H2DCFDA (Calbiochem). H2DCFDA diffuses into the cells where it is converted into a non-fluorescent derivative (H2DCF) by endogenous esterases. H2DCF is oxidized to green fluorescent DCF in the presence of intracellular ROS. Cells were routinely treated with either tunicamycin or thapsigargin for 24 or 48 h, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of H2DCFDA in serum-free medium. Me2SO-treated cells were used as controls. After incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan Cell Scanner (BD Biosciences). Kinase Assay—JNK immunoprecipitates were used for the immune complex kinase assay that was performed at 30 °C for 10 min with 2 μg of substrate, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total of 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm Na3VO4, and 50 μm dithiothreitol). The substrate was glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79). The reaction was terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and the products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Increased Susceptibility of TRAF2-/- MEFs to ER Stress-induced Apoptosis—TRAF2 is a scaffold protein that transduces signals from membrane receptors and the ER membrane (10Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 11Leonardi A. Vito P. Mauro C. Pacifico F. Ulianich L. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Di Jeso B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of TRAF2 in apoptosis induced by ER stress, we treated MEFs derived from TRAF2-/- mice and WT MEFs with increasing concentrations of thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Both drugs induce ER stress by inhibiting ER-resident Ca2+-ATPase, and N-glycosylation, respectively. After a 48-h treatment, some morphological changes were observed. In particular, WT MEFs showed an extended shape, typical of cellular stress response, whereas TRAF2-/- MEFs appeared detached and shrunken (Fig. 1A). Because these morphological changes were reminiscent of apoptosis, we performed annexin V staining on WT and TRAF2-/- MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin caused a dramatic increase in apoptosis in TRAF2-/- MEFs but not in WT MEFs. The higher sensitivity to apoptosis observed in TRAF2-/- MEFs was not because of an intrinsic defect of these cells, given that reintroduction of TRAF2 (TRAF2FL) completely rescued cell viability (Fig. 1, C–E). TRAF2-/- MEFs showed the same susceptibility as WT MEFs to serum starvation- and doxorubicin-induced cell death (Fig. 1F). These results suggest a specific role for TRAF2 in modulating survival signals from the ER. ROS Mediate Increased Apoptosis in TRAF2-/- MEFs—ER stress has recently been shown to promote oxidative stress and apoptosis (21Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Hence, to have some insight on the molecular mechanism determining the increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis, we compared ROS production in WT and TRAF2-/- MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin caused an increase in ROS production in TRAF2-/- MEFs but not in WT. Reconstitution of these cells with TRAF2 (TRAF2FL) blocked ROS accumulation following treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate whether the increased production of ROS was responsible for the susceptibility of TRAF2-/- MEFs to ER stress-induced apoptosis, TRAF2-/- MEFs were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin in the presence of different antioxidants and 48 h later cell viability was measured by MTS assay and the ROS level by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3, NAC abolished ROS accumulation and protected these cells from apoptosis. Similar results were obtained by using dithiothreitol as antioxidant (data not shown). Interestingly, also the small percentage of WT MEFs and reconstituted TRAF2-/- MEFs undergoing apoptosis following treatment with tunicamycin and thapsigargin were almost completely protected by both antioxidants (Fig. 3 and data not shown). These results demonstrated that susceptibility of TRAF2-/- MEFs to ER stress-induced apoptosis was because of increased accumulation of ROS. It is worth noting that in TRAF2-/- cells, higher levels of ROS and apoptosis were detected, even in the absence of ER stressing agents (Fig. 1, B and E, and data not shown).FIGURE 3ROS production correlates with endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. WT, TRAF2-/-, and TRAF2FL MEFs were treated with Me2SO (Co), 150 ng/ml tunicamycin (Tun), or 20 nm thapsigargin (Thaps) for 48 h, in the presence or absence of antioxidants (NAC or dithiothreitol). ROS production was assessed by flow cytometry after labeling with H2DCFDA. Cell viability was evaluated by MTS assay. Data are mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments.

MEFs derived from p65 knock-out and JNK1/2 double knock-out mice were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin in the presence or absence of NAC. As shown in Fig. 4A, p65-/- MEFs showed very high levels of ROS following treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin. As expected, treatment with NAC decreased ROS accumulation by about 40%. In contrast, JNK1/2-/- MEFs showed an accumulation of ROS similar to WT MEFs (Fig. 4A). Statistical analysis is reported in Fig. 4B. We next investigated the susceptibility of p65-/- and JNK1/2-/- MEFs to apoptosis induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in the presence or absence of NAC. As shown in Fig. 4C, p65-/- MEFs were highly susceptible to apoptosis compared with WT MEF and treatment with NAC significantly increased cell viability. JNK1/2-/- MEFs did not show susceptibility to ER stress-induced cell death, as compared with WT MEFs. These results suggest that NF-κB protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis by controlling ROS accumulation. To have further insight on the cross-talk between the NF-κB and the JNK pathways after ER stress, we evaluated activation of both pathways in WT, TRAF2-/-, and reconstituted TRAF2FL MEFs. Treatment with tunicamycin caused activation of NF-κB in WT and TRAF2FL MEFs, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the inhibitory subunit IκBα (Fig. 5A) and by the increased activity of a κB-driven luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5B). In the absence of TRAF2 it was not possible to detect activation of NF-κB. The observed activation of NF-κB was functional as demonstrated by the reappearance of the inhibitory subunit IκBα, a known early target gene of NF-κB (Fig. 5A). Activation of JNK in WT and TRAF2FL MEFs stimulated with tunicamycin was detected 90 min after stimulation and decreased thereafter. Treatment with antioxidant did not affect JNK activation (Fig. 6). In contrast, in TRAF2-/- MEFs, activation of JNK was detectable only 6 h after stimulation and remained sustained for up to 12 h. This sustained activation of JNK was almost completely suppressed by NAC (Fig. 6). This result confirms that TRAF2 was necessary to activate JNK after ER stress, and suggests that the increased level of ROS detected in the absence of TRAF2 may mediate the sustained activation of JNK. This is in agreement with previous reports showing that after TNF stimulation the early activation of JNK depends on TRAF2 and that the sustained activation of JNK depends on ROS (26Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Altogether these results suggested that following ER stress, the TRAF2-mediated activation of NF-κB was responsible for protection from apoptosis by decreasing ROS levels and controlling sustained JNK activation. The endoplasmic reticulum is the principal site for protein synthesis and folding, and also serves as a cellular storage site for calcium. Agents that interfere with protein folding or export lead to ER stress and eventually cell death. Although initiation of apoptosis induced by death receptors and mitochondria is well studied, the mechanism by which ER stress triggers apoptosis is still not clear. In the present paper, we present evidence supporting a central role played by TRAF2 in regulation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways initiated at the ER. We demonstrate that TRAF2-/- MEFs have increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis. This increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis was because of accumulation of ROS following ER stress, and was abolished by the use of antioxidants, such as NAC. In addition, we demonstrated that NF-κB was protecting cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis by controlling ROS accumulation. TRAF2 has been demonstrated to be involved in signaling from endoplasmic reticulum being able to interact with Ire1 (10Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar), one of the ER transmembrane proteins involved in initiating signals from the ER. TRAF2 mediates activation of both the JNK/SAPK and the NF-κB pathways following ER stress (10Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 11Leonardi A. Vito P. Mauro C. Pacifico F. Ulianich L. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Di Jeso B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This scenario is reminiscent of TNF signaling, in which TRAF2 mediates simultaneous activation of the NF-κB survival pathway and pro-apoptotic JNK pathway, and the fate of the cell would be determined by interplay between these opposing signals. NF-κB exerts its anti-apoptotic activity by inhibiting caspase function (28Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The latter function is mediated by at least two different mechanisms: by blocking activation of MKK7 via GADD45β (16Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Bubici C. Jayawardena S. Alvarez K. Matsuda S. Nguyen D.U. Pham C.G. Nelsbach A.H. Melis T. De Smaele E. Tang W.J. D'Adamio L. Franzoso G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and decreasing ROS accumulation via the ferritin heavy chain (17Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K.

The importance of ROS in regulating sustained activation of JNK following TNF receptor triggering has been recently investigated in a NF-κB null cell model (26Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Based on this study, TRAF-mediated NF-κB activation suppresses the TNF-induced ROS accumulation that, in turn, induces prolonged JNK activation and cell death. Our result supports this model and suggests that a similar mechanism may also operate for the ER. In fact, induction of ER stress causes activation of both NF-κB and JNK. In the absence of TRAF2 or p65, the NF-κB pathway is not activated, and the late, ROS-dependent JNK activity is not counteracted, leading to cell death. How does ROS affect JNK activation? ROS may affect JNK activation by at least two different mechanisms: by oxidizing and inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (33Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) and activating the protein ASK1 (34Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minora O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rept. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). This kinase may be activated via ROS and TRAF2 and has been demonstrated to be essential for inducing cell death after ER stress, at least in neuronal cells (34Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minora O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rept. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 35Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). It may be possible that after ER stress and in the absence of a functional NF-κB activation, ASK1 is activated by the increased level of ROS and mediates sustained JNK activation and cell death. Whereas it is clear from our results that the presence of a functional NF-κB is necessary for survival, counteracting increased induction of ROS following ER stress, the mechanism by which NF-κB exerts this function is not fully understood. It has been recently demonstrated that NF-κB up-regulates expression of ferritin heavy chain, an enzyme involved in iron metabolism and suppression of ROS accumulation (17Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that in addition to up-regulation of genes involved in disposal of the ROS, NF-κB may also control transcription of genes that suppress production of ROS. Our results confirm the central role played by TRAF2 in regulating activation of NF-κB following ER stress, and also sheds light on the functional significance of this activation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that in addition to the TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation, another mechanism leading to activation of NF-κB following ER stress might exist. Based on this model, following ER stress, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 represses synthesis of the inhibitory subunit IκBα, leading to activation of NF-κB (36Deng J. Lu D.L. Zhang Y. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Harding H.P. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10161-10168Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The two models of activation of NF-κB following ER stress, the TRAF2-mediated and the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-mediated, are not mutually exclusive. It is possible that both mechanisms contribute to activate NF-κB upon ER stress. However, whereas the biological significance of the link between eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation is not fully understood, the functional significance of TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation seems to be clear, at least in our experimental system. In fact, cells lacking TRAF2 or functional NF-κB undergo massive cell death after ER stress. In conclusion, in the present study we provide evidence, for the first time, that the adaptor protein TRAF2 plays a central role in regulating signaling from the ER and that the activation of NF-κB, mediated by TRAF2, protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Therefore TRAF2 and NF-κB may be potential targets to control ER stress-induced apoptosis. We thank Dr. Kostas Pantopoulos (McGill University, Canada) for helpful advice on ROS detection."

As part of an effort aimed at determining the function of novel AAA+ chaperones in Escherichia coli, we report the characterization of a representative member of the MoxR family, YieN, which we have renamed RavA (regulatory ATPase variant A). We show that the ravA gene exists on an operon with another gene encoding a protein, YieM, of unknown function containing a Von Willebrand Factor Type A domain. RavA expression is under the control of the σS transcription factor, and its levels increase toward late log/early stationary phase, consistent with its possible role as a general stress-response protein. RavA functions as an ATPase and forms hexameric oligomers. Importantly, we demonstrate that RavA interacts strongly with inducible lysine decarboxylase (LdcI or CadA) forming a large cage-like structure consisting of two LdcI decamers linked by a maximum of five RavA oligomers. Surprisingly, the activity of LdcI does not appear to be affected by binding to RavA in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays, however, complex formation results in the stimulation of RavA ATPase activity. Data obtained suggest that the RavA-LdcI interaction may be important for the regulation of RavA activity against its targets. AAA+ ATPases are ubiquitous proteins that employ the energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to remodel proteins, DNA, or RNA.

The AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily of proteins comprises a large and functionally diverse class of P-loop NTPases. Members of this superfamily are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including protein refolding/degradation, transcriptional regulation, ribosome and organelle biogenesis, DNA repair and replication, and molecular transport events (1Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Proteins belonging to this superfamily contain one or more copies of the AAA+ module, which is a 200- to 250-amino acid region containing several distinct conserved motifs (1Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kunau W.H. Beyer A. Franken T. Gotte K. Marzioch M. Saidowsky J. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Wiebel F.F.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the Walker A and Walker B consensus sequences. AAA+ modules are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, the energy of which is then harnessed for use in molecular rearrangement events (5Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). AAA+ proteins oligomerize, typically forming ring-shaped hexamers (6Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Recent phylogenetic analyses using sequence and structural information have identified numerous families of AAA+ proteins (1Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 7Beyer A.

One major but poorly characterized family is the MoxR family, which is widespread throughout bacteria and archaea, with members being represented in all major lineages (1Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct.

The exact functional role of MoxR proteins is unclear, although limited work with members of this family suggests a chaperone-like role in the assembly/activation of specific protein complexes. The first characterized member of this family is MoxR in Paracoccus denitrificans, which was shown to be important in the biogenesis of methanol dehydrogenase. Cells in which the moxR gene was disrupted produced wild-type levels of methanol dehydrogenase, but, surprisingly, the enzyme was not functional (9Van Spanning R.J. Wansell C.W. De Boer T. Hazelaar M.J. Anazawa H. Harms N. Oltmann L.F. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6948-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another MoxR-related protein, NorQ/NirQ, was shown to be important in the biogenesis of nitric-oxide reductase. As with MoxR and methanol dehydrogenase, disruptions of the norQ/nirQ gene resulted in the production of non-functional nitric-oxide reductase enzyme in Pseudomonas stutzeri, P. denitrificans, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (10Jungst A. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11de Boer A.P. van der Oost J. Reijnders W.N. Westerhoff H.V. Stouthamer A.H. van Spanning R.J. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3534-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the CbbQ gene product, a MoxR-related protein, was shown to alter Rubisco 4The abbreviations used are: Rubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseVWAVon Willebrand Factor Type ALdcIinducible lysine decarboxylaseDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTAPS3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminWTwild-typePLPpyridoxal phosphateTNBS2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acidRTreverse transcriptionEMelectron microscopyATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)ORFopen reading frameFTCfraction three complex. 4The abbreviations used are: Rubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseVWAVon Willebrand Factor Type ALdcIinducible lysine decarboxylaseDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTAPS3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminWTwild-typePLPpyridoxal phosphateTNBS2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acidRTreverse transcriptionEMelectron microscopyATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)ORFopen reading frameFTCfraction three complex. conformation and stimulate its activity upon overexpression of recombinant forms of the proteins together in an Escherichia coli system (13Hayashi N.R.

Commun. 1999; 265: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Yet another MoxR family member, GvpN, has been shown to be important in gas vesicle biogenesis in certain organisms (15Englert C. Wanner G. Pfeifer F. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3543-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Offner S. Wanner G. Pfeifer F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mlouka A. Comte K.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7646-7652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact role and mechanism of function of MoxR proteins in all of these processes are not clear. ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase Von Willebrand Factor Type A inducible lysine decarboxylase dithiothreitol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin wild-type pyridoxal phosphate 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid reverse transcription electron microscopy adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) open reading frame fraction three complex. ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase Von Willebrand Factor Type A inducible lysine decarboxylase dithiothreitol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin wild-type pyridoxal phosphate 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid reverse transcription electron microscopy adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) open reading frame fraction three complex. Genes encoding MoxR proteins frequently co-occur in close proximity to genes encoding proteins containing Von Willebrand Factor Type A (VWA) domains, suggesting that these gene products may be functionally linked. For example, the MoxR family members, norQ and cbbQ genes, are encoded on the same operon as, and immediately upstream of, the norD and cbbO genes, respectively, which encode VWA proteins. Both NorD and CbbO were shown to be important in the activation of functional nitric-oxide reductase and Rubisco, respectively (11de Boer A.P. van der Oost J. Reijnders W.N. Westerhoff H.V. Stouthamer A.H. van Spanning R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Bartnikas T.B. Tosques I.E. Laratta W.P. Shi J. Shapleigh J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3534-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hayashi N.R. Arai H. Kodama T. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The VWA domain is a metal-binding domain often mediating protein-protein interactions (19Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The metal is typically magnesium. Metal-binding occurs through a non-contiguous metal ion-dependent adhesion site, which is important for binding protein ligands (20Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). VWA proteins have been well studied in eukaryotes, where they are involved in a range of processes, including cell adhesion, transport, the complement system, proteolysis, transcription, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis. Bacterial and archaeal VWA proteins are not as well characterized, although limited work has identified members involved in surface adhesion, serum opacity, fibrinogen binding, and metal insertion into protoporphyrin IX (21Kachlany S.C. Planet P.J. Bhattacharjee M.K. Kollia E. DeSalle R. Fine D.H. Figurski D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Katerov V. Lindgren P.E. Totolian A.A. Schalen C. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Willows R.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, to carry out their varied remodeling functions, many MoxR AAA+ proteins probably work in conjunction with VWA domain-containing proteins. As part of a research project aimed at identifying novel AAA+ chaperones in E. coli, we became interested in the uncharacterized protein YieN (SwissProt number P31473), which defines a MoxR subfamily (2Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). We have renamed this protein RavA (regulatory ATPase variant A). Here, we show that RavA is a cytoplasmic, hexameric AAA+ protein that functions with a VWA domain-containing protein, YieM (SwissProt number P03818), which we termed ViaA (VWA interacting with AAA+ ATPase). Detailed information is presented on RavA gene organization, expression patterns, protein subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and oligomerization properties. Furthermore, we show that RavA strongly interacts with the inducible lysine decarboxylase (LdcI or CadA, SwissProt number P0A9H3), an enzyme important in bacterial acid stress response, to form a distinctive 5-fold symmetric cage-like complex as determined by electron microscopy. Bioinformatics—A total of 156 proteins belonging to the MoxR AAA+ family, as defined by the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (MoxR COG0714), were selected for analysis (24Tatusov R.L. Fedorova N.D. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Kiryutin B. Koonin E.V. Krylov D.M. Mazumder R. Mekhedov S.L. Nikolskaya A.N. Rao B.S. Smirnov S. Sverdlov A.V. Vasudevan S. Wolf Y.I. Yin J.J. Natale D.A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). These sequences included those currently identified in the COG data base as belonging to COG0714, as well as additional sequences extracted using the BLASTP program from 427 microbial genomes in the NCBI sequence data base (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). All additional sequences were analyzed using the COGNITOR program to ensure that they belonged to COG0714 (26Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2821) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment was then constructed using the ClustalW program (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was generated using the PROTDIST and FITCH programs included in the PHYLIP package (28Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A PMB model of substitution (29Veerassamy S. Smith A. Tillier E.R. J. Comput. Biol. 2003; 10: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and global rearrangement were used. Default settings were used for all other parameters. 36 sequences identified as belonging to the RavA subfamily of MoxR AAA+ were selected and aligned using ClustalW. This alignment was then used to identify residues conserved in >90% of sequences. Conservation was based upon the following amino acid groupings: ILVM, KR, DE, ST, YFW, and NQ. Ungrouped amino acids included Ala, Cys, Pro, His, and Gly. Bacterial Strains—Wild-type MG1655 strain was purchased from ATCC (ATCC Number 47076). MG1655 ΔravA strain was constructed from WT MG1655 using the Lambda Red system as described (30Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Briefly, knock-out cassette containing the chloramphenicol resistance marker was amplified by PCR from pKD3 plasmid using primers RKO-_forward (5′-agaaacgtctatactcgcaatttacgcagaacttttgacgaaagggtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3′) and RKO_reverse (5′-aatctgtgcaccgacatcctgtaggctggcttcaatgcgacctaacatatgaatatcctccttag-3′) to construct the ravA deletion strain, or VKO_forward (5′-ctgaaggcggcaatcactgatgatgttccccgctggcgtgaaggtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3′) and VKO_reverse (5′-gcgagagcgtcccttctctgctgtaataatttatcgccgccagcgcatatgaatatcctccttag-3′) to construct the viaA (yieM_ECOLI) deletion strain. DY330 cells were inoculated from single colonies into 50 ml of LB media and grown at 30 °C with shaking to A600 = 0.6–0.8. 25 ml of culture was heated in a 42 °C water bath with shaking for 15 min to induce expression of the Lambda Red genes exo, bet, and gam. Cells were immediately cooled on ice for 10 min. Cells were made electrocompetent and then transformed with 1–2 μl of linear PCR product using a Bio-Rad GenePulser. Transformed cells were diluted into 1 ml of LB and grown at 30 °C for 1 h. Cells were then plated onto LB agar containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 30 °C. Resistant colonies were selected and screened for successful deletion of the gene(s) using PCR. The deletion cassette was then transferred from DY330 to MG1655 using P1Δdam rev6 transduction as described previously (32Sternberg N.L. Maurer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 18-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Verification of the deletion strains was performed using PCR, DNA sequencing, and Northern and Western blot analyses. It should be noted that deletion of ravA resulted in a strain that also cannot transcribe viaA (see Fig. 4, A and B). The RavA-TAP-encoding strain was constructed using the Lambda Red system in a manner similar to that described for the construction of the knock-out strains. Specific details on strain construction, as well as on the pull-down and identification of bands by mass spectrometry, are provided elsewhere (33Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J. Emili A. Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). MG1655 ΔrpoS and ΔcadB strains were obtained from the E. coli genome project at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. Gene Cloning—ravA (yieN_ECOLI), ldcI (cadA/dcly_ECOLI), and ldcC (dclz_ECOLI) genes were cloned from E. coli K12 MG1655, whereas viaA was cloned from E. coli O157:H7. It should be noted that the amino acid sequences of ViaA from E. coli K12 MG1655 and O157:H7 strains are identical. Primers used were as follows: RAVA_forward (5′-atcacgatcatatggctcaccctcatttattag-3′), RAVA_reverse (5′-tacgtaggatccttagcattgttgtgcctggcg-3′), VIAA_forward (5′-aactcgatcatatgctaacgctggatacg-3′), VIAA_reverse (5′-ctatggatccttatcgccgccagcgtctgagc-3′), LDCI_forward (5′-atgctaccatatgaacgttattgcaatattg-3′), LDCI_ reverse (5′-ctggatccttatttcttgctttcttctttcaatacc-3′), LDCC_forward (5′-tctaccatgggcatgaacatcattgccattatg-3′), and LDCC_reverse (5′-cacctcgagttatcccgccatttttaggac-3′). ravA was cloned into p11 plasmid (34Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a modified pET15b, which adds His6 followed by a tobacco etch virus-cut site to the N terminus of the expressed protein (HV tag). viaA and ldcI were cloned into pET3a (Novagen), which expresses untagged proteins. ldcC was cloned into pET16b such that it was expressed untagged, with the exception of additional N-terminal Gly and Met residues. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). RavA, ViaA, and LdcI protein expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to cultures grown to midlog phase. Cultures expressing RavA were grown overnight at 30 °C in the presence of inducer, and those expressing ViaA were induced at 18 °C overnight. Cultures expressing LdcI were induced for 3 h at 37 °C. LdcC cultures were grown at 37 °C for 24 h without the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min and stored at –80 °C pending purification. RavA was purified using Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocols. The HV tag was removed by digestion with tobacco etch virus protease at 1:10 molar ratio of tobacco etch virus to protein for 5 h at 4°C. The protein was further purified using a Mono S HR 5/5 column. ViaA was precipitated from cell lysate using 30% ammonium sulfate. Pellets were resuspended and exchanged into a no-salt buffer using PD10 desalting columns. The protein was further purified on a Heparin HP5 column. Cells overexpressing LdcI were lysed in buffer LI1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was heated at 70 °C for 5 min resulting in the precipitation of the bulk of E. coli proteins, however, most of LdcI remained soluble. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min. LdcI in the supernatant was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and then by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. LdcC was precipitated from cell lysate using 30% ammonium sulfate, and the pellets were resuspended and exchanged into low salt buffer by dialysis. The protein was further purified using a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. The final yields of purified proteins per 1 liter of culture were as follows: 6 mg for RavA, 2 mg for ViaA, 10 mg for LdcI, and 5 mg for LdcC. Proteins were judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. All chromatography columns used were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Measurement of RavA ATPase Activity—RavA ATPase activity was measured by determining the free phosphate released after ATP hydrolysis using a colorimetric assay similar to that reported previously (35Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Briefly, RavA was placed in buffer RA1 (5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT) containing various concentrations of ATP substrate. RA1 solutions of different pH were generated using 10 mm concentrations of citrate, acetate, MES, HEPES, or TAPS buffers. Where applicable, BSA, ViaA, LdcI, and LdcC were included in the buffer. Assays were performed in 100-μl volumes at 37 °C in Eppendorf tubes or in a quartz plate. At different time points, 10-μl aliquots of the assay mixture were removed and added to 200 μl of RA2 (1 mm malachite green, 8.5 mm ammonium molybdate, and 1 m HCl). Color development was allowed to proceed for 1 min and then was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 37% citric acid. Absorbance was measured at 660 nm and converted to moles of phosphate produced using a KH2PO4 standard curve. Preparation of Cell Extracts for LdcI Activity Assays—WT and ΔravA cells were grown in LB media containing 0.4% glucose to an A600 of 3.0–4.0 at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer LT1 (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation, flash frozen on liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C until use in assays. Measurement of LdcI Lysine Decarboxylase Activity—The ability of LdcI to generate cadaverine from lysine was measured as previously described with slight modification (36Phan A.P. Ngo T.T. Lenhoff H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purified LdcI was dissolved in buffer LA1 (2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm PLP, and 4 mm lysine). LA1 solutions of different pH levels were generated using acetate, HEPES, or TAPS buffers at a concentration of 50–100 mm. Total cell protein (25 μg/assay) was dissolved in buffer LA2 (25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm PLP, and 4 mm lysine). Assays were conducted in 100-μl volumes at 37 °C using either a quartz plate or Eppendorf tubes. At specific time points, 15-μl aliquots were removed and added to an equal volume of 1 m Na2CO3 stop solution. Subsequently, 15 μl of 10 mm 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) was added, and samples were heated at 40 °C for 5 min to allow the formation of cadaverine-TNBS and lysine-TNBS adducts. Cadaverine-TNBS (N,N′-bistrinitrophenylcadaverine) was extracted using 500 μl of toluene, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured. An extinction coefficient of 2.5 × 104 m–1 cm–1 was used (36Phan A.P. Ngo T.T. Lenhoff H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to convert absorbance into moles of cadaverine produced. Growth in LdcI Indicator Media—E. coli K12 MG1655 WT, ΔravA, and ΔcadB cells were grown in lysine decarboxylase indicator media DI1 (0.3% yeast extract, 0.1% glucose, 0.5% lysine, and 0.0016% bromocresol purple pH indicator) at 37 °C. Samples were taken at selected time points, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the absorbance at 590 nm of the bromocresol purple indicator in the cleared lysates was measured. Extreme Acid Shock Assays—Extreme acid shock assays were adapted from previously described protocols (37Iyer R. Williams C. Miller C. J.

Cells were diluted 1/100 into pH 2.5 acid shock media AS1 (40 mm KCl, 80 mm KH2PO4, 33 mm H3PO4, 1.7 mm sodium citrate, and 20 mm glucose) with and without 1 mm lysine. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then serially diluted in LB media in a 96-well plate. Diluted cells were then spotted onto an LB agar plate and grown up at 37 °C overnight. Growth on plates was examined to determine cell viability. Northern Blot Analysis—E. coli MG1655 cultures were grown in LB media at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Total RNA was isolated using the single step acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method as described (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5-ml samples of culture were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer NB1 (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were then passed four times through a 25-gauge needle to facilitate lysis. 0.05 ml of 2 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 0.5 ml phenol, and 0.1 ml chloroform-isoamyl alcohol were then added sequentially to the sample. After each addition, the tube was capped and mixed thoroughly by inversion. Samples were then vortexed briefly, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and an equal volume of isopropanol was added. The solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated at –20 °C for 1 h. RNA precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The isopropanol was carefully decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.15 ml of buffer NB1. After thorough mixing, the sample was precipitated again using isopropanol. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Samples were stored at –80 °C. 20 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 6.7% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and was covalently cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene). Probe generation and Northern blotting were carried out using the AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). For RavA, the DNA probe used was complementary to bp 623–1497 of the ravA gene, whereas for ViaA, the DNA probe used was complementary to bp 719–1452 of the viaA gene. RT-PCR—RT-PCR analysis was performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit as described in the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μgof E. coli K12 MG1655 total RNA was used as a template. Amplification was carried out using primers RAVA_forward2 (5′-tatcacggcgccatggctcaccctcatttattag-3′) and VIAA_reverse and primers RAVA_internal_forward (5′-gcgaattccatatgcaacaaattgatgtattgatgaccg-3′) and VIAA_internal_reverse (5′-cgttcgatcactttttcacg-3′). Western Blot Analysis—Typically, cell pellets were lysed by sonication, and lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. 5–40 μg of proteins was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Biotrace polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus as per the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RavA or anti-LdcI antibodies generated at the Division of Comparative Medicine, University of Toronto.

https://openalex.org/W1990589737,"The putative role of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in mediating lesion-induced plasticity in topographic cortical representations was investigated. Cholinergic immunolesions were combined with unilateral restricted cochlear lesions in adult cats, demonstrating the consequence of cholinergic depletion on lesion-induced plasticity in primary auditory cortex (AI). Immunolesions almost eliminated the cholinergic input to AI, while cochlear lesions produced broad high-frequency hearing losses. The results demonstrate that the near elimination of cholinergic input does not disrupt reorganization of the tonotopic representation of the lesioned (contralateral) cochlea in AI and does not affect the normal representation of the unlesioned (ipsilateral) cochlea. It is concluded that cholinergic basal forebrain input to AI is not essential for the occurrence of lesion-induced plasticity in AI."

Despite a significant sequence conservation including the two mechanistically important acidic residues (Fig. 1A), this Gre-like factor does not stimulate but instead inhibits the intrinsic and GreA-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage (14Hogan B.P.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Gfh1 and the structural features that determine functionality of the CC transcription factors, we have determined the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus Gfh1 at 2.4 Å resolution. The structural and functional analysis suggests that while CC protein regulators appear to utilize similar structural motifs to gain access to the RNAP AS, their dramatically different effects may result from relatively subtle changes in the amino acid composition and conformation of the tip of the CC-domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSCrystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The Gfh1 protein was expressed and purified as described (16Perederina A. Vassylyeva N.M. Berezin I.A. Svetlov V. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The crystals were obtained by a sitting drop vapor diffusion technique followed by macro-seeding (16Perederina A. Vassylyeva N.M. Berezin I.A. Svetlov V. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The final well crystallization solution contained 3% polyethylene glycol 8000, 33 mm zinc acetate, and 17 mm sodium cacodilate, pH 6.5. The crystals belong to the P43 space group with unit cell dimensions a = b = 59.3, c = 218.9 Å and possess perfect merohedral twinning with the twinning operator {h, -k, -l}. The data for the native protein and three heavy atom derivatives were collected at 100 K on the in house x-ray generator (Rigaku) using a RAXIS-IV++ imaging plate detector and were processed with the HKL2000 program package (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). The initial phases were obtained by the MLPHARE program and were improved by solvent flattening using the DM program (18Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The model was built manually using the O program (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

ATP, GTP, and UTP (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2.5 μm, followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C and purification through G50 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TGA. The obtained A26 transcription elongation complexes (TECs) were incubated with 300 nm [α-32P]CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 min at 37 °C to form C27 TECs. C27 TECs were incubated at conditions indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Samples were analyzed as described previously (21Artsimovitch I. Patlan V. Sekine S. Vassylyeva M.N. Hosaka T. Ochi K.

Top, transcript generated from the λPR promoter on pIA253; transcriptional start site is indicated by an arrow and is followed by a 26-nucleotide C-less cassette. Bottom, halted unlabeled A26 TECs were purified through G50 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with [α-32P]CTP to form 3′-end-labeled C27 TECs. C27 complexes were incubated at 37 °C with 200 nm UTP and GTP (nucleotide addition), 10 μm PPi (pyrophosphorolysis), 500 μm ATP, and 8 mm MnCl2 (exo-cleavage) or at 55 °C (endo-cleavage). Gfh1 was added to 500 nm where indicated. Aliquots were withdrawn at times indicated above each panel, quenched with 5 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, and separated on a 13% denaturing urea-acrylamide (19:1) gel. The portion of the gel lacking radioactive signals (between the C27 and the cleavage products) was deleted to conserve space (gray bar). Gfh1 inhibitory effect (-fold, shown below each panel) on each catalytic reaction was determined by comparing the rate of reaction in the absence to that in the presence of Gfh1. For nucleotide addition, accumulation of C34 RNA species was quantified. PPi cleavage was measured by the disappearance of the labeled C27 RNA (shorter RNA fragments are not labeled). Endo- and exo-digestion was monitored by the accumulation of the corresponding cleavage products (CMP in case of the exo-nucleolytic cleavage). A representative gel is shown; the experiment was repeated at least three times for each reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSThe Gfh1 Structure—The Gfh1 structure (Fig. 1B) comprises two domains, globular (G-) and CC, which closely resemble the corresponding domains of GreA (22Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (root mean square deviation are 1.1 and 0.85 Å for the G- and CC-domains, respectively). A high quality of the experimental electron density allowed unambiguous modeling of all 156 Gfh1 residues in each of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The only exception is a linker loop (residues 41–45) intervening the α-helices at the CC tip (Fig. 1, A and B), which was represented by the relatively weak experimental electron density and exhibited high B-factors in a final model, suggesting that this segment is flexible and therefore might adopt alternative conformations. The four independent Gfh1 monomers are arranged as a pair of nearly identical dimers (supplemental Fig. S1), in which the individual molecules are related by a perfect rotational symmetry, suggesting that the dimers might have some physiological relevance. However, the dimers are stabilized almost exclusively through Zn2+-mediated interactions and can represent a crystallization artifact given the high concentration of zinc acetate (33 mm) used for crystallization. On the other hand, judging by 25 well fixed Zn2+ions predominantly bound to the acidic side chains, Gfh1 apparently has affinity for the divalent cations, implying that at certain conditions its activity might be modulated by metal ions.Comparison with GreA and DksA—Despite their high structural similarity, there are two essential differences between the Gfh1 and GreA structures. First, the interdomain orientations are strikingly distinct (∼162° rotation), resulting in completely different orientations of the CC-domains and the interdomain interfaces (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the Gfh1 interacting surface is more extensive (1238 Å2 via 1030 Å2 in GreA) and involves mostly hydrophobic interactions, whereas the GreA interface is determined exclusively by hydrogen bonding (supplemental Fig. 2). The Gfh1 structural organization is reminiscent of that of DksA, whose G- and CC-domains also form a common hydrophobic core that, similarly to Gfh1, masks a big portion of the CC-domain, thereby likely restricting its conformational flexibility (9Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The Gfh1 and GreA conformations are compact and are stabilized by specific interdomain interactions, suggesting that they represent physiologically relevant states of the proteins rather than being artificially induced by crystal packing.Another notable structural difference that distinguishes Gfh1 from both GreA and DksA is the local conformation of the linker at the CC tip. In GreA/DksA this region contains a DXX(E/D) motif with the two invariant acidic residues crucial for function (8Laptenko O. Lee J. Lomakin I. Borukhov S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6322-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G.

Cell. 2003; 114: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In both GreA and DksA this segment adopts a well fixed α-turn conformation, which is self-stabilized through the internal main chain interactions and brings the acidic side chains proximal to each other (Fig. 1D). Given the potential functional importance of the acidic residues in other proteins, this motif can be considered”extended“in Gfh1 (DDYDD) (Fig. 1A). While similar to GreA in orientation, the Gfh1 linker is apparently missing the self-stabilized α-turn, making it more flexible and allowing three out of four Asp side chains to approach each other in an acidic cluster whose formation would be effectively prohibited in the presence of the α-turn (Fig. 1D).Gfh1 Inhibits All Catalytic Activities of RNAP—The reactions catalyzed by RNAP utilize different substrates and thus likely have different requirements for the”optimal“configuration of the AS. Indeed, alterations in the AS geometry brought by the substitutions of individual Asp residues inhibit different polymerization and cleavage reactions to different extent (23Sosunov V. Zorov S. Sosunova E. Nikolaev A. Zakeyeva I. Bass I. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. Mustaev A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4202-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, protein factors, like GreA and DksA, may remodel the AS to preferentially impact one but not other activities, thus exerting a specific regulatory effect. In contrast, Gfh1 was shown to inhibit two distinct catalytic reactions (14Hogan B.P. Hartsch T. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether Gfh1 would have a similar effect on all types of catalytic reactions in a single TEC, we prepared C27 TECs that were uniquely labeled at their 3′-terminal C residue (Fig. 2).C27 RNA was extended upon addition of GTP and UTP; at the low NTP concentrations used here, transcription arrests at U38. C27 RNA was also degraded in the presence of PPi releasing CTP (which co-migrated with the excess [α-32P]CTP; data not shown). At 55 °C, both the endonucleolytic activity that leads to the release of short 3′-labeled RNA fragments (cleavage products) and the ability to scavenge trace nucleotides to extend C27 RNA (extension products) became pronounced. Similarly to published studies (14Hogan B.P. Hartsch T. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Laptenko O. Borukhov S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we found that Gfh1 moderately (from 2- to 4.5-fold effects) inhibited all these three reactions (Fig. 2).Upon addition of Mn2+ and non-cognate ATP (3Sosunov V. Sosunova E. Mustaev A. Bass I. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2234-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a fraction of C27 RNA was extended to A28 as a result of misincorporation (ATP preparation used is not contaminated with GTP; data not shown) and the remaining RNA was cleaved, releasing 3′-terminal CMP. The exonucleolytic cleavage was essentially blocked by Gfh1 (CMP synthesis was inhibited 30-fold; Fig. 2). Thus, although Gfh1 inhibits all RNAP reactions, the exonucleolytic cleavage is particularly sensitive to inhibition. This selectivity may be relevant to the physiological role of Gfh1, which remains obscure.DISCUSSIONThe sequence and structural homology between Gfh1 and GreA and the observation that Gfh1 affects all intrinsic (factor-independent) catalytic activities of RNAP (Fig. 2) suggests that Gfh1 utilizes the Gre/DksA-like structural mechanism of action: protruding the CC-domain through the secondary channel toward the RNAP catalytic center, where the CC-tip acidic residues remodel the AS (perhaps through Mg2+-mediated interactions with the catalytic residues), thereby modulating the RNAP activities.A low resolution (15 Å) electron density (12Opalka N. Chlenov M. Chacon P. Rice W.J. Wriggers W. Darst S.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the RNAP secondary channel accommodates the GreB CC-domain but does not allow one to distinguish between the alternative G-domain orientations: the GreA and Gfh1 G-domains would likely fit equally well to the same electron density if the proteins are superimposed by their CC-domains (supplemental Fig. S3). The published models for RNAP-Gre factor interactions agree on the overall topology of the complex but differ in their details (8Laptenko O. Lee J. Lomakin I. Borukhov S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6322-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Sosunova E. Sosunov V. Kozlov M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2003; 114: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and substitutions in RNAP that directly affect the Gre factors binding have not been reported. The sequence analysis and structural modeling show that with the exception of a few unfavorable amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1A), which likely make the observed conformations preferential for the particular protein in its free form, the residues forming the interdomain interfaces in Gfh1 and GreA are conserved among both protein families. At the same time the interdomain contacts in both proteins are not very extensive and could be disrupted under certain conditions to allow a”flip“between the two observed orientations. In principle, either of the two conformations might be induced for each protein in the course of its recruitment to RNAP. These considerations suggest two alternative modes of Gfh1/GreA binding to RNAP. First, the proteins may maintain their free form conformations. Assuming that in both cases the G-domains contain the major binding determinants (8Laptenko O. Lee J. Lomakin I. Borukhov S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6322-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Loizos N. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23378-23386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), while the CC-domains would be positioned essentially similar given the restrictions imposed by the size and shape of the secondary channel on their orientations, this scenario implies distinct RNAP binding modes for Gfh1 and GreA (they may utilize different structural elements to bind to the same site on RNAP or bind to different sites on RNAP); consistently, the G-domains surfaces exposed for the potential interactions with RNAP differ both in shape and sequence. Alternatively, both proteins may adopt one of the observed conformations induced upon binding to RNAP and in this case would likely bind to the same site on RNAP in a similar fashion; this also seems possible in light of their sequence and apparent structural similarity. Interestingly, changes in the relative positions of the two GreB domains upon binding to RNAP and TECs were detected by hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis (24Loizos N. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23378-23386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Structural comparison of the Gfh1, GreA, and DksA proteins allows us to propose that their dramatically different effects on transcription in vitro (Fig. 2 and Refs. 8Laptenko O.

In GreA and DksA, the well fixed nearly identical α-turns strictly fix the orientations of the two functional acidic side chains, allowing them to coordinate a single Mg2+ ion but at the same time restricting their mobility to focus their activity on a single particular target. The distinct orientations of the α-turns in GreA and DksA (Fig. 1D) likely reflect the differences in the positions of their substrates thus avoiding functional overlap. We propose that, although the Gre/DksA-like stabilization of the Mg2+ ions in the vicinity of the RNAP AS is also a key element of the Gfh1 function, the flexibility of the Gfh1 CC linker missing the stable α-turn and the excess of the acidic residues in this region might allow Gfh1 to coordinate the Mg2+ ions occupying somewhat distinct positions (likely a characteristic of different reactions catalyzed by RNAP) without significant alterations of the CC orientation. This hypothesis is consistent with the broad functional specificity of Gfh1, which inhibits all RNAP catalytic reactions (Fig. 2). Indeed, the three-residue acidic cluster observed in the Gfh1 structure may readily stabilize one Mg2+ ion providing three coordination bonds (in contrast to only two in GreA/DksA) (Fig. 3A). Under certain conditions, however, one of these three Asp residues may flip its side chain to approach the adjacent fourth Asp, this would allow for coordination of the Mg2+ ion located in a substantially distinct position (Fig. 3B). In fact, the apparent flexibility of the Gfh1 CC linker might allow for additional conformations and subsequent spatial regrouping of the four Asp side chains, resulting in a number of the alternative binding modes of the Mg2+ ions.FIGURE 3Proposed mechanisms of the Gfh1 action. A and B, the flexibility and the number of the acidic residues at the CC tip of Gfh1 allow for the alternative binding (MG1 or MG2) of the Mg2+ ions. C, two hypothetical pathways (competitive and noncompetitive) by which the Gfh1 protein may inhibit nucleotide addition. cMg1 and cMg2 are the two catalytic metals, whereas iMg is a putative inhibitory Mg2+ ion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the nucleotide addition reaction as an example, we suggest two hypothetical pathways, namely competitive and noncompetitive, by which Gfh1 may inhibit RNAP catalysis (Fig. 3C). In the competitive mode, Gfh1 may directly stabilize both catalytic Mg2+ ions that are required for substrate binding and catalysis with its four Asp residues. This would enhance the Gfh1 affinity to RNAP on one hand and sterically exclude substrate binding in the AS on the other. In the noncompetitive pathway, Gfh1 may fix an additional, non-catalytic Mg2+ ion in the site adjacent to, but not overlapping with, the AS. While this would not block substrate binding, competition of this inhibitory Mg2+ ion with the catalytic metal for binding of the substrate phosphates might result in a formation of a stable substrate-bound, but catalytically inactive, transcription complex. A similar mechanism of inhibition was recently proposed for the RNAP inhibitor tagetitoxin, which”donates“an additional Mg2+ ion bound in the vicinity of the AS (11Vassylyev D.G. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Igarashi N. Matsugaki N. Wakatsuki S. Artsimovitch I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given a broad Gfh1 specificity, it may utilize either or both of these pathways to modulate distinct RNAP catalytic reactions. Undoubtedly, the proposed mechanisms remain hypothetical and would require further biochemical and structural verification.Gfh1 represents a third example of the rapidly growing family of the CC transcription factors operating through the RNAP secondary channel. All of them share a long CC-domain to deliver their active structural elements to the common target, the RNAP AS, but confer strikingly distinct effects on transcription. Remarkably, this functional diversity is achieved through relatively subtle variations in the conformation and sequence of a short linker segment located at the tip of the CC-domain that presumably targets only a few metal ions in the RNAP AS. The CC factors are thus reminiscent of a set of surgical tools, many of which are nearly identical in size and shape and differ only by their tips designed for highly specialized, non-overlapping applications. As transcription is a highly regulated process, we may await discovery of o"

https://openalex.org/W2153338937,"The protein Mon2 is distantly related to the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Arf1 on Golgi membranes. However, unlike these ""large"" Arf GEFs, Mon2 lacks the Sec7 domain that catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Arf1. Here we report that yeast Mon2 shares extensive homology with the noncatalytic parts of both the BIG and Golgi brefeldin A resistance factor subfamilies of Arf GEFs and is located to the trans-Golgi. Moreover, we find that Mon2 forms a complex with Dop1, a large cytoplasmic protein conserved in evolution from humans to protozoa. Deletion of Mon2 results in mislocalization of Dop1 from the Golgi and defects in cycling between endosomes and the Golgi. However, unlike Mon2, Dop1 is essential for yeast viability. A conditional allele of Dop1 shows that loss of Dop1 activity not only affects endosome to Golgi transport but also causes a severe perturbation of the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, it appears that Dop1 plays a widespread role in membrane organization, and Mon2 acts as a scaffold to recruit the Golgi-localized pool of Dop1."

In contrast to cytochrome bo, an alternative oxidase under highly aerated growth conditions, cytochrome bd has no proton pumping activity and does not belong to the heme-copper terminal oxidase superfamily.

A low affinity for substrates and the difficulty in anaerobically keeping substrates as reduced forms make it difficult to crystallize a quinol-bound form. Currently, no atomic structure for cytochrome bd is available; thus photoaffinity cross-linking with photolabile substrate analogs is an alternative approach to identify the substrate-binding site.

Reduced forms of 2-azido- and 3-azido-Q2 serve as efficient electron donors to cytochrome bd, and UV illumination in the presence of azido-Q2H2 inactivated the quinol oxidase activity. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS identified subunit I as the azido-Q2-labeled site. In-gel digestion followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) revealed the cross-linked amino acid residue for the first time. The oxidized form of a photoproduct of azido-Q2 (azido-Q *2) was covalently linked to the carboxylic side chain of I-Glu280 in the hexapeptide 278EEETNK283, that is present in the Q-loop. This study demonstrated directly that the N-terminal region of periplasmic loop VI/VII (Q-loop) is a part of the quinol oxidation site and indicates that the 2- and 3-methoxy groups of the quinone ring are in the close vicinity of I-Glu280 in loop VI/VII.

Biospectroscopy. 1995; 1: 305-311Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The concentration of the enzyme was calculated from the Soret absorption of the air-oxidized form by using an extinction coefficient of 223,000 m–1 cm–1 (35Tsubaki M. Hori H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J.

The purified enzyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate (Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Co., Tokyo) was stored at –80 °C until use. The enzyme activity was determined at 25 °C with a JASCO V-550 UV-visible spectrophotometer, as described previously (36Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Takegami K. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Iwamura H. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.1% sucrose monolaurate, and 40 nm cytochrome bd. The reaction was started by the addition of a reduced form of Q1, a kind gift from Eisai Co. (Tokyo, Japan), at a final concentration of 0.14 mm. Photoaffinity Labeling of Cytochrome bd—2-Azido-Q2 and 3-azido-Q2 were synthesized as previously described (26Sakamoto K. Nomura K. Miyoshi H. J. Pesticide Sci. 2002; 27: 147-149Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cytochrome bd (10 μm in 0.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate) was placed in a quartz cuvette and incubated on ice for 10 min. A 4-fold molar excess of reduced azido-Q2 was added to the enzyme solution and subjected to illumination on ice with long wavelength UV light (Black-Ray model B-100 A; UVP, Upland, CA; 365 nm) at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. For the competition with azido-Q2H2, 2-n-heptyl-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO; Sigma-Aldrich) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. Q1H2 oxidase activity was measured before and after the illumination. In-gel Digestion of Subunit I—Samples containing 20 μg of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In-gel digestion was performed by the method of Hellman et al. (38Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Gel pieces containing subunit I band were washed three times with 1 ml of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and rehydrated with 0.l ml of the digestion buffer. The enzymatic cleavage was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 18 h at a protease-to-protein ratio of 1:200. The digestion buffers used for lysyl endopeptidase (Lep; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka) and endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 20 mm sodium borate (pH 7.0), respectively. Digestion was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of acetic acid. In-gel CNBr cleavage was performed in 0.1 ml of 70% trifluoroacetic acid at a CNBr-to-protein ratio of 1: 10. The gel pieces were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 18 h. For the double digestion, the gel pieces were first incubated with Lep, washed three times with 1 ml of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, and then treated with Asp-N or CNBr as described above. The peptides were extracted twice from the gel pieces with 100 μl of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile and concentrated with ZipTip μ-C18 (Millipore) to 20 μl in 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF MS—The samples were analyzed on an AXIMA-CFR plus (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto) TOF mass spectrometer in a linear (for proteins) or reflection (for peptides) mode with positive ion detection. The matrix solution was 50% acetonitrile saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). One-μl of desalted proteins or peptides were mixed with an equal amount of the matrix solution on the target plate and dried. A nitrogen laser at 337 nm was used to desorb solute molecules from the sample plate. The coarse laser energy was set to 50% with fine adjustment for each sample, and 1–100 laser shots were accumulated for each spectrum. A voltage of 20 kV was established in the source region, and the microchannel detector was set at 2.8 kV. MS spectra were calibrated externally with rabbit muscle aldolase and bovine serum albumin (molecular masses were 39,212 and 66,430 Da, respectively) for proteins and human bradykinin fragment, human angiotensin II, P14R, human ACTH fragment 18–39, and bovine insulin oxidized B chain (molecular masses were 757.40, 1,046.54, 1,533.86, 2,465.20, and 3,494.65 Da, respectively) for peptides. Data analysis was carried out with Kompact (Shimadzu Co.). Reverse-phase HPLC—Subunit I peptides (100 μg) produced by double digestion with Lep and Asp-N were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Develosil 300C8-HG-5 column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 15 cm; Nomura-Kagaku Co.) using a gradient formed from 0.1% acetic acid and 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution profiles of peptides were monitored at 212 nm with a SPD-M10AVP Shimadzu photodiode array detector, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were dried up with a vacuum centrifuge, and the peptides were dissolved in 30 μl of 0.1% formic acid. ESI MS—The samples were applied to a C18 column (0.1-mm inner diameter × 25 cm; GL Science) coupled to ESI source and analyzed on a Q-TOF2 (Micromass) quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer. The analysis was carried out in the positive ion detection mode with a capillary voltage of 2.8 kV and a sampling cone voltage of 40 V. For MS experiments, the quadrupole analyzer was used in wide band pass mode, and the microchannel plate detector was set at 2.7 kV. For MS/MS experiments the quadrupole (first) analyzer was used to select sequentially the peaks of interest in the m/z spectrum, allowing one particular precursor or parent mass to proceed through the collision cell into the TOF (second) analyzer. Argon gas was admitted into the collision cell so that the pressure in that region increased by a factor of 10, and the collision energy was 10 eV. The resulting fragment ions were analyzed, and MS/MS spectra acquired over the appropriate m/z range and were deconvoluted with MaxEnt3 (Micromass). Data processing was achieved manually with the aid of the PepSeq program of MassLynx package (Micromass). The nomenclature used for fragment ions was N-terminal C=O-containing fragments (b type) and C-terminal N-H-containing fragments (y type), which were derived by the cleavage at the middle of peptide bonds (39Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Photo Inactivation of Cytochrome bd with Azido-Q2H2—Electron-donating activities of 2-azido- and 3-azido-Q2H2 to cytochrome bd are 97 and 94%, respectively, of that of Q2H2 at 0.04 mm, and thus they are suitable for probing the structure of the quinol oxidation site. After 15 min of illumination with UV light in the presence and absence of 0.04 mm 3-azido-Q2H2, Q1H2 oxidase activity was decreased to 28 and 68%, respectively, of the original activity without illumination (Fig. 1). Monophasic decay of the oxidase activity indicates the labeling of the quinol oxidation site with a single azido-Q2H2 molecule (data not shown). UV illumination in the presence of 0.04 mm 2-azido-Q2H2 resulted in a 40% loss of the quinol oxidase activity. Inhibition levels are comparable with 35–50% reported for reactions of azidoquinones with cytochrome bd (22Yang F.D. Yu L. Yu C.A. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

A difference in the inactivation levels between 2-azido- and 3-azido-Q2H2 may be related to interactions of their photoproducts with the protein. The incomplete inactivation with azido-Q2H2 may be partly due to the intramolecular reaction with the nearby methoxy group on the quinone ring. These results indicate that the photoaffinity labeling of azido-Q2H2 to the quinol-binding site inactivates the quinol oxidase activity of cytochrome bd. Our azido-Q2 derivatives are not radioactive; thus labeling profiles were examined by mass spectrometry. In MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the purified cytochrome bd, subunits I and II were identified as singly protonated ions at m/z 58,160 ± 60 and 42,410 ± 70 (n = 5) (Fig. 2), respectively, which are comparable with the calculated molecular masses of 58,205 3Because of a sequencing error (I-Phe213 to Leu) found in pNG2, the mass of subunit I was corrected to 58,205 from 58,171 (40Miller M.J. Hermodson J.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 263: 5235-5240Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). and 42,460 Da, respectively, from the deduced amino acid sequence (40Miller M.J. Hermodson J.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 263: 5235-5240Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Upon UV illumination in the presence of 2-azido- or 3-azido-Q2H2, a part of subunit I molecules increased molecular mass, indicated by the presence of a shoulder peak at a higher m/z region (Fig. 2). In contrast, subunit II remained as a sharp peak, and nonspecific binding to subunit II (22Yang F.D. Yu L. Yu C.A. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14987-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not occur for our azido-Q2H2 derivatives. These observations indicate that the quinol-binding site of cytochrome bd is located within subunit I and that the labeling of subunit I with azido-Q2H2 resulted in the inactivation of the quinol oxidase activity. Identification of the Azido-Q2-cross-linked Peptide—For the identification of the azido-Q2H2-cross-linked site by MS, subunit I was separated from subunit II and free substrates and its photoproducts by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel digestion with endoproteinase Lep and/or Asp-N or in-gel cleavage with CNBr. In combination with proteolytic and chemical cleavage, peptides corresponding to 89.1% of the total sequence and 99.4% of the Q-loop were recovered and identified (supplemental Table S1). The coverage was comparable with 79% for subunit II of the E. coli cytochrome bo by MALDI MS (29Tsatsos P.H. Reynolds K. Nickels E.F. He D.-Y. Yu C.-A. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9884-9888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 83% for the E. coli H+/galactose symporter GalP by ESI MS (41Venter H. Ashcroft A.E. Keen J.F. Henderson P.J.F.

In the Lep/Asp-N double digest of subunit I labeled with 2-azido- or 3-azido-Q2H2, we reproducibly identified a new peak at 29.5 min in reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 3, B and C) and at m/z 1047.5 in MALDI-TOF mass spectra (Fig. 4B). Photoaffinity labeling with 3-azido-Q2H2 in the presence of 1 mm HQNO, a competitive inhibitor (I50,7 μm), eliminated the m/z 1047.5 peak (Fig. 4C), confirming the attachment of the photoproduct to this peptide.FIGURE 4MALDI-TOF mass spectra of in-gel double-digested subunit I with Lep and Asp-N.

Doubly charged N-terminal fragment ions (b-series) and C-terminal fragment ions (y-series) thus yielded identified the amino acid sequence of this peptide to be the hexapeptide 278EEETNK283 (monoisotopic mass of 748.32) and demonstrated that a photoproduct (300.36 Da) of 2-azido-(data not shown) and 3-azido-Q2H2 (Fig. 5) is covalently linked to the carboxylic side chain of I-Glu280 (m/z 128.03) via the COO-NH linkage (Fig. 6D). The b′ series (b3′,b4′, and b5′), which lost the cross-linked Azido-Q2*, confirmed this assignment. Our result demonstrated that the 2- and 3-substituents of the quinone ring are in the vicinity of I-Glu280 in the periplasmic loop VI/VII of subunit I. The observed mass for the photoproduct indicates a loss of four hydrogen from the expected structure (304.39 Da) (Fig. 6C), because of the auto-oxidation of the reduced photoproduct during the preparation and isolation of the peptide.FIGURE 6Possible mechanism for the photoaffinity labeling with azido-Q2H2.

All USPs contain a conserved catalytic domain surrounded by one or more subdomains, some of which contribute to target recognition. One such specific subdomain, the DUSP domain (domain present in ubiquitin-specific proteases), is present in at least seven different human USPs that regulate the stability of or interact with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1-α, the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), cullin E3 ligases, and BRCA2. We describe the NMR solution structure of the DUSP domain of human USP15, recently implicated in COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenic gene 9)-signalosome regulation. Its tripod-like structure consists of a 3-fold α-helical bundle supporting a triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The DUSP domain displays a novel fold, an α/β tripod (AB3).

There are at least 67 human deubiquitinating enzymes, subdivided in ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) 4The abbreviations used are: USP, ubiquitin-specific protease; BRCA2, breast cancer 2 gene; CSN, COP9 signalosome; DUSP, domain present in ubiquitin-specific proteases; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; NF, nuclear factor; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; VDU, Von Hippel-Lindau protein deubiquitinating enzyme; pVHL, Von Hippel-Lindau protein; RING, really interesting new gene; AB3: α/β tripod. and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases. By removing covalently attached ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, USPs counteract the activity of a relatively small number of E2 enzymes and hundreds of E3 enzymes responsible for specific protein ubiquitination. The subclass of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase enzymes cleaves ubiquitin from small peptides. Deubiquitination serves a number of roles: it protects Lys48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins from targeting to the proteasome and subsequent degradation, but can also control the signaling state characterized by monoubiquitination or Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (1Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Human USP7 was shown to stabilize p53 and, as a consequence, affect cell viability and apoptosis. Initial observations suggested that USP7 stabilizes p53 by direct binding and deubiquitination of p53 (2Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 3Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Subsequently, USP7 was also demonstrated to deubiquitinate the murine double minute 2 homolog protein, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. The total absence of USP7 destabilized murine double minute 2 homolog, causing an indirect stimulation of p53 protein stability (4Li M. Brooks C.L. Kon N. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 879-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 5Cummins J.M. Rago C. Kohli M. Kinzler K.W. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 2004; 428 (p following 486): 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The balance in deubiquitination of these two targets might determine the net outcome of both opposing actions. If the flexibility in target recognition by USP7 is exemplary for the whole USP protein family, unraveling USP-regulated ubiquitin signaling and USP target specificity will prove a challenging task. A first structural view on the action of USPs was provided by the crystal structure of the USP7 catalytic domain in complex with a covalently attached ubiquitin aldehyde that specifically inhibits USP enzymes (3Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin moiety is recognized by an extended protein surface, and its carboxyl-terminal region contacts a narrow groove containing the conserved catalytic triad His, Cys, and Asp. The ubiquitin carboxyl terminus, normally covalently bound to a ubiquitinated target, is positioned at the end of this catalytic channel, which permits binding of the substrate protein by other USP subdomains or by the catalytic core domain itself. All USPs contain a conserved catalytic domain but vary in both the number and type of subdomains surrounding it (6Quesada V. Diaz-Perales A. Gutierrez-Fernandez A. Garabaya C. Cal S. Lopez-Otin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In USP7, such subdomains were demonstrated to participate in target recognition. A domain carboxyl-terminal to the USP7 catalytic domain interacted with herpesvirus-infected cell protein 0 (7Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L. J. Biol.

Arrowsmith C. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47753-47761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this amino-terminal domain in complex with an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 peptide shows that the extended target peptide binds to the edge of a β-sandwich (8Saridakis V.

Because Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 and p53 compete for binding to similar residues in the amino-terminal domain of USP7, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 binding could indirectly destabilize p53 and prevent apoptosis (8Saridakis V. Sheng Y. Sarkari F. Holowaty M.N. Shire K. Nguyen T. Zhang R.G. Liao J. Lee W. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Frappier L. Mol.

Subdomains present in multiple USPs include the DUSP domain, the UBP Zinc-finger (ZnF-UBP), and the ubiquitin-interacting motif (9Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In at least seven human USPs, single or tandem DUSP domains are located both amino- and carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic core domain (Fig. 1a). The DUSP containing the USP family was shown to deubiquitinate or interact with proteins as diverse as the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1A, the breast cancer 2 gene product BRCA2, COP9-signalosome-associated cullin E3 ligase complexes, and the thyroid hormone-activating enzyme D2. In a structural genomics effort within our group, we have screened for conserved human protein domains that were suitable for semi-automatic structure elucidation by NMR spectroscopy (10Folkers G.E. van Buuren B.N. Kaptein R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To identify domains with new folds, we have eliminated those showing significant sequence homology to proteins with a structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The amino-terminal DUSP domain of human USP15, a protein recently implicated in COP9 signalosome regulation (11Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M.

We have determined its solution structure, which displays a novel AB3 fold comprising a 3-fold α-helical bundle that supports a triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. We have discussed the implications of the DUSP domain structure for its potential function in substrate recognition. Protein Expression and Purification—A DNA fragment encoding the amino-terminal 120 amino acid residues of human USP15 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the His tag expression vector pET15B (Novagen) from a self-made cDNA library based on a variety of human tumor cell lines essentially as described previously (10Folkers G.E. van Buuren B.N. Kaptein R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein expression and isotopic labeling was performed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 RIL (Stratagene) as described previously (10Folkers G.E. van Buuren B.N. Kaptein R. J.

The harvested bacteria from 0.5 liters of bacterial culture were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture for His-tagged proteins (Sigma)), frozen/thawed, sonicated on ice (20 bursts of 10 s), and centrifuged (30 min, 30,000 × g, 4 °C). The His-tagged hUSP15 was purified on a nickel-MC POROS column (PerSeptive Biosystems) as described previously (10Folkers G.E. van Buuren B.N. Kaptein R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris/BisTris, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl diluted to 30 mm NaCl, loaded on an HS-POROS column (PerSeptive Biosystems), purified in 10 mm Tris/BisTris, pH 7.0, with a 30–300 mm NaCl gradient with elution at ∼120 mm NaCl, and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 at pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. The purified His-hUSP15-(1–120) was concentrated to ∼1.5 mm using 3-kDa cutoff Centricon (Amicon) spin concentrators. For NMR samples, 10% D2O and 0.02% NaN3 were added. Samples were stable for more than a year. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR measurements on U-15N- and U-13C,15N-labeled hUSP15 were performed at 298 K on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 700 and 900 MHz. The mostly three-dimensional spectra required for resonance assignment and structure determination were recorded using a standard set of NMR experiments recommended for this purpose (see Ref. 12Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Mag. Res. Sp. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar and references therein). For backbone assignment using CO, CA, and CB resonances, we recorded sequential (i-1) HNCO and CBCA(CO)NH in combination with bifurcate (i,i-1) HN(CA)CO, HNCA, and HNCACB experiments. All spectra were processed with XWinNMR version 3.5 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) and assigned using PASTA (13Leutner M. Gschwind R.M. Liermann J. Schwarz C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J.

The first CANDID run was performed when the completeness of proton resonance assignments reached 92%, excluding the first 21 residues in the His tag. The quality of the structures was improved in an iterative procedure, where CANDID runs were followed by manual analysis using the NOE spectra and the preliminary structures to assign missing resonances and improve the quality of the peak lists. Hydrogen bond restraints were defined when consistent with the secondary chemical shifts, expected NOE contacts, and the structures. Manual NOE peak assignments were generally not fixed in the CANDID runs but used to create accurate spectrum-specific chemical shift lists to check the consistency of subsequent CANDID runs and to check the manual assignments. The assignment completeness for the final run was 99% for non-labile protons. The set of 20 structures calculated by CANDID was subjected to water refinement in crystallography NMR software (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

NOE restraints for the water refinement were taken from the sixth cycle of the final CANDID run, because CANDID retains only unambiguous restraints in the final seventh cycle. Dihedral restraints for 47 residues, generated by TALOS on the basis of backbone atom chemical shifts, were included. The structure was validated using WHAT-CHECK (20Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Structural coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1W6V. NMR assignments were deposited under BioMagResBank entry 6901. The DUSP Domain Forms an AB3 Tripod—The DUSP domain present in the human USP4, USP11, USP15, USP20, USP32, USP33, and USP48 (Fig. 1a) was originally derived from sequence homology (9Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of several representative DUSP family members, including all reported human DUSP domains, are aligned in Fig. 1d. The solution structure of the amino-terminal 120 amino acids of hUSP15 (hereafter referred to as the DUSP domain) was solved by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. Three α-helices formed a bundle supporting a short three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in a novel tripod-like AB3 fold (Fig. 1). Helices α1–α3 are interleaved with strands β1–β3 defining an α/β/α/β/α/β topology (Fig. 1b). Helix 2 and β-strand 2 are connected by a long linker that consists of three sub-elements. The highly conserved PGPI motif (Fig. 1d, gold) is surrounded by loop L1 (green) and loop L2 (magenta), which vary considerably both in length and sequence (Fig. 1d). The PGPI motif packs against the three-helix bundle and is highly ordered (Fig. 1c). The backbone root mean square deviation calculated for residues 6–116 is 0.59 ± 0.11 Å (Table 1). Structural homology searches using DALI, VAST, and MSDfold failed to produce structures with significant homology to the α/β tripod fold of the DUSP domain, indicating it represents a novel fold.TABLE 1Structural statistics of the hUSP15 DUSP domain Unambiguous/ambiguous restraints are listed by range: intraresidual (within the same residue), sequential (between neighboring residues), medium range (between residues 2–4 positions apart), or long range (5 or more amino acids apart). The average root mean square deviation of superimposed backbone and heavy atoms was calculated for the indicated amino acids. Structure Z scores were obtained by WHATCHECK analysis of the deposited ensemble over the whole protein (residues 1–120). The first deposited structure in the ensemble is the structure closest to the ensemble average. The Ramachandran plot was obtained by PROCHECK analysis of backbone torsion angle statistics of the deposited ensemble of the 13 lowest energy structures without nuclear Overhauser effect violations >1.0 Å over the whole protein.NOE-based distance restraints (unambiguous/ambiguous)Intraresidual577/178Sequential623/228Medium range (2–4)402/231Long range (5 or more)570/359Total2172/996Dihedral restraintsΦ/Ψ47/47Average root mean square deviation to mean (backbone atoms; heavy atoms (Å))Overall, amino acids 6–1160.59 ± 0.11; 1.04 ± 0.09Structured, amino acids 6–46; 62–68; 88–1160.49 ± 0.10; 0.95 ± 0.12Loop L1, amino acids 47–610.64 ± 0.22; 1.18 ± 0.34Loop L2, amino acids 69–870.82 ± 0.26; 1.21 ± 0.24Structure Z scores (WHATCHECK software)1st generation packing quality-1.51 ± 0.142nd generation packing quality-2.22 ± 0.30Ramachandran plot appearance-2.62 ± 0.34χ-1/χ-2 rotamer normality-1.78 ± 0.35Backbone conformation-2.47 ± 0.68Number of bumps per 100 residues16.03 ± 3.34Ramachandran plot (%) (PROCHECK software)Most favored regions86.09 ± 2.64Allowed regions11.32 ± 2.87Generously allowed regions2.22 ± 0.99Disallowed regions0.38 ± 0.63 Open table in a new tab Conserved Residues Participate in Hydrophobic Interactions—The most conserved residues of the DUSP domain, Trp37 in α1 and the PGPI motif (P62-I65), interact closely. The PGPI motif wraps around the aromatic side chain of Trp37 (Fig. 2a) with the hydrophobic side chains of Pro62 and Ile65 packing against the aromatic ring, which explains the exceptional Ile65-HA chemical shift of 1.33 ppm. The tryptophan HE1 iminoproton is perfectly placed to form a hydrogen bond with the main chain Gly63 carbonyl. The Pro64 side chain is pointing away from the Trp37 aromatic ring, whereas its backbone atoms curve around it in a sharp turn. Although the PGPI motif does not adopt a canonical secondary structure, it is structurally well defined with a low backbone root mean square deviation of 0.53 ± 0.14 Å. Isoleucine 65 not only interacts with Trp37 but also participates in a second hydrophobic cluster around the conserved Trp97 with its γ2-methyl group (Fig. 2b). Conserved residues from four structure elements (the PGPI motif, helix α2, strand β2, and the loop preceding strand β3) interact to tie these elements together. The side chains of Tyr31 and Pro112 pack on one side, and the Ile65 methyl γ2 and the Val101 side chain pack on the other side of the Trp97 indole ring. Also, the core of the three-helix bundle is stabilized by hydrophobic side chain interactions between conserved residues (Fig. 2c). Leucine 100 in helix α3 interacts with α2 residues Phe38 and Trp41, of which the hydrophobic character is conserved. Helix α1 contributes a non-conserved Ile16 side chain in USP15 that may be replaced by different residues in other DUSP-containing USP family members. The DUSP Domain Boundary Definition Should Include an Amino-terminal Helix—When we tried to express soluble protein fragments based on the human USP15 DUSP domain (9Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), soluble protein was only obtained in high yield after extending the domain amino-terminally to the original DUSP domain boundary definition (amino acids 23–120). Residues 8–21 in this amino-terminal extension form an α-helix (α1) that, despite its low sequence conservation, interacts intimately with the other helices to form the three-helix bundle. The aliphatic side chains of its residues Ile16 and Leu19 pack against Lys99 in helix α3 (Fig. 2d). Apart from these hydrophobic interactions, Lys99 forms a salt bridge with Asp15 in helix α1 via its protonated amino group. The interface between helices α1 and α3 is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between Trp103, Ala6, and Ala7. These extensive interactions of helix α1 with the other helices underline its vital role in forming the DUSP domain. DUSP domains have been identified in USPs both at the amino and carboxyl termini and between other subdomains. All amino-terminally located DUSP domains have an extension amino-terminal to the conserved residues in strand β1, previously thought to define the domain boundary. Secondary structure predictions suggest that this extension most likely forms an α-helix, as we observed for the hUSP15 DUSP domain. DUSP domains located carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic core domain also contain such a amino-terminal spacer between the conserved residues of the catalytic and DUSP domains. We therefore expect that all DUSP domains contain the three-helix bundle we observed for hUSP15, despite the low sequence conservation of the amino-terminal helix α1. Two Variable Loops Flank the PGPI Motif—Interestingly, the most conserved DUSP residues, forming the PGPI motif, are flanked by two long loops that vary both in length and sequence. The length of loop L1, preceding the PGPI motif, ranges from 2 to 110 residues in human DUSP domains, whereas loop L2 ranges from 17 to 32 residues (Fig. 1d). The assigned NOEs in these loop regions indicate an inherent absence of canonical secondary structure, yet the root mean square deviation of loops L1 (0.64 ± 0.22 Å) and L2 (0.82 ± 0.26 Å) is only slightly higher than the overall average of 0.59 ± 0.11 Å (Table 1). The relatively low root mean square deviation in loop L2 is explained by the presence of a hydrophobic cluster formed by leucines 70, 79, and 83 and Tyr89 in strand β2. Interestingly, although the sequence conservation in loop L2 is very poor, the hydrophobic character of these residues is largely conserved, even in loops of larger and smaller size. Such conservation is not observed in the loop L1 that is missing in hUSP20 and hUSP32, which contain two consecutive DUSP domains (Fig. 1d). In these proteins, Pro83 from the PGPI motif is connected to helix α2 via a small linker of only two residues, which is compatible with the hUSP15 structure. A Conserved Surface Cluster Is Present at the Loop L2/β-Sheet Interface—A projection of sequence conservation onto the protein surface, shown in Fig. 3, reveals two conserved surface areas that could indicate functionally important residues in the DUSP domain. One area contains the PGPI motif, but because the side chains in this motif are mainly buried and wrap around the Trp37 aromatic ring, we interpret its role mainly in terms of structural stabilization (Figs. 2a and 3a). The second conserved area of conservation, cluster A in Fig. 3, contains residues Leu32 in β1, Tyr89 in β2, β3 residues Ile113, Arg115 and Val118 and loop L2 residues Leu79, Leu83, and Ile84. Although only Tyr89 (β2) and Arg115 (β3) are highly conserved residues, the hydrophobicity of the other side chains is conserved as well, producing a largely hydrophobic surface area in a deep cleft at the boundary of the β-sheet and loop L2 (Fig. 3b). Conserved hydrophobic surface patches have repeatedly been shown to participate in protein/protein interactions, suggesting that this cluster could play a similar role. Interestingly, an analysis of surface-exposed hydrophobic side chains reveals another area adjacent to cluster A. This cluster B (Fig. 3c), defined by the poorly conserved amino acids Leu20 (α1), Leu24, Trp30 (β1), Phe38 (α2), Phe47 (L1), Ile90, and Leu91 (β2) forms a second, more shallow cleft of which the hydrophobicity is only conserved in the closest hUSP15 homologs hUSP4 and hUSP11 and to a lesser extent in hUSP32. Clusters A and B together form the most striking surface features of the DUSP domain; both are hydrophobic clefts, one of which is broadly conserved, whereas the other is specific for close hUSP15 relatives. The presented solution structure of the DUSP domain of human USP15 does not show significant homology to any structure so far deposited in the Protein Data Bank, as verified using DALI, VAST, and MSDfold searches. Three interleaved α/β structure repeats form a novel tripod-like AB3 fold with a three-helix bundle and a three-stranded β-sheet resembling the legs and seat of the tripod. Conserved residues are predominantly involved in hydrophobic packing interactions within the three α-helices (Fig. 2). The highly conserved PGPI motif wraps around the fully conserved Trp37 side chain in α2 and is flanked by two loops of variable length and sequence composition. The most striking surface feature is a conserved, mainly hydrophobic area in a deep cleft at the interface of loop L2 and the β-sheet. Although the lack of structural homologs hampers the functional interpretation of the structure, there is experimental data on USPs containing DUSP domains. The best characterized human DUSP containing USPs are the two strongly related USP20 (VDU2) and USP33 (VDU1) that were originally identified as interactors of pVHL (22Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Li Z. Wang D. Na X. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Meller J. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 146-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Under normal oxygen conditions, a cage in the pVHL β-domain binds a specific, hydroxylated proline in the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α (25Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), which results in HIF-1α ubiquitination and degradation. Under low oxygen pressure, the hydroxylation is reversed, causing transcriptional activation of HIF-1α-responsive genes that provide a cellular response to hypoxia. Although both USP20 and USP33 are bound by pVHL and ubiquitinated in a pVHL-dependent fashion, only USP20 can bind HIF-1α and protect it from pVHL-dependent ubiquitination (27Li Z. Wang D. Messing E.M. Wu G. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). USP20 residues 269–390 are necessary and sufficient for this interaction with HIF-1α, excluding any contribution from the DUSP domains. In contrast, the interaction with pVHL is located within hUSP20 and hUSP33 residues 510–911, including both DUSP domains and part of the catalytic ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase catalytic domain (22Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both hUSP20 and hUSP33 were also demonstrated to bind the iodothyronine deiodinase D2 enzyme that plays a role in thyroid hormone activation. Ubiquitination of D2 can be reversed by both hUSP20 and hUSP33, rescuing the enzyme from proteasomal degradation (28Curcio-Morelli C. Zavacki A.M. Christofollete M. Gereben B. de Freitas B.C. Harney J.W. Li Z. Wu G. Bianco A.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The interaction with D2 was mapped to the hUSP33 residues 585–786 that comprise a small fragment of the catalytic palm subdomain and the complete first DUSP domain (28Curcio-Morelli C. Zavacki A.M. Christofollete M. Gereben B. de Freitas B.C. Harney J.W. Li Z. Wu G. Bianco A.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because the palm fragment is likely unfolded in the absence of the rest of the catalytic domain, the DUSP domain remains the more probable candidate for D2 recognition. Consistent with their participation in the recognition of pVHL and D2 by both hUSP20 and"

A number of fluorescence properties of the tethered bimane fluorophore were measured in the membrane-bound state of the channel domain, including fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence quantum yield, fluorescence anisotropy, membrane bilayer penetration depth, surface accessibility, and apparent polarity. The data show that helix 1 is an amphipathic α-helix that is situated parallel to the membrane surface. A least squares fit of the various data sets to a harmonic function indicated that the periodicity and angular frequency for helix 1 are typical for an amphipathic α-helix (3.7 ± 0.1 residues per turn and 97 ± 3.0°, respectively) that is partially bathing into the membrane bilayer. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis also revealed that helix 1 is peripherally membrane-associated, with one face of the helix dipping into the lipid bilayer and the other face projecting toward the solvent. Finally, our data suggest that the helical boundaries of helix 1, at least at the C-terminal region, remain unaffected upon binding to the surface of the membrane in support of a toroidal pore model for this colicin.

The colicins are a family of antimicrobial proteins that are secreted by Escherichia coli strains under environmental stress, because of nutrient depletion or overcrowding, and these proteins often target sensitive bacterial strains (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 203-205PubMed Google Scholar). The lethal actions of colicins against their target cells are manifested in a number of different modes that include the following: (i) formation of depolarizing ion channels in the cytoplasmic membrane, (ii) inhibition of protein and peptidoglycan synthesis, and (iii) degradation of cellular nucleic acids (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 203-205PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cramer W.A. Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Stroud R.M.

Microbiol. 2002; 56: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In this context, the bacterial machinery responsible for colicin biological activity feature important mechanisms that are fundamental to various biological processes. These mechanisms include protein receptor binding, membrane translocation, membrane binding and protein unfolding, membrane insertion, voltage-gated ion channel formation, catalysis, and inhibition of enzymes. Colicin E1 is a member of the channel-forming subfamily of colicins and is secreted by E. coli that harbors the naturally occurring colE1 plasmid; the whole colicin consists of three functional segments, the translocation, receptor-binding domains, and channel-forming domains. Initially, the receptor-binding domain (8Brunden K.R. Cramer W.A. Cohen F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 190-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interacts with the vitamin B12 receptor of target cells (9Taylor R. Burgner J.W. Clifton J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31113-31118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following receptor recognition, the translocation domain associates with the tolA gene product, which permits the translocation of colicin E1 across the outer membrane and into the periplasm (10Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Grabau C. Cramer W.A. Hermodson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3857-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the periplasm, the channel domain undergoes a conformational change to an insertion-competent state and then inserts spontaneously into the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell, forming an ion channel. The channel allows the passage of monovalent ions, resulting in the dissipation of the cationic gradients (H+, K+, and Na+) of the target cell, causing depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane. In an effort to compensate for the membrane depolarization effected by the colicin E1 channel, Na+/K+-ATPase activity is increased in the host cell, resulting in the consumption of ATP reserves, without concomitant replenishment (11Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The final outcome is host cell death. A number of techniques have been used to study the topology of the membrane-bound state of colicin E1. Studies of the surface topology of the colicin E1 channel peptide bound to liposomes have been performed using proteases, and it was found that the bound polypeptide is largely sensitized to trypsin proteolysis relative to that in aqueous solution (12Cramer W.A. Zhang Y.L. Schendel S. Merrill A.R. Song H.Y. Stauffacher C.V. Cohen F.S. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 71-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal one-third of the 190-residue membrane-bound colicin E1 channel peptide is unbound or loosely bound with the C-terminal two-thirds showing little sensitivity to protease. The membrane-associated closed state of the channel was also studied by depth-dependent fluorescence quenching (13Palmer L.R. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach used Trp as the reporter spectroscopic probe and doxyl-labeled phospholipids as the quencher species. The results from this study were consistent with the presence of only two transmembrane segments in the closed channel and were in agreement with those obtained by Shin et al. (14Shin Y.K. Levinthal C. Levinthal F. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) who conducted an ESR study of spin-labeled cysteine mutants of the channel peptide. Furthermore, the structure and dynamics of the gating mechanism of the colicin E1 channel were studied previously by hydrophobic photolabeling (15Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and by site-specific biotinylation (4Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 131-161PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the membrane-bound volume of the colicin E1 channel peptide was determined using light scattering analysis and was found to be 177 nm3, suggesting that the peptide likely has a large hydration shell when membrane-bound (16Strawbridge K.B. Palmer L.R. Merrill A.R. Hallett F.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Tory and Merrill (17Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24539-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) used a plethora of fluorescence methods to probe the membrane topology of the closed channel state, and they concluded that the monomeric channel features two states that are in rapid equilibrium in which one state is more heavily populated than the other. Furthermore, Zakharov et al. (19Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Griko Y. Salamon Z. Tollin G. Prendergast F.G. Cramer W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4282-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) proposed that the colicin E1 closed channel exists as a two-dimensional helical array with most of the helices appressed closely to the bilayer surface. Also, Kim et al. (20Kim Y. Valentine K. Opella S.J. Schendel S.L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) used 15N-labeled p190 colicin in oriented planar phospholipid bilayers and found that the data were consistent with a single transmembrane helical hairpin inserted into the bilayer from each colicin molecule. Moreover, Zakharov et al. (21Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11325-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) characterized the kinetic steps involved in the binding and insertion process for the colicin channel domain and later suggested a role for the membrane lipid in the insertion mechanism of colicin E1 (22Zakharov S.D. Kotova E.A. Antonenko Y.N. Cramer W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, Sobko et al. (23Sobko A.A. Kotova E.A. Antonenko Y.N. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the channel activity of colicin E1 was sensitive to the membrane curvature of the lipid bilayer thus suggesting that the channel may form a toroidal pore in the bilayer. A general mechanism for toxin insertion into membranes was suggested by Elkins et al. (11Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) based on comparison of the x-ray structures of the soluble channel peptides of colicin A and E1. In this work, we prepared a series of cysteine mutants within helix 1 of the colicin E1 p190 channel domain, and we labeled the Cys residue with the bimane fluorophore. We then used the approach of site-directed fluorescence labeling to scan the membrane-bound topology of the closed state of the channel domain in membrane vesicles. We determined a number of physicochemical and fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore tethered at different sites within the channel domain, including fluorescence emission maximum, quantum yield, anisotropy, lifetime, membrane depth, surface accessibility, and apparent polarity. Least squares harmonic wave function analysis of the observed properties of the tethered bimane at various positions along helix 1 reveals that this α-helix is amphipathic and is embedded within the membrane bilayer with its nonpolar face bathing the membrane hydrocarbon core and its polar face interacting with the aqueous solvent.

Mutants—The hexahistidine-tagged channel-forming domain of colicin E1 (p190His6 (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 203-205PubMed Google Scholar)) was purified from a lexA- strain of E. coli (IT3661), which contained the pSKHY plasmid that results in constitutive production of the p190 protein. Mutant proteins were purified and characterized as described previously (17Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24539-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min) and lysed in 40 ml of loading buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.2) at 15,000 p.s.i. using a French press. The lysate was spun down (31,000 × g, 30 min), diluted, filtered (2× with two Whatman No. 5 filter paper and 1× with Whatman No. 1 filter paper), and loaded onto Zn2+-charged chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare, Baie D'Urfé, Quebec, Canada). The loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of the loading buffer and subsequently with a wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, pH 7.2). The protein was eluted using an elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 buffer. The purity of the protein samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and all mutant proteins were at least 90% pure. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 28,590 m-1 cm-1 (an ϵM, 280 of 27, 310 m-1 cm-1 was used for Y356C and Y363C). colicin E1 190-residue channel domain with an N-terminal His6 tag monobromobimane wild type large unilamellar vesicles fluorescence quantum yield bimane-labeled N-acetylcysteine the ratio of quenching by KI to that by 10-DN solvent-accessible surface area 10-doxylnonadecane. Fluorescence Labeling of p190H Mutants—The fluorescent labeling of all mutants was accomplished using a 20-fold molar excess of monobromobimane (mBBr; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, at room temperature for 2 h. Prior to the addition of the fluorescent label, protein samples were reduced with a 5-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol for 30 min. The labeled protein was separated from free label using a pre-packed Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.0. The absorbance spectrum of each labeled protein was obtained using a Cary 300 UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The stoichiometry of the protein-bimane conjugation reaction was calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated bimane and labeled proteins. The molar concentrations of the conjugated bimane and protein were determined from the absorbance at 380 and 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficients (ϵM) of 5,000 and 28,590 m-1 cm-1, respectively (an ϵM, 280 of 27,310 m-1 cm-1 was used for Y356C and Y363C). The contribution to the absorbance at 280 nm from bimane was accounted for before the calculation of the protein concentrations. The labeling efficiency of all proteins was nearly 100%. In addition to the introduced cysteine residues, all p190His6 possessed one additional cysteine residue, Cys-505, which is buried within the core of the protein. Labeling of the buried sulfhydryl side chain of Cys-505 has been shown previously to require the partial unfolding of the protein (24Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incubation of excess mBBr with wild-type (WT) p190His6 resulted in negligible background labeling (<1%). Therefore, given the near 1:1 stoichiometry of the labeling reactions and the lack of bimane labeling of the WT protein, all the fluorophores were presumed to be attached to the introduced cysteine residues, and the buried Cys-505 did not participate in the labeling reaction. Preparation of Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in 60:40% molar ratio by extrusion through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter (Lipofast, Aventin Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) in 20 mm dimethylglutaric acid, 130 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, and phospholipid concentration was determined using the Bartlett assay for phosphorus as described earlier (17Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24539-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements of Mutants—All steady-state fluorescence measurements, except for the dual quencher experiments, were made with a PTI-Alphascan-2 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a thermostated cell holder. Unless otherwise stated, a 2.5–4.0 μm protein sample in 20 mm dimethylglutaric acid, 130 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, in the presence or absence of excess LUVs (800 μm, final concentration), was used for all measurements. The temperature was maintained constant at 22 °C. Structural and Functional Assessments—The folding properties of all mutants were examined by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of each protein compared with the WT. Trp fluorescence emission spectra of labeled and unlabeled mutant proteins in pH 7.0 phosphate-buffered saline buffer were obtained using 295-nm excitation light. The excitation and emission slit widths were 2 and 4 nm, respectively, and the fluorescence emission was scanned from 305 to 450 nm. Corrections were made for the appropriate blanks and for the wavelength-dependent bias of the optical and detection systems. The fluorescence emission maximum (λem, max) values were determined from the first derivative of the smoothed spectra. These data were used to assess the structural integrity of the mutant proteins as compared with the WT protein. In addition, the in vitro channel activity of all mutants was also assayed as described earlier (24Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bimane Fluorescence Emission Spectra—The steady-state fluorescence emission spectra, in the presence or absence of LUVs, were measured from 395 to 600 nm while exciting at 381 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were kept at 2.0 and 4.0 nm, respectively. To minimize vesicle light scattering, a 390 nm cut-off filter (Oriel Corporation, Rockford, IL) was placed in the emission light path. The signal from solvent blank (buffer or LUVs in buffer) was subtracted from the sample fluorescence, and the spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the instrument response. Quantum Yield Measurements—The bimane fluorescence quantum yields (QF), in the presence and absence of LUVs, of all mutants were obtained using quinine sulfate (QF = 0.53 in 0.1 n H2SO4) as a quantum standard (25Fletcher A.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1969; 9: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 360 nm while scanning the emission spectra from 370 to 600 nm in 1 nm increments. The excitation and emission slit widths were 4.0 and 6.0 nm, respectively. The absorbance at the excitation wavelength for the various samples ranged between 0.05 and 0.1. To minimize light scattering effects, the excitation light was vertically polarized, and the emission was detected at 54.7° (magic angle). The signal from the solvent blank (buffer or LUVs in buffer) was subtracted from the sample fluorescence, and the spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the instrument response. Using the wavelength-integrated fluorescence intensities and the optical densities at the excitation wavelength of the sample and the reference, the quantum yield was calculated as shown in Equation 1,QF=QRIIRARA(Eq. 1) where QR is the quantum yield of the reference sample; I and IR are the integrated fluorescence intensities of the sample and the reference, respectively; A and AR are the optical densities, at the excitation wavelength, of the sample and the reference, respectively. The reported values represent the mean of at least three determinations. Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) measurements were made using “T-format” detection by simultaneously comparing the intensities of the vertically (IVV) and horizontally (IVH) polarized emitted light when the sample was excited with a vertically polarized light. By using the IVV and IVH fluorescence intensities, the anisotropy (r) was calculated as shown in Equation 2.r=IVV-GIVHIVV+2GIVH(Eq. 2) The “G” instrumental factor, measured as IHV/IHH, was determined from the intensities of the vertically (IHV) and horizontally (IHH) polarized emitted light from horizontally polarized excitation light. For all measurements, the excitation was set at 381 nm (4 nm slit width), and emission was collected at 470 nm (10 nm slit width) with a signal integration time of 30 s. Each anisotropy value is the mean of three determinations. A solvent blank (buffer or LUVs in buffer) was subtracted from each intensity reading prior to the calculation of the anisotropy value. Depth-dependent Dual Fluorescence Quenching Measurements Using Iodide and 10-Doxylnonadecane—For the depth measurement of bimane-labeled residues within the bilayer, iodide and 10-doxylnonadecane (10-DN) quenching of bimane was measured as described previously (26Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3265-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Hayashibara M. London E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2183-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To measure iodide quenching (FKI), the fluorescence of samples was measured on a Spex Tau-2 Fluorolog Spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) in ratio mode using semi-micro quartz cuvettes (excitation path length 10 mm, emission path length 4 mm) containing 100 μm LUVs and 7.5 μg of protein or LUVs only (background). FKI was determined after the addition of a 50-μl aliquot of an aqueous solution from a 1.7 m KI and 0.85 mm Na2S2O3 stock solution. The initial fluorescence of the samples in the absence of the quencher (Fo) was obtained from equivalent samples in which a 50-μl aliquot of 0.85 mm Na2S2O3 was added to each sample instead of KI. The excitation wavelength was set at 375 nm while observing the emission intensity at 467 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 and 5.0 nm, respectively. To measure the efficiency of 10-DN quenching, membrane-bound protein or vesicles lacking protein were prepared as described above except that the 10-DN quencher-containing LUVs contained 10 mol % of 10-DN. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 24 °C before measurement. Calculation of the Iodide to 10-DN Q Ratio—The ratio of quenching by KI to that by 10-DN (Q ratio) was used to determine bimane depth in lipid bilayers. The Q ratio was calculated from Equation 3,Q-ratio=((Fo/FKI)-1)((Fo/F10-DN)-1)(Eq. 3) where Fo is the fluorescence of a sample lacking quencher, and FKI and F10-DN are the fluorescence intensities in the presence of KI or 10-DN, respectively. Sensitivity of the Fluorescence Parameters of Bimane to Solvent Polarity—The sensitivity of the bimane fluorescence to solvent polarity was assessed using N-acetylcysteine conjugated with bimane (bimane-Cys) as a probe. Bimane-Cys was produced by reacting mBBr with 10-fold molar excess of N-acetylcysteine in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.1, for 1 h. The reaction mixture was lyophilized overnight and subsequently resuspended in dioxane:water mixtures of 0 to 100% (v/v) dioxane. The fluorescence emission and lifetime of bimane-Cys (2 μm bimane-Cys) samples in dioxane:water mixtures of different dielectric constants (ϵ = 2.3–80) were determined. Analysis of the Solvent-accessible Surface Area (SASA)—The solvent accessibility of each residue in helix 1 of p190H6 (347–365) to a 1.4-Å probe (water) was calculated using the Web-based program GETAREA 1.1 (www.scsb.utmb.edu/getarea/area_man.html) (28Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure coordinates of the WT p190 colicin E1 (11Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Predicting Secondary Structure from Fluorescence Parameters—The secondary structure elements within the colicin E1 channel domain were predicted from the observed fluorescence parameters using a method adopted from Cornette et al. (29Cornette J.L. Cease K.B. Margalit H. Spouge J.L. Berzofsky J.A. DeLisi C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 659-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In brief, the periodicity and the angular frequency of the observed fluorescence parameters were obtained through a least squares fit of the data using the harmonic wave function as shown in Equation 4,y=a·sin(2π(x+bp))+c(Eq. 4) where a is the amplitude; b is the phase; p is the period; and c is an offset value. All calculations were made using an Excel 2002 template spread-sheet developed in-house by Dr. Uwe Oehler. The primary sequence of the colicin E1 channel domain, p190H6, is shown in Fig. 1A, and the protein sequence, including helix 1 in the water-soluble structure that was Cys-scanned, is indicated by the downward facing brace. Additionally, the overall topology of helix 1 within p190H6 and also the locations of the inserted Cys residues are shown as spheres that correspond to the C-α carbon of each residue (Fig. 1B). The channel domain is a bundle of 10 α-helices that is composed of four antiparallel helical pairs that include helix 1 matched with helix 2 (layer A, see Fig. 1B), a helical segment that forms a strap across the structure (helices 5a and 5b), and the C-terminal helix (helix 10). Although it is believed that the helices within layer A of the channel domain are not involved in direct contact with the membrane, they may play an important role in channel formation (11Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The angle between helices 1 and 2 is about 33° and results in helix 1 extending away from the body of the molecule. This region is believed to serve as the hinge to provide sufficient flexibility to allow rotation to the appropriate docking orientation on the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterial host (11Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Characterization of WT and Mutant p190H6—The N-terminal hexahistidine tag has been incorporated previously in the channel domain of colicin A and N, for ease of purification (30Fridd S.L. Gokce I. Lakey J.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Structural and functional characterizations of His-tagged colicin A and N channel domains have shown that the incorporation of the hexahistidine tag did not significantly alter the channel properties of these two proteins (30Fridd S.L. Gokce I. Lakey J.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used intrinsic Trp fluorescence as a probe of protein conformation as well as in vitro channel activity analysis to assess the impact of how the engineered hexahistidine tag, the introduction of cysteine residues, and the bimane labeling affected the structural and functional integrity of the protein. Previously, membrane binding analysis of the p190H6 revealed that the dissociation constant (Kd) for membrane association of the His-tagged channel peptide did not vary significantly from the untagged, thermolytic channel domain of WT colicin E1. Also, the binding of WT p190H6 to anionic LUVs under conditions (pH 4, ionic strength, I ∼ 0.1 m, anionic lipid content = 40%) for which the protein has the highest activity was assayed as described earlier (24Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The observed binding parameters, n = 32–45 (lipid molecules bound per protein) and Kd = 0.8–1.2 nm, are in good agreement with earlier results for the WT colicin thermolytic channel peptide (24Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Trp λem, max of all mutant proteins (bimane-labeled and unlabeled proteins) showed values that were similar with those of the WT p190H6 (Table 1), indicating that the global folding pattern of the mutants was similar or did not differ significantly from that of the WT thermolytic channel domain. The in vitro channel activities of all p190H6 WT and mutant proteins were also comparable with the previously characterized thermolytic WT channel domain (data not shown) (24Musse A.A. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24491-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of the Trp λem max values observed for the WT and the bimane-labeled/unlabeled Cys mutants of colicin E1 channel peptideSampleλem, maxaValues shown are the means ± the S."
https://openalex.org/W2048365197,"MCT1 (monocarboxylic acid transporter 1) facilitates bidirectional monocarboxylic acid transport across membranes. MCT1 function and regulation have not been characterized previously in cerebral endothelial cells but may be important during normal cerebral energy metabolism and during brain diseases such as stroke. Here, by using the cytoplasmic pH indicator 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester, the initial rates of monocarboxylate-dependent cytoplasmic acidification were measured as an indication of MCT1 kinetic function in vitro using the rat brain endothelial cell (RBE4) model of blood-brain transport. The initial rate of l-lactate-dependent acidification was significantly inhibited by 5–10-min incubations with agonists of intracellular cAMP-dependent cell signaling pathways as follows: dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and isoproterenol. Isoproterenol reduced Vmax but did not affect Km values. The effects of forskolin were completely reversed by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89, whereas H89 alone increased transport rates. Cytoplasmic cAMP levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were increased by forskolin or isoproterenol, and the effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol. MCT1-independent intracellular pH control mechanisms did not contribute to the forskolin or H89 effects on MCT1 kinetic function as determined with amiloride, monocarboxylate-independent acid loading, or the transport inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. The data demonstrate the direct modulation of MCT1 kinetic function in cerebral endothelial cells by agents known to affect the β-adrenergic receptor/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A intracellular signaling pathway.

MCT1 (monocarboxylic acid transporter 1) facilitates the diffusion of monocarboxylic acids such as l-lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and keto acids across biological membranes. It is an obligatory symporter that carries a dissociated proton-monocarboxylate pair with each transport cycle (for review see Refs. 1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 2Drewes L.R. Paulson O. Knudsen G.M. Moos T. Brain Barrier Systems, Alfred Benzon Symposium 45. Munksgaard, Copenhagen1999: 285-295Google Scholar, 3Pierre K. Pellerin L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, MCT1 has been characterized as a member of the monocarboxylic acid transporter family of solute carriers (SLC16 family (4Wain H.M. Bruford E.A. Lovering R.C. Lush M.J. Wright M.W. Povey S. Genomics. 2002; 79: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)) that includes up to 14 subtypes (MCT1–14), although the monocarboxylate substrate specificity has been demonstrated for only 4 (5Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). MCT1 is the prominent monocarboxylic acid transporter in the cerebral microvascular endothelium, where it is present on the luminal and abluminal membranes of vascular endothelial cells (6Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E207-E213PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leino R.L. Gerhart D.Z. Drewes L.R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain. Res. 1999; 113: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here MCT1 is proposed to be the major regulator of bidirectional monocarboxylic acid transport between the brain and the blood, and may have pharmacologic importance for treating brain diseases such as stroke (2Drewes L.R. Paulson O. Knudsen G.M. Moos T. Brain Barrier Systems, Alfred Benzon Symposium 45. Munksgaard, Copenhagen1999: 285-295Google Scholar, 8Enerson B.E. Drewes L.R. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 1531-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The vast majority of strokes are associated with severe cerebral lactic acidosis, which is a key factor leading to permanent brain cell damage (for review see Ref. 9Martin R.L. Lloyd H.G. Cowan A.I. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 251-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Decreased activity of MCT1 in the cerebral microvasculature may be a critical determinant of acid-related cell damage during stroke, and this is evident because lactic acid is not cleared from brain during cerebral ischemia (10Drewes L.R. Gilboe D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2489-2496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of MCT1 mRNA in brain is correlated with a reduction in cell damage following experimental transient focal cerebral ischemia in rodents. 3L. R. Drewes, unpublished results. Therefore, factors that regulate the kinetic function of MCT1 in the cerebral microvascular endothelium may be important in mediating the extent of lactic acidosis and therefore brain damage during stroke. The regulation of MCT1 function is suggested by its shared structural similarity with other transporters that are kinetically regulated by specific intracellular signaling mechanisms. These include sodium/hydrogen exchangers (11Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13231-13239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Heard K.S. Fidyk N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Regulation of MCT1 by phosphorylation is suggested by the presence of sequence motifs that have a high phosphorylation potential in its intracellular protein domain. Recently, hormone-induced translocation of MCT1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane has been shown to regulate MCT1-dependent butyrate uptake in a cell line from human intestine, suggesting the possibility of such a regulatory mechanism for cerebral vascular MCT1 (16Buyse M. Sitaraman S.V. Liu X. Bado A. Merlin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28182-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the Michaelis-Menten kinetics and inhibition of MCT1 have been clearly defined by a number of studies in other cells (17Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), neither its basic kinetics nor its functional regulation in cerebral microvascular cells has been investigated. Here we report the modulation of MCT1 kinetic function in the RBE4 cell model of rat cerebral endothelial cells by agents known to affect the β-adrenergic/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A-intracellular signal transudation pathway. The elucidation of this regulation improves our understanding of the roles that monocarboxylate and MCT1 have in normal brain energy metabolism. It also suggests the pharmacological modulation of MCT1 kinetic function as a novel target for drug-based therapies to reduce the damaging effects of lactic acidosis during cerebral ischemia and stroke. RBE4 Cell Culture—Immortalized rat brain endothelial cells (RBE4), a gift from F. Roux (20Roux F. Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Claire M. Mailly P. Bourre J.M. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 159: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), were cultured in equal parts minimum essential medium α and F-10 Nutrient (Ham's), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen), 0.3 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma), and 1.0 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were cultured directly on 75-mm2 polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Falcon) or 25-mm round coverglass and passaged less than 12 times before use. All imaging experiments were conducted before cells reached confluence. Gene Expression by Real Time PCR—Primer pairs for real time PCR were designed using Oligo 6.4 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO) (Table 1). Total RNA was extracted from RBE4 cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA using an Omniscript™ kit (Qiagen) with oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers. Reactions for quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR were performed on a LightCycler™ instrument using the LightCycler™ DNA Master SYBR® Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Before quantitative measurements of cDNA were performed, PCR conditions for each primer set were optimized, and a melting curve analysis was used to confirm that each primer pair produced a single product. Standard curves for candidate cDNAs were prepared from a series of five 10-fold serial dilutions of target cDNA. The quantity of DNA in each sample was normalized to 18 S rRNA or glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase.TABLE 1RT-PCR primersTransporterPCR primersMCT1Forward, 5′-ATG TAT GCC GGA GGT CCT ATC-3′Reverse, 5′-CCA ATG GTC GCT TCT TGT AGA-3′MCT2Forward, 5′-CTG GCT GTC ATG TAC GCA GGA-3′Reverse, 5′-AAG CCG ACG GTG AGG TAA AGT-3′MCT4Forward, 5′-GCA TCT TCT TTG GGA TCT CGT-3′Reverse, 5′-GTA AAC TTT CGT TGC GTC CAG-3′MCT7Forward, 5′-AAG GGC CAG GCT CAC CGA AAG-3′Reverse, 5′-GAG GCC GAA CAG CGT GTA ACA-3′MCT8Forward, 5′-ATC TGC CCA TTC AGG TGA CAC-3′Reverse, 5′-CCT AAG AGG CTG CTT CCT ACT-3′ Open table in a new tab Immunocytochemical Analysis of MCT1 Protein Expression—A polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide coding the 15 carboxylterminal amino acids of rat monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1, LQNSSGDPAEEESPV), isolated from chicken egg yolks, affinity-purified, and used in immunocytochemical studies (6Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E207-E213PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody recognizes a protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 46–50 kDa on immunoblots of brain membrane proteins from adult and suckling rats (data not shown) (6Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E207-E213PubMed Google Scholar). The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunocytochemistry elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was employed with color development for 1–4 min in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). To provide controls for nonspecific staining, the antigenic peptide was added to the primary antibody at 20 μg/ml before use. Cell Loading with pH Indicator Dye—RBE4 cells, growing on glass, were incubated for 10–15 min at room temperature with 3.5 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) 4The abbreviations used are: BCECF, (2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester); H89, N-(2-[bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; CHC, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate; RT, reverse transcriptase; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; [H+]i, intracellular proton concentration; Bt2cAMP, N6, 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate; MCT, monocarboxylic acid transporter; NHE, sodium hydrogen exchanger; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS). HBS consisted of the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 5 sucrose, pH 7.35 ± 0.05 (KOH). Coverslips were transferred to fresh HBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in order to allow maximal de-esterification of the indicator and stabilization of the cytoplasmic H+ concentration ([H+]i). Incubation was continued on ice for a minimum of 15 min prior to imaging. Determination of pH-dependent Fluorescence—BCECF fluorescence was determined using an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope with a 10× objective, a 490 ± 20-nm excitation filter combined with a 1.0 neutral density filter, a 440 ± 20-nm excitation filter, and a 535 ± 25-nm emission filter cube (Omega Optical, Inc., Brattleboro, VT). A Sutter 10-position filter wheel with a LUDL controller was used to control the excitation filtering. Fluorescence images were obtained using a SIT68 video camera (Dage-MTI, Inc.) and computerized using a MuTech MV1000 frame grabber and MetaFluor Imaging System software, version 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Cells were excited for 100 ms at each wavelength, with a sample rate of ∼1 image pair per 1.8 s. Background fluorescence was subtracted from a cell-free region of each image during acquisition. The image pairs were stored digitally for off-line analysis using MetaFluor Imaging System software (above) and Microcal™ Origin™ graphical analysis software (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Calibration of BCECF Fluorescence to pHi—Ratiometric images were calibrated to indicate the approximate pHi from image regions corresponding to individual cells by using the method of Thomas et al. (21Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were perfused with HBS substituted with 135 mm KCl and 5 mm NaCl, containing the K+/H+-exchange ionophore nigericin (10–20 μm), in solutions of different pH values (adjusted with NaOH). Nigericin equilibrates the intracellular and extracellular pH in the presence of high K+ (21Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). At the end of each experiment, the fluorescence ratio from nigericin-treated cells was determined at eight pH values ranging from pH 6.2 to 8.2. The calibration data were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using Microcal Origin™ software to determine the maximum (Rmax) and minimum (Rmin) fluorescence ratios and the pK of the dye in each cell. The 495/440 excitation ratio data (R) was transformed to determine the approximate pHi at each time point and for each individual cell in all experiments, using the following equation: pHi = pK + log((R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R)). As an example, the sigmoidal fit for the average R versus extracellular pH in nigericin from 20 cells (±S.E.) is illustrated; however, in practice these data were determined for each individual cell (Fig. 3A). Initial Rates of Acidification—All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Media were exchanged within 2 s by aspirating the imaging chamber (Warner Instruments RC-21BRW) and flushing it with 10–20 chamber volumes (5 ml) of fresh medium. The initial rates of cytoplasmic acidification (vi) were determined using Microcal Origin™ software by line fitting the first four or more points of pHi time data occurring in the earliest, most linear region of a response to bath-applied substrate and were expressed as pH units/s (Fig. 3B). Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) were determined by plotting the extracellular substrate concentration ([S]) versus vi and fitting the data to the following Michaelis-Menten equation: vi = (Vmax[S])/(Km + [S]) using Microcal Origin™ software. Cytoplasmic cAMP Concentrations—Cytoplasmic cAMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Briefly, subconfluent RBE4 cells growing in 35-mm culture dishes (Corning) were treated at room temperature with drugs in HBS for 5–10 min in the presence or absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (25 mm). The media were aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of absolute ethanol, and the cells were scraped, sonicated, and pelleted, and the level of cAMP in the supernatant was measured using a TRK.432 kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturers' recommended protocol. cAMP levels were expressed as picomoles of cAMP per 35-mm culture dish. Drugs and Solutions—All drugs, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma. Drugs were dissolved in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, HBS, or water as recommended by the manufacturer and diluted to their final concentrations in HBS, and the pH was adjusted if necessary (KOH). In no case did any vehicle at its final concentration cause measurable effects on RBE4 cell pHi (data not shown). The [Cl–] and osmolarity of media containing transporter substrates were kept constant by substituting the substrates for an equivalent portion of NaCl. Statistics—All statistics and curve fitting were performed using Microcal Origin™ software and applied as indicated in the figure legends or text. Functional MCT1 Is Expressed in RBE4 Cells—Strong immunoreactivity against MCT1 protein was present in RBE4 cell cultures using a polyclonal antibody that is specific for MCT1 (6Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E207-E213PubMed Google Scholar). Staining was evident throughout the plasma membrane of all cells and was completely inhibited by the antigenic peptide, confirming that the RBE4 cells expressed robust levels of MCT1 protein (Fig. 1). mRNA for MCT1 was the predominant monocarboxylic acid transporter transcript expressed in these cells, as shown by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2). The MCT2 RT-PCR product was minimally detected at less than 15% of the MCT1 product. It was not surprising that MCT2 mRNA would be low in these cells because MCT2 protein is not detectable in the rat cerebral endothelium from which RBE4 cells are derived (22Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Glia. 1998; 22: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Pierre K. Magistretti P.J. Pellerin L. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MCT1 is, however, the only detectable monocarboxylate transporter in rat brain endothelium in situ (6Gerhart D.Z. Enerson B.E. Zhdankina O.Y. Leino R.L. Drewes L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E207-E213PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that MCT2 is relatively insignificant in RBE4 cells and was further supported by our kinetic analysis (see below). MCT4, -7, and -8 PCR product levels were very low in RBE4 cells, between 0.16 and 4% of the MCT1 product (Fig. 2). The combined data suggested that RBE4 cells would be an excellent model for the study of MCT1 protein function.FIGURE 2Quantitative measurement of MCT gene expression by real time RT-PCR in RBE4 cells. Cells expressed much greater levels of mRNA for MCT1 than for other MCT isoforms suggesting that MCT1 is the predominant monocarboxylate transporter mRNA message expressed in these cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To measure the function of MCT1, we used ratiometric fluorescence video microscopy of cells loaded with the pHi indicator BCECF-AM, and we measured the responses to extracellularly applied monocarboxylate substrates of MCT1. All experimentation was conducted in bicarbonate-free buffer to minimize the activity of bicarbonate-dependent pHi regulatory mechanisms. This method has been shown previously to give very reliable estimates of MCT1 kinetic parameters and is comparable in efficacy to methods using intracellular pH-sensitive electrodes and uptake of l-[14C]lactate (17Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem.

BCECF-AM-loaded RBE4 cells showed cytoplasmic fluorescence that was even and bright. Fluorescence ratios of BCECF-loaded cells, excited at 495/440 nm, were calibrated to indicate the approximate pHi using the method of Thomas et al. (21Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the data exhibited minimal variation and were tightly fit by the theoretical parameters used in the calibration, further indicating the high efficacy of this method (Fig. 3) (21Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Resting pHi was stable for periods longer than ½ h, whereas experiments were typically completed within 10 min. pHi was unaffected by repetitive exchanges of the bath with fresh HBS. Rapid exchange of the bathing medium with HBS containing 20 mm l-lactate induced an immediate acidification of the cytoplasm of all cells that was completely reversed upon reperfusion with lactate-free HBS (Fig. 3B). As a measure of MCT1 kinetic function, the initial rate of vi was determined by linear regression of the earliest, most linear portion of this response in each cell and was expressed in pH units/s (Fig. 3B). Plots of the average vi measured in groups of 19–40 cells, ± S.E., were determined at different concentrations of MCT1 substrates and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 4). A summary of kinetic data (Table 2) indicates that RBE4 cells responded to the MCT1 substrates, l-lactate, d-3-hydroxybutyrate, and pyruvate very consistently with previously published kinetic studies that characterized the Michaelis-Menten parameters for MCT1 function using both BCECF and pH-sensitive intracellular electrodes (17Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Broer S. Schneider H.P. Broer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem.

These data supported our RT-PCR data suggesting that MCT2 would not be significant in RBE4 cells, because Km values for MCT2, as determined previously with these substrates, are only between 8 and 21% of Km values for MCT1 (25Broer S. Broer A. Schneider H.P. Stegen C. Halestrap A.P. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), a specific MCT1 inhibitor, vi was linear with increasing concentrations of l-lactate (not shown). CHC blocked nearly all of the lactate-dependent acidification at the highest lactate concentrations, further suggesting the specificity of these studies for measuring MCT1 functionality (Fig. 4). Combined, our immunocytochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and CHC inhibition of lactate-dependent vi were very consistent with other studies that have defined MCT1 kinetic function, indicating the specificity of our experimental system for measuring MCT1 function.TABLE 2Michaelis-Menten parameters for MCT1 in RBE4 and other cell typesl-LactatePyruvated-3-HydroxybutyrateCell typeKmVmax, % l-lactateKmVmax, % l-lactateKmVmax, % l-lactatemm%mm%mm%RBE4 cell4.01002.06312.096Ehrlich-Lettre tumor cell (17Carpenter L.

Km was also very consistent over time, producing values very near 4 mm l-lactate when tested on at least four separate occasions. In contrast, Vmax and the 25 mm l-lactate-dependent vi varied daily, depending on the particular batch of cells used and their length of time in culture. Therefore, vi values were compared only among identical cultures from the same day and were internally consistent in their responses to l-lactate concentrations (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that elevated cytoplasmic concentrations of cAMP might lead to a modulation of MCT1 kinetic function, we incubated RBE4 cells in the membrane-permeant cAMP analog Bt2cAMP or the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin for 5–10 min prior to measuring l-lactate-dependent vi values. Neither drug caused a perceptible change in the resting pHi during the preincubation (not shown); however, the initial rate of acidification with 25 mm l-lactate was significantly reduced by both drugs (Fig. 5A). This result was repeated on more than four separate occasions. A role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in slowing lactate-dependent vi was suggested because the PKA activator, Bt2cAMP, inhibited MCT1 function. To determine whether the forskolin-dependent reduction in lactate-dependent vi was mediated by PKA, we pretreated cells with the specific PKA antagonist 20 μm H89, with and without forskolin, for 5 min before measuring responses to 25 mm l-lactate. H89 did not cause a perceptible change in the basal pHi during the preincubation (not shown). However, inclusion of H89 in the forskolin preincubation completely reversed the effects of forskolin (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, H89 alone caused a significant increase in l-lactate-dependent vi, suggesting that PKA may be exerting a tonic slowing effect on MCT1 kinetic function under control conditions (Fig. 5B). The above results were repeated on at least three separate occasions and suggest a role for PKA in modulating MCT1 kinetic function in RBE4 cells. Because PKA activation is downstream of cell surface receptor-mediated mechanisms (26Taylor S.S. Zheng J. Radzio-Andzelm E. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Herberg F.W. Yonemoto W.M.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 191-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because cerebral endothelium is known to express β-adrenergic receptors that activate PKA, we tested the hypothesis that a β-adrenergic receptor agonist would lead to a reduction in the lactate-dependent vi. Isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent slowing of vi consistent with a β-adrenergic receptor-mediated process having an IC50 near 4 μm when tested with 25 mm l-lactate (Fig. 6A). The transport-slowing effect of 100 μm isoproterenol was similar in magnitude to that observed with Bt2cAMP and forskolin (Figs. 5 and 6). Inclusion of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (10 nm), in the preincubation with isoproterenol, led to a statistically significant reversal of the isoproterenol-dependent reduction in vi. However, the reversal of inhibition was not complete (data not shown). Isoproterenol or propranolol alone did not cause a perceptible change in the basal pHi during the preincubation (not shown). Comparison of Michaelis-Menten plots constructed at varying l-lactate concentrations in the presence and absence of 100 μm isoproterenol showed that drug treatment caused a 14% reduction in Vmax but only a 2% change in Km (Fig. 6B). The combined data demonstrated that MCT1 kinetic fu"

We have investigated its action using toxin-sensitive MIN6 beta-cells, which express endogenously the alpha-LTX receptor latrophilin (LPH), and toxin-insensitive HIT-T15 beta-cells, which lack endogenous LPH. alpha-LTX evoked insulin exocytosis in HIT-T15 cells only upon expression of full-length LPH but not of LPH truncated after the first transmembrane domain (LPH-TD1). In HIT-T15 cells expressing full-length LPH and in native MIN6 cells, alpha-LTX first induced membrane depolarization by inhibition of repolarizing K(+) channels followed by the appearance of Ca(2+) transients. In a second phase, the toxin induced a large inward current and a prominent increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) reflecting pore formation. Upon expression of LPH-TD1 in HIT-T15 cells just this second phase was observed. Moreover, the mutated toxin LTX(N4C), which is devoid of pore formation, only evoked oscillations of membrane potential by reversible inhibition of iberiotoxin-sensitive K(+) channels via phospholipase C, activated L-type Ca(2+) channels independently from its effect on membrane potential, and induced an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-dependent release of intracellular calcium in MIN6 cells. The combined effects evoked transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in these cells, which were sensitive to inhibitors of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, or L-type Ca(2+) channels. The latter agents also reduced toxin-induced insulin exocytosis. In conclusion, alpha-LTX induces signaling distinct from pore formation via full-length LPH and phospholipase C to regulate physiologically important K(+) and Ca(2+) channels as novel targets of its secretory activity."

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CuZn-SOD deficiency causes a high mutation rate and an auxotrophy for lysine and methionine or cysteine under aerobic growth conditions (6Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, CuZn-SOD deficiency causes severe growth defects even in rich media (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and auxotrophy for lysine and methionine or cysteine (8Mutoh M. Nakagawa C.W. Yamada K. Curr.

In S. cerevisiae, several multicopy suppressor genes that overcome the biosynthetic defects and oxidant-sensitive phenotype of a CuZn-SOD-deficient mutant (sod1Δ) have been isolated. They include the ATX1 and ATX2 genes, which cause accumulation of copper and manganese, respectively (9Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations in genes such as PMR1 and BSD2 also suppress oxidative damage in sod1Δ by accumulation of manganese and copper plus manganese, respectively (11Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and a recent study suggests that the suppression might be due to increased mitochondrial iron in seo mutants (14Jensen L.T. Sanchez R.J. Srinivasan C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29938-29943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Even though lysine auxotrophy is generally observed in yeast lacking CuZn-SOD, the labile target(s) in the lysine biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. In yeast, filamentous fungi, and some bacteria, lysine is synthesized by the α-aminoadipate pathway (15Yura T. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 648-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Vogel H.J. Am. Nat. 1964; 98: 435-446Crossref Google Scholar, 17Wulandari A.P. Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Hoshino T. Yamane H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the first step is catalyzed by homocitrate synthase (HCS), which converts α-ketoglutarate to homocitrate. Homocitrate is then converted to homoaconitate and further to homoisocitrate by homocitrate dehydrase and homoaconitate dehydratase (homoaconitase), respectively (18Irvin S.D. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reactions from α-ketoglutarate to α-aminoadipate are similar to those in leucine biosynthesis and a portion of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A close similarity in amino acid sequence between the corresponding enzymes has been revealed (available at www.ncbi.hih.gov/COG) (18Irvin S.D. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One recent study hypothesized that homoaconitase (encoded by the LYS4 gene in S. cerevisiae) containing a 4Fe-4S cluster could be the damaged target in the sod1Δ mutant of S. cerevisiae (20Wallace M.A. Liou L.-L. Martins J. Clement M.H.S. Bailey S. Longo V.D. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we screened for multicopy suppressors of growth defects caused by depletion of CuZn-SOD in the fission yeast S. pombe and found that overproduction of HCS, encoded by the lys4+ gene in S. pombe (21Ye Z.H. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5968-5970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is sufficient to suppress lysine auxotrophy caused by CuZn-SOD depletion. We present evidence that HCS is the labile target that is compromised and thus causes lysine auxotrophy under pro-oxidative (superoxide-rich) conditions. Strains and Culture Conditions—S. pombe strains 972, ED665, ED668, and JL46 were used as described by Lee et al. (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely grown in yeast extract/supplement (YES) medium and synthetic minimal medium (Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM)) as described by Alfa et al. (22Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). For conjugation and sporulation analyses, cells were grown in malt extract medium according to standard procedures (23Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). Disruption of the sod1+ Gene and Tetrad Analysis—A HindIII fragment containing the ura4+ gene of S. pombe (24Grimm C. Kohli J. Murray J. Maundrell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BstEII site of the sod1+ gene cloned into pSOD1 (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), generating pSUD1. The BstYI/SpeI fragment (2 kb) from pSUD1, which contains the ura4+ cassette (1.76 kb) flanked by the sod1+ gene sequence, was used to transform a diploid cell (ED665/ED668). Following selection by the ura4+ marker, the expected heterozygous (sod1+/sod1::ura4+) gene structure of the diploid transformant was confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. For tetrad analysis, the spores from each ascus were dissected on YES plates and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3 days. Auxotrophy Test—Strain JL46, an ED665 derivative that contains the nmt1 promoter-driven sod1+ gene in the chromosome (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was grown to the exponential phase (A600 = 0.5) in EMM. For survival tests on plates, aliquots from serial dilutions were spotted onto EMM plates with or without thiamine (10 μm) and amino acid supplements (250 mg/liter) and incubated at 30 °C. To monitor growth in liquid medium, freshly grown cells were inoculated in liquid EMM with or without thiamine (10 μm) and amino acid supplements (250 mg/liter), and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Screening of Multicopy Suppressors of Growth Defects Caused by Depletion of CuZn-SOD—An S. pombe genomic library was made by cloning partial HindIII-cut DNA fragments from strain 972 into the pWH5 shuttle plasmid with a 2μ circle origin (25Wright A. Maundrell K. Heyer W.D. Beach D. Nurse P. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Following transformation into strain JL46 (nmt1-sod1+), transformants were selected on EMM plates containing 10 μm thiamine, on which parental JL46 cells are unable to grow. Transformants that restored the normal level of CuZn-SOD (Sod1) due to introduction of the sod1+ gene or constitutive nmt1 promoter mutations were excluded by Western blot analysis using antibody against Sod1. Plasmids that confirmed JL46 growth on thiamine plates in the absence of sod1+ gene expression were then selected, and the multicopy suppressor genes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. The pWH5-34 clone containing a 8.07-kb genomic DNA fragment harboring the phx1+ gene was selected and named pWH5-phx1+. Two-dimensional PAGE Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared from ED665 cells harboring the pWH5 or pWH5-phx1+ plasmid grown to the stationary phase in EMM. Extracts containing 200 μg of proteins were loaded onto Immobiline™ DryStrip gels (pH 4–7, 13-cm length; Amersham Biosciences) for isoelectric focusing as recommended by the manufacturer. Gel strips were then equilibrated in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 2% SDS) and subjected to second dimensional electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with silver nitrate as recommended by the manufacturer and compared for changed spots. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—The gel spots visualized by silver staining were excised, followed by destaining, reduction, and alkylation with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mm iodoacetamide (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). Following dehydration of gel slices with 50% acetonitrile, 2 volumes of freshly prepared trypsin (20 ng/μl in 25 mm NH4HCO3) were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (5%)/acetonitrile (50%) solution in two consecutive steps, dried by vacuum centrifugation, redissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore Corp.). The washed peptides were eluted with saturated matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Mass analysis was carried out on a Voyager-DE™ STR spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) at the Center for Natural Science Research Facilities of Seoul National University. External and internal calibrations were done with a Sequazyme peptide mass standard kit (Perceptive Biosystems) and autolytic trypsin peptides, respectively. For data analysis, the Mascot peptide mass fingerprint program (available at www.matrixscience.com) was used. Cloning of the lys4+ Gene—We generated a PCR fragment containing the entire coding region of the lys4+ gene using the mutagenic forward primer CATCCATATGTCTGTGTCCGAAGC (with the NdeI site underlined) and reverse primer TAAAGGATCCAGCACTTGCAACG (with the BamHI site underlined). The 1.26-kb NdeI/BamHI-cut lys4+ gene was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of the pAEP1 expression vector, a pREP1-based vector with the adh1+ promoter preceding the cloning site. Homocitrate Synthase Activity Assay—A classical method for measuring HCS activity was employed with slight modifications (27Gray G.S. Bhattacharjee J.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1976; 22: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Jaklitsch W.M. Kubicek C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were obtained by vortexing cells with glass beads (0.5 mm). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. It was then dialyzed twice for 3 h each against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol to remove small thiol compounds that could interfere with the HCS activity assay utilizing 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Cell extracts containing 200 μg of proteins were incubated in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer containing 0.5 mm acetyl-CoA and 50 mm α-ketoglutaric acid in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of absolute ethanol, followed by 0.5 ml of 5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The amount of CoA generated by HCS reaction was indirectly measured by its reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, which was then quantified by its absorbance at 412 nm (ϵ = 13,600/mol/cm). One unit of enzyme is defined as the activity that produces 1 nmol of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid/min. The same cell extract sample containing 20 μg of proteins was analyzed for the amount of Lys4 (HCS) protein by Western blot analysis using anti-Lys4 polyclonal antibody raised in mice. Preparation of Total RNA and Northern Hybridization—Total cellular RNA was prepared as described by Schmitt et al. (29Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Each RNA sample (7 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 18% formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and fixed with a UV cross-linker. Hybridization was performed with the PCR-generated lys4+ probe in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Lack of CuZn-SOD Causes Auxotrophy for Lysine and Cysteine/Methionine—It has been suggested previously that the sod1+ gene encoding CuZn-SOD is absolutely required for the proliferation of S. pombe cells (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mutoh et al. (8Mutoh M. Nakagawa C.W. Yamada K. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that its absence causes auxotrophy for lysine and cysteine or methionine as judged by random spore analysis. To resolve this controversy, we created a sod1 null mutation in a diploid cell (ED665/ED668) using the ura4+ cassette. Ura+ heterozygous cells (sod1+/sod1Δ::ura4+) were selected and induced to sporulate for tetrad analysis. Of 15 asci tested, 12 exhibited similar spore growth patterns, generating two large (normal) and two small (slow growing) colonies on YES plates, suggesting that the sod1 disruption causes poor growth even in rich medium (data not shown). When each colony grown on a YES plate was streaked onto an EMM plate without uracil, no growth was observed, suggesting that the sod1 null mutant (with the ura4+ marker) requires some growth supplements. When cysteine and lysine were added to the EMM plate, two colony streaks from each ascus grew (Fig. 1), consistent with the observation by Mutoh et al. (8Mutoh M. Nakagawa C.W. Yamada K. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that the sod1 mutation causes auxotrophy for lysine and cysteine. Methionine, cysteine, or lysine alone did not support growth on EMM plates. We confirmed that the cells grown on lysine- and cysteine-supplemented EMM plates in the absence of uracil were indeed sod1 null mutants with ura4+ cassettes by Southern hybridization and activity estimation of CuZn-SOD (data not shown). When sod1 null mutants were grown anaerobically, they grew as well as the wild type, exhibiting no requirement for lysine and sulfurous amino acids. This indicates that the auxotrophy is caused by oxidative damage, as observed in S. cerevisiae (6Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the sod1 null mutants grew very slowly even in rich or supplemented minimal medium with an extended lag and slow growth rate, we employed a repressible sod1+ strain (JL46, nmt1-sod1+) that expresses the sod1+ gene under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (7Lee J. Kwon E.-S. Kim D.W. Cha J. Roe J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for further analyses. As shown in Fig. 2A, JL46 cells required cysteine and lysine to grow efficiently on thiamine-containing EMM plates. Addition of lysine alone slightly increased growth, whereas cysteine alone did not, suggesting that lysine is more limiting than cysteine in CuZn-SOD-depleted S. pombe under the growth conditions employed. In liquid EMM, cell growth was also retarded by adding thiamine (Fig. 2B). Growth retardation was completely relieved by adding lysine, but not cysteine. Considering that O2 partial pressure is lower in liquid than on plate cultures, these results support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway for lysine is more labile and damaged than that for sulfurous amino acids under pro-oxidative conditions, as occur in CuZn-SOD-depleted cells. Multicopy Suppression of CuZn-SOD Deficiency by phx1+—To identify genes related to superoxide-mediated damage and protection in CuZn-SOD-deficient cells, we screened for multicopy suppressors of the poor growth phenotype of strain JL46 on thiamine-containing plates by introducing the S. pombe genomic library into strain JL46. The transformants that acquired either the sod1+ or thi1+ gene, which allowed sod1+ expression in the presence of thiamine and thus restored normal levels of CuZn-SOD activity, were excluded. Of several suppressor clones, one clone showed a pronounced effect. This clone contained a gene encoding a putative homeodomain protein, thus named phx1+ for pombe homeobox gene. It encodes a large protein of 942 amino acids (103,986 Da), with the conserved homeobox domain near the N terminus. When the phx1+ gene cloned into the pWH5 vector was reintroduced into strain JL46, it enhanced growth of JL46 cells on EMM plates containing thiamine (Fig. 3A). In liquid EMM culture with thiamine, the multicopy phx1+ gene restored growth of strain JL46 significantly, but to a lesser extent than that achieved by adding lysine (Fig. 3B). Enhanced Production of Homocitrate Synthase in Phx1-overproducing Cells—As an initial attempt to determine the mechanism by which Phx1 suppresses growth defects in CuZn-SOD-deficient cells, we compared the proteomes of the control and Phx1-overproducing cells by two-dimensional PAGE. Multiple protein spots were affected by Phx1 overproduction, and they were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. One of the spots that greatly increased in Phx1-overproducing cells was identified as the lys4+ gene product, a putative HCS (Fig. 4A) (21Ye Z.H. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5968-5970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCS catalyzes the first step in the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis common in fungi and some bacteria (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody against recombinant Lys4 protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed that the amount of Lys4 protein was enhanced by >5-fold in Phx1-overproducing cells compared with control cells harboring the parental vector only (data not shown). These results suggest that the mechanism by which Phx1 suppresses lysine auxotrophy in Sod1-deficient cells involves provision of lysine by overproducing the Lys4 protein, a putative HCS. Suppression of Lysine Auxotrophy by Overproducing Lys4—S. pombe harbors only one gene (lys4+) predicted to encode HCS. We tested whether overproduction of Lys4 suppresses the lysine auxotrophy caused by CuZn-SOD deficiency as predicted. The lys4+ gene was cloned downstream of the strong adh1 promoter in the expression vector pAEP1 (derived from pREP1), and the resulting plasmid (pAEP-lys4+) was introduced into strain JL46 (nmt1-sod1+). HCS enzyme activity in Lys4-overproducing cells was ∼20 times higher than that in control cells (with the parental vector only), confirming that the lys4+ gene indeed encodes HCS in S. pombe (data not shown). We then monitored the effect of Lys4 overproduction on the growth of JL46 cells in liquid EMM with thiamine. Fig. 5A demonstrates that, whereas growth of JL46 cells with the parental vector was inhibited by thiamine in liquid EMM, growth of cells with pAEP1-lys4+ was not, indicating that overproduction of HCS reverses growth defects caused by CuZn-SOD depletion. On EMM plates in the presence of thiamine, the multicopy lys4+ gene enhanced proliferation of JL46 cells as expected (Fig. 5B). Addition of lysine did not further enhance growth, indicating that the growth enhancement by Lys4 overproduction is indeed through restoration of lysine prototrophy. Addition of cysteine further enhanced growth as expected, consistent with the results of Figs. 1 and 2A. Decrease in Homocitrate Synthase Activity in CuZn-SOD-depleted Growth-retarded Cells—To investigate whether HCS activity is impaired in CuZn-SOD-depleted cells, we monitored changes in HCS activity upon CuZn-SOD depletion. JL46 cells were grown in liquid EMM in the absence or presence of thiamine. Cell-free extracts were prepared at 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27 h after inoculation, during which time growth retardation was observed in the presence of thiamine. In control cells grown in the absence of thiamine and thus containing normal levels of CuZn-SOD, HCS activity increased as cells grew. In contrast, HCS activity in CuZn-SOD-depleted cells decreased dramatically as incubation continued (Fig. 6A). To test whether these changes in enzyme activity result from changes in transcript levels, the lys4+ transcripts were monitored by Northern analysis, and no significant change was observed (data not shown). The level of Lys4 protein was then examined by Western analysis. Fig. 6B demonstrates that the amount of Lys4 protein in CuZn-SOD-depleted cells was significantly lowered and continued to decrease with incubation. In contrast, in healthy growing cells, the Lys4 protein level was maintained at a higher level and increased as culture continued. The overall protein profile of all samples examined did not change significantly as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. This excludes the possibility that the decrease in Lys4 in growth-retarded CuZn-SOD-depleted cells is due to global deterioration of proteins (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the decrease in HCS enzyme activity in CuZn-SOD-depleted growth-retarded cells is due to the specific loss of HCS (Lys4) protein, which might reflect the vulnerability of HCS to reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, and/or its derivatives. Decrease in Homocitrate Synthase in Paraquat-treated Cells—To test whether HCS is indeed vulnerable under superoxide-rich conditions, we treated cells with paraquat, a superoxide generator, and monitored changes in HCS (Fig. 7). Cells were grown in liquid EMM to early exponential phase and treated with 2 mm paraquat. Slight growth retardation was observed in paraquat-treated cells (Fig. 7A). Cell-free extracts were prepared at 2, 4, 6, and 9 h after paraquat treatment and from non-treated cells for comparison. Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of HCS dramatically decreased upon paraquat treatment (Fig. 7B). Neither the lys4+ transcript level (Fig. 7B) nor the total protein profile (data not shown) was affected by paraquat. These results confirm the proposal that HCS is the labile target damaged under superoxide-rich conditions, as in CuZn-SOD-depleted or paraquat-treated cells. We have demonstrated in this study that overproduction of the Lys4 protein, a HCS, overcomes lysine auxotrophy caused by CuZn-SOD deficiency. We also found that the amount of this enzyme is greatly reduced under superoxide-rich (Sod1-depleted or paraquat-treated) conditions in fission yeast. Unlike S. cerevisiae, which contains two genes (LYS20 and LYS21) that encode two isoenzymes of HCS, S. pombe contains only one gene (lys4+) for HCS. HCS contains two conserved CXXXC motifs predicted to be involved in metal binding. Similar motifs are found in S. cerevisiae Sco1p, in which they are involved in Cu(I) ligation and have been implicated in the delivery of copper to cytochrome c oxidase (30Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that HCS may have bound metal, HCS activity is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as o-phenanthroline and α,α′-dipyridyl (27Gray G.S. Bhattacharjee J.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1976; 22: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HCS activity is also inhibited by a sulfhydryl-binding agent, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (27Gray G.S. Bhattacharjee J.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1976; 22: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), implying that metal coordination by sulfhydryl residues is critical for its activity. Our work demonstrates that HCS is a labile target that is damaged under superoxide-rich conditions. Exposure of some proteins to ROS has been reported to cause structural modification, resulting in proteolytic degradation (32Wolff S.P. Garner A. Dean R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 33Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Savitsky P.A. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20535-20540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the case of the cell cycle-regulating phosphatase Cdc25C, H2O2 destabilizes the protein, most likely by modification of its critical cysteine residue (34Savitsky P.A. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20535-20540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Alternatively, proteins can be fragmented by hydroxyl radicals produced from H2O2 in the presence of transition metals such as Cu(I) and Fe(II) by the Fenton reaction (32Wolff S.P. Garner A. Dean R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals generated within the metal-binding protein may react with the protein, resulting in fragmentation of nonrandom lengths. Further study is necessary to reveal the mechanism of HCS sensitivity to ROS. Considering various modulators of HCS activity such as activators (acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate) and inhibitors (lysine and CoA) (35Tracy J.W. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1802-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), an indirect effect of ROS on changing the level and/or ratio of these modulators needs to also be assessed. The recent observation by microarray analysis that the lys4+ gene in S. pombe is induced by H2O2 is intriguing (available at www.sanger.ac.uk/perl/SPGE/geexview). This suggests that more Lys4 is needed under oxidative stress condition and supports our hypothesis that it is a labile target of oxidative stress that needs to be replenished for survival under such conditions. In S. cerevisiae, it has been proposed that homoaconitase, the second enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathway in fungi (Fig. 4B), is the superoxide-labile target (20Wallace M.A. Liou L.-L. Martins J. Clement M.H.S. Bailey S. Longo V.D. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that enzymes that contain solvent-exposed 4Fe-4S clusters are labile to superoxide-specific damages (37Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and homoaconitase, a sequence homolog of aconitase containing superoxide-labile 4Fe-4S clusters, could be a vulnerable target. However, there still remains a possibility that another enzyme(s) in the lysine biosynthetic pathway could be inactivated by superoxide in S. cerevisiae because lysine is synthesized normally in manganese-containing SOD-deficient mutants, in which the level of homoaconitase is greatly reduced as in CuZn-SOD-deficient mutants (20Wallace M.A. Liou L.-L. Martins J. Clement M.H.S. Bailey S. Longo V.D. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that homoaconitase may not be the rate-limiting enzyme in lysine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. In S. pombe, we were not able to suppress lysine auxotrophy by overproducing the Lys2 protein, a putative homoaconitase (data not shown). If homoaconitase is also critically inactivated in CuZn-SOD-depleted S. pombe cells, provision of its substrates by HCS would not rescue lysine auxotrophy, as we observed in this study. Therefore, whether homoaconitase is damaged or not by superoxide or its derivatives, it is not likely that it is the critically damaged target causing lysine auxotrophy in the sod1 mutant of S. pombe. The subcellular localization of HCS in S. cerevisiae has been in dispute for some time. Both HCS isoenzymes of S. cerevisiae have been shown to localize mainly in the nucleus using monoclonal antibodies against nuclear proteins (38Chen S. Brockenbrough S. Dove J.E. Aris J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10839-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and HCS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins (39Feller A. Ramos F. Pierard A. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, in Penicillium chrysogenum, HCS enzyme activity has been detected in both mitochondrial and cytosolic cell extracts (28Jaklitsch W.M. Kubicek C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and has been reported to reside primarily in the cytoplasm when detected by GFP fusion proteins (40Banuelos O. Casqueiro J. Steidl S. Gutierrez S. Brakhage A. Martin J.F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). By sequence analysis (available at psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp), the HCS of S. pombe is predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein with marginal 57% probability. According to our preliminary observations, different results are obtained depending on the detection methods. When fluorescence from the HCS-GFP fusion gene is monitored by microscopy, HCS is distributed evenly throughout the cell. Detection by antibody against GFP also provides similar results. On the other hand, when HCS itself is detected by Western analysis, it resides primarily in the non-cytosolic fraction. 5E.-S. Kwon, unpublished data. This discrepancy suggests that GFP fusion to the C terminus of HCS could have perturbed subcellular localization in S. pombe, and we need to take precautions when interpreting GFP fusion data. Further systematic investigation to elucidate the exact distribution of HCS in S. pombe is necessary. If we accept the Western results detecting HCS directly, it appears that most of the HCS resides in a different location compared with cytosolic Sod1. However, the difference between the localizations of Sod1 and HCS does not contradict the model that HCS is the target of pro-oxidative damage caused by Sod1 deficiency. Because protein synthesis, folding, and targeting all occur in the cytosol, accumulation of ROS in the cytosol of Sod1-deficient cells can affect nearly all labile target proteins, including organellar proteins, before they reach their destination. In budding yeast, it had been proposed that the cysteine/methionine auxotrophy of the sod1 mutant is due to its hypersensitivity to sulfite, producing a sulfur trioxy radical (SO–3) (41Chang E.C. Kosman D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But more recently, a metabolic connection between Sod1p (CuZn-SOD) and the pentose phosphate pathway has been suggested (42Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) based on the observation that the aerobic methionine auxotrophy of the sod1 mutant was fully rescued by overexpression of transketolase (Tkl1p) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p), which can provide NADPH to PAPS reductase and/or sulfite reductase in the sulfurous amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Overproduction of Phx1 could also partially suppress the cysteine auxotrophy of the sod1 mutant in fission yeast in aerobic plate cultures. It can be proposed that Phx1 serves as a global regulator to respond against pro-oxidative conditions. In addition to its homology to Hox proteins with DNA-binding homeodomains, its overproduction causes changes in multiple proteins as observed by two-dimensional PAGE and confers resistance to various oxidants. 5E.-S. Kwon, unpublished data. The investigation of genes that are regulated by Phx1 is expected to provide further clues toward understanding the mechanism of ROS toxicity in yeast and other eukaryotes."

The results were then compared with those that were obtained with the well characterized SSB protein from Escherichia coli, SsbEc. In the absence of Mg2+, the results indicated that the SsbEc protein was able to bind to the dTn oligomers in the SSB35 mode, with only two of the four subunits of the tetramer interacting with the dTn oligomers. In the presence of Mg2+, however, the results indicated that the SsbEc protein was bound to the dTn oligomers in the SSB65 mode, with all four subunits of the tetramer interacting with the dTn oligomers. The SsbA protein behaved similarly to the SsbEc protein under all conditions, indicating that it undergoes Mg2+-dependent changes in its DNA binding modes that are analogous to those of the SsbEc protein. The SsbB protein, in contrast, appeared to bind to the dTn oligomers in an SSB65-like mode in either the presence or the absence of Mg2+, suggesting that it may not exhibit the pronounced negative intrasubunit cooperativity in the absence of Mg2+ that is required for the formation of the SSB35 mode. Additional experiments with a chimeric SsbA/B protein indicated that the structural determinants that govern the transitions between the different DNA binding modes may be contained within the N-terminal domains of the SSB proteins.

The naturally transformable Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae has two single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) 2The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. 2The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. proteins, designated SsbA and SsbB (Fig. 1). The SsbA protein is similar in size to the extensively studied SSB protein from Escherichia coli, SsbEc, a homotetrameric, non-sequence-specific, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein that is involved in many aspects of DNA metabolism in E. coli (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The SsbB protein, in contrast, is a smaller protein that is specifically induced during natural transformation in S. pneumoniae (3Peterson S.N. Cline R.T. Tettelin H. Sharov V. Morrison D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6192-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Peterson S.N. Sung C.K. Cline R. Desai B.V. Snesrud E.C. Luo P. Walling J. Li H. Mintz M. Tsegaye G. Burr P.C. Do Y. Ahn S. Gilbert J. Fleischmann R.D. Morrison D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1051-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the SsbA protein may serve as a general SSB protein involved in routine DNA functions (analogous to the SsbEc protein) and that the SsbB protein may be a specialized SSB protein used primarily during natural transformation. Consistent with this idea, a recent survey revealed that those naturally transformable Gram-positive bacteria that are related to S. pneumoniae generally have two ssb-like genes, whereas the non-naturally transformable Gram-negative bacteria that are related to E. coli have only a single ssb gene (5Lindner C. Nijland R. van Hartskamp M. Bron S. Hamoen L.W. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have recently amplified the ssbA and ssbB genes from S. pneumoniae genomic DNA, developed efficient expression systems, and purified the SsbA and SsbB proteins to apparent homogeneity (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Hedayati M.A. Grove D.E. Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our initial investigations, we found that the SsbA and SsbB proteins, like the SsbEc protein, formed stable homotetramers in solution (7Grove D.E. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11067-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, although the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA protein appeared to be similar to those of the SsbEc protein, the ssDNA binding characteristics of the SsbB protein were quite different. For example, although the SsbB protein was able to bind to the shorter oligomer dT50 with an affinity similar to that of the SsbEc and SsbA proteins, our results indicated that two SsbEc or SsbA tetramers were able to bind to the longer oligomer dT75, whereas only a single SsbB tetramer was able to bind to this ssDNA. The apparent differences in the stoichiometries of binding to dT75 and other longer oligomers indicated that the SsbB protein interacts with ssDNA in a manner different from that of the SsbEc and SsbA proteins (7Grove D.E. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11067-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ssDNA binding properties of the SsbEc protein have been shown to exhibit a complex dependence on solution conditions (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In general, at lower DNA binding densities and higher monovalent or divalent salt concentrations, the SsbEc protein binds in either the SSB56 or the SSB65 mode in which all four subunits of the tetramer interact with ssDNA, occluding ∼56 or 65 nucleotides of ssDNA/tetramer, respectively (since the physical distinction between the SSB56 and SSB65 modes is not clear, they will be referred to collectively here as the SSB65 mode). At higher DNA binding densities and lower salt concentrations, however, the SsbEc protein can bind in the SSB35 mode in which only two subunits of the tetramer interact with ssDNA, occluding ∼35 nucleotides of ssDNA/tetramer (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Our initial analysis of the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA and SsbB proteins was based on polyacrylamide gel shift assays that were carried out using the standard gel electrophoresis running buffer, TBE (Tris borate (pH 8.5)/EDTA) (7Grove D.E. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11067-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, SSB proteins have been found to act as accessory factors for a variety of enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, many of which are dependent on Mg2+ for activity. We have therefore examined the effect of Mg2+ on the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA and SsbB proteins. The ssDNA binding reactions were carried out in a typical enzyme reaction buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5)) with various concentrations of magnesium acetate, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels that contained the same buffer and magnesium acetate concentrations as in the reaction solutions. The results of this analysis have led to an explanation for the previously observed differences in the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA and SsbB proteins. In addition, a new chimeric SSB protein was prepared as a first step toward identifying the structural basis for the differences in the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA and SsbB proteins. Materials—S. pneumoniae SsbA protein (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and SsbB protein (6Hedayati M.A. Grove D.E. Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. E. coli SSB protein was from Promega. dTn oligomers were from Invitrogen; 32P-end-labeled dTn oligomers were prepared using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). G-250 BioSafe Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein gel stain was from Bio-Rad. dTn concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient 8.4 mm–1 cm–1 (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Chimeric SsbA/B Protein—A NruI restriction site was introduced into each of the previously described pETssbA (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and pETssbB constructs (6Hedayati M.A. Grove D.E. Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (8Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar); the NruI site was designed such that although nucleotide changes were made in the coding sequence of both ssbA and ssbB genes, the corresponding amino acids were not altered. The constructs were then digested with NdeI and NruI to generate fragments encoding the N-terminal region of the SsbA protein (amino acids 1–105) and the C-terminal region of the SsbB protein (amino acids 105–131 plus the pET21a vector), respectively. These fragments were ligated together to give the final construct, pETssbA/B. The insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the anticipated ssbA-(1–105)/ssbB-(105–131) chimeric sequence. The protein encoded by this insert will be referred to as the SsbA/B protein in the results described below. The SsbA/B protein was expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta(DE3)-pLysS (Novagen). Competent Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with pETssbA/B and selected for growth on LB/carbenicillin/chloramphenicol plates. A single Rosetta(DE3)pLysS/pETssbA/B colony was used to inoculate 2× YT broth (10 ml) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and the resulting culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. This overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of 2× YT broth/ampicillin/chloramphenicol medium, and the cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Isopropyl-1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce expression of the SsbA/B protein. After 2.5 h at 37 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in a 2:1 ratio of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm spermidine resuspension buffer to wet cell weight, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell suspension was stored at –80 °C. The SsbA/B protein was purified by a procedure similar to that described previously for the SsbA (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and SsbB proteins (6Hedayati M.A. Grove D.E. Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with the following modification. Instead of utilizing a Polymin P precipitation, the SsbA/B protein was precipitated from the crude lysate fraction with ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 0.25 g/ml. The ammonium sulfate precipitation step was then followed by MonoQ and heparin chromatography steps (1Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Hedayati M.A. Grove D.E. Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).

The binding reactions were carried out in a reaction buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and either 0 or 10 mm magnesium acetate, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels that contained the same buffer and magnesium acetate concentrations as in the reaction solutions. Forward Titrations with dT75—A set of forward titration experiments was carried out in which a fixed concentration of 32P-end-labeled dT75 was incubated with increasing concentrations of SsbEc protein. The complexes that were resolved on the polyacrylamide gels were visualized by autoradiography to monitor the changes in the mobility of the dT75 that occur when it binds to SsbEc protein. When increasing concentrations of SsbEc protein were added to dT75 in the absence of Mg2+, an initial complex with a gel mobility lower than that of unbound dT75 was formed at the lower protein concentrations (Fig. 2). A further increase in the concentration of SsbEc protein resulted in the disappearance of this initial complex and the appearance of a second complex of even lower gel mobility (Fig. 2). These results are similar to those that were obtained previously using the TBE buffer system and indicated that two tetramers of SsbEc protein were able to bind to dT75 at the higher protein concentrations in the absence of Mg2+ (7Grove D.E. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11067-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A different result was obtained when increasing concentrations of SsbEc protein were added to dT75 in the presence of Mg2+ (10 mm) (Fig. 2). In this case, an initial complex was again formed at the lower protein concentrations. However, in contrast to the results that were obtained in the absence of Mg2+, there was no indication of the formation of the second complex in the presence of Mg2+, even at the highest concentration of SsbEc protein examined (Fig. 2). These results indicated that only a single tetramer of SsbEc protein was able to bind to dT75 in the presence of Mg2+. These results suggested that in the absence of Mg2+, the SsbEc protein was able to bind to dT75 in the previously described SSB35 mode, with two of the four subunits of each of the two bound tetramers interacting with the dT75 (occluding 35 nucleotides/tetramer), whereas in the presence of Mg2+, the SsbEc protein was binding to dT75 in the SSB65 mode, with all four subunits of a single tetramer interacting with the dT75 (occluding 65 nucleotides) (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Reverse Titrations with dT35—A complementary set of reverse titration experiments was carried out using the oligomer, dT35, which is only long enough to bind to two of the four subunits of the SsbEc tetramer (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In these reactions, a fixed concentration of SsbEc protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of dT35. The complexes that were resolved on the polyacrylamide gels were visualized by protein staining to monitor the changes in the mobility of the SsbEc protein that occur when it binds to dT35. When the SsbEc protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of dT35 in the absence of Mg2+, a new band with a gel mobility greater than that of the free SsbEc protein was formed (Fig. 3). A parallel reverse titration experiment that was carried out using 32P-end-labeled dT35 confirmed that the new band corresponded to an SsbEc-(dT35)n complex (gel not shown). The concentration of dT35 that was required to convert the free SsbEc protein to the complex corresponded to approximately one dT35 molecule/tetramer of SsbEc protein. These results indicated that in the absence of Mg2+, the SsbEc tetramer was able to bind a single dT35 molecule (through two of the four subunits of the tetramer) to form an SsbEc-dT35 complex (the additional negative charges that are contributed by the phosphoryl groups of the bound dT35 presumably increase the mobility of the SsbEc-dT35 complex relative to that of the free SsbEc protein). A different result was obtained when the SsbEc protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of dT35 in the presence of Mg2+ (10 mm) (Fig. 3). In this case, an initial complex was formed at the same concentration of dT35 that was observed for the formation of the SsbEc-dT35 complex in the absence of Mg2+. However, in contrast to the results that were obtained in the absence of Mg2+, a further increase in the concentration of dT35 resulted in the disappearance of the first complex and the appearance of a new band with even greater gel mobility (Fig. 3). A parallel reverse titration experiment that was carried out using end-labeled dT35 confirmed that both the first and the second bands corresponded to SsbEc-(dT35)n complexes and that the second complex contained approximately twice as much dT35 as the first (gel not shown). These results indicated that in the presence of Mg2+, the SsbEc tetramer was able to bind two dT35 molecules (through all four subunits of the tetramer) to form an SsbEc-(dT35)2 complex (the additional negative charges contributed by the phosphoryl groups of the second dT35 presumably increase the mobility of the doubly liganded complex relative to that of the singly liganded complex). The results of the reverse titrations were consistent with those from the forward titrations and indicated that the SsbEc protein was able to bind to the dTn oligomers in the SSB35 mode (with two of four subunits interacting with dTn) in the absence of Mg2+ and in the SSB65 mode (with all four subunits interacting with dTn) in the presence of Mg2+ (10 mm). These results are consistent with previous fluorescence studies of the SsbEc protein (see “Discussion”) and indicated that the Mg2+-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method described here could be used to analyze the binding modes of the SsbA and SsbB proteins. Forward and reverse titration experiments analogous to those described above for the SsbEc protein were used to analyze the DNA binding modes of the SsbA protein. Forward Titrations with dT75—When increasing concentrations of SsbA protein were added to 32P-end-labeled dT75 in the absence of Mg2+, an initial complex with a gel mobility lower than that of unbound dT75 was formed at the lower protein concentrations (Fig. 4). A further increase in the concentration of SsbA protein resulted in a decrease in this initial complex and the appearance of a second complex of even lower gel mobility (Fig. 4). These results were similar to those that were obtained for the SsbEc protein (Fig. 2) and to those that were obtained previously for the SsbA protein using the TBE buffer system (7Grove D.E. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11067-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and indicated that two tetramers of SsbA protein were able to bind to dT75 in the absence of Mg2+. When increasing concentrations of SsbA protein were added to dT75 in the presence of Mg2+, an initial complex was again formed at the lower protein concentrations (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to the results that were obtained in the absence of Mg2+, there was no indication of the formation of the second complex in the presence of Mg2+, even at the highest concentration of SsbA protein examined (Fig. 4). These results were again similar to those that were obtained for the SsbEc protein (Fig. 2) and indicated that only one tetramer of SsbA protein was able to bind to dT75 in the presence of Mg2+. Reverse Titrations with dT35—When the SsbA protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of dT35 in the absence of Mg2+, a single complex with a gel mobility greater than that of the free SsbA protein was formed (Fig. 5). These results were similar to those that were obtained with the SsbEc protein (Fig. 3) and indicated that in the absence of Mg2+, the SsbA tetramer was able to readily bind a single dT35 molecule to form an SsbA-dT35 complex (the slight increase in the apparent mobility of this complex at higher dT35 concentrations suggests that a second dT35 may bind weakly to the SsbA protein under these conditions). When the SsbA protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of dT35 in the presence of Mg2+, an initial complex was formed at the same concentration of dT35 that was observed for the formation of the SsbA-dT35 complex in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). However, in contrast to the results that were obtained in the absence of Mg2+, a further increase in the concentration of dT35 resulted in the disappearance of the first complex and the appearance of a new complex with even greater gel mobility (Fig. 5). These results were again similar to those that were obtained with the SsbEc protein (Fig. 3"
