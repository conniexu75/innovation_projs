https://openalex.org/W2118266480,"Abstract Hormonal control of the initial step in hepatic gluconeogenesis from pyruvate was examined following acute administration of epinephrine, glucagon, or cortisol to adult rats. After hormonal treatment of the animals, the mitochondria were isolated for the study of pyruvate metabolism. When pyruvate and bicarbonate were the only substrates provided, mitochondrial fixation of carbon dioxide and production of acetyl coenzyme A accounted for the entire uptake of pyruvate. Although none of the three hormones raised the activity of mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase, each increased mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and secondarily enhanced both CO2 fixation and pyruvate-1-14C decarboxylation. The primary role of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake was confirmed by reducing the osmolality of the suspending medium during incubation of mitochondria with substrate. Increasing mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate by this means enhanced both fixation of CO2 and decarboxylation of pyruvate-1-14C, while reducing the observable effect of hormone. Apparently the rate of pyruvate transfer into mitochondria is of primary importance in the control of mitochondrial CO2 fixation."

https://openalex.org/W1538363759,"Abstract A procedure for the purification of highly purified l-histidine ammonia lyase is described. The enzyme exists in both an oxidized and reduced form. These forms are interconvertible and separable by electrophoresis. Studies with inhibitors suggest that the enzyme interacts with the substrate specifically through the carboxyl and amino groups and the imidazole moiety. Effective inhibitors contain functional groups corresponding to these three binding sites, while compounds with only two of the functional groups are poor inhibitors. A notable exception is glycine, which is a strong inhibitor. It was postulated that the binding of the substrate, as well as those inhibitors which contain a carbon atom corresponding to the β carbon atom of histidine, involves strain or distortion induced by the enzyme. Therefore in the case of glycine, where no distortion is possible, the two functional groups provide sufficient interaction energy for binding to the enzyme. It was also shown that H(s). bound to the β carbon atom of histidine, is eliminated in the conversion to urocanic acid, and it was concluded that histidine ammonia lyase catalyzes a trans-elimination. Exposure of the enzyme to nitromethane leads to loss of catalytic activity and to the covalent binding of approximately 2 moles of nitromethane per mole of enzyme. The extent of inactivation by nitromethane can be reduced by the addition of substrate or inhibitors, suggesting that nitromethane reacts at the active site. After catalytic reduction and acid hydrolysis of the nitromethane-inactivated enzyme, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 4-amino-2-hydroxybutyric acid, and β-alanine were isolated. It is tentatively proposed that nitromethane reacts with a dehydroalanine residue at the active site, and that the amino group of the dehydroalanine residue forms a Schiff base to a carbonyl compound that is as yet unidentified."

https://openalex.org/W1809209698,Abstract Preparations of highly purified Pseudomonas histidine ammonia lyase were inactivated by reduction with sodium borotritide. Alanine was the only labeled material in acid hydrolysates of the dialyzed product. Its presence indicates the presence of dehydroalanine (2-aminoacrylic acid) in the enzyme. There was approximately 0.9 mole of labeled alanine per mole of enzyme. Enzyme inactivation and tritium incorporation into alanine were largely prevented by the presence of histidine. This result suggests that dehydroalanine is at the active site of histidine ammonia lyase.
https://openalex.org/W1633565009,"Abstract Coenzyme A thiol esters of the complete series of positional isomers of cis-methylene octadecanoic acid were synthesized. Their activities as substrates for acyl-CoA: phospholipid acyltransferases of rat liver microsomes were determined with positional isomers of acylglycerophosphoryl choline and acylglycerophosphoryl ethanolamine as acceptors. The results showed that the acyltransferases discriminated between the acyl-CoA isomers in quite different ways. Certain acyl-CoA esters were transferred at much different rates with different acylglycerophospholipid acceptors, suggesting that different enzymes were acting with the different acceptors. Comparison of the rates of cis-cyclopropane acid derivatives and cis-octadecenoic acid derivatives showed that the presence of π bonds in the acyl residue is not an important factor for the enzyme or enzymes transferring cis-acyl groups to the 1 position of acylglycerophospholipids. On the other hand, the presence of a π bond can cause higher or lower transfer rates to the 2-hydroxyl depending upon the location of the cis-functional group along the acyl chain."

https://openalex.org/W1565798058,"Abstract Preparation of a soluble, highly purified S-adenosylmethionine-dependent sterol methyltransferase from yeast subcellular particles is described. The solubilized enzyme has been purified over 600-fold by a number of procedures. Transmethylation yields stoichiometric amounts of zymosterol consumption and of 24-methylene-dihydrozymosterol (fecosterol) formation. Fecosterol has been identified by a variety of physical and chemical methods. Glutathione, Mg++, and a neutral pH are requirements for maximal activity of the methyltransferase. The value for Km for zymosterol is 6.2 x 10-5 m. The enzyme is stable during storage as an ammonium sulfate precipitate at -25°. Additional properties of the enzyme are described."

Although the protein shell of the nucleoprotein is similar to, if not identical to that of tobacco ringspot virus, each ahell of the nucleoprotein conntains many small strands of nucleic acid, which replicate only in mixed infections with the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1509473532,"Abstract Aminoacyltransferase II is one of the two soluble protein factors required for polypeptide biosynthesis from aminoacyl transfer RNA with rat liver preparations. This transfer factor and guanosine triphosphate are required for the translocation of messenger RNA and peptidyl transfer RNA from the aminoacyl to the peptidyl site on ribosomes. A method for the purification of the translocation factor has been devised. After the resolution of the translocase from the other transfer factor (aminoacyltransferase I) on hydroxylapatite, the translocase is chromatographed on cellulose phosphate and DEAESephadex columns and then subjected to electrophoresis in an electrofocusing (sucrose density-pH gradient) apparatus. The final product seems to be homogenous on acrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. A molecular weight estimate of 60,000 to 65,000 has been made. Specific activities, up to 1,000-fold higher than that of the pH 5 supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates, the starting material for these studies, have been obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1597288837,"The glycopeptides of purified bovine thyrotropic and luteinizing (interstitial cell-stimulating) hormones have been obtained by tryptic digestion of their reduced and S-carboxymethylated derivatives. A combination of gel filtration and countercurrent distribution yielded, in each case, fractions which were almost exclusively glycopeptides. Three different types of glycopeptides were in this fraction from thyroid-stimulating hormone, two of which were easily isolated. Their amino acid compositions and partial sequences are: Val-Glx-Asx-(Ser, Thr2, Glx, Cys3, His2)-(Tyr2, His)-Lys and Asx-Ile-(Ser, Thr2, Glx, Cys2, Ala2, Val)-Lys. These glycopeptides have amino acid compositions identical or nearly identical with those of the two tryptic glycopeptides from 1 of the 2 subunits of bovine-luteinizing hormone and are also very similar in compositions and partial sequences to the same peptides from ovine luteinizing hormone previously reported by Ward and his colleagues (Proceedings of the Third International Congress of Endocrinology, 1968). Considerable homology thus may exist between thyroid-stimulating hormone and one chain of luteinizing hormone in regions adjacent to two oligosaccharides, and peptide maps suggest that the similarity extends to other regions. A third glycopeptide from thyroid-stimulating hormone was more difficult to purify completely. Its probable amino acid composition is: Asx, Thr4, Gly, Ala, Cys3, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Arg. This peptide does not seem related to the third tryptic glycopeptide of luteinizing hormone, which originates from its other subunit. Each type of thyrotropin glycopeptide contains glucosamine, galactosamine, and mannose. A fraction of a residue of fucose is found in preparations of each type and, in one type, a fraction of a residue of galactose. The yields of these glycopeptides are consistent with attachment of 3 oligosaccharide units to each molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1535224948,"Abstract The solid phase technique of peptide synthesis has been used to study structural features related to the activity of Fragment P2 (Residues 6 through 48) of nuclease-T. Binding of synthetic analogues to the complimentary native Fragment P3 (Residues 49 through 149) may be detected by affinity chromatography upon an agarose column containing covalently bound P3. Binding in free solution was detected by changes in the fluorescence spectrum of the single tryptophan residue in P3. Previous studies have shown that the synthetic 6-47 peptide, after purification by specific binding to an agarose P3 column, can generate approximately 30% of the maximum enzymic activity when added in an equivalent molar quantity to Fragment P3 Deletion of the NH2-terminal tripeptide from synthetic P2 (yielding synthetic 9-47) leaves both binding and activating abilities intact. Two shorter analogues, synthetic 18-47 and synthetic 33-47, have no activity, although the 18-47 analogue appears to retain some binding affinity for native P3. The methionine residues at positions 26 and 32 may be replaced by norleucine to give an analogue capable of both binding to and activating P3. Replacement of glutamic acid by glutamine at position 43 leads to an inactive derivative which retains its ability to bind specifically to Fragment P3."
https://openalex.org/W1547049055,"Abstract Two highly purified preparations of bovine thrombin with the same specific activities and amino acid compositions were examined by the techniques of electrophoresis, sedimentation-equilibrium, and gel filtration in 6 m guanidinium chloride. One of the preparations which contained two electrophoretic components in the ratio of 5:95% appeared to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and gave a molecular weight of 28,000 ± 1,400. Similar studies performed on the fully reduced, carboxymethylated protein gave a lower molecular weight and indications of polydispersity. Gel filtration of the fully reduced and carboxymethylated protein revealed the presence of five polypeptide components with molecular weights ranging from approximately 33,000 to 6,000. The components present in greatest amount had molecular weights of approximately 21,000, 10,000, and 14,000. A second thrombin preparation, which contained the same electrophoretic components as the first, but in the ratio of 60:40%, was analyzed in the same fashion. The molecular weight of this sample obtained prior to reduction of the protein was 36,700. Gel filtration of the reduced, carboxymethylated protein revealed the presence of the same polypeptide components present in the previously described sample. However, in this preparation, the component present in greatest quantity had a molecular weight of approximately 33,000. These studies suggest that thrombin activation proceeds through cleavage of prothrombin to a continuous polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 33,000. Two subsequent cleavages may occur in this chain which result in active thrombin molecules composed of two (21,000 and 10,000) and three (14,000, 6,000, and 10,000) polypeptide chains interconnected by disulfide bridges."

https://openalex.org/W1596367871,"Abstract 1-Cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4)-ethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMC) was shown to inactivate α-chymotrypsin. The close correspondence between efficiency and all or none assays during the inactivation reaction shows that CMC reacts with α-chymotrypsin to produce a derivative completely devoid of catalytic activity and that inactivation is probably caused by a reaction between CMC and a single aminoacyl residue on the enzyme. The dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant for inactivation on the concentration of CMC and indole indicates that CMC interacts with the substrate-binding site of α-chymotrypsin and forms an adsorption complex with the enzyme before the inactivation reaction. At pH 7 and 25°, the first order rate constant (k2) for the formation of inactivated enzyme from the adsorption complex is 0.10 min-1, and the dissociation constant (Kd) for the adsorption complex is 0.013 m. The following results secured the conclusion that a seryl residue at the active site of α-chymotrypsin adds to CMC or 14C-CMC (1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4)-ethyl)carbodiimide metho-14C-p-toluenesulfonate) to form a catalytically inactive isoureylene derivative of the enzyme (CMC-chymotrypsin or 14C-CMC-chymotrypsin). (a) The inactivation reaction is associated with the incorporation into protein of 1 mole of 14C-CMC per mole of enzyme inactivated. (b) 2-Mercaptoethylamine displaces CMC (probably as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4)-ethyl)ureylene metho-p-toluenesulfonate from CMC-chymotrypsin to yield 1 S-aminoethylcysteinyl residue per inactivated enzyme molecule. (c) On standing in 5% acetic acid, 14C-CMC-chymotrypsin liberates radiochemical label, and the amino group of a seryl residue is exposed. (d) NH2OH reacts with 14C-CMC-chymotrypsin, regenerating active enzyme and liberating radiochemical label from protein in roughly equivalent amounts. (e) 14C-CMC is bound to an active center peptide obtained by digesting 14C-CMC-chymotrypsin with pepsin. In order to establish precedent for the reaction between 2-mercaptoethylamine and CMC-chymotrypsin, O-methylisourea was shown to S-methylate cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1592725280,"The effect of variation of extracellular total CO2 concentration at constant pH on intracellular pH and total intracellular CO2 content and on the conversion of glycerol-1,3-14C and glucose uniformly labeled with 14C to glycogen in perfused rat liver has been studied. The concentration of perfusate CO2 was varied from 8 to 40 m m while pH was maintained between 7.4 and 7.5. At the end of a 60-min perfusion period with perfusate of either CO2 concentration, the intracellular pH remained constant in the range of pH 7.0 to 7.1. Intracellular total CO2 content followed the changes in extracellular total CO2 content but was generally 25% lower than the extracellular concentration. Under similar perfusion conditions, liver glycogen content was increased 30 to 60% and glycerol-1,3-14C conversion to glycogen by 90 to 100% by perfusion with an average total CO2 concentration of 33 m m as compared to 9 m m total CO2 in the presence of 13 m m glycerol and 15 m m glucose as substrate. When the only added substrate was glucose adjusted to 5.6 m m initially, glycogen content was not markedly altered by the CO2 content of the perfusate, but the conversion of glucose uniformly labeled with 14C to glycogen was increased 90% over control values when the liver was perfused the 1st hour with perfusate containing 11 m m CO2 followed by perfusion the 2nd hour with 34 m m CO2. These results suggest that variation in extracellular total CO2 concentration within physiological limits does produce alterations in glycogen metabolism by variation of total intracellular CO2 concentration and not by variation in the average intracellular pH. The results suggest that total intracellular CO2 concentration may be an important physiological regulator of carbohydrate metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1582371909,"The molecular weight of bovine heart supernatant malic dehydrogenase has been determined by sedimentation equilibrium. The enzyme was shown to be a dimer with a molecular weight of 72,000. Upon reaction with maleic anhydride or in the presence of guanidinium chloride, the enzyme was dissociated into two subunits having identical molecular weights of about 37,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. These results were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mapping experiments. The COOH-terminal amino acid residue of both subunits was identified as alanine, and cleavage by carboxypeptidase digestion did not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Circular dichroism measurements showed that the dissociation of the enzyme by maleic anhydride and guanidinium chloride was accompanied by significant amounts of unfolding in the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1548438670,"Abstract The hemoglobin structures from domestic horse, tarpan horse, and przewalski's horse, donkey, and four subspecies of zebra are compared by peptide mapping and specific staining, with limited isolation of peptides followed by amino acid analysis. Peptide mapping techniques are used to indicate the between phenylalanine and tyrosine at amino acid position α-24 in domestic horse. Such ambiguity at this position cannot be found in the α chain of 51 donkey hemoglobin samples, and is not evident in other equine species. Comparison of the hemoglobin polypeptide chains of the equine family reveals striking similarity among the β chains and a limited number of differences among the α chains. The number of amino acid interchanges accounting for species differences in the α chain are small in contrast to the numerous differences occurring in the α chains of the ruminants. Serine is present at position α-15 in the horse, donkey, and Hartmann's zebra hemoglobins, whereas glycine is present at α-15 in all the other zebra subspecies studied. The limited structural differences in the equine genus are contrasted to the recently reported variations which account for the polymorphic hemoglobins of ruminants. The genetic control of the hemoglobins of the horse, based upon three pairs of alleles for the two different α and single β chains is proposed and compared to a nonallelic scheme for sheep hemoglobins. The numerous evolutionarily effective amino acid substitutions seen in ruminant hemoglobins as compared to other species are accentuated by this comparison within the genus Equus."
