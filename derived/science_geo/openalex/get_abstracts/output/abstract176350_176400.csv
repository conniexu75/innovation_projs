https://openalex.org/W2039940539,"DOT1 was originally identified as a gene affecting telomeric silencing in S. cerevisiae. We now find that Dot1p methylates histone H3 on lysine 79, which maps to the top and bottom of the nucleosome core. Methylation occurs only when histone H3 is assembled in chromatin. In vivo, Dot1p is solely responsible for this methylation and methylates approximately 90% of histone H3. In dot1delta cells, silencing is compromised and silencing proteins become redistributed at the expense of normally silenced loci. We suggest that methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 limits silencing to discrete loci by preventing the binding of Sir proteins elsewhere along the genome. Because Dot1p and histone H3 are conserved, similar mechanisms are likely at work in other eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1981829804,"Neurogenesis proceeds throughout life in the higher vocal center (HVC) of the adult songbird neostriatum. Testosterone induces neuronal addition and endothelial division in HVC. We asked if testosterone-induced angiogenesis might contribute importantly to HVC neuronal recruitment. Testosterone upregulated both VEGF and its endothelial receptor, VEGF-R2/Quek1/KDR, in HVC. This yielded a burst in local HVC angiogenesis. FACS-isolated HVC endothelial cells produced BDNF in a testosterone-dependent manner. In vivo, HVC BDNF rose by the third week after testosterone, lagging by over a week the rise in VEGF and VEGF-R2. In situ hybridization revealed that much of this induced BDNF mRNA was endothelial. In vivo, both angiogenesis and neuronal addition to HVC were substantially diminished by inhibition of VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase. These findings suggest a causal interaction between testosterone-induced angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the adult forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W2051718122,"Kit/SCF signaling and Mitf-dependent transcription are both essential for melanocyte development and pigmentation. To identify Mitf-dependent Kit transcriptional targets in primary melanocytes, microarray studies were undertaken. Among identified targets was BCL2, whose germline deletion produces melanocyte loss and which exhibited phenotypic synergy with Mitf in mice. BCL2's regulation by Mitf was verified in melanocytes and melanoma cells and by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BCL2 promoter. Mitf also regulates BCL2 in osteoclasts, and both Mitfmi/mi and Bcl2−/− mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis. Disruption of Mitf in melanocytes or melanoma triggered profound apoptosis susceptible to rescue by BCL2 overexpression. Clinically, primary human melanoma expression microarrays revealed tight nearest neighbor linkage for MITF and BCL2. This linkage helps explain the vital roles of both Mitf and Bcl2 in the melanocyte lineage and the well-known treatment resistance of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2038600671,"In lymphocytes, integration of Ca2+ and other signaling pathways results in productive activation, while unopposed Ca2+ signaling leads to tolerance or anergy. We show that the Ca2+-regulated transcription factor NFAT has an integral role in both aspects of lymphocyte function. Ca2+/calcineurin signaling induces a limited set of anergy-associated genes, distinct from genes induced in the productive immune response; these genes are upregulated in vivo in tolerant T cells and are largely NFAT dependent. T cells lacking NFAT1 are resistant to anergy induction; conversely, NFAT1 induces T cell anergy if prevented from interacting with its transcriptional partner AP-1 (Fos/Jun). Thus, in the absence of AP-1, NFAT imposes a genetic program of lymphocyte anergy that counters the program of productive activation mediated by the cooperative NFAT:AP-1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2164406367,"Myelin inhibitors, including MAG, are major impediments to CNS regeneration. However, CNS axons of DRGs regenerate if the peripheral branch of these neurons is lesioned first. We show that 1 day post-peripheral-lesion, DRG-cAMP levels triple and MAG/myelin no longer inhibit growth, an effect that is PKA dependent. By 1 week post-lesion, DRG-cAMP returns to control, but growth on MAG/myelin improves and is now PKA independent. Inhibiting PKA in vivo blocks the post-lesion growth on MAG/myelin at 1 day and attenuates it at 1 week. Alone, injection of db-cAMP into the DRG mimics completely a conditioning lesion as DRGs grow on MAG/myelin, initially, in a PKA-dependent manner that becomes PKA independent. Importantly, DRG injection of db-cAMP results in extensive regeneration of dorsal column axons lesioned 1 week later. These results may be relevant to developing therapies for spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W1967291020,"Nerves and blood vessels are branched structures, but whether their branching patterns are established independently or coordinately is not clear. Here we show that arteries, but not veins, are specifically aligned with peripheral nerves in embryonic mouse limb skin. Mutations that eliminate peripheral sensory nerves or Schwann cells prevent proper arteriogenesis, while those that disorganize the nerves maintain the alignment of arteries with misrouted axons. In vitro, sensory neurons or Schwann cells can induce arterial marker expression in isolated embryonic endothelial cells, and VEGF(164/120) is necessary and sufficient to mediate this induction. These data suggest that peripheral nerves provide a template that determines the organotypic pattern of blood vessel branching and arterial differentiation in the skin, via local secretion of VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2090389580,"The peripheral branch of primary sensory neurons regenerates after injury, but there is no regeneration when their central branch is severed by spinal cord injury. Here we show that microinjection of a membrane-permeable analog of cAMP in lumbar dorsal root ganglia markedly increases the regeneration of injured central sensory branches. The injured axons regrow into the spinal cord lesion, often traversing the injury site. This result mimics the effect of a conditioning peripheral nerve lesion. We also demonstrate that sensory neurons exposed to cAMP in vivo, when subsequently cultured in vitro, show enhanced growth of neurites and an ability to overcome inhibition by CNS myelin. Thus, stimulating cAMP signaling increases the intrinsic growth capacity of injured sensory axons. This approach may be useful in promoting regeneration after spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2166704790,"Telomere shortening limits the number of cell divisions of primary human cells and might affect the regenerative capacity of organ systems during aging and chronic disease. To test whether the telomere hypothesis applies to human cirrhosis, the telomere length was monitored in cirrhosis induced by a broad variety of different etiologies. Telomeres were significantly shorter in cirrhosis compared with noncirrhotic samples independent of the primary etiology and independent of the age of the patients. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that telomere shortening was restricted to hepatocytes whereas lymphocytes and stellate cells in areas of fibrosis had significantly longer telomere reserves. Hepatocyte-specific telomere shortening correlated with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining in 84% of the cirrhosis samples, specifically in hepatocytes, but not in stellate cells or lymphocytes. Hepatocyte telomere shortening and senescence correlated with progression of fibrosis in cirrhosis samples. This study demonstrates for the first time that cell type-specific telomere shortening and senescence are linked to progression of human cirrhosis. These findings give a novel explanation for the pathophysiology of cirrhosis, indicating that fibrotic scarring at the cirrhosis stage is a consequence of hepatocyte telomere shortening and senescence. The data imply that future therapies aiming to restore regenerative capacity during aging and chronic diseases will have to ensure efficient targeting of specific cell types within the affected organs."
https://openalex.org/W2064226140,"We report that CaM kinase IV and CREB play a critical role in mediating calcium-induced dendritic growth in cortical neurons. Calcium-dependent dendritic growth is suppressed by CaM kinase inhibitors, a constitutively active form of CaM kinase IV induces dendritic growth in the absence of extracellular stimulation, and a kinase-dead form of CaM kinase IV suppresses dendritic growth induced by calcium influx. CaM kinase IV activates the transcription factor CREB, and expression of a dominant negative form of CREB blocks calcium- and CaM kinase IV-induced dendritic growth. In cortical slice cultures, dendritic growth is attenuated by inhibitors of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and by dominant negative CREB. These experiments indicate that calcium-induced dendritic growth is regulated by activation of a transcriptional program that involves CaM kinase IV and CREB-mediated signaling to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1998856849,"Virtually all blood vessels are surrounded by adventitial fat. Adipocytes produce a host of vasoactive substances that may influence vascular contraction. We tested whether or not perivascular adipose tissue modulates contraction of aortic ring preparations. We studied aortic rings surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue from adult Sprague-Dawley rats. At a maximum concentration of 300 nM angiotensin II, 6.5 microM serotonin, and 5 microM phenylephrine, the contractile response of intact rings was 95%, 80%, and 30% lower than that of vessels without periadventitial fat. The anticontractile effect of periadventitial fat was reduced by inhibition of ATP-dependent K+ channels with glibenclamide (3 microM) and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 microM). Blocking NOS, cyclo-oxygenase, cytochrome P450, or adenosine receptors did not restore the vascular response in intact vessels. The anticontractile effect of perivascular fat was present in Zucker fa/fa rats, suggesting that leptin receptors were not responsible. Transferring the bath solution from intact vessels, isolated periadventitial tissue, and cultured rat adipocytes to precontracted vessels lacking periadventitial fat resulted in a rapid relaxation. We suggest that perivascular adventitial adipose tissue releases a transferable adventitium-derived relaxing factor that acts by tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082159115,"IL (interleukin)-22 is an IL-10-related cytokine; its main biological activity known thus far is the induction of acute phase reactants in liver and pancreas. IL-22 signals through a receptor that is composed of two chains from the class II cytokine receptor family: IL-22R (also called ZcytoR11/CRF2–9) and IL-10Rβ (CRF2–4), which is also involved in IL-10 signaling. In this report, we analyzed the signal transduction pathways activated in response to IL-22 in a rat hepatoma cell line, H4IIE. We found that IL-22 induces activation of JAK1 and Tyk2 but not JAK2, as well as phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 on tyrosine residues, extending the similarities between IL-22 and IL-10. However our results unraveled some differences between IL-22 and IL-10 signaling. Using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p90RSK, JNK, and p38 kinase, we showed that IL-22 activates the three major MAPK pathways. IL-22 also induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727. This effect, which is not shared with IL-10, was only marginally affected by MEK1/2 inhibitors, indicating that other pathways might be involved. Finally, by overexpressing a STAT3 S727A mutant, we showed that serine phosphorylation is required to achieve maximum transactivation of a STAT responsive promoter upon IL-22 stimulation.

This cytokine shows 22% amino acid identity with IL-10 and belongs to a family of cytokines with limited homology to IL-10, namely IL-10, IL-22, mda-7/IL-24, IL-19, IL-20, and AK155/IL-26 (2Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R.

As discovered thus far, IL-22 activities include up-regulation of acute-phase reactants in the liver and hepatoma cells (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. J.

Foster J. Gurney A.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this cytokine in inflammatory processes. IL-22 also induces STAT activation in several cell lines such as mesangial cells, lung and intestinal epithelial cells, melanomas, and hepatomas (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. J.

Signaling through the receptors for the IL-10-related cytokines has been poorly investigated so far, with the exception of the IL-10 receptor itself. IL-10 binding to its receptor complex (IL-10Rα and IL-10Rβ) induces the activation of JAK1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases, with JAK1 being associated with IL-10Rα (12Finbloom D. Winestock K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Tyk2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with IL-10Rβ (13Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P., Wu, W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Activation of these two JAK kinases leads to phosphorylation of three STAT factors: STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 (12Finbloom D.

In this report, we show that binding of IL-22 to its surface receptor on rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE induced the rapid activation of JAK1 and Tyk2, leading to phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. IL-22 also activated the three major MAPK pathways: the MEK-ERK-RSK, the JNK/SAPK, and the p38 kinase pathways. In addition, IL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on a serine residue. This further STAT modification was necessary for maximum transactivation and depended only marginally on the ERK pathway. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (from Dr. J.-P. Thissen, University of Louvain, Belgium) were grown in Iscove-Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.55 mml-arginine, 0.24 mml-asparagine, and 1.25 mml-glutamine. HEK293-EBNA human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 2C4, U4C, (generously provided by Dr. Ian Kerr, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK) and γ2A (generously provided by Dr. George Stark, Cleveland Clinic Research Institute, Cleveland, OH) fibrosarcoma cells (18Kohlhuber F.

Recombinant human IL-10 was purchased from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant mouse IFN-γ was provided by Dr. W. Fiers (University of Gent, Belgium). Cytokines were added to the cultures at the following concentrations: 2000 units/ml for rIL-22, 1% for IL-22-containing HEK293 supernatant, 10 ng/ml for IL-10, and 250 units/ml for IFN-γ. H4IIE cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) at 5 × 105 cells/well 1 day before stimulation. The next day, cells were stimulated with new medium containing or not containing IL-22. When indicated, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 50 μm PD98059 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or 10 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling) MEK inhibitors. After various periods of time, cells were lysed in 500 μl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 3 min before being loading on pre-cast Novex (Carlsbad, CA) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8 or 14%) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C; AmershamBiosciences). Membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, washed, and probed using antibodies specific for phosphorylated Tyk2, STAT1-Y701, STAT3-Y705, STAT3-S727, STAT5-Y694, ERK1/2, p90RSK, JNK/SAPK, p38 kinase (Cell Signaling), or MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Blots were reprobed with anti-Tyk2 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) or anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma) as a control. A SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce) was used for detection. Thirty million H4IIE cells were stimulated with mIL-22 (1% HEK293 cell supernatant), IFN-γ (250 units/ml), or control medium for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, and inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates were homogenized by five passages through a 20-gauge needle, incubated for 45 min on ice, and centrifuged (14,000 ×g). 2.5 μg of anti-JAK1 or anti-JAK2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with protein A-agarose for 2 h. Beads were washed, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (25 μl), and boiled. Proteins were separated in a 8% SDS-PAGE (Novex, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin solution before overnight incubation with 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibody. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce), and membranes were reprobed with anti-JAK1 or anti-JAK2 antibodies as a control. The human IL-22R cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription PCR from the HepG2 hepatoma cell line before cloning into the pEF-BOSpuro expression vector (21Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Mouse IL10Rα cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription PCR from MC9 cells and also cloned into the pEF-BOSpuro expression vector. The pSG5-STAT3 wild-type and the pSG5-STAT3 S727A vectors encoding wild-type or mutated forms of human STAT3 were obtained as described (22Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E.

Brennan, Imperial Cancer Research Fund) or 30 μg of pSRE-luc plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The first construct contains five copies of the STAT-binding site of the FcγRI gene inserted upstream from a luciferase gene controlled by the TK promoter, and the second one contains repeats of the serum responsive element of the c-fos promoter. 5 μg of another reporter plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) encoding renilla luciferase, was co-electroporated as an internal control of the transfection process. Cells were seeded in 12-wells plates at 106/ml. The next day, cells were stimulated for 3 h with 2000 units/ml IL-22 before lysis. When indicated, cells were preincubated 1 h with 50 μm PD98059 or 10 μm U0126 MEK inhibitors. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). For stable transfection, mouse IL-10Rα cDNA was subcloned into the pEF/Myc/Cyto plasmid (Invitrogen) carrying a Geneticin resistance gene. 12.106 H4IIE cells were electroporated (250 V, 200 ohms, 1200 microfarads) with 50 μg of IL-10Rα cDNA. The next day, cells were cultured with 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) until a bulk population was obtained. Transient transfection of H4IIE cells with wild-type and mutated STAT3 was performed as follows. 12.106 H4IIE cells were electroporated (250 V, 200 ohms, 1200 microfarads) with 15 μg of pGRR5-luc, 15 μg of either pSG5-STAT3 or pSG5-STAT3 S727A, and 5 μg of pRL-TK vectors. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 106/ml. 5 h later, cells were stimulated for 3 h with 2000 units/ml IL-22 before lysis and luciferase assay. Transient HEK293 cells transfections were carried out as described previously (24Lejeune D. Demoulin J.B. Renauld J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. Transfection was carried out using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in a total of: 500 ng of hIL-22R or mIL-10R cDNA, 100 ng of pGRR5, 100 ng of pRL-TK, 1 μg of vector encoding wild-type or mutated forms of STAT3, and empty vector to 2 μg. 5 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with control medium, with IL-22 (2000 units/ml) or human IL-10 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The same protocol was used for transient transfection of 2C4, U4C, and γ2A fibrosarcoma cells with 500 ng of hIL-22R cDNA, 40 ng of pRK5-JAK1, pRK5-JAK2, or empty vector, 100 ng of pGRR5, and 100 ng of pRL-TK.

Within 5 min, IL-22 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 (Fig.1A). This phosphorylation was transient, decreasing to barely detectable levels for STAT1 and STAT5 after 30 min. However, phosphorylated STAT3 could still be detected at least 1 h after IL-22 stimulation (data not shown). To confirm that IL-22-induced STAT phosphorylation correlated with transcriptional activation, we used luciferase assays with pGRR5-luc reporter plasmid. The pGRR5-luc construct is regulated by five copies of a STAT-binding sequence recognizing at least STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. As shown in Fig.1B, when H4IIE cells were electroporated with pGRR5-luc, IL-22 stimulation induced a 35-fold increase in luciferase activity. As JAK kinases are known to be responsible for STAT phosphorylation in response to cytokines, we next investigated which JAK kinase is activated by IL-22. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells were stimulated with control medium or IL-22, and a Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-phospho-Tyk2 antibody, while immunoprecipitations were used for JAK1 and JAK2. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, IL-22 stimulation of H4IIE cells induced the rapid phosphorylation of Tyk2 and JAK1 but not of JAK2. As a control for JAK2 immunoprecipitation, H4IIE cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, which is known to activate this JAK family member as well as JAK1 (25Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell J.E., Jr. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To further assess the functional role of JAK1 in IL-22 signaling, we transfected JAK1-deficient U4C cells with the IL-22R cDNA together with pGRR5-luc reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2C, IL-22 failed to induce a luciferase activity in U4C cells unless these cells were transfected with JAK1 cDNA. By contrast, parental cells (2C4) or JAK2-deficient cells (γ2A) were both able to respond to IL-22. We next analyzed the ability of IL-22 to activate the MAP kinase pathways. As shown in Fig.3A, IL-22 induced a sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Two MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, totally blocked this phosphorylation, suggesting that ERK1/2 phosphorylation results from MEK activation. In line with this result, IL-22 induced the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Fig. 3B). p90RSK, a well known substrate of ERK, was also phosphorylated in response to IL-22. To confirm the functional activation of this pathway, we electroporated H4IIE cells with the pSRE-luc reporter plasmid regulated by the serum-responsive element from the c-fos promoter. As shown in Fig.4, IL-22 stimulation induced a 2.25-fold increase in luciferase activity, which was completely abolished when cells were preincubated with any of the MEK inhibitors. In contrast with IL-22, IL-10 did not activate the ERK MAPK pathway in H4IIE cells transfected with IL-10Rα cDNA (Fig.5). In addition to this MEK-ERK-RSK cascade, IL-22 also induced a delayed phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases, detectable after 30–40 min (Fig. 3B).Figure 4IL-22 activates the MAPK pathway in H4IIE cells. 12.106 H4IIE cells were electroporated with 30 μg of pSRE-luc and 5 μg of pRL-TK reporter vectors. The transfected cells were seeded in 12-well plates (106 cells/well). The next day, cells were preincubated for 1 h in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 1/1000 final), PD98059 (50 μm final), or U0126 (10 μm final) before stimulation with mIL-22 (2000 units/ml) or control medium. 3 h later, a luciferase assay was performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5IL-10 does not induce phosphorylation of ERK. 5.105 H4IIE cells stably transfected with IL-10Rα were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day before stimulation with IL-10 (10 ng/ml) or mIL-22 (2000 units/ml) for 10, 20, 30, or 40 min or with control medium for 40 min.

Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In our system, IL-22 stimulation of H4IIE cells induced rapid serine phosphorylation of STAT3. Although MAPKs have often been described as mediating STAT3 Ser phosphorylation (22Schuringa J.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), preincubation of H4IIE cells with MEK inhibitors only slightly delayed but did not inhibit this effect (Fig. 6,A and B). To test the functional significance of STAT3 serine phosphorylation, we transfected H4IIE cells with the pGRR5-luc and pRL-TK reporter plasmids together with a plasmid encoding wild-type or a mutated form of STAT3, in which the serine 727 is mutated into alanine, thus preventing phosphorylation (28Schuringa J.J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, mutation of Ser727 of STAT3 reduced luciferase induction from an 8-fold to a 4-fold increase upon IL-22 stimulation, strongly suggesting that STAT3 serine phosphorylation is required to achieve maximal transactivation. To further support this hypothesis, we studied the effect of this STAT3 S727A mutant on IL-10-induced transactivation because IL-10 has never been described to phosphorylate STAT3 on a serine residue. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding either IL-22R or IL-10R cDNA together with a plasmid encoding the wild-type or S727A mutated form of STAT3, pGRR5-luc, and pRL-TK reporter plasmids. As shown in Fig. 8A, IL-22 stimulation of IL-22R-transfected HEK293 cells induced a 6.5-fold increase in luciferase activity. Co-transfection of the STAT3 S727A mutant reduced this induction to 4-fold. By contrast, co-transfection of the STAT3 S727A mutant in cells expressing IL-10R had no effect on IL-10-induced transactivation (Fig. 8A). In line with this result, IL-22, but not IL-10, induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation in these cells, whereas both cytokines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 8B). IL-22, a new cytokine that is structurally related to IL-10, was originally identified as an IL-9-induced gene and shown to up-regulate the acute phase response in the liver (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J.

In addition to their sequence homology, IL-22 and IL-10 share one receptor subunit, IL-10Rβ, whereas their functional receptor complex also involves IL-22R for IL-22 and IL-10Rα for IL-10 (7Xie M.H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have analyzed the signaling pathways activated by IL-22 in rat hepatoma cells. We showed that IL-22 induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyk2, but not JAK2, and that JAK1 is absolutely required for IL-22 signaling. Because Tyk2 has been shown to be associated with IL-10Rβ (13Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P., Wu, W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), these results suggest that JAK1 associates with IL-22R. This observation extends the similarities between IL-22 and IL-10, which also activates JAK1 and Tyk2. Moreover, both cytokines induce the phosphorylation of the same STAT factors (12Finbloom D. Winestock K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P., Wu, W. Pestka S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, our results unravel some of the differences between IL-22 and IL-10 signaling. First, IL-22 induces the activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways that are not activated by IL-10 (2Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar). Secondly, IL-22, but not IL-10, induces serine phosphorylation of STAT3. Thus, despite the structural relationship between IL-22 and IL-10, these cytokines activate overlapping but not identical signaling pathways. IL-22 activity and signaling pathways are reminiscent of those of IL-6 on hepatocytes. Indeed, IL-22 has been shown to induce acute phase proteins in the liver (6Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), an effect that has been described to be regulated by IL-6 mainly through STAT3 activation (30Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 31Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Muller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C.

A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Although the IL-6 receptor complex is less related to the IL-22 receptor than the IL-10 receptor complex, IL-6 binding also leads to JAK1 activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT1, and STAT5 (33Hirano T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-6 also activates the MAPK pathways (34Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 35Bode J.G. Ludwig S. Freitas C.A. Schaper F. Ruhl M. Melmed S. Heinrich P.C. Haussinger D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A synergistic effect between the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways has been proposed to regulate acute phase protein expression in response to IL-6 (36Yoo J.Y. Wang W. Desiderion S. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26421-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that such a synergy can also take place in the regulation of the acute phase response by IL-22. Accumulating data have stressed the importance of STAT regulation by serine phosphorylation. In this report, we have shown that STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is induced upon IL-22 stimulation and is required for maximal transcriptional activation. Similar results were previously reported for IL-6 (22Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By contrast, IL-10 signaling does not involve STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation, indicating that this process is not shared by all STAT3-activating cytokines. In the case of IL-6, STAT3 serine phosphorylation results from the sequential activation of a Vav-Rac-1-SEK-1/MKK-4-PKCδ cascade (22Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,37Schuringa J.J. Dekker L.V. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27709-27715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, we failed to show any IL-22-induced PKCδ activation (data not shown). STAT serine phosphorylation can also be mediated by MAPKs such as ERK (38Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (39Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21004-21011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), JNK (27Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), or p38 kinase (40Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-22-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation was only slightly delayed but not inhibited by MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, suggesting that this effect could result from several cooperating signaling pathways. This hypothesis is further supported by a recent report showing that both H7 (a PKC inhibitor) and PD98059 inhibitors were required to block STAT3 serine phosphorylation induced by high IL-6 concentrations (41Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N. Sekimoto T. Miki T. Hirano T. Nakajima K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, we have failed thus far to identify the kinases responsible for IL-22-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation by combining signaling pathway inhibitors (data not shown). This report is the first description of signal transduction by one of the recently described IL-10-related cytokines (IL-22, IL-19, IL-20, mda-7/IL-24, AK155/IL-26; reviewed in Refs. 3Dumoutier L.

Our data show both similarities (JAK1, Tyk2, and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation) and discrepancies (STAT3 serine phosphorylation, MAPKs activation) between IL-22 and IL-10 signaling. Little is known about the pathways activated by the other members of this family, except that they all induce STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (29Dumoutier L. Leemans C. Lejeune D. Kotenko S.V.

https://openalex.org/W2157008873,"This study was designed to investigate the effects of various chemically distinct activators of PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction. Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR in samples of rat heart, we document the expression of the mRNA for PPAR-gamma (isoform 1 but not isoform 2) as well as PPAR-beta and PPAR-alpha in freshly isolated cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and in the left and right ventricles of the heart. Using a rat model of regional myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (in vivo), we have discovered that various chemically distinct ligands of PPAR-gamma (including the TZDs rosiglitazone, ciglitazone, and pioglitazone, as well as the cyclopentanone prostaglandins 15D-PGJ2 and PGA1) cause a substantial reduction of myocardial infarct size in the rat. We demonstrate that two distinct ligands of PPAR-alpha (including clofibrate and WY 14643) also cause a substantial reduction of myocardial infarct size in the rat. The most pronounced reduction in infarct size was observed with the endogenous PPAR-gamma ligand, 15-deoxyDelta12,14-prostagalndin J2 (15D-PGJ2). The mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of 15D-PGJ2 may include 1) activation of PPAR-alpha, 2) activation of PPAR-gamma, 3) expression of HO-1, and 4) inhibition of the activation of NF-kappaB in the ischemic-reperfused heart. Inhibition by 15D-PGJ2 of the activation of NF-kappaB in turn results in a reduction of the 1) expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the nitration of proteins by peroxynitrite, 2) formation of the chemokine MCP-1, and 3) expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. We speculate that ligands of PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha may be useful in the therapy of conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion of the heart and other organs. Our findings also imply that TZDs and fibrates may help protect the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. This beneficial effect of 15D-PGJ2 was associated with a reduction in the expression of the 1) adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin, 2) chemokine macrophage chemotactic protein 1, and 3) inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase. 15D-PGJ2 reduced the nitration of proteins (immunohistological analysis of nitrotyrosine formation) caused by ischemia-reperfusion, likely due to the generation of peroxynitrite. Not all of the effects of 15D-PGJ2, however, are due to the activation of PPAR-gamma. For instance, exposure of rat cardiac myocytes to 15D-PGJ2, but not to rosiglitazone, results in an up-regulation of the expression of the mRNA for heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Taken together, these results provide convincing evidence that several, chemically distinct ligands of PPAR-gamma reduce the tissue necrosis associated with acute myocardial infarction."

Given the metabolic functions of Acrp30 and its potential involvement in the development of insulin resistance, remarkably little is known of its biochemical and physical properties. Analysis of human and mouse plasma by size exclusion gel chromatography or sucrose velocity gradient revealed that Acrp30 forms multiple species of different apparent molecular weights (1Scherer P.E.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). A portion of the high molecular weight Acrp30 in plasma has been isolated by gelatin-cellulose chromatography (10Yoda M.

Tomita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), possibly due to an affinity for collagen. Here we have used several approaches to show that Acrp30 expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli and human embryonic kidney 293T cells forms stable trimers and hexamers; 293T cells also produce a diffuse higher molecular weight (HMW) species. Similar Acrp30 oligomers were found in mouse serum as well as in 3T3-L1 adipocyte-conditioned medium. Whereas the most abundant Acrp30 species in serum are HMW and hexamers, those secreted from 3T3-L1 adipocytes are mostly trimers. We also show that Acrp30 is a hormone: addition of Acrp30 to C2C12 myocytes or myotubes led to activation of the NF-κB transcription factor in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α. Importantly, only hexameric and larger isoforms of Acrp30 activated NF-κB; trimeric Acrp30 or gAcrp30 could not. Although the biological significance of NF-κB activation is unclear, these results suggest that activity of Acrp30 may be controlled at least partially by changes in the relative distribution of the different oligomeric isoforms. C2C12 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DME medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Differentiation was initiated by changing to 2% horse serum after reaching confluence. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (12Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells expressing IκB-α with S32A and S36A substitutions were generated as described previously (12Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen) containing a His6 tag, human rhinovirus 3C protease recognition site, and either Acrp30 cDNA residues 18–247 (full length) or 107–247 (gAcrp30). Expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 50 min at 37 °C. Following centrifugation and sonication, cell lysates were filtered and bound to nickel-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Fractions containing pure Acrp30 were pooled and treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. PreScission protease and cleaved His6 tag were removed by glutathione-Sepharose and nickel-agarose beads, respectively. Acrp30 secreted from HEK cells was purified as described previously (8Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar) except cells were transiently transfected with mouse Acrp30 cDNA (residues 1–247) in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Following dialysis against PBS, purified protein samples were fractionated in a 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with PBS. Two milliliters of mouse serum (Sigma) were loaded onto a 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column and eluted with PBS. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected, and the amount of Acrp30 in each fraction was analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antiserum directed against an epitope in the globular domain (SVGLETRVTVPNVPIRFTK) of mouse Acrp30. 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated for 8 days were washed twice with serum-free DME medium and incubated overnight with serum-free DME medium plus 0.05% bovine serum albumin. Conditioned medium was centrifuged and filtered prior to gel filtration and immunoblot analysis. Samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 18 h at 10 °C in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge before absorbance was recorded. Data were fit globally, using MacNonlin PPC (13Johnson M.L.

J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), 2MacNonlin PPC can be found at www.cauma.uthscsa.edu/software/. to the following equation that describes sedimentation of a homogeneous species: Abs = B + A′ exp[H× M (x2 −xo2)], where Abs = absorbance at radius x, A′ = absorbance at reference radius xo, H = (1 − νρ)ω2/2RT, R = gas constant, T = temperature in Kelvin, ν = partial specific volume = 0.71896131 ml/g, ρ = density of solvent = 1.0061 g/ml, ω = angular velocity in radians/s, M = apparent molecular weight, and B = solvent absorbance (blank). Individual peaks of Acrp30 eluted from the gel filtration column in Fig. 1 were collected, and different concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/ml) of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce) were added to each Acrp30 species (40 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by a 15-min incubation at room temperature with 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0. Western blot analysis was performed as described above. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under the control of E-selectin promoter (14Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following overnight or 6-h incubation with Acrp30, gAcrp30, or LPS, cells were washed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were tested using kits from Promega and Clonetech. To test for endotoxin contamination, Acrp30, gAcrp30, and LPS were treated with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) for 90 min at 50 °C followed by 12 min at 99 °C. Undifferentiated or differentiated C2C12 cells were treated with 200 ng/ml LPS, 2 μg/ml gAcrp30, 4 μg/ml unfractionated Acrp30, or specific Acrp30 oligomers in normal growth medium. After 30 or 120 min of incubation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 50 mmTris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, a 1:100 dilution of Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I and II (Sigma), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The amount of phosphorylated and total IκB-α was assessed by Western blot analysis using a Ser-32 phospho-specific and a phosphorylation state-independent IκB-α antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). As judged by size exclusion chromatography and sucrose gradient analysis serum Acrp30 is mainly found in high molecular weight complexes (1Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), although their precise composition is uncharacterized. We therefore determined the multimerization state of Acrp30 and its isolated globular domain, gAcrp30, produced in E. coli. To this end full-length Acrp30 was expressed and purified from E. coli as a His6-tagged protein precursor that was subsequently treated with PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences) to remove the His tags. As judged by gel permeation chromatography this material resolved into three fractions (Fig.1, top left panel). Subsequent gel filtration analysis of separated individual species after 14-h incubation at room temperature or 3 months at 4 °C in PBS showed no interconversion from one species to another (data not shown). Equilibrium sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge showed that the largest species (apparent molecular mass, 410 kDa) was actually an Acrp30 hexamer (Fig.2A); non-linear least squares fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium data to an ideal single species model generated an actual molecular mass of 143 kDa, or 5.7 Acrp30 polypeptides per protein (Hexamer, Fig. 2A). Similarly, the actual molecular mass of the 209-kDa species is 80 kDa, or 3.2 full-length 25-kDa Acrp30 polypeptides (without signal sequence) per oligomer (Trimer A, Fig. 2B). The rigid triple helical structure of its collagen domain can extend the spherical radius of Acrp30 trimer, causing the discrepancy between apparent and actual molecular mass. Although cross-linking of Trimer B showed this species to contain the same number of Acrp30 polypeptides as Trimer A (described below, Fig. 3B), its apparent molecular mass is only 123 kDa (Fig. 1, top panel). Immunoblot analysis of Trimer B indicated that one of its three polypeptides is truncated by 9 kDa at the N terminus (data not shown), rendering impossible the formation of a collagenous triple helix. In contrast to full-length Acrp30, gAcrp30 exists as one single trimeric species (Fig. 2C).FIG. 3Analysis of E. coli- and HEK cell-produced Acrp30 oligomers by cross-linking.

Knight C., Xu, L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or other modification(s) introduced by mammalian enzymes affects its oligomerization state, we examined recombinant Acrp30 secreted from transfected HEK 293T cells, serum Acrp30, and Acrp30 secreted by cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fig. 1 shows that Acrp30 from all three sources fractionates as Trimer A and hexamer species, similar to those produced in E. coli, as well as a HMW species of apparent molecular mass ∼629 kDa. Following separation by gel filtration, these different species are stable; no conversion to other species took place (data not shown). Cross-linking experiments indicated that the apparent 410-kDa Acrp30 species secreted by HEK cells (Hexamer) indeed contains at least six Acrp30 polypeptides (Fig. 3A) since the molecular mass of the largest cross-linked species equaled that of about six Acrp30 polypeptides. Similar results were obtained by subjecting the E. coli-produced hexamer (Fig. 2A) to cross-linking (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the 226-kDa species (Trimer A) secreted by HEK cells was a trimer (Fig. 3A), and similar results were obtained by subjecting the E. coli-produced Trimer A and B species to cross-linking (Fig.3B). While we could not purify enough Acrp30 from mouse serum or 3T3-L1 adipocytes to perform biophysical characterization, the Western blots summarized in the top right and bottom right panels of Fig. 1 indicate that these too contain trimer A, hexamer, and HMW Acrp30 species, although in different proportions. To determine whether Acrp30 can affect intracellular signaling pathways, we conducted a systematic search of cis-acting enhancer or promoter elements whose transcriptional activation reflects stimulation of various signaling pathways. Of many luciferase reporter constructs tested in C2C12 myoblasts, only expression from the NF-κB-responsive E-selectin promoter (14Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was increased significantly by Acrp30 purified from E. coli (Fig.4A). Notably, gAcrp30 had no effect. Reporter constructs that contained glucocorticoid, heat shock, serum, cAMP, p21, and p53 response elements were unaffected either by Acrp30 or gAcrp30 addition (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows that activation of the E-selectin NF-κB-responsive promoter was correlated with release of NF-κB from the inhibitory binding protein IκB-α. Treatment of undifferentiated C2C12 cells for 30 min with Acrp30 (but not gAcrp30) resulted in marked phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32 as well as degradation of IκB-α (Fig.4B). By 2 h the steady-state levels of IκB-α returned to normal even though increased phosphorylation persisted. Experiments using differentiated C2C12 cells yielded similar results (data not shown). Acrp30 failed to elicit increased luciferase reporter expression from the E-selectin promoter in C2C12 cells expressing a dominant negative IκB-α, one containing serine to alanine substitutions at positions 32 and 36 (data not shown). This indicates that activation of NF-κB by Acrp30 depends upon phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α. Fig. 5A shows that only hexameric and larger forms of Acrp30, purified either from E. coli or HEK cells, transcriptionally activated the NF-κB-responsive E-selectin promoter; Trimer A (and Trimer B, data not shown) forms had negligible effects. Acrp30 HMW and hexamer isoforms activated NF-κB in a dosage-dependent manner; 50% maximal activation of the E-selectin promoter was achieved by 3.5 nm Acrp30 hexamer or 2 nm trimer equivalent of HMW Acrp30 produced by transfected 293T cells (data not shown), a concentration expected of typical receptor-ligand interactions. Consistent with these findings, Acrp30 hexamers induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5B). Although the Trimer A Acrp30 isoform did not cause degradation of IκB-α, it was able to increase phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32 (Fig. 5B), indicating that it is able to partially activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. The major result of our study was that Acrp30 hexamer and HMW species but not Acrp30 or gAcrp30 trimers cause activation of NF-κB in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. One puzzle concerning the potential role of Acrp30 as a genuine endocrine hormone is its high circulating concentration. The mean plasma Acrp30 concentration is ∼10 μg/ml (5Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Fruebis J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 440: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This is equivalent to a 130 nm concentration of the basic Acrp30 trimer (based upon monomer molecular mass of 25 kDa). Thus, as compared with other metabolic hormones like insulin and glucagon, the concentration of Acrp30 in circulation is extremely high. Multimerization represents one potential method to effectively reduce the concentration of the active form of Acrp30 (6Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 8Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Indeed our results suggest that one way to regulate activity of Acrp30 is through its multimerization state. The biological significance of NF-κB activation by Acrp30 is currently under investigation. Full-length Acrp30, but not gAcrp30, increases the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production (8Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 16Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This pattern is consistent with activation of NF-κB by hexameric and larger forms of Acrp30 but not by trimeric Acrp30 or gAcrp30. However, there is no published evidence linking NF-κB activation to hepatic glucose production. In addition, a recent study suggests that Acrp30-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte glucose production is related to the hydroxylation and glycosylation of the four conserved lysine residues in the Acrp30 collagen domain (15Wang Y., Xu, A. Knight C., Xu, L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation- and glycosylation-deficient Acrp30, produced in E. coli cells, has been reported to exhibit a decreased ability to inhibit hepatocyte glucose production (15Wang Y., Xu, A. Knight C., Xu, L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Activity of the E. coli-produced protein was equal to that of a mutant Acrp30, whose four lysine residues in the collagen domain were substituted with arginines, that was produced in transfected mammalian cells (15Wang Y., Xu, A. Knight C., Xu, L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed here that NF-κB activation depends only on the oligomerization state of Acrp30, not on its source or on any posttranslational modifications not made in bacterial cells. Since Acrp30 hexamer produced in either HEK or E. coli cells activated NF-κB, lysine hydroxylation and glycosylation of Acrp30 most likely does not contribute to NF-κB activation. Current data, however, do not preclude the possibility that NF-κB activation is one of multiple signaling pathways required for Acrp30-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte glucose production. It is noteworthy that the predominant isoform of Acrp30 secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes is Trimer A (Fig. 3A). Perhaps the formation of the hexamer and HMW species occurs only after the protein reaches the circulation. Only Acrp30 hexamers and larger oligomers cause activation of NF-κB; Acrp30 trimers are inactive as is gAcrp30. Thus clustering of cell surface receptors by multimers of Acrp30 trimers may effect signal transduction in a manner unattainable by gAcrp30 or Acrp30 trimers. In cultured cells 50% activation of an NF-κB-responsive promoter is achieved at 3.5 nm Acrp30 hexamer or 2 nmtrimer equivalent of HMW species, while the serum concentration of Acrp30 is much higher (about 50–100 nm trimer equivalent). Also, the isoforms of Acrp30 that can activate NF-κB, hexamer and HMW, are also those that are the most abundant in serum. However, movement of Acrp30 from the circulation to muscle or liver cells may be impeded by collagen-binding proteins in the endothelium and in other extracellular matrices. Indeed, recombinant Acrp30 binds tightly to collagens I, III, and V (17Okamoto Y. Arita Y. Nishida M. Muraguchi M. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Igura T. Inui Y. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Miyagawa J. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). If removal of Acrp30 from circulation is a regulated process, the actual Acrp30 concentration seen by muscle or liver cells may well be very small. In summary, we have identified three distinct and stable isoforms of Acrp30 produced both by E. coli and cultured mammalian cells and in mouse serum: trimer, hexamer, and an even higher molecular weight form. Because of its ability to lower both blood glucose and free fatty acids, Acrp30 and/or gAcrp30 shows promise as a therapeutic agent for diabetes and obesity. Identifying the different cell surface receptors for these proteins will be necessary to determine how Acrp30 but not gAcrp30 leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway. It may also tell us the biological significance of NF-κB activation by Acrp30. In the future, it will be important to determine whether alterations in the relative distribution of different Acrp30 isoforms can regulate Acrp30 activity. We thank J. Hancock for expert technical support and Drs. J. Bogan, L. J. S. Huang, and L. Rezende for valuable discussions throughout this study."
https://openalex.org/W1997893262,"Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that reflects neuronal hyperexcitability arising from largely unknown cellular and molecular mechanisms. In generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, an autosomal dominant epilepsy syndrome, mutations in three genes coding for voltage-gated sodium channel α or β1 subunits (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B) and one GABA receptor subunit gene (GABRG2) have been identified. Here, we characterize the functional effects of three mutations in the human neuronal sodium channel α subunit SCN1A by heterologous expression with its known accessory subunits, β1 and β2, in cultured mammalian cells. SCN1A mutations alter channel inactivation, resulting in persistent inward sodium current. This gain-of-function abnormality will likely enhance excitability of neuronal membranes by causing prolonged membrane depolarization, a plausible underlying biophysical mechanism responsible for this inherited human epilepsy."

Sca1(154Q/2Q) mice developed a progressive neurological disorder that resembles human SCA1, featuring motor incoordination, cognitive deficits, wasting, and premature death, accompanied by Purkinje cell loss and age-related hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Mutant ataxin-1 solubility varied with brain region, being most soluble in the neurons most vulnerable to degeneration. Solubility decreased overall as the mice aged; Purkinje cells, the most affected in SCA1, did not form aggregates of mutant protein until an advanced stage of disease. It appears that those neurons that cannot sequester the mutant protein efficiently and thereby curb its toxicity suffer the worst damage from polyglutamine-induced toxicity."

We show that Mfd influences the elongation state of RNA polymerase (RNAP); transcription complexes that have reverse translocated into the backtracked position, a potentially important intermediate in RNA proofreading and repair, are restored to the forward position by the activity of Mfd, and arrested complexes are rescued into productive elongation. Mfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation."

In addition, a salt wash did not release the tubulin from the mitochondria. By using electron microscopy, we then showed that tubulin is localized in the mitochondrial membranes. As compared with cellular tubulin, mitochondrial tubulin is enriched in acetylated and tyrosinated α-tubulin and is also enriched in the class III β-tubulin isotype but contains very little of the class IV β-tubulin isotype.

Proteins present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space have been shown to induce apoptosis (1Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). They are released into the cytosol in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (2Zamzani N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c initiates caspase activation when released from mitochondria during apoptosis. Cytosolic cytochrome c binds to apaf-1, ATP, and multiple procaspase-9 molecules to induce formation of the apoptosome. The caspase-9, in turn, activates downstream executioner caspases such as caspase-3, leading to characteristic morphological changes in apoptosis. Other mitochondrial proteins are released from mitochondria such as the apoptosis-inducing factor, which triggers caspase-independent cell death, or Smac/Diablo, which promotes apoptosis by inactivation of the inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (1Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is critical for the release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria (2Zamzani N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The exact mode of permeabilization of mitochondria has not been elucidated, and several hypotheses have been proposed. According to the main hypothesis, the permeability transition pore (PTP),1 a multiprotein complex that is formed at the contact sites between the inner and outer membrane, is responsible for mitochondrial permeabilization. The PTP contains transmembranous proteins such as the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor as well as the mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins (hexokinase, creatine kinase and cyclophilin D). ANT and VDAC are the most abundant PTP components of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively. An alternative hypothesis for mitochondrial permeabilization involves proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which can form pores in the outer membrane by oligomerization (2Zamzani N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the Bcl-2 family members in the early events of the release of cytochromec (3Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) and their interaction with PTP or isolated PTP components such as VDAC (4Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar) remain controversial. Microtubules are dynamic components of the cytoskeleton. They are critical for a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells. They are involved in the maintenance of cell shape, cell signaling, mitosis by the mediation of chromosome migration, mRNA localization, and vesicle and organelle trafficking mechanisms (5Dutcher S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Microtubules are the principal target in cells for a family of anticancer drugs, the so-called anti-tubulin agents. These agents strongly suppress microtubule dynamics that are essential for progression throughout mitosis (6Gonçalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11742Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), leading to sustained mitotic arrest and apoptosis (7Gonçalves A. Braguer D. Carles G. Andreá N. Prevot C. Briand C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the molecular pathways involved in the apoptotic process induced by these agents are still not elucidated. We have recently shown (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar) that paclitaxel acts directly on mitochondria isolated from human cancer cells to release cytochrome c. The release of cytochrome c is prevented by cyclosporin A, which prevents PTP opening by binding to cyclophilin D (9Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar). This demonstrates the involvement of this pore. The release was also observed with other anti-tubulin agents, either microtubule-stabilizing agents like docetaxel or microtubule-depolymerizing agents like nocodazole, CI 980, and vinorelbine (10Braguer D. Andreá N. Carreá M. Carles G. Goncalves A. Briand C. 92nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, New Orleans, LA, March 24–28, 2001. 42. American Association for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA2001: 369Google Scholar). Anti-mitochondrial agents such as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and arsenic trioxide induce the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (11Lim M.L. Minamikawa T. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Carreá M. Carles G. Andreá N. Douillard S. Ciccolini J. Briand C. Braguer D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, also act like anti-tubulin agents by depolymerizing microtubules in intact cells and in vitro experiments (12–14.). In contrast, doxorubicin, an anticancer drug that acts on DNA independently of microtubules, does not induce the release of cytochrome c (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we hypothesized that tubulin could be involved in the mechanism of the release of cytochrome c and should be present in mitochondria. More than twenty years ago the existence of membrane-associated tubulin (15Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Nature. 1976; 264: 576-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Stephens R.E. Biol. Cell. 1986; 57: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), including that of mitochondria (17Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7092-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was described but has remained controversial. The current study presents evidence that tubulin is an inherent component of mitochondrial membranes specifically interacting with the VDAC. The human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and IMR-32 cell lines, the human pulmonary cancer cell line A549, and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were routinely cultured as described previously (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chadebech P. Brichese L. Baldin V. Vidal S. Valette A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The human breast non-tumor cell line HBL-100 was cultured as described previously (19Bourgarel-Rey V. Vallee S. Rimet O. Champion S. Braguer D. Desobry A. Briand C. Barra Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The human cervical cancer HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. The nasal septum carcinoma RPMI 2650 cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium with Earle’s buffer supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate. The antibodies used were VDAC (anti-porin, 31 HL France Biochem, Meudon, France), α-tubulin (clone DM1A Sigma), β-tubulin (clone TU-06, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France), tyrosinated α-tubulin (clone TUB-1A2, Sigma), acetylated α-tubulin (clone 6-11B-1, Sigma), class I β-tubulin isotype (gift from Charles Dumontet), class II β-tubulin isotype (N178101B, BioGenex, San Ramon, CA), class III β-tubulin isotype (gift from Anthony Frankfurter), class IV β-tubulin isotype (N176101B, BioGenex), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), dynein (clone 70.1, Sigma), kinesin (clone IBII, Sigma), and ANT (Q18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mitochondria were isolated from SK-N-SH, IMR-32, and A549 cells as described previously (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 9 × 107 cells (36 ± 4 mg of protein) were suspended in a sucrose buffer (250 mmsucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, homogenized with 50–100 strokes (depending on the cell line) in a glass homogenizer (Kimble Kontes, Vineland, NJ), and centrifuged twice at 800 ×g for 10 min. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellets were immediately washed three times in the sucrose buffer. The protein content of the isolated mitochondria obtained by this procedure was determined according to the Bradford method (0.71 ± 0.05 mg). Mitochondria from HeLa, MCF-7, and RPMI 2650 cells were isolated using a similar extraction procedure except for the composition of the isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). To calculate the yield of mitochondrial isolation under our experimental conditions, we determined the percentage of mitochondria that were not isolated and pelleted after the first centrifugation at 800 × g. The quantity of mitochondria was estimated by quantification of the VDAC by Western blotting. The pellet obtained after the 800 × gcentrifugation was lysed and loaded on a gel together with the lysate of mitochondria isolated during the same experiment. The gel was processed for immunoblotting with VDAC, and the yield of the mitochondria isolation procedure was defined as the ratio of the quantity of VDAC in the isolated mitochondria preparation to the total quantity of VDAC in both the cells and the isolated mitochondria. Nuclei were isolated from SK-N-SH as described (20Fulda S. Jeremias I. Steiner H.H. Pietsch T. Debatin K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in lysis buffer (5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm Hepes, pH 8) for 10 min, and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 ×g. Then, the pellet was resuspended in a glycerol-rich buffer (50% v/v glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 10 mmNaCl, 125 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm Pipes, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The final pelleted nuclei were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 60 min at room temperature for electron microscopy. Isolated mitochondria were first incubated in 2 m KCl or in the sucrose-buffer (for control) for 2 h at 37 °C (20Fulda S. Jeremias I. Steiner H.H. Pietsch T. Debatin K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mitochondria and the supernatant were then separated by centrifugation at 4 °C (10 min, 15,000 ×g), and Western blotting was performed. To detect whether microtubules were present on isolated mitochondria, samples from isolated mitochondria or polymerized tubulin were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and loaded on Formvar-coated grids. Microtubules and mitochondria were visualized by using transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 1220). For immunodetection by electron microscopy, cells grown on glass coverslips, isolated mitochondria, and isolated nuclei were stained using the peroxidase labeling technique. Samples were fixed and permeabilized according to standard procedures. Cells, mitochondria, or nuclei were incubated with monoclonal α- or β-tubulin antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.03% saponine, 1% bovine serum albumin (1:40) for 1 h at 37 °C. Successive incubations with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody, streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, and diaminobenzidine were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (LSAB 2 system HRP kit K0673, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Cells, nuclei, or mitochondria were fixed in 1% osmic acid, dehydrated in acetone, embedded in araldite, and cut into 0.05–0.08-μm sections before electron microscopy observation. Isolated mitochondria and cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (2 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm orthovanate, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). SDS-PAGE was carried out, and visualization was accomplished using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences); immunoblot quantification was then performed using Traitima, a homemade densitometric software, as described previously (22Carles G. Braguer D. Dumontet C. Bourgarel V. Gonçalves A. Sarrazin M. Rognoni J.B. Briand C. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At least three independent experiments were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’st test. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. The determination of tubulin quantity in isolated mitochondria and whole cells was performed using a standard curve of pure tubulin previously extracted from pig brain as described (23Barbier P. Gregoire C. Devred F. Sarrazin M. Peyrot V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13510-13519Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because pure tubulin is composed of α/β dimers, the quantity of the individual α- and β-tubulins represents half of the loaded quantity of tubulin. The characterization of mitochondrial tubulin by comparison with cellular tubulin was performed by immunoblots on samples of isolated mitochondria and whole cell lysates containing equivalent quantities of tubulin. Several α-tubulin post-translational modifications and β-tubulin isotypes were also analyzed. Isolated mitochondria were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaP, orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors), and ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C. The collected supernatants were precleared by mixing with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h with gentle rocking, and beads were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 500 × g. The resulting supernatants were incubated with 4 μg of primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubation with protein G-agarose for 2 h and centrifugation for 2 min at 500 × g. The pellets were washed successively twice with lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl) and twice in the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl to increase stringency and reduce nonspecific binding of proteins to immunoprecipitates. The protein G-agarose beads with immunoprecipitates were then suspended in loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. We have shown previously that α-tubulin is present in isolated mitochondria from human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carreá M. Carles G. Andreá N. Douillard S. Ciccolini J. Briand C. Braguer D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Maro B. Marty M.C. Bomens M. EMBO J. 1982; 11: 1347-1352Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Marshall L.E. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to the presence of tubulin in SK-N-SH cells, we also find tubulin in the mitochondria isolated from another human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32) and from lung carcinoma (A549), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), nasal septum adenocarcinoma (RPMI 2650), cervix carcinoma (HeLa), and non cancerous breast (HBL-100) cells (Fig.1). Thus, tubulin is present in mitochondria from a wide range of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. The amount of mitochondrial tubulin appears to differ according to the cell lines from which mitochondria were isolated. We then focused our study on the SK-N-SH cell line to determine whether tubulin is an intrinsic component of the mitochondria. First, we checked that the tubulin detected by Western blotting was not present in the form of microtubules associated with the mitochondria. Using transmission electron microscopy, we compared, at the same magnification, suspensions of whole isolated mitochondria and in vitropolymerized microtubules (Fig.2A). No microtubules were seen within the isolated mitochondria suspension. Moreover, we showed by Western blotting that proteins that are normally associated with microtubules such as the light chains of the motor proteins dynein and kinesin were also absent from the isolated mitochondria (Fig.2B). These results imply that the mitochondrial tubulin detected by Western blotting does not come from microtubules pelleted during the mitochondrial isolation procedure or attached to the mitochondria and that mitochondrial tubulin is not linked to mitochondria through binding with motor proteins. Moreover, the cytosolic enzyme NSE, a cell-specific isoenzyme of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (24Kaiser E. Kuzmits R. Pregant P. Burghuber O. Worofka W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 183: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that is present throughout the cytoplasm but not in mitochondria (25Vinores S.A. Herman M.M. Rubinstein L.J. Marangos P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1984; 32: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was not detected in our mitochondrial preparation (Fig. 2B). This indicates that no contaminating cytosolic protein was present in the isolated mitochondria. To test the association of tubulin with mitochondria, we performed a salt wash of the isolated mitochondria (21Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A. Durand G. Pous C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) with 2 m KCl for 2 h at 37 °C. Tubulin was barely detectable in the supernatant of the KCl-incubated mitochondria. The small quantity of both tubulin and VDAC detected in the supernatant from salt-washed mitochondria (Fig.2C) is probably derived from damaged mitochondria. It is clear that the presence of tubulin in the mitochondria is not sensitive to ionic strength, suggesting that the tubulin is an inherent protein component of the mitochondria. To determine the localization of the mitochondrial tubulin, we used immunoperoxidase labeling coupled with anti-α- and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies and transmission electron microscopy. We visualized α- and β-tubulin in the membranes of isolated mitochondria but not in their matrix (Fig.3A). We then confirmed the presence of tubulin in mitochondrial membranes in intact cells, which strengthens the interpretation that the association of tubulin with the mitochondria is not due to the extraction procedure. Because the nuclear membranes were not stained in intact cells, we then isolated nuclei and performed the same immunostaining protocol as for isolated mitochondria. Tubulin was not detected in nuclear membranes (Fig.3B), further demonstrating the specificity of the tubulin staining on mitochondrial membranes. Altogether, these results show that α/β-tubulin is specifically associated with mitochondrial membranes. The quantity of tubulin in whole cells and in mitochondria was determined by using a standard curve with pure tubulin (Fig.4). Mitochondrial α/β-tubulin represents 0.53 ± 0.02% of total mitochondrial protein, and cellular α/β-tubulin represents 1.70 ± 0.05% of whole cell protein. Thus, there is a substantial amount of tubulin in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial protein represents 7 ± 1% of the total cellular protein as determined by cellular and mitochondrial protein measurements, taking into account the yield of the mitochondrial isolation procedure (28 ± 2%). Altogether, these data allow us to conclude that mitochondrial tubulin represents ∼2.2% of the total pool of cellular tubulin in SK-N-SH cells. Interestingly, α- and β-tubulin were present at comparable levels in mitochondria (0.26 ± 0.02% and 0.27 ± 0.01% of the mitochondrial proteins, respectively; p > 0.05), strongly suggesting that mitochondrial tubulin is present as α/β dimers. To compare the pattern of distribution of α-tubulin post-translational modifications and β-tubulin isotypes between mitochondrial and cellular tubulin, we performed immunoblotting using samples of isolated mitochondria and whole cell lysates containing equivalent quantities of tubulin. Significant differences were found between cellular and mitochondrial tubulins (Fig.5). Mitochondrial α-tubulin was more tyrosinated and more acetylated than cellular α-tubulin (a 6.0 ± 0.3-fold and a 1.9 ± 0.5-fold increase, respectively;p < 0.01). Moreover, differences in the distribution of β-tubulin isotypes were also evident. The main differences were a 2.9 ± 0.6-fold increase in the class III β-isotype and a 2.5 ± 0.1-fold decrease in the class IV β-isotype (p < 0.01) in mitochondrial tubulin compared with whole cell tubulin (Fig 5). Altogether, these results indicate that mitochondrial tubulin is a different subset of cellular tubulin and suggest that it could have a specific function(s). Because several anti-tubulin agents, whose target is tubulin, trigger cytochrome c release from mitochondria through the opening of the PTP (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether mitochondrial tubulin could be associated with the proteins of this complex. Therefore, we searched for an interaction between mitochondrial tubulin and both VDAC and ANT, the two major proteins of the PTP. First, lysates of isolated mitochondria from SK-N-SH cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to α-tubulin, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed for the presence of VDAC or ANT by immunoblotting. Then, mitochondrial lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to VDAC, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed for the presence of tubulin. These experiments demonstrated that the antibody to α-tubulin co-immunoprecipitated tubulin and VDAC and that the immunoprecipitation of VDAC brought down tubulin (Fig.6A). Thus, mitochondrial tubulin interacts with the PTP through its binding to the outer membrane protein VDAC. Similar results were found under the same stringent conditions (500 mm NaCl washes) on mitochondria isolated from A549 cells (data not shown), confirming the interaction between tubulin and VDAC in another cancer cell type. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with mitochondrial tubulin and ANT did not reveal an interaction between these two proteins (Fig6B), proving the specificity of association between VDAC and mitochondrial tubulin. In this study, we showed that tubulin is an inherent component of mitochondrial membranes in several human cancer cell lines as well as in a non-cancerous cell line. Differences in the pattern of distribution of α-tubulin post-translational modifications and β-tubulin isotypes between the mitochondrial and cellular tubulins were shown. We also demonstrated that mitochondrial tubulin is specifically associated with VDAC, the main PTP component located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. The presence of tubulin in mitochondria was initially surprising because tubulin was thought to be primarily a cytosolic protein involved in microtubule formation by an equilibrium between free and assembled α/β-tubulin dimers. Nevertheless, several studies reported the presence of tubulin in organelle or plasma membranes about 20 years ago (15Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Nature. 1976; 264: 576-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7092-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Walss et al. (26Walss C. Kreisberg J.I. Luduena R.F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of α/βII-tubulin dimers in the matrix of nuclei, and Chabin-Brion et al. (21Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A. Durand G. Pous C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that γ-tubulin is associated with the Golgi apparatus, indicating that the Golgi could play the role of a microtubule-organizing organelle. Thus, the tubulins are a large protein superfamily (5Dutcher S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with various members whose localization in cells is widespread. Since the first suggestion of its existence, mitochondrial tubulin has been controversial (16Stephens R.E. Biol. Cell. 1986; 57: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial tubulin was considered as a possible artifactual consequence of the cell fractionation process. To exclude such a possibility in this study, we determined that our mitochondrial preparation did not contain any assembled microtubules, microtubule-linked proteins, or a cytosolic protein. By using electron microscopy, we then showed that tubulin is an inherent component of mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial tubulin represents 0.5% of mitochondrial protein, which is consistent with results published previously (17Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7092-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Linden M. Nelson B.D. Letterier J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, α- and β-tubulin is present in equivalent quantities in mitochondria, strongly suggesting that mitochondrial tubulin is organized in α/β dimers. At present, we do not know whether these tubulin dimers in mitochondrial membranes are individual or in oligomeric form. A study of α-tubulin post-translational modifications and β-tubulin isotypes revealed that mitochondrial tubulin has a specific pattern of distribution that is different from that of total cellular tubulin. Mitochondrial tubulin contains very little of the class IV β-tubulin isotype but is rich in the class III β-tubulin isotype. Because the class III β-tubulin lacks the highly oxidizable Cys-239, it is much more resistant to free radicals, and it is not surprising that mitochondria are enriched for this isotype because mitochondria are a major site of free radical production (28Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, even if mitochondrial tubulin is synthesized in the cytosol, a selection related to the inherent characteristics of tubulin and the mitochondrial environment seems to be made, leading to a mitochondrial-specific distribution of tubulin isotypes. These data suggest that mitochondrial tubulin may have specific functions. When studies on mitochondrial tubulin were first published, mitochondria were only regarded as cell power plants, so the functions of mitochondrial tubulin were hard to imagine. Nevertheless, colocalization of mitochondria with microtubules in cells had already been described (29Ball E.H. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial tubulin was suggested as providing an interaction site for the transport of mitochondria along microtubules via motor proteins (16Stephens R.E. Biol. Cell. 1986; 57: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, Ngan et al. (30Ngan V.K. Bellman K. Hill B.T. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) hypothesized thatVinca alkaloids may be sequestered within the cell to explain the differences between the intracellular concentrations of drugs and the observed effects on the microtubule network in the cells. Because mitochondrial tubulin represents 2.2% of the total cellular tubulin, mitochondria may participate at least in part in drug sequestration through binding of the anti-tubulin agents to mitochondrial tubulin. However, it seems that the main functions of mitochondrial tubulin may be due to the major involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis through the PTP opening. In the present study, we demonstrate that mitochondrial tubulin is specifically associated with VDAC, the main outer membrane PTP component. Such an association between PTP and mitochondrial tubulin might explain why anti-tubulin drugs such as vinorelbine and paclitaxel directly induce the PTP opening and the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (8Andreá N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Gonçalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-tubulin drugs could bind to mitochondrial tubulin and thus change the conformation of the tubulin that consequently modifies the conformation of PTP, leading to its opening. As mitochondria are regarded as new targets for anti-cancer agents (31Grad J.M. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 2: 85-91Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and more widely as death sensors (32Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 306-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Brenner C. Kroemer G. Science. 2000; 289: 1150-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the existence of mitochondrial tubulin and its association with PTP could extend the range of stimuli that can be orchestrated by mitochondria. Nevertheless, the role of mitochondrial tubulin should not be restricted to its function during apoptosis induced by anti-cancer drugs. Mitochondrial tubulin may participate in a pathway for death signals from the cytoskeleton to the mitochondria via the VDAC (34Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or could be involved on its own in the apoptotic mechanism. Whether the association of mitochondrial tubulin with VDAC is or is not a direct interaction remains to be elucidated. Linden et al.(27Linden M. Nelson B.D. Letterier J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) previously showed that the immunoprecipitation of VDAC brought down microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). VDAC, tubulin, and MAP2 could form a complex in which MAP2 or tubulin may be an intermediary partner. Even if we have shown that mitochondrial tubulin is not associated with ANT, we cannot exclude an interaction with another component of the PTP such as hexokinase, which can bind tubulinin vitro (35Wagner G. Kovacs J. Low P. Orosz F. Ovadi J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or with another mitochondrial protein. In summary, in the present paper we demonstrate the presence of tubulin in mitochondrial membranes and its association with the main PTP outer membrane component, VDAC. It seems very likely that mitochondrial tubulin could act as a regulator of the PTP state. However, the roles of mitochondrial tubulin have to be further investigated. Further characterization of mitochondrial tubulin is currently in progress and could lead to the identification of specific isotypes as targets for new anti-tumor drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2072126194,"Fragile X mental retardation is a prominent genetic disorder caused by the lack of the FMR1 gene product, a known RNA binding protein. Specific physiologic pathways regulated by FMR1 function have yet to be identified. Adult dfmr1 (also called dfxr) mutant flies display arrhythmic circadian activity and have erratic patterns of locomotor activity, whereas overexpression of dFMR1 leads to a lengthened period. dfmr1 mutant males also display reduced courtship activity which appears to result from their inability to maintain courtship interest. Molecular analysis fails to reveal any defects in the expression of clock components; however, the CREB output is affected. Morphological analysis of neurons required for normal circadian behavior reveals subtle abnormalities, suggesting that defects in axonal pathfinding or synapse formation may cause the observed behavioral defects."
https://openalex.org/W2031863862,"Neuronal activity and neurotrophins play a central role in the formation, maintenance, and plasticity of dendritic arbors. Here, we show that neuronal activity, mediated by electrical stimulation, KCl depolarization, or cholinergic receptor activation, promotes reversible dendrite formation in sympathetic neurons and that this effect is enhanced by NGF. Activity-dependent dendrite formation is accompanied by increased association of HMW MAP2 with microtubules and increased microtubule stability. Inhibition of either CaMKII or the MEK-ERK pathway, both of which phosphorylate MAP2, inhibits dendrite formation, but inhibition of both pathways simultaneously is required for dendrites to retract. These data indicate that neuronal activity signals via CamKII and the ERKs to regulate MAP2:microtubule interactions and hence reversible dendrite stability, and to provide a mechanism whereby activity and neurotrophins converge intracellularly to dynamically regulate dendritic morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2073503004,"Mental retardation is a pervasive societal problem, 25 times more common than blindness for example. Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. Fragile X patients display neurite morphology defects in the brain, suggesting that this may be the basis of their mental retardation. Drosophila contains a single homolog of FMR1, dfxr (also called dfmr1). We analyzed the role of dfxr in neurite development in three distinct neuronal classes. We find that DFXR is required for normal neurite extension, guidance, and branching. dfxr mutants also display strong eclosion failure and circadian rhythm defects. Interestingly, distinct neuronal cell types show different phenotypes, suggesting that dfxr differentially regulates diverse targets in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2026093694,"To investigate the role of the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) in controlling susceptibility to foreign prions, two Syrian hamster (SHa) prion strains, Sc237 and DY, were transmitted to transgenic mice expressing chimeric SHa/mouse PrP genes, Tg(MH2M). First passage of SHa(Sc237) prions exhibited prolonged incubation times, diagnostic of a species barrier. PrPSc of the new MH2M(Sc237) strain possessed different structural properties from those of SHa(Sc237), as demonstrated by relative conformational stability measurements. This change was accompanied by a disease phenotype different from the SHa(Sc237) strain. Conversely, transmission of SHa(DY) prions to Tg(MH2M) mice showed no species barrier, and the MH2M(DY) strain retained the conformational and disease-specific properties of SHa(DY). These results suggest a causal relationship between species barriers, changes in PrPSc conformation, and the emergence of new prion strains."
https://openalex.org/W2130713036,"Recent studies have linked fetal exposure to a suboptimal intrauterine environment with adult hypertension. The aims of this study were twofold: 1) to see whether cortisol treatment administered to the ewe for 2 days at 27 days of gestation (term approximately 150 days) resulted in high blood pressure in offspring; 2) to study the effect of the same treatment on gene expression in the brain at 130 days of gestation and in lambs at 2 months of age. Mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the adult female and male offspring of sheep treated with cortisol than in the control group (females: 89+/-2 mmHg vs. 81+/-2; P<0.05 and males: 102+/-4 mmHg vs. 91+/-3; P<0.05). Prenatal cortisol treatment led to up-regulation of angiotensinogen, AT1, MR, and GR mRNA in the hippocampus in fetuses at 130 days of gestation but not in the animals at 2 months of age. This is the first evidence that short prenatal exposure to cortisol programmed high blood pressure in the adult female and male offspring of sheep. Altered gene expression in the hippocampus could have a significant effect on the development of the hippocampus, and on postnatal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2048446724,"The Neurospora crassa CYT-18 protein, the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, functions in splicing group I introns by inducing formation of the catalytically active RNA structure. Here, we identified a DEAD-box protein (CYT-19) that functions in concert with CYT-18 to promote group I intron splicing in vivo and vitro. CYT-19 does not bind specifically to group I intron RNAs and instead functions as an ATP-dependent RNA chaperone to destabilize nonnative RNA structures that constitute kinetic traps in the CYT-18-assisted RNA-folding pathway. Our results demonstrate that a DExH/D-box protein has a specific, physiologically relevant chaperone function in the folding of a natural RNA substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2109528706,"We studied the roles of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-Akt-BAD cascade, ERK-BAD cascade, and Akt-Raf-1 cascade in the paclitaxel-resistant SW626 human ovarian cancer cell line, which lacks functional p53. Treatment of SW626 cells with paclitaxel activates Akt and ERK with different time frames. Interference with the Akt cascade either by treatment with PI-3K inhibitor (wortmannin or LY294002) or by exogenous expression of a dominant negative Akt in SW626 cells caused decreased cell viability following treatment with paclitaxel. Interference with the ERK cascade by treatment with an MEK inhibitor, PD98059, in SW626 cells also caused decreased cell viability following treatment with paclitaxel. Treatment of cells with paclitaxel also stimulated the phosphorylation of BAD at both the Ser-112 and Ser-136 sites. The phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136 was blocked by treatment with wortmannin or cotransfection with the dominant negative Akt. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112 was blocked by PD98059. We further examined the role of BAD in the viability following paclitaxel treatment using BAD mutants. Exogenous expression of doubly substituted BAD2SA in SW626 cells caused decreased viability following treatment with paclitaxel. Moreover, because paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is mediated by activated Raf-1 and the region surrounding Ser-259 in Raf-1 conforms to a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by Akt, the regulation of Raf-1 by Akt was examined. We demonstrated an association between Akt and Raf-1 and showed that the phosphorylation of Raf-1 on Ser-259 induced by paclitaxel was blocked by treatment with wortmannin or LY294002. Furthermore, interference with the Akt cascade induced by paclitaxel up-regulated Raf-1 activity, and expression of constitutively active Akt inhibited Raf-1 activity, suggesting that Akt negatively regulates Raf-1. Our findings suggest that paclitaxel induces the phosphorylation of BAD Ser-112 via the ERK cascade, and the phosphorylation of both BAD Ser-136 and Raf-1 Ser-259 via the PI-3K-Akt cascade, and that inhibition of either of these cascades sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel.

Unlike other antimicrotubule agents, paclitaxel increases tubulin polymerization, stabilizes microtubules, and prevents tubulin depolymerization, ultimately causing tubulin bundling (3Kumar N. J.

These effects of the drug are correlated with the arrest of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, as well as cellular toxicity (5Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Jones R.J. Tucker R.W.

The inclusion of paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer has led to improved response rates and prolonged median survival compared with the results of prior regimens (8McGuire W.P.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients with advanced ovarian cancer are destined to relapse and subsequently to develop resistance to initially active drugs such as paclitaxel (9Cannistra S.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 1550-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance has been gained from a better understanding of the pathway of apoptosis. Apoptosis is the final common pathway of many if not all forms of chemotherapy-induced cell death (10Fisher D.E.

Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Molecules known to predispose cells to apoptosis have been shown to enhance sensitivity to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents that induce damage to DNA or to the mitotic spindle (10Fisher D.E.

Conversely, defects in the apoptotic pathway have been observed to confer insensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and may therefore represent an important mechanism for the development of chemoresistance (14Chao D.T.

The apoptotic response of a cell damaged by chemotherapy partly depends upon the balance between proteins that predispose to apoptosis, such as BAX, and proteins that antagonize apoptosis, such as Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 (20Oltvai Z.N.

Recently, a signaling pathway by which extracellular stimuli suppress apoptosis has been characterized. One of the first reports on survival signaling demonstrated an association between activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase cascade with survival in PC-12 cells (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Geenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Recent studies (23Liu Y. Bhalla K. Hill C. Priest D.G. Biochem.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that paclitaxel affects the activities of several intracellular tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases. For example, paclitaxel causes rapid activation of MAP kinase (26Ding A. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5596-5602PubMed Google Scholar). Another signaling pathway requiring phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) activity was shown to be associated with anti-apoptotic signaling in neurons, fibroblasts, and hematopoietic cells (27Minshall C. Arkins S. Freund G.G. Kelley K.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 29Yao R.

Subsequently, the serine/threonine kinase termed Akt or protein kinase B was identified as a downstream component of survival signaling through PI-3K (30Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J.

Recently BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was found to be a substrate of Akt, identifying an intersection point of pro- and anti-apoptotic regulatory cascades (37Datta S.R. Dudek H.

BAD is capable of forming heterodimers with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 and antagonizes their anti-apoptotic activity (44Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B.

Treatment with geldanamycin to deplete intracellular Raf-1 inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (25Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Ngyuen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L.

The kinase activity of Raf-1 (47Moelling K. Heimann B. Beimling P. Rapp U.R. Sander T. Nature. 1984; 312: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) is regulated by phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue (Ser-259) in the amino-terminal regulatory domain (48Morrison D.K. Cutler R.J., Jr. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The region surrounding Ser-259 in Raf-1 conforms to a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by Akt (49Alessi D.R. Candwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 50Meier R. Hemmings B.A. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was reported recently (51Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-259 in vivo inhibits Raf-1 kinase activity. However, the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel, which induces damage to the mitotic spindle, on the PI-3K-Akt-BAD cascade, the ERK-BAD cascade, and the association of Akt and Raf-1 have not yet been reported. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the PI-3K-Akt-BAD cascade, the ERK-BAD cascade, or the phosphorylation of Raf-1 by Akt plays a role in the cellular stress response to paclitaxel by using the paclitaxel-resistant SW626 human ovarian cancer cell line, which lacks functional p53. Here we provide evidence that paclitaxel induced the activation of Akt and ERK with different time frames, followed by phosphorylation of BAD. Paclitaxel also induced the phosphorylation and negative regulation of Raf-1 by Akt. Moreover, whereas inhibition of Raf-1 activity by geldanamycin markedly increased the cell viability following treatment with paclitaxel, inhibition of Akt and BAD markedly decreased the cell viability following treatment with paclitaxel.

Clonal selection was performed by adding geneticin to the medium at 200 μg/ml final concentration 2 days after the transfection. After 3 weeks, several clones were isolated using cloning rings. Selected clones were then maintained in medium supplemented with geneticin (100 μg/ml), and only low passage number cells (p < 10) were used for the experiments described here. For analysis of the levels of expressed Akt and BAD protein products, empty vector (CMV-6)- or AktK179M-expressing SW626 cells, or empty vector (pCDNA3)- and BAD2SA-expressing SW626 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were lysed in ice-cold HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (53Kimura A.

By the 5th day, the cells without treatment were growing exponentially and had achieved a density of 6.0–6.5 × 103 cells/well. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate, and the viability was expressed as the ratio of the number of viable cells with paclitaxel treatment to that without treatment.

We examined human lung EC barrier regulation elicited by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a recognized angiogenic factor and EC chemoattractant. HGF rapidly and dose-dependently elevated transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) of EC monolayers (>50% increase at 100 ng/ml), with immunofluorescence microscopic evidence of both cytoplasmic actin stress fiber dissolution and strong augmentation of the cortical actin ring. HGF rapidly stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C activities. Pharmacological inhibitor studies demonstrated each pathway to be intimately involved in HGF-induced increases in TER, cortical actin thickening, and phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a potential target for the HGF barrier-promoting response. GSK-3beta phosphorylation was strongly correlated with reductions in both HGF-induced TER and enhanced beta-catenin immunoreactivity observed at cell-cell junctions. Our data suggest a model in which HGF-mediated EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier enhancement depend critically on the activation of a complex kinase cascade that converges at GSK-3beta to increase the availability of beta-catenin, thereby enhancing endothelial junctional integrity and vascular barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W1995627779,"Several forms of motor learning, including classical conditioning of the eyeblink and nictitating membrane response (NMR), are dependent upon the cerebellum, but it is not known how motor memories are stored within the cerebellar circuitry. Localized infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol were used to target putative consolidation processes by producing reversible inactivations after NMR conditioning sessions. Posttraining inactivations of eyeblink control regions in cerebellar cortical lobule HVI completely prevented conditioning from developing over four sessions. In contrast, similar inactivations of eyeblink control regions in the cerebellar nuclei allowed conditioning to develop normally. These findings provide evidence that there are critical posttraining memory consolidation processes for eyeblink conditioning mediated by the cerebellar cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2080028075,"Heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) is an important virulence factor expressed by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The route of LT secretion through the outer membrane and the cellular and extracellular localization of secreted LT were examined. Using a fluorescently labeled receptor, LT was found to be specifically secreted onto the surface of wild type enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (GSP) was necessary and sufficient to localize LT to the bacterial surface in a K-12 strain. LT is a heteromeric toxin, and we determined that its cell surface localization was mediated by the its B subunit independent of an intact G(M1) ganglioside binding site and that LT binds lipopolysaccharide and G(M1) concurrently. The majority of LT secreted into the culture supernatant by the GSP in E. coli associated with vesicles. Only a mutation in hns, not overexpression of the GSP or LT, caused an increase in vesicle yield, supporting a specific vesicle formation machinery regulated by the nucleoid-associated protein HNS. We propose a model in which LT is secreted by the GSP across the outer membrane, secreted LT binds lipopolysaccharide via a G(M1)-independent binding region on its B subunit, and LT on the surface of released outer membrane vesicles interacts with host cell receptors, leading to intoxication. These data explain a novel mechanism of vesicle-mediated receptor-dependent delivery of a bacterial toxin into a host cell."

Fibroblasts seeded onto the cell-binding domain (CBD) fragment of FN attach but do not fully spread or form focal adhesions. Activation of Rho, with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), or protein kinase C, using the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or clustering of syndecan-4 with antibodies directed against its extracellular domain will stimulate formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in CBD-adherent fibroblasts. The distinct morphological differences between the cells adherent to the CBD and to full-length FN suggest that syndecan-4 may influence the organization of the focal adhesion or the activation state of the proteins that comprise it. FN-null fibroblasts (which express syndecan-4) exhibit reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) tyrosine 397 (Tyr397) when adherent to CBD compared with FN-adherent cells. Treating the CBD-adherent fibroblasts with LPA, to activate Rho, or the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate increased the level of phosphorylation of Tyr397 to match that of cells plated on FN. Treatment of the fibroblasts with PMA did not elicit such an effect. To confirm that this regulatory pathway includes syndecan-4 specifically, we examined fibroblasts derived from syndecan-4-null mice. The phosphorylation levels of FAK Tyr397 were lower in FN-adherent syndecan-4-null fibroblasts compared with syndecan-4-wild type and these levels were rescued by the addition of LPA or re-expression of syndecan-4. These data indicate that syndecan-4 ligation regulates the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr397 and that this mechanism is dependent on Rho but not protein kinase C activation.

Although all members of the syndecan family arose from a single ancestral gene, their expression patterns in tissues and during development are highly regulated (3Carey D.J. Biochem.

Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Comparison of the localization of syndecan-4 with the focal adhesion marker protein vinculin suggests that syndecan-4 does not localize to newly formed contacts but with more established adhesion sites (18Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are macromolecular complexes that localize to sites of closest contact (10–15 nm) between cells and the underlying extracellular matrix substrate (reviewed in Refs. 19Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 20Zamir E. Geiger B. J.

Focal adhesions are composed of transmembrane receptors (primarily syndecan-4 and members of the integrin superfamily), structural molecules (such as actin, talin, tensin, vinculin, and α-actinin), and signaling molecules (i.e. focal adhesion kinase (FAK), PKC, and Src). Focal adhesions, therefore, serve not only as structural supports but also as signaling conduits between the actin cytoskeleton and the surrounding environment of the cell. The generation of focal adhesions in fibronectin (FN)-adherent cells is dependent on the ligation of two different transmembrane receptors: integrins and syndecan-4. Fibroblasts seeded on the cell-binding domain (CBD) of FN (which contains only the integrin-binding RGD sequence) will attach but not form focal adhesions or actin stress fibers (22Woods A.

The addition of an antibody against the extracellular domain of syndecan-4 stimulates focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in cells plated on the CBD (24Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F.

The syndecan-4 signal can be bypassed in CBD-adherent fibroblasts by directly stimulating the small GTPase Rho with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (24Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K.

These data indicate that syndecan-4 acts in cooperation with the α5β1 integrin to direct focal adhesion formation and that the action of syndecan-4 is through a Rho-dependent mechanism (24Saoncella S.

The generation of syndecan-4-null mice demonstrated no initial obvious phenotype and showed, surprisingly, that cells seeded onto FN will form stress fibers and focal adhesions in the absence of syndecan-4 (25Ishiguro K.

Treatment of CBD-adherent syndecan-4-null fibroblasts with antibodies to syndecan-4 do not form focal adhesions or stress fibers although wild type fibroblasts do, suggesting that the syndecan-4 signaling pathway can be selectively activated and does not function in the syndecan-4-null cells (25Ishiguro K.

Interestingly, further studies have documented that syndecan-4-null mice do not respond to physiological insults as well as their wild type counterparts implying that syndecan-4 may be important in combating “stress situations” (26Echtermeyer F.

Syndecan-4-null mice exhibit a delay in wound healing and this deficiency appears to be due to an impairment in cell migration that can also be demonstrated in in vitro migration assays (26Echtermeyer F.

Impaired cell migration may be because of the inability of cells to either generate enough force to propel themselves over an underlying substrate or to disengage established adhesion contacts to promote new adhesions (29Palecek S.P.

Although many focal adhesion-associated proteins are involved in cell migration, the tyrosine kinase FAK has been shown to be intimately involved in focal adhesion turnover (30Ilic D. Furuta Y.

A nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, FAK, is composed of a central catalytic domain flanked by two noncatalytic regions (37Zachary I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FAK contains multiple tyrosine residues that, upon their phosphorylation, are capable of binding proteins containing SH2 domains. Tyrosine 397 (Tyr397) is a critical phosphorylation site that results from autophosphorylation upon antibody-induced clustering of cell-surface integrins or cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (such as collagen, fibronectin, and vitronectin) (Refs. 38Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

The unlikely possibility that all of these proteins bind FAK simultaneously suggests that distinct FAK-containing signaling complexes probably exist within the focal adhesion (47Schaller M.D. Biochim.

The phosphorylation of the remaining tyrosine residues (407, 576, 577, 861, and 925) occurs in a Src-dependent manner (48Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

Closer examination of early adhesion events documented initial FAK phosphorylation occurring in a Rho-independent manner followed by Rho-mediated FAK phosphorylation (58Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recently, Ren et al. (31Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that FAK-null cells exhibit constitutive activation of Rho and this activity level is inversely correlated with focal adhesion turnover. They reintroduced FAK to the deficient cells and showed that Rho activity was restored to normal levels. This suggests that FAK is responsible for the transient inhibition of Rho during early cell spreading (31Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate that reciprocal interactions may occur between FAK and Rho to facilitate cell spreading and focal adhesion and stress fiber formation. General FAK phosphorylation levels increase during early cell spreading (59Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) but maximal phosphorylation requires both the integrin-binding and heparin-binding domains of FN (60Jeong J. Han I. Lim Y.

We now demonstrate that increased phosphorylation of FAK Tyr397 is dependent on syndecan-4 ligation, and that the syndecan-4 signal may be superseded by direct activation of Rho. Three types of cells were used in this study. Fibronectin-null cells which express syndecan-4 (24Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F.

These cells are referred to as FN-null and syndecan-4-WT or syndecan-4-null, respectively. All cell types were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For experimental assays, 1.5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish were seeded in serum overnight and subsequently serum starved for 18 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline minus calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (PBS, Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and lifted from the dishes with a 1:1 dilution of PBS/EDTA and 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). The tissue culture plates and glass coverslips used for the experiments were coated with either 30 μg/ml FN (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or 10 μg/ml CBD (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates and coverslips were then washed with PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature, and given a final wash before the cells were seeded. The fibroblasts were allowed to attach and spread for 3 h in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Following this incubation the cell medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing either 500 ng/ml LPA (Sigma), 250 nmphorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma), 0.5 mm sodium vanadate (Sigma), or medium alone for 30 (for the FN-null cells) or 60 min (for the syndecan-4-WT and syndecan-4-null cells). All experiments were done on cultures that were 50% confluent. Syndecan-4-null fibroblasts were transiently transfected with the rat syndecan-4 cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1 Hygro (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1 Hygro alone using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of protein expression was ascertained by heparitinase I treating the transfected cell lysates following a protocol by Rapraeger and Ott (62Rapraeger A.C. Ott V.L. J. Biol.

Fibroblasts were placed on ice and washed twice with cold PBS containing calcium chloride and magnesium chloride and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The cells were lysed with an extraction buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate (pH 7.3), 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (63Xu F. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min (4 °C) to remove insoluble material and protein concentration was determined. Equal protein concentrations were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (clone PY20) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The polyclonal FAK and phosphospecific FAK Tyr397 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and the α-actinin antibody was purchased from Sigma. After washing the blots, secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were added for 60 min at room temperature. The membranes were subsequently washed again and detection of signal was obtained using the West Pico enhanced chemiluminescent kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). Figures are representative results of experiments that were performed at least three times. Syndecan-4-WT and syndecan-4-null cells were seeded on glass coverslips at a concentration of 9,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate for 3 h in serum-free medium and then incubated for an additional 60 min in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml LPA or 250 nm PMA or an additional 2 h in the presence or absence of 15 μg/ml C3 exotransferase (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized for 10 min with cold 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with a monoclonal FAK antibody (clone 4.47, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:50) or polyclonal phosphospecific FAK Tyr397 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:50) and a monoclonal vinculin antibody (clone hVIN-1, Sigma; 1:400) diluted in 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C. For experiments in which the monoclonal antibodies to FAK and vinculin were to be used, the vinculin antibody was directly conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate using a protein labeling kit (Pierce) and incubated with the cells subsequent to incubation of the FAK primary antibody and the appropriate secondary antibody to prevent cross-reactivity. All reagents and antibodies were diluted in Small’s buffer (64Small J.V. Celis J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 31: 393-409PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed for 60 min with Small’s buffer and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells received final washes for 1 h, and were mounted on slides and visualized using a Leica TCS NT4D confocal imaging system with a ×40 oil-immersion lens (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). During double labeling experiments there was no evidence of bleed-through between channels. Cell images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Images represent typical staining patterns from multiple experiments. Syndecan-4-null and WT fibroblasts were seeded on FN-coated 150-mm tissue culture dishes at a concentration of 1.6 × 106 cells/dish. Following adhesion and incubation with LPA, as described above, the cells were processed using the Rho Activation Assay kit (purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with beads conjugated to the Rho-binding domain of the Rhotekin protein (which only binds GTP-bound Rho (65Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G.

The beads were then washed three times and the samples were resolved on a 16% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and incubated with a polyclonal Rho antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. A membrane containing identical amounts of protein used in the Rho activation assay was incubated with polyclonal antibodies to Rho (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and actin (Sigma) to serve as loading controls. The blots were washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, and exposed to film following treatment with the West Pico enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce).

Single-unit activity was obtained from alert adult rats that did not to whisk upon application of punctate, rhythmic stimulation of individual vibrissae. The spike response of units in S1 cortex largely reproduced the shape of the stimulus. In contrast, the spiking output of units in M1 cortex were modulated solely as a sinusoid at the repetition rate of the stimulus for frequencies between 5 and 15 Hz; this range corresponds to that of natural whisking. Thus, the S1 to M1 transformation extracts the fundamental frequency from a spectrally rich stimulus. We discuss our results in terms of a band-pass filter with a center frequency that adapts to the change in stimulation rate."
https://openalex.org/W2045223441,"Dopamine release is activated by ethanol and addicting drugs, but molecular mechanisms linking dopaminergic signaling to neuronal responses and drinking behavior are poorly understood. We report that dopamine-D2 receptors induce PKA Cα translocation and increase CRE-regulated gene expression. Ethanol also activates PKA signaling. Subthreshold concentrations of the D2 agonist NPA and ethanol, without effect alone, together cause synergistic PKA translocation and CRE-mediated gene transcription. D2 or adenosine A2 receptor blockade, pertussis toxin, Rp-cAMPS, or overexpression of dominant-negative peptides that sequester βγ dimers prevent synergy. Importantly, overexpression of a βγ inhibitor peptide in the nucleus accumbens strikingly reduces sustained alcohol consumption. We propose that synergy of D2 and A2 confers ethanol hypersensitivity and that βγ dimers are required for voluntary drinking."
https://openalex.org/W2126007769,"The regulation of cation content is critical for cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that gate the systems that control K+ movements remain unclear. KTN is a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain present ubiquitously in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic K+ channels and transporters. Here we report crystal structures for two representative KTN domains that reveal a dimeric hinged assembly. Alternative ligands NAD+ and NADH block or vacate, respectively, the hinge region affecting the dimer's conformational flexibility. Conserved, surface-exposed hydrophobic patches that become coplanar upon hinge closure provide an assembly interface for KTN tetramerization. Mutational analysis using the KefC system demonstrates that this domain directly interacts with its respective transmembrane constituent, coupling ligand-mediated KTN conformational changes to the permease's activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994869819,"Our previous data showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression via repression of gene transcription in lung cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which NSAIDs inhibit MMP-2. Promoter deletion and mutation analysis indicate that NSAIDs act via the Sp1 transcription factor binding site located between -91 and -84 in the MMP-2 promoter to suppress gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that Sp1 and Sp3 proteins constitutively bind to this consensus sequence and overexpression of Sp1 may enhance MMP-2 expression. NSAID treatment reduces Sp1 DNA binding activity and phosphorylation and attenuates MMP-2 expression. We also investigate the signaling pathway that mediates the effect of NSAIDs. Our results suggest that ERKs are involved in this process. First, NSAIDs suppress basal and serum-stimulated ERK activity. Second, a MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibits MMP-2 promoter activity and Sp1 phosphorylation. Third, overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 stimulates Sp1 phosphorylation and MMP-2 promoter activity and antagonizes the inhibition of NSAIDs. Collectively, our data suggest that NSAIDs inhibit MMP-2 by blocking ERK/Sp1-mediated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1993700780,"There is controversy whether or not upstream stimulatory factors (USF) regulate the glucose responsiveness of L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter activity in hepatocytes. It has been suggested that USF-2 is required for glucose stimulation of L-PK promoter activity in single islet β-cells and INS-1 cells (Kennedy, H. J., Viollet, B., Rafiq, I., Kahn, A., and Rutter, G. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20636–20640). In the present study, the tet-on system has been employed to achieve tightly controlled and inducible expression of USF-1 and -2 and their dominant-negative mutants DN-USF-1 (ΔbTDU1) and -2 (TDU2) in INS-1 cells. Quantitative Northern blot analysis shows that neither basal level nor glucose responsiveness of endogenous L-PK mRNA is affected by overexpression of USF-1 and -2. Likewise, the L-PK expression is unaltered by dominant-negative suppression of USF function. Western blotting demonstrates that USF-1 and -2 and DN-USF-1 and -2 proteins are stably expressed in nuclear fractions of INS-1 cells. Immunofluorescence staining indicates the uniform induction of these transgene-encoded proteins in the cell nuclei. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the L-PK promoter segment reveal that induction of USF-1 and -2 dramatically enhances the USF binding activity, whereas DN-USF-1 and -2 abolish binding. DN-USF-1 and -2 exert their dominant-negative effect by forming non-functional heterodimers with endogenous USF proteins. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) was recently shown to regulate the glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter activity in hepatocytes. We now report the presence of this transcription factor in rat islets and INS-1 cells. Glucose stimulates ChREBP transcription in INS-1 cells, as shown by nuclear run-on experiments. Overexpression of ChREBP in INS-1 cells using the tet-on system results in a left shift of glucose responsiveness of L-PK expression and an enhanced L-PK promoter activity. Both endogenous and doxycycline-induced ChREBP proteins bind to the L-PK promoter in a glucose-dependent manner. These unprecedented results suggest that ChREBP rather than USF mediates glucose-promoted L-PK expression in insulin-secreting cells.

A carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) containing the E-box sequence CACGTG separated by 5 bp has been located in the L-PK promoter (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M.

Accordingly it has been postulated that a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (b/HLH/LZ) family of transcription factors may be involved in carbohydrate-mediated regulation (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M.

Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative form of USF in INS-1 cells failed to block the glucose-induced L-PK promoter activity and again negated the involvement of USF in glucose-regulation in INS-1 cells. The present study was aimed to clarify these conflicting results. We employed the tet-on system (10Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) in INS-1 cells to achieve tightly controlled and conditional expression of USF-1 and -2 and their dominant-negative mutants (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M.

These stable cell clones allowed evaluation of the involvement of USF in the regulation of endogenous L-PK mRNA levels at various concentrations of glucose.Recent studies showed that a ChoRE-binding protein (ChREBP), another member of b/HLH/LZ family, bound to the L-PK promoter in a glucose-dependent manner and that transient transfection of primary hepatocytes with ChREBP led to increased L-PK promoter activity (8Kawaguchi T.

We provide the first direct evidence that ChREBP left shifts the glucose responsiveness of endogenous L-PK expression in INS-1 cells engineered for inducible ChREBP action.DISCUSSIONThere is controversy regarding the role of USF in the regulation of glucose-stimulated L-PK expression in hepatocytes, pancreatic β-cells, and INS-1 cells (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M.

This could be secondary to alterations in expression of USF-2-target genes such as the liver glucokinase. USF positively regulates the expression of this gene (19Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microinjection of USF antibodies into the nuclei of INS-1 cells could have pleiotropic effects on the L-PK promoter luciferase activity (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Indeed, this work (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is strongly challenged by Kaytor et al. (7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who suggest that adenovirus-mediated expression of DN-USF does not interfere with glucose-induced L-PK promoter activity. Unfortunately, the expression level and cellular localization of DN-USF in the latter study was not monitored (7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The present study was designed to assess the role of USF in the regulation of glucose-induced L-PK expression in a more controlled manner. We established four stable INS-1-derived clones, permitting inducible expression of USF-1 and -2 and DN-USF-1 and -2, respectively. The expression level and cellular localization of these transgene-encoded proteins are well documented in our study. We also showed that these nuclear localized USF and DN-USF proteins are induced homogeneously in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that induction of USF-1 and -2 led to an over-10-fold increase in the USF binding to the L-PK ChoRE, whereas induction of DN-USF-1 and -2 abolished endogenous USF binding activity. Moreover, we illustrated with EMSA that DN-USF-1 exerts its dominant-negative action by forming non-functional heterodimers with endogenous USF, while DN-USF-2 forms predominantly homodimers to compete for the cognate DNA binding. Finally, using quantitative Northern blot analysis we evaluated the consequences of up- and down-regulation of USF function on glucose responsiveness of endogenous L-PK mRNA. We conclude that USF has no effect on either basal or glucose-stimulated L-PK expression in INS-1 cells. Consistently, induction of USF2 or DN-USF2 does not affect the L-PK promoter activity in INS-1 cells, which supports the study of Kaytor et al.(7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but contradicts the report of Kennedy et al. (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that a novel b/HLH/LZ transcription factor distinct from USF regulates the glucose response of the L-PK promoter (20Koo S.H.

A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) purified this protein based on its ability to bind to the L-PK ChoRE and identified it as ChREBP by sequencing the digested peptides. In addition, ChREBP binds to the L-PK promoter and translocates to the nucleus of hepatocytes in a glucose-dependent manner (8Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Furthermore, overexpression of ChREBP in primary hepatocytes by transient transfection causes enhanced glucose-induced L-PK promoter activity (8Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,9Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The present study includes the following novel findings. We showed that ChREBP is also expressed in rat islets and INS-1 cells. More importantly, we found that glucose stimulates the expression of ChREBP at the transcriptional level in INS-1 cells. Our results provide the first direct evidence that ChREBP induces the expression of endogenous L-PK mRNA in insulin-secreting cells by activating the L-PK promoter activity. Furthermore, in INS-1 cells both endogenous and doxycycline-induced ChREBP proteins bind to the L-PK promoter in response to glucose. It has been well documented in hepatocytes that glucose activates the nuclear translocation of ChREBP protein by dephosphorylation of Ser196 in the cytoplasm and also stimulates the DNA binding activity by dephosphorylation of Thr666 in the nucleus (8Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether similar mechanisms also apply to INS-1 cells.We therefore conclude that ChREBP rather than USF regulates the glucose responsiveness of L-PK expression in INS-1 cells. It is possible that a similar mechanism participates in the regulation of other glucose-sensitive genes in hepatocytes and β-cells. A set of glucose-responsive genes in hepatocytes has evolved to control the conversion of glucose into triglycerides, when food is sufficient, for storing energy to be used during fasting (1Towle H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13476-13478Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The pancreatic β-cell responds to increased glucose metabolism by releasing insulin, which is essential for maintaining glucose and fatty acid homeostasis (1Towle H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13476-13478Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK)1 represents a typical glucose-responsive gene in both hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells (2Marie S.

We showed that ChREBP is also expressed in rat islets and INS-1 cells. More importantly, we found that glucose stimulates the expression of ChREBP at the transcriptional level in INS-1 cells. Our results provide the first direct evidence that ChREBP induces the expression of endogenous L-PK mRNA in insulin-secreting cells by activating the L-PK promoter activity. Furthermore, in INS-1 cells both endogenous and doxycycline-induced ChREBP proteins bind to the L-PK promoter in response to glucose. It has been well documented in hepatocytes that glucose activates the nuclear translocation of ChREBP protein by dephosphorylation of Ser196 in the cytoplasm and also stimulates the DNA binding activity by dephosphorylation of Thr666 in the nucleus (8Kawaguchi T.

It remains to be established whether similar mechanisms also apply to INS-1 cells.We therefore conclude that ChREBP rather than USF regulates the glucose responsiveness of L-PK expression in INS-1 cells. It is possible that a similar mechanism participates in the regulation of other glucose-sensitive genes in hepatocytes and β-cells. There is controversy regarding the role of USF in the regulation of glucose-stimulated L-PK expression in hepatocytes, pancreatic β-cells, and INS-1 cells (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A.

Two groups showed contradictory results of the L-PK reporter enzyme activity using transient transfection of hepatocytes with USF and DN-USF (3Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B.

(6Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol.

This could be secondary to alterations in expression of USF-2-target genes such as the liver glucokinase. USF positively regulates the expression of this gene (19Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microinjection of USF antibodies into the nuclei of INS-1 cells could have pleiotropic effects on the L-PK promoter luciferase activity (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and data showing diminished luciferase activity should therefor be interpreted with caution. Indeed, this work (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is strongly challenged by Kaytor et al. (7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who suggest that adenovirus-mediated expression of DN-USF does not interfere with glucose-induced L-PK promoter activity. Unfortunately, the expression level and cellular localization of DN-USF in the latter study was not monitored (7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was designed to assess the role of USF in the regulation of glucose-induced L-PK expression in a more controlled manner. We established four stable INS-1-derived clones, permitting inducible expression of USF-1 and -2 and DN-USF-1 and -2, respectively. The expression level and cellular localization of these transgene-encoded proteins are well documented in our study. We also showed that these nuclear localized USF and DN-USF proteins are induced homogeneously in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that induction of USF-1 and -2 led to an over-10-fold increase in the USF binding to the L-PK ChoRE, whereas induction of DN-USF-1 and -2 abolished endogenous USF binding activity. Moreover, we illustrated with EMSA that DN-USF-1 exerts its dominant-negative action by forming non-functional heterodimers with endogenous USF, while DN-USF-2 forms predominantly homodimers to compete for the cognate DNA binding. Finally, using quantitative Northern blot analysis we evaluated the consequences of up- and down-regulation of USF function on glucose responsiveness of endogenous L-PK mRNA. We conclude that USF has no effect on either basal or glucose-stimulated L-PK expression in INS-1 cells. Consistently, induction of USF2 or DN-USF2 does not affect the L-PK promoter activity in INS-1 cells, which supports the study of Kaytor et al.(7Kaytor E.N. Qian J. Towle H.C. Olson L.K. Mol Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but contradicts the report of Kennedy et al. (5Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that a novel b/HLH/LZ transcription factor distinct from USF regulates the glucose response of the L-PK promoter (20Koo S.H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057990672,"Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals have been implicated in the pathogenic growth of various cell types. The molecular mechanisms involved in redox-sensitive cell growth control are poorly understood. Stimulation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with xanthin/xanthin oxidase (X/XO) increases proliferation, whereas stimulation with hydrogen peroxide and Fe3+NTA (H-Fe) causes growth arrest of VSMC. Differential Display led to the identification of two novel, differentially regulated redox-sensitive genes. The dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein Id3 is induced by X/XO and down-regulated by H-Fe. The transcription factor gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor (GKLF) is induced by H-Fe but not by X/XO. Induction of GKLF and inhibition of Id3 via transfection experiments leads to growth arrest, whereas overexpression of Id3 and inhibition of GKLF cause cell growth. Id3 down-regulation is induced via binding of GKLF to the Id3 promotor and concomitantly reduced Id3 gene transcription rate. GKLF induction by H-Fe is mediated through hydroxyl radicals, p38MAP kinase-, calcium-, and protein synthesis-dependent pathways. Id3 is induced by X/XO via superoxide, calcium, p38, and p42/44 MAP kinase. GKLF induces and Id3 depresses expression of p21WAF1/Cip1, p27KIP1, p53. Induction of Id3 is accomplished by angiotensin II via superoxide release. A vascular injury mouse model revealed that Id3 is overexpressed in proliferating vascular tissue in vivo. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of redox-controlled cellular proliferation involving GKLF and Id3 that may have general implications for our understanding of vascular and nonvascular growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1990098395,"Phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 subunit is tightly correlated with enhanced translation initiation of a subset of mRNAs that encodes components of the protein synthesis machinery, which is an important early event that controls mammalian cell growth and proliferation. The recently identified S6 kinase 2 (S6K2), together with its homologue S6K1, is likely responsible for the mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of S6. Like S6K1, the activation of S6K2 requires signaling from both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here we report the investigation of the mechanisms of S6K2 regulation by mTOR. We demonstrate that similar to S6K1 the serum activation of S6K2 in cells is dependent on mTOR kinase activity, amino acid sufficiency, and phosphatidic acid. Previously we have shown that mTOR is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein. As a predominantly nuclear protein, S6K2 activation was facilitated by enhanced mTOR nuclear import with the tagging of an exogenous nuclear localization signal and diminished by enhanced mTOR nuclear export with the tagging of a nuclear export sequence. However, further increase of mTOR nuclear import by the tagging of four copies of nuclear localization signal resulted in its decreased ability to activate S6K2, suggesting that mTOR nuclear export may also be an integral part of the activation process. Consistently, the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B inhibited S6K2 activation. Taken together, our observations suggest a novel regulatory mechanism in which an optimal cytoplasmic-nuclear distribution or shuttling rate for mTOR is required for maximal activation of the nuclear S6K2.

Hornstein E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 671-694Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 subunit is correlated with 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-dependent translation initiation, and the 70-kDa S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase responsible for mitogen-stimulated S6 phosphorylation (2Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-718Google Scholar). In addition to playing an essential role in regulating cell growth, S6K1 appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in other cellular processes such as anti-apoptosis (3Harada H. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Terada N. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and RNA processing (4Wilson K.F., Wu, W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37307-37310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two parallel pathways are both required for activation of S6K1, and they are mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), respectively (2Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-718Google Scholar, 5Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). While the PI3K pathway transduces mitogenic signals to S6K1, the mTOR pathway is believed to sense amino acid sufficiency and play a permissive role to govern S6K1 activation by PI3K signals (6Hara K.

Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of mTOR is required, but not sufficient, for signaling to downstream effectors including S6K1 (11Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 12Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Most recently we have found that phosphatidic acid, likely produced by phospholipase D, directly mediates mitogenic stimulation of mTOR signaling to S6K1 (13Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Thus, mTOR appears to regulate S6K1 by integrating nutrient and mitogen signals. We have also reported that mTOR is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and this shuttling is involved in S6K1 regulation. Specifically, the constant nuclear entry and exit of mTOR is necessary for mitogenic activation of S6K1 (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), although the shuttling itself does not seem to be regulated by any known upstream signals. 2J. E. Kim, R. Bachmann, and J. Chen, unpublished observation. 2J. E. Kim, R. Bachmann, and J. Chen, unpublished observation. Targeted gene disruption of S6K1 in mice led to a reduced animal size, implicating S6K1 in cell growth and cell size regulation (15Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but S6 phosphorylation and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-dependent translation were normal in the S6K1-deficient cells (15Shima H.

S6K1 and S6K2 are highly homologous in the kinase domain and adjacent regulatory region, and sequence diversity occurs mainly in the N and C termini. The most notable difference between these two proteins is their subcellular localization. Alternative splicing at the N terminus gives rise to two isoforms for both S6K1 (p70 S6K1αII and p85 S6K1αI) and S6K2 (p60 S6K2βI and p54 S6K2βII). p70 S6K1 is cytosolic, whereas p85 S6K1 is nuclear due to the unique N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) (20Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both S6K2 isoforms are predominantly nuclear due to an NLS in the C termini of the proteins (18Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The differential subcellular localization of S6K1 (p70, αII) and S6K2 suggests potentially distinct regulatory mechanisms and/or diverse downstream effectors. Like S6K1, the activation of S6K2 requires both the PI3K pathway and the mTOR pathway (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J.

Here we report the investigation of S6K2 regulation by mTOR. We show that S6K2 activation requires the kinase activity of mTOR, is dependent on amino acid sufficiency, and involves phosphatidic acid (PA). Furthermore, our data suggest that an optimal rate of mTOR cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling gives rise to maximal activation of S6K2. All cell culture media were from Invitrogen.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and monkey kidney epithelial CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK293 cells or CV-1 cells were transfected in six-well plates at ∼ 60% confluence with PolyFect according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). For co-transfection, 1.5 μg of mTOR DNA and 0.5 μg of S6K2 DNA were used. Whenever applicable, pCDNA3 empty vector DNA was used to ensure a constant total DNA amount in each transfection. For all starvation and stimulation experiments, HEK293 cells in six-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of S6K2 DNA for 24 h and then incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h followed by incubation in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered solution for 2 h if amino acid deprivation was desired. For PA stimulation, 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid in chloroform was dried under N2 and resuspended by vortexing for 2 min in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). The freshly made PA solution was immediately added to cell culture for stimulation at a final concentration of 100 μm. CV-1 cells grown on glass cover slips were transfected for 24 h in 12-well plates with 1 μg of mTOR DNA or 0.5 μg of S6K2 DNA using PolyFect (Qiagen). Whenever applicable, the cells were treated with 10 nm LMB for various times prior to fixation. The transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with the primary antibody (2 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin and phosphate-buffered saline) followed by incubation with FITC-anti-mouse IgG antibody (10 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin and phosphate-buffered saline). The fluorescent images were obtained with a Leica fluorescent microscope or a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. For S6 kinase assays, transfected or untransfected HEK293 or CV-1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m KCl, and 0.3% Triton X-100) followed by immunoprecipitation using the 16B12 anti-HA antibody. The kinase assays were performed with the immune complexes as described previously for S6K1 (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For mTOR auto-kinase assays, transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (24Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. In HEK293 cells, activation of a recombinant S6K2 by serum was abolished by rapamycin treatment (Fig.1A), consistent with several previous reports (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J.

To confirm the critical role of mTOR in S6K2 activation, we introduced a rapamycin-resistant mTOR (S2035T) together with S6K2 by transient transfection. Indeed, S6K2 activation in the presence of rapamycin was significantly restored by the rapamycin-resistant mTOR (Fig. 1B), indicating that mTOR is the sole mediator of the rapamycin effect. A kinase-dead mTOR mutant (D2357E) failed to confer rapamycin resistance to S6K2 (Fig.1B), suggesting that the kinase activity of mTOR is required for activation of S6K2. Amino acid depletion leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of S6K1 in a reversible manner via the mTOR pathway (6Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 7Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To test whether amino acid sufficiency is also required for S6K2 activation, we examined the effect of amino acid deprivation on S6K2 activity. Amino acid withdrawal for 2 h in serum-starved HEK293 cells completely inhibited the ability of serum to stimulate S6K2 activation, and amino acid readdition restored the activation of S6K2 by serum (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that the response of S6K2 to mitogens is dependent on amino acid sufficiency. Most recently we have shown that phosphatidic acid mediates mitogenic activation of mTOR signaling to S6K1 and 4E-BP1, likely by binding to the FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR (13Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of S6K2 regulation by mTOR, we examined the involvement of PA in S6K2 activation. Mitogenic stimulation may result in phospholipase D-mediated increase of PA production, which can be blocked by low concentrations of primary alcohols due to the production of phosphatidylalcohol at the expense of PA (25Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3A, the serum-stimulated S6K2 activation was significantly blocked by 0.3% 1-butanol, which inhibited serum-induced PA production in these cells (Fig.3B) (13Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Under identical conditions, the activation of Erk and Akt was analyzed by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies. Neither Erk nor Akt was affected by butanol treatment (Fig.3C). Hence, the butanol effect was highly specific for S6K2, and it suggested the role of PA in the regulation of S6K2. In addition, exogenous PA stimulated S6K2 activation in the absence of serum (Fig.3D), further supporting the direct involvement of PA in S6K2 activation. The activation of S6K2 by PA was abolished by rapamycin, confirming the involvement of mTOR. Wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, also completely inhibited S6K2 activation by PA (Fig.3D), implying that a basal level of PI3K activity is required for the PA effect since under the same conditions PA does not stimulate PI3K (13Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of PA to stimulate S6K2 activity is fully dependent on amino acid sufficiency as PA had no effect in the absence of amino acids with or without serum (Fig.3E). Therefore, the activation of S6K2 likely requires three parallel pathways: the amino acid-sensing mTOR pathway, the mitogen-activated PI3K pathway, and the mitogen-activated PA-mTOR pathway (presumably mediated by phospholipase D). Previously we have reported that mTOR is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein and that this shuttling appears to be required for S6K1 activation (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Given the distinct subcellular localization of S6K1 and S6K2, the effect of mTOR localization on S6K2 activity might be different from that on S6K1. Interestingly, LMB (27Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear exporter Crm1 (28Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), inhibited S6K2 activity by about 50% (Fig.4A). The recombinant S6K2 was mostly localized in the nucleus, and the localization was not changed by LMB (Fig. 4B). It is thus possible that the nuclear export or shuttling of an upstream activator of S6K2 may be required for S6K2 activation. mTOR is a candidate for such an activator since LMB sequestered mTOR in the nucleus (Fig. 4C). To specifically examine the potential involvement of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of mTOR in S6K2 activation, we made use of two previously engineered mTOR constructs (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) tagged with the SV40 NLS (29Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) and the human immunodeficiency virus Rev nuclear export sequence (NES) (30Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), respectively. The ability of these mTOR variants to activate S6K2in vivo was examined by co-transfection with epitope-tagged S6K2 into CV-1 cells followed by immunoprecipitation of recombinant S6K2 and subsequent in vitro kinase assays. All the mTOR cDNA constructs contained the rapamycin resistance S2035T mutation, and all experiments were carried out in rapamycin-treated cells to eliminate endogenous mTOR signaling (11Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild type, NLS-mTOR enhanced S6K2 kinase activation, whereas NES-mTOR led to a decreased S6K2 kinase activity (Fig.5). These observations are similar to those made with S6K1, although S6K1 and S6K2 are differentially localized in the cell. Since S6K2 is primarily a nuclear protein, its enhanced activation by NLS-mTOR and diminished activation by NES-mTOR could be simply due to mTOR activation of S6K2 in the nucleus. An alternative mechanism involves the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of mTOR. To distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed mTOR in which two or four copies of NLS (2xNLS or 4xNLS, respectively) were tagged at the N terminus. If the nuclear entry of mTOR is sufficient to activate S6K2, increased S6K2 activation would be expected to correlate with enhanced mTOR nuclear import. On the other hand, if nuclear export of mTOR is also required, overenhanced mTOR nuclear import might have a negative impact on S6K2. The subcellular localization of the recombinant mTOR engineered to alter its nuclear import activity was examined in CV-1 cells by indirect immunofluorescent staining (Fig.6A). As reported previously (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) a small fraction of the wild-type mTOR protein was found in the nucleus. An even distribution between cytoplasm and nucleus was found for NLS-mTOR in 60% of the cells, whereas 60% of the 4xNLS-mTOR-expressing cells displayed mostly nuclear (30%) or almost exclusively nuclear (30%) staining. In both the NLS-mTOR- and 4xNLS-mTOR-expressing cells, about 40% of the population displayed mTOR localization similar to the wild type (data not shown). The extent of the nuclear localization of 2xNLS-mTOR was intermediate compared with those of NLS-mTOR and 4xNLS-mTOR (data not shown). Therefore, all the mTOR variants behaved as expected in their subcellular localization. The change in subcellular localization did not affect the catalytic activity of mTOR as all the mutants displayed in vitro auto-kinase activity comparable to the wild type when transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated (Fig.6B). The ability of the nuclear import-enhanced mTOR mutants to activate S6K2 was then examined by co-expressing mTOR with recombinant S6K2 in CV-1 cells that were treated with rapamycin, again taking advantage of the S2035T mutation in all the cDNA constructs to eliminate endogenous mTOR signaling. The tagging of one and two copies of NLS progressively increased the extent of S6K2 activation, but 4xNLS activated S6K2 to a lesser degree than NLS (Fig.7). These observations suggest that the nuclear entry of mTOR alone is not sufficient to activate S6K2. Instead, an optimal rate of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of mTOR may be required. The rapamycin sensitivity of S6K2 has been a controversial issue. While several groups reported a complete blockage of S6K2 activity by low concentrations of rapamycin (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J.

Commun. 1998; 253: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), one group observed a partial resistance of S6K2 activity to rapamycin at concentrations up to 200 nm (16Gout I. Minami T.

Shirai Y. Saito N. Gout I. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have found that in HEK293 and CV-1 cells S6K2 (βII isoform) activity was completely inhibited by 100 nm rapamycin (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In addition, amino acid withdrawal abolished S6K2 activation by serum, contrary to the report by Minami et al.(31Minami T. Hara K. Oshiro N. Ueoku S. Yoshino K. Tokunaga C. Shirai Y. Saito N. Gout I. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and readdition of amino acids restored serum stimulation of S6K2 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the activation of S6K2 is dependent on mTOR kinase activity (Fig. 1B). The difference in amino acid requirement may be attributed to the two different isoforms of S6K2 that we (βII) and Minami et al.(βI, Ref. 31Minami T. Hara K. Oshiro N. Ueoku S. Yoshino K. Tokunaga C. Shirai Y. Saito N. Gout I. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) studied. However, it is not clear what gave rise to the discrepancy in the effect of rapamycin on S6K2. The βII isoform with an optimal Kozak sequence surrounding the start codon (16Gout I. Minami T. Hara K.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as well as ours, were carried out with transiently expressed S6K2 in HEK293 cells. Thus, no obvious explanation can be found for the discrepancy in rapamycin sensitivity of S6K2; subtle differences in cell culture and/or assay conditions may be responsible but are not assessable from the published information. The recent finding that PA mediates mitogenic activation of mTOR signaling to S6K1 and 4E-BP1 has uncovered a previously unexpected regulatory mode for mTOR (13Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). We now report that S6K2 is also regulated by PA as S6K2 was inhibited by a low concentration of butanol in serum-stimulated cells and activated by exogenous PA in serum-starved cells (Fig. 3). Although implicated by the effect of 1-butanol, the involvement of phospholipase D in S6K2 and S6K1 activation is yet to be definitively proven and is currently under investigation. The cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of mTOR, both the nuclear entry and subsequent nuclear exit, appears to be required for the activation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (14Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The predominantly nuclear localization of S6K2 (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B), as opposed to the cytoplasmic localization of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, might suggest a distinct requirement for mTOR localization. Increased mTOR nuclear import (NLS-mTOR) led to enhanced S6K2 activation, whereas increased mTOR nuclear export (NES-mTOR) resulted in reduced S6K2 activity (Fig. 5), which may simply reflect a correlation between nuclear mTOR and the activation of nuclear S6K2. However, S6K2 activation was inhibited by LMB (Fig.4A), suggesting that the nuclear export of an upstream component is required. Strong evidence for the critical role of mTOR shuttling came from the observations that while two copies of NLS tagged to mTOR further enhanced S6K2 activation in vivo, additional increase of nuclear entry by tagging four copies of NLS to mTOR reduced S6K2 activation (Fig. 7). Similar results were also obtained with S6K1 (data not shown). It is thus likely that a balanced distribution of mTOR between the cytoplasm and nucleus, or an optimal shuttling rate for mTOR, may be essential for maximal activation of downstream signaling. The fact that mTOR with two exogenous copies of NLS is most active does not necessarily suggest that nature has designed a suboptimal mTOR for downstream signaling. Since these experiments rely on overexpression of recombinant proteins, the stoichiometry of various components in the pathway may be different from that of the endogenous proteins. Nevertheless, the outcome of the multiple NLS tagging experiments has proven as a principle the importance of mTOR shuttling in activating downstream signaling. Lee-Fruman et al. (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that S6K2βII was in a detergent-soluble fraction, whereas S6K2βI stayed in the particulate fraction, suggesting that the two isoforms may be localized to different nuclear compartments. Interestingly, the localization of S6K2βII appears identical to that of S6K1αI (p85s6k) (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the activation of which is also dependent on mTOR shuttling (data not shown). It would be intriguing to examine the regulation of S6K2βI in the context of mTOR localization. It remains a puzzle why activation of S6K2, a nuclear protein, requires the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling (and not just nuclear entry) of mTOR, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein. One simple possibility would be that upon activation of S6K2 in the nucleus mTOR is inactivated, and it is necessary for mTOR to be reactivated in the cytoplasm to allow maximal S6K2 activation. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the observation that nuclear entry of mTOR is much slower than the rate of full S6K2 activation in the cell: while S6K2 is maximally activated at 30 min (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (data not shown), mTOR nuclear entry, as indicated by sequestration by LMB, required more than 3 h to complete (Fig. 4C). It is not known whether activation of S6K2 occurs in the cytoplasm or nucleus or in both as a multistep process. Both PI3K and Akt, upstream regulators of S6K2 (17Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J.

Therefore, many possibilities exist for the activation process of S6K2. The regulation of mTOR is also a complex process; the relationship between PA binding (presumably in the intracellular membranes) and nuclear translocation of mTOR is currently unclear and awaits future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2071940759,"Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Dok1 as a docking protein for RET tyrosine kinase. Dok1 bound more strongly to RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B mutation than RET with a MEN2A mutation and was highly phosphorylated in the cells expressing the former mutant protein. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that tyrosine 361 in mouse Dok1 represents a binding site for the Nck adaptor protein and tyrosines 295, 314, 361, 376, 397, and 408 for the Ras-GTPase-activating protein. We replaced tyrosine 361 or these six tyrosines with phenylalanine (designated Y361F or 6F) inDok1 and introduced the mutant Dok1 genes into the cells expressing the wild-type RET or RET-MEN2B protein. Overexpression of Dok1 or Dok1-Y361F, but not Dok1–6F, suppressed the Ras/Erk activation induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B, implying that this inhibitory effect requires the Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding to Dok1. In contrast, overexpression of Dok1, but not Dok1-Y361F or Dok1–6F, enhanced the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation. This suggested that the association of Nck to tyrosine 361 in Dok1 is necessary for the JNK and c-Jun activation by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B. Because a high level of the JNK phosphorylation was observed in the cells expressing RET-MEN2B, its strong activation via Nck binding to Dok1 may be responsible for aggressive properties of medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in MEN 2B. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Dok1 as a docking protein for RET tyrosine kinase. Dok1 bound more strongly to RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B mutation than RET with a MEN2A mutation and was highly phosphorylated in the cells expressing the former mutant protein.

Because a high level of the JNK phosphorylation was observed in the cells expressing RET-MEN2B, its strong activation via Nck binding to Dok1 may be responsible for aggressive properties of medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in MEN 2B. glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor multiple endocrine neoplasia familial medullary thyroid carcinoma papillary thyroid carcinoma medullary thyroid carcinoma Ras-GTPase-activating protein Jun amino-terminal kinase phosphotyrosine-binding pleckstrin homology serum response element glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride insulin-like receptor substrate-1 COOH-terminal tail p21-activated protein cytomegalovirus thymidine kinase DNA binding domain Nck-interacting kinase RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an important role in the development of the enteric nervous system and the kidney (1Takahashi M.

It has been demonstrated that members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)1family including GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin represent the RET ligands. The RET activation by these neurotrophic factors are mediated by their binding to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored co-receptors termed GDNF family receptor α 1–4 (GFRα 1–4) (1Takahashi M.

GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin use GFRα 1, GFRα 2, GFRα 3, and GFRα 4 as the preferred receptors, respectively, and play specific roles in vivo through these preferred ligand-receptor complex formation. For example, Gdnf- orGfrα1-deficient mice had the phenotype quite similar to that of Ret-deficient mice, exhibiting the defects of enteric neurons as well as renal agenesis or dysgenesis (3Schuchardt A.

On the other hand, gain-of-function mutations of RET contribute to the development of human neoplastic diseases including MEN 2A, MEN 2B, FMTC, and PTC (12Jhiang S.M.

MEN 2A and MEN 2B share the clinical feature of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma, and FMTC is characterized by the development of MTC alone. In addition, ∼10–30% of MEN 2A patients develop parathyroid hyperplasia, whereas MEN 2B patients show a more complex phenotype including ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract, mucosal neuroma, and marfanoid habitus. MTCs developed in MEN 2B appear more aggressive than those in MEN 2A and FMTC. Activated RET recruits a variety of signaling molecules including Grb2, Grb7, Grb10, Shc, Enigma, SNT/Frs2, Dok, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and phospholipase Cγ (17–29). As is the case for other receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the kinase domain and carboxyl-terminal tail of RET represent docking sites for these molecules. For example, phosphorylated tyrosines 905, 1015, and 1096 were identified as docking sites for Grb7/Grb10, phospholipase Cγ, and Grb2, respectively (17Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F.

However, how the p38MAPK, JNK, and Erk5 signaling pathways are activated through tyrosine 1062 is currently unknown. In this study, to further elucidate the activation mechanism of intracellular signaling through RET receptor, we tried to identify the molecules that interact with phosphorylated RET by a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified Dok1, the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of which was responsible for the binding to tyrosine 1062 in RET in response to GDNF. Tyrosine 361 in mouse Dok1 bound the Nck adaptor protein, and six tyrosines with the YXXP motif bound Ras-GAP, leading to the JNK and c-Jun activation and attenuation of the Erk1/2 activation, respectively. In addition, we found enhanced JNK activation in the cells expressing RET-MEN2B that may result from a high level of Dok1 phosphorylation. An ∼1.2-kbpEcoRI-XhoI cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human RET with a MEN2Bmutation (M918T) was amplified by PCR and fused to the sequence encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) in the pAS2–1 vector (CLONTECH). The recombinant plasmid was co-transfected into the Y190 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with two-hybrid library derived from fetal human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). The transformants were plated on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. From ∼5.7 × 106 independent clones, 77 colonies were found to grow on the selective medium, and to be positive for β-galactosidase expression. Plasmids isolated from His(−) and β-galactosidase-positive clones were used to transformEscherichia coli, HB101. To eliminate false positives, the plasmids isolated from bacteria were used to co-transform yeast with pAS2–1 (no insert) or pAS2–1-RETc containing the cytoplasmic domain of human RET. Transformants were grown in selective medium without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Positive clones were identified by the β-galactosidase activity filter assay. These clones were further characterized by sequencing and analyzed for gene homology by the on-line Blast search engine. Wild-type human RET orRET-MEN2B cDNA was introduced into the Rc/CMV expression plasmid (Invitrogen). Full-length mouse wild-type Dok1 orDok1 mutant cDNAs were amplified by PCR with introduction of appropriate restriction enzyme sites in the primer. The cDNA fragments were introduced into the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Sigma), thereby fusing the Dok1 cDNAs with the FLAG sequence. All Dok1 mutations were introduced into double-stranded DNA by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast and SK-N-MC human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 8% calf serum. NIH 3T3 and SK-N- MC cell lines transfected with the expression plasmids containing wild-type RET or mutantRET cDNA were described previously (19Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Takahashi M. J. Biol.

Anti-Dok1 and anti-Erk1/2 polyclonal antibodies, and anti-Ras-GAP, anti-JNK, and anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-phosphoErk1/2, anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, anti-Akt, anti-phosphoAkt, anti-c-Jun, and anti-phosphoJun polyclonal antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-RET antibody was developed as described previously (23Kurokawa K. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Kawai K. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were grown subconfluently in 100-mm dishes and serum-starved for 12 h. Then they were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with one tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunocomplexes were collected with Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed four times with lysis buffer. The complexes were eluted in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue) by boiling for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nihon Millipore Kogyo) and reacted with the antibodies. The reaction was examined by enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To generate the GST fusion proteins with each domain of Dok1, cDNA fragments of mouse Dok1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (34Murakami H. Iwashita T. Asai N. Iwata Y. Narumiya S. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These constructs were used to transformE. coli to produce the GST fusion proteins that were purified using glutathione-agarose beads. The cells expressing wild-type RET and mutant RET were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with one tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture/50 ml and 1 mm PMSF, and the resulting cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of immobilized GST or GST fusion proteins for 3 h at 4 °C and washed with lysis buffer four times. The proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-RET or anti-FLAG antibody. For serum response element (SRE) reporter-gene assay, SK-N-MC cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates 20–24 h prior to transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 150 ng of SRE-reporter plasmid, 50 ng of phRL-TK plasmid carrying the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega), 600 ng of pCMV-RET(M918T), and 1 μg of various mutant Dok1 expression constructs (CMV-Dok1s), CMV-Shc or CMV-RasN17 construct by LipofectoAMINE2000 methods (Invitrogen) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The total amounts of transfected DNAs were kept constant by including the appropriate empty vector where needed. The cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection and serum-starved for the following 24 h. Then, they were lysed and the resulting extracts were assayed for the luciferase activity using a Promega kit. To investigate the c-Jun-mediated gene expression by RET-MEN2B in SK-N-MC cells, the cells were plated on 24-well culture plates 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 150 ng of GAL4-responsive pFR-Luc reporter plasmid (Stratagene), 50 ng of phRL-TK plasmid, 400 ng of pcDNA-GAL4 DNA binding domain-c-Jun fusion construct (pcDNA-GAL4DB-c-Jun), 600 ng of pCMV-RET(M918T), and 1 μg of various Dok1 expression constructs (CMV-Doks) or CMV-Shc construct by LipofectAMINE2000 methods. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for the luciferase activity. To investigate the effect of GDNF stimulation on the luciferase activity, SK-N-MC(RET) cells were co-transfected with 150 ng of SRE reporter gene, 50 ng of phRL-TK, and 1.2 μg of pCMV-Dok1 constructs. For assays of c-Jun-mediated gene expression, the cells were transfected with 150 ng of pFR-Luc reporter plasmid, 50 ng of phRL-TK plasmid, 600 ng of pcDNA-GAL4DB-c-Jun fusion construct, and 1 μg of various Dok1 expression constructs (CMV-Doks), or CMV-Shc construct. Twenty-four hours after transfection, GDNF (100 ng/ml) was added for 24 h and luciferase assays were performed. Co-transfection with the phRL-TK plasmid carrying the Renilla luciferase gene was used to normalize all luciferase values. All experiments were repeated three times. The GST fusion proteins including the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf (c-RafRBD) were generated in E. coli as described above and used to measure the amount of GTP-bound Ras in the cells. Briefly, GDNF-treated or untreated SK-N-MC cells expressing RET were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 250 μm PMSF, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and the resulting lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was added to 5 μg of GST-c-RafRBD fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 60–120 min with gentle rotation. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The amount of GTP-bound Ras was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Ras monoclonal antibody (Signal Transduction). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify the proteins that can interact with the intracellular domain of RET in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. A human RETcDNA corresponding to the intracellular domain (amino acids 718–1114) with or without a MEN2B mutation (methionine 918 → threonine, M918T) was fused in frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 transcription factor in the pAS2–1 plasmid as a bait (Fig.1A). Western blot analyses with anti-GAL4-DB and anti-RET antibodies showed that 62-kDa fusion proteins were detected in the lysates from yeast transformed by the bait plasmid (Fig. 1B). As expected, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the GAL4DB-RET(MEN2B) protein was much higher than that of the GAL4DB-RET(wild-type) protein (Fig.1B). Approximately 5.7 × 106 clones of human fetal brain cDNA inserted in the pACT2 vector were screened, and 77 independent positive clones interacting with GAL4DB-RET(MEN2B) were identified (Fig. 1C). Among them, nucleotide sequences of 14 clones matched cDNA sequence of the human DOK1gene. They included 5′ non-coding and coding regions of the humanDOK1 cDNA (∼1.9 kbp). To confirm the interaction between human DOK1 and activated RET by a pull-down assay, a full-length DOK1 protein was produced in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. The GST-DOK1 fusion protein was incubated with the lysates of NIH3T3 cells expressing human RET with aMEN2A (cysteine 634 → arginine, C634R) or MEN2Bmutation. The results showed that the fusion protein interacted with RET-MEN2A (Fig. 1D) as well as RET-MEN2B (data not shown). In addition, when the lysate from SK-N-MC human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells transfected the wild-type RETgene was used for the pull-down assay, the GST-DOK1 fusion protein interacted with 175-kDa RET phosphorylated by GDNF (Fig.1D). Dok1 consists of an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a PTB domain, and a COOH-terminal tail (CT) harboring at least seven potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig.2A) (35Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To determine which domain of Dok1 mediates the interaction with RET, we produced the GST fusion proteins containing PH domain (Dok1-PH), PTB domain (Dok1-PTB), COOH-terminal tail (Dok1-CT), PH and PTB domains (Dok1-PH/PTB), or PTB and COOH-terminal tail (Dok1-PTB/CT). As shown in Fig. 2B, the GST fusion proteins containing the PTB domain were able to strongly bind the RET-MEN2B protein. In addition, because it was reported that two arginine residues at codons 207 and 208 in the Dok1 PTB domain are crucial for its interaction with phosphotyrosine (37Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we replaced these two residues with alanine (Dok1-AA in Fig.2A) and performed the pull-down assay. As expected, this mutation markedly impaired the interaction between RET-MEN2B and Dok1 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the PTB domain of Dok1 is responsible for the interaction with activated RET. To confirm the interaction between Dok1 and RET in the cells, the lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing RET with MEN2A(C634R) or MEN2B(M918T) mutation were immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RET, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Dok1 antibody. As shown in Fig.3A, RET and Dok1 were coprecipitated from both lysates, although the RET-MEN2B protein was more efficiently coprecipitated with Dok1 than the RET-MEN2A protein was. In addition, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok1 in NIH-RET(MEN2B) cells was higher than that in NIH-RET(MEN2A) cells (Fig.3A). Because tyrosine 1062 in RET was reported to be responsible for interaction of the Dok-5 PTB domain (22Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S., Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we replaced tyrosine 1062 with phenylalanine (Y1062F). When the lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B with the Y1062F mutation were used for immunoprecipitation, coprecipitation of RET with Dok1 was hardly detected (Fig. 3A), confirming the importance of tyrosine 1062 for Dok1 binding. To further investigate whether Dok1 interacts more strongly with RET-MEN2B than RET-MEN2A, we transfected the FLAG expression plasmid containing mouse full-length Dok1cDNA into NIH3T3, NIH-RET(MEN2A), and NIH-RET(MEN2B) cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG antibody showed that the amount of coprecipitated RET-MEN2B protein was larger than that of coprecipitated RET-MEN2A protein (Fig. 3B). Moreover, when the FLAG-tagged Dok1-AA or PH domain-deleted Dok1 (Dok1-delPH) plasmid was transfected into NIH-RET(MEN2B) cells, coprecipitation of RET with Dok1-AA was hardly detected (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, wild-type Dok1 and Dok1-delPH were coprecipitated with RET at similar levels, indicating that the PH domain is unnecessary for the Dok1 binding to RET in the cells (Fig. 3C). We previously demonstrated that phosphorylated Dok1 complexes with Ras-GAP and Nck in NIH3T3 cells expressing RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B (38Murakami H Iwashita T. Asai N. Shimono Y. Iwata Y. Kawai K.

In vitro binding study with a phosphotyrosyl peptide library has shown that the SH2 domain of Nck binds preferentially to a phosphopeptide that contains the sequence motif pYDEP, whereas the SH2 domains of RAS-GAP bind to pYXXP motif (39Holland S.J.

To determine the binding site of mouse Dok1 with Nck and Ras-GAP, we replaced 10 tyrosine residues (tyrosines 146, 203, 295, 314, 340, 361, 376, 397, 408, and 450) in mouse Dok1 with phenylalanine (Fig. 4A) and generated FLAG-tagged mutant genes with each single tyrosine mutation. In addition, we generated FLAG-tagged Dok1 constructs with 3 tyrosine mutations (Y203F, Y340F and Y450F, designated 3F), 4 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, and Y376F, designated 4F), 6 tyrosine mutations (Y295F, Y314F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, and Y408F, designated 6F), or 10 tyrosine mutations (Y146F, Y203F, Y295F, Y314F, Y340F, Y361F, Y376F, Y397F, Y408F, and Y450F, designated 10F) (Fig.4A). FLAG-tagged mutant genes were transfected into NIH-RET(MEN2B) cells, and the association of RET with mutant Dok1 protein was analyzed. RET-MEN2B mutant proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with all mutant Dok1 proteins at similar levels (Fig. 4B and data not shown), although tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok1–6F and Dok1–10F was significantly reduced (Fig. 4B). The association of Nck with Dok1 was almost abolished by the Y3"
https://openalex.org/W1993262750,"Intracellular calcium signaling plays a central role in cell proliferation. In leukemic cells, the calcium release-activated calcium channels provide a major pathway for calcium entry (I(CRAC)) perpetuating progression through the cell cycle. Although I(CRAC) is under mitochondrial regulation, targeting mitochondrial function has not been exploited to control malignant cell growth. The benzothiadiazine diazoxide, which depolarized respiration-dependent mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the rate of proliferation and arrested human acute leukemic T cells in the G0/G1 phase. Diazoxide did not alter cellular energetics, but rather inhibited the mitochondria-controlled I(CRAC) and reduced calcium influx into tumor cells. The antiproliferative action of diazoxide was mimicked by removal of extracellular calcium or by the tyrphostin A9, an I(CRAC) inhibitor. Deletion of the mitochondrial genome, which encodes essential respiratory chain enzyme subunits, attenuated the inhibitory effect of diazoxide on I(CRAC)-mediated calcium influx and cell proliferation. Thus, manipulation of mitochondrial function and associated calcium signaling provides a basis for a novel anticancer strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2136041234,"Endothelial differentiation gene-1 product (Edg-1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for the platelet derived bioactive lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sph-1-P). Recent studies have shown that in response to Sph-1-P, Edg-1 mediates various signaling pathways through downstream signaling molecules, such as MAP kinase and calcium, via heterotrimeric G-proteins. We found for the first time that Edg-1 is glycosylated in its amino-terminal extracellular portion, and further identified the specific glycosylation site as asparagine 30 by creating a nonglycosylated mutant of Edg-1 (N30D-Edg-1) and transfecting it into cell lines. The nonglycosylated mutant receptors, resembling their wild-type controls, were predominantly expressed in the plasma membrane. Although there was no difference in ligand binding ability and ligand-induced MAP kinase activation in the wild-type and mutant receptors, nonglycosylated Edg-1 was much less responsive for ligand-induced internalization. Unlike the wild-type receptor, which was associated with the caveolae, nonglycosylated N30D-Edg-1 was dispersed broadly in the membrane fractions separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, suggesting that internalization and microdomain localization of N-glycosylated Edg-1 might be related. Although the precise molecular mechanism of the internalization of the N-glycosylated Edg-1 localized in the microdomain remains to be examined, the present study suggested that the presence of N-linked glycan in the receptor may play a regulatory role in the receptor dynamics in ligand-stimulated mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082450138,"Bordetella pertussis is an important cause of infection in humans worldwide, with full expression of the syndrome associated with characteristic increases in lung permeability and airway edema. The exact cellular mechanisms by which pertussis toxin (PTX) exerts pulmonary toxicity remain unknown, but may involve its ability to ADP-ribosylate-specific G-proteins. We determined that PTX directly and reproducibly reduced lung endothelial and epithelial cell barrier function in vitro and in vivo assessed by decreases in transmonolayer electrical resistance (TER) and isolated perfused lung preparations. Alterations in lung permeability began approximately 30 min after PTX and were dependent on intrinsic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, as neither the cell binding beta-oligomer subunit or a genetically engineered PTX mutant (devoid of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity) altered TER. PTX-induced barrier dysfunction was associated with mild increases in F-actin stress fiber formation and causally linked to p38 MAP kinase activities. PTX-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation did not involve either p42/p44 ERK, p60src, Rho family of GTPases, or phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase pathways. PTX-mediated decreases in TER were temporally linked to phosphorylation of the actin binding proteins Hsp27 and caldesmon, known substrates for the Ser/Thr kinase MAPKAP2, whose activity is regulated by p38 MAP kinase. In addition to defining novel signaling pathways involved in PTX-induced respiratory pathophysiology, these data suggest that the direct cell-activating effects of PTX be carefully considered as a potential limitation to its use as a tool in signal transduction analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2023500405,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. African American men have a 60% greater incidence of prostate cancer and a twofold higher mortality rate than Caucasian men. The Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) is a receptor expressed on erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells that binds to and clears angiogenic chemokines. The DARC also functions as the erythrocyte receptor for invasion by malarial parasites. Approximately 70% of African Americans lack erythrocyte expression of the DARC as a genetic mechanism of protection against malaria infection. Given the importance of angiogenic chemokines in the development of tumor vascular networks and the chemokine binding properties of the DARC, the possibility that a lack of DARC expression on erythrocytes may represent an epigenetic factor that predisposes African American men to a greater incidence and mortality of prostate cancer should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2011814357,"We report here the identification and characterization of a novel paired-like homeobox-containing gene (Ehox). This gene, identified in embryonic stem (ES) cells, is differentially expressed during in vitro ES cell differentiation.

This has involved molecular and biological analyses of the effects of sense or antisenseEhox expression (using episomal vectors) on ES cell differentiation.

In contrast, overexpression ofEhox using the sense construct accelerated the appearance of these differentiation markers. ES cell self-renewal and differentiation assays reveal that inhibition of Ehoxactivity results in the maintenance of a stem cell phenotype in limiting concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor and the almost complete impairment of the cardiomyocyte differentiation capacity of these cells.

This technology, however, is severely limited by the heterogeneity of the differentiation process and by the limited molecular characterization of the system. A detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in the early differentiation steps may allow the development of lineage selection strategies (7Li M. Pevny L. Lovell-Badge R. Smith A.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 971-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate therapeutic quantities of a specific cell type. One of the most closely studied differentiation pathways using the ES cell differentiation system has been the commitment to, and the differentiation of, hematopoietic stem cells (17Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou M. Wiles M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 18Kennedy M. Firpo M. Choi K. Wall C. Robertson S. Kabrun N. Keller G.

We have recently described the in vitro differentiation of ES cells, cultured as embryoid bodies (EBs), and the time course of commitment of these cells to the hemopoietic lineage (21Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, these studies have demonstrated that, following removal of LIF, components of the hemopoietic stem cell compartment incorporating both long term and short term repopulating stem cells are generated between days 3 and 5 of in vitro differentiation. Subsequently we have used subtractive hybridization to examine the genes expressed over this 2-day time frame (22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which we have now shown to be a valuable source of known and novel hemopoietic gene products. The subtractive hybridization technology used in this study yields small cDNA fragments in the subtracted library and not full-length cDNA molecules (22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of the small fragments in the subtracted library (clone name JB46) displayed homology with members of the homeobox-containing family of transcriptional regulators. The homeobox domain is a 60-amino acid DNA-binding motif, which is contained within the context of larger proteins that have diverse roles to play in development and in adult cell function (23Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Many members of the homeobox gene families are key players acting as transcriptional master regulators during embryonic development and adult cell differentiation. Here we present the molecular and functional characterization of JB46, herein referred to as Ehox, which represents a highly divergent member of the paired-like homeobox gene family. We have used an episomal overexpression system to facilitate the functional analysis of Ehox in the ES cell differentiation system. Stem cell and differentiation assays as well as detailed real-time PCR analysis of sense Ehox and antisense Ehox-expressing ES cells suggest a fundamental role for this homeobox gene in regulating the initial stages of ES cell differentiation. To derive full-length Ehox cDNA clones, a day 5 EB cDNA library was generated using the Zap-Express kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and all procedures were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The hemopoietic potential of the day 5 EBs used to construct this library was verified as described previously (21Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The library was screened for EhoxcDNAs using a radiolabeled JB46 probe, and again all procedures involved in the cloning of Ehox were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following three rounds of library screening, positive clones were isolated and the inserts sequenced. The consensus full-length Ehox sequence was determined by examining the sequences of multiple Ehoxclones. ES cells were maintained in Glasgow's minimal essential medium (GMEM) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and 100 units/ml recombinant LIF, on gelatinized tissue culture dishes (24Smith A.G. J. Tiss. Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 89-94Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We used a subclone of the E14tg2a cell line called E14/T (kindly provided by A. Smith and I. Chambers) which expresses polyoma large T from an integrated pMGDNEO plasmid. E14/T ES cells were “supertransfected” with polyoma ori (pyF101)-containing plasmids expressing Ehox in either the sense or antisense orientations driven by the ubiquitous CAG promoter (25Niwa H. Yamamura K.-I. Miyazaki J.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). Puromycin-N-acetyltransferase was linked toEhox expression via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), to ensure that all puromycin-resistant cells expressed the cDNA. Plasmids without the Ehox insert (empty vector) served as experimental controls. Supertransfections were performed by electroporating 5 × 106 E14/T cells with 5 μg of plasmid DNA at 200 V and 960 microfarads. Transfected E14/T cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin for 6 days, and then clones were pooled and maintained under selection throughout subsequent culture. Replicate transfection plates were stained with Leishman's stain to quantify ES colony numbers. At least two separately derived transfected pools of cells were generated for all vectors. ES cells were supertransfected with vector, sense, or antisense Ehox constructs as outlined above and were maintained in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin throughout the experiments. Pools of transfected ES cells were allowed to form EBs by hanging-drop culture as described previously (21Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The EBs were harvested and differentiation initiated by removal of the LIF from the culture medium. EBs were harvested at daily intervals up to 6 days after initiation of differentiation and RNA prepared following lysis of the EB-derived cells in TRIzol (Sigma). RNA was also prepared from undifferentiated ES cells as well as EBs obtained immediately following harvesting and prior to the initiation of differentiation. 20 μg of total RNA isolated from undifferentiated E14/T ES cells supertransfected with episomal plasmids to express Ehox sense, antisense, or empty vector was loaded per lane of a 2% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was done for 3 h at 80 V before blotting onto Hybond N nylon membranes. The blot was UV cross-linked and hybridized with a32P-labeled 700-bp Ehox cDNA probe overnight, and washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C before exposing to X-Omat AR autoradiography film overnight and developing. Real-time PCR was carried out on the ABI PRISM® 7700 system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Relative quantitation of gene expression levels was achieved using the standard curve method. The RNA used in the real-time PCR experiments was first DNase I-treated. Following the TaqMan® reverse transcriptase (RT) kit instructions the following reaction was set up with final concentrations of 1× TaqMan® RT buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm each dNTP, 1.25 μm random hexamers, 1.25 μm oligo(dT)16, 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor, and 1.25 units/μl Multiscribe RT, RNA, and H2O up to 5 μl. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 48 °C for 30 min, and the RT was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. For the standard curve, 0.5 μl of each RNA dilution was added to the RT reaction; for the experimental samples, ∼50 ng of DNase-treated RNA was added to each RT reaction. The cDNA produced was stored at −20 °C until use. The primers and probes used in the real-time PCR analyses were obtained from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) and were as shown below. The PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl in 96-well optical reaction plates. 12.5 μl of a 2× TaqMan® Universal Master mix was used together with 5 μl of cDNA from the RT step, the appropriate concentration of primer/probe, and the volume made up to 25 μl with H2O. The plates were sealed using optical adhesive covers and run on the ABI 7700 sequence detection system following the recommended protocol. Briefly the plates was heated to 55 °C for 2 min and then held at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold. The PCR steps were: 95 °C for 15 s followed by an annealing/extension time of 1 min at 60 °C, and this was repeated for 40 cycles. For both the RT step and PCR step, positive displacement pipettes were used to ensure accurate aliquoting. Once the run was complete, the plate was analyzed with the sequence detection software and the control wells checked for contamination. Standard deviations were calculated using the method recommended by the supplier. 2 × 10 5 COS 7 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes in 5 ml of GMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Next day each culture was co-transfected with theEhox expression vectors used in ES cell supertransfections. Cultures were transfected with a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche, Lewes, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Combinations of plasmids were made to transfect Ehox sense, antisense, or both sense and antisense in one culture. In addition all cultures received plasmids expressing EGFP as a transfection control. Transfected cells were allowed to grow for 3 days and examined for EGFP prior to processing for Western blotting. Polyclonal anti-Ehox antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a chemically synthesized Ehox peptide representing a 24-amino acid region amino-terminal to the homeobox region. The sequence of the peptide used was EEKLPEEPVLRDAVVIDKVQPIPV. Both the peptide synthesis and the antibody generation were performed on a service basis by Invitrogen (Renfrewshire, UK). For Western blotting, COS cells were lysed on ice in 500 μl of sample buffer. Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and sonicated before 15 μl/lane was separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel prior to semidry electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for nonspecific binding by overnight incubation in 5% dried milk powder (Marvel) in 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) before hybridization for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-Ehox antibody in 5% milk/TBST. Following three 15-min washes in TBST, the blots were incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (SAPU, Scotland, UK) in 5% milk/TBST. Finally, blots were subjected to three 15-min washes in TBST, following which specific antibody binding was detected with ECL substrate and autoradiography. To control for loading, blots were stripped in 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 45 min and washed with TBST before reprobing with a 1:200 dilution of anti-GFP antibody (Neomarkers, Suffolk, UK) in 5% milk/TBST and a 1:5000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody essentially as described above. Again, detection was carried out using the ECL substrate. In initial experiments, 1 × 104 transfected E14/T cells were plated in duplicate onto 35-mm gelatin-coated wells in standard ES cell medium containing 100, 10, 1, or 0 units/ml LIF and 2 μg/ml puromycin. After 7 days, medium was removed and colonies were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity according to the instructions of the manufacturer (AP leukocyte kit; Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). Colonies were examined microscopically for intensity of red stain (stem cell) (26Bernstine E.G. Hooper M.L. Grandchamp S. Ephrussi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and morphology and scored as either a stem cell or a differentiated colony. Two independently derived pools were assayed three times for each transfection. Subsequent analysis was from 5 × 103transfected cells plated per 35-mm dish in duplicate and analyzed after 5 days in culture. EBs were generated in 10-μl hanging drop cultures containing 300 cells in GMEM, 10% FCS, 100 units/ml LIF, and 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days. EBs were harvested and cultured in suspension in GMEM, 10% FCS without LIF for 5 days (with 2 μg/ml puromycin) before plating at 1 EB/well of a 24-well plate in GMEM, 10% FCS. Cultures were examined microscopically, and EBs with beating cardiomyocytes were scored daily for the next 10 days. Analysis of cDNA clones from a previously generated ES cell-derived subtracted library (22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) revealed one clone, JB46, that displayed homology with members of the homeobox family of transcriptional regulators. This homology is limited and is evident at the peptide, but not the nucleotide level. The full-length cDNA for JB46 was isolated from a day 5 EB full-length cDNA library and sequenced (Fig.1 a). The 893-bp cDNA is predicted to encode a 205-amino acid peptide containing a COOH-terminal 60 amino acid motif (underlined) that has homology to equivalent regions in other homeotic proteins. We have redesignated this cDNA Ehox to reflect its membership of this family and its ES cell origin. Over the homeobox region, Ehox is most closely related to GPBOX (50% identity),OG-12 (43% identity), and PRX-1 (41% identity), all of which are members of the paired-like homeobox gene family (Ref.22Baird J.W. Ryan K.M. Hayes I. Hampson L. Heyworth C.M. Clark A. Wootton M. Ansell J.D. Menzel U. Hole N. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9189-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 b). In addition there is an EST (accession no.AK015997), which also displays 50% identity to Ehox over the homeobox region, and, with the exception of an EST that is identical to Ehox (accession no. AK017380), this remains the closest EST homologue of Ehox in the available data bases. The relatively weak homology across the homeodomain indicates thatEhox is a divergent member of this protein family. In keeping with the divergent nature of Ehox is the fact that we have been unable to detect any homology between any other sequences in the publicly available data bases and the peptide or cDNA sequences in regions NH2-terminal to, or 5′ of, the homeobox region respectively. Genomic sequence data base searches withEhox cDNA sequences has revealed a number of regions that are identical to sequences from the murine X chromosome, confirming this as the chromosomal location of Ehox. This is in keeping with the presence of other paired-like genes on this chromosome in the mouse (27Takasaki N. McIsaac R. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As this cDNA was derived from differentiating ES cells, we have examined the patterns of expression of Ehox during in vitro ES cell differentiation. Preliminary Northern blot and PCR analyses indicated thatEhox is expressed at relatively low levels in undifferentiated ES cells (data not shown). We have subsequently used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to accurately measure Ehoxexpression during ES cell differentiation. Results obtained indicate that Ehox is expressed in undifferentiated ES cells and that this low expression level is maintained following initiation of differentiation before rising at later stages of the in vitro differentiation process to levels 5 times higher than those seen in undifferentiated ES cells (Fig.2 a). We have also had to resort to real-time quantitative PCR to assess relative Ehox expression levels in a range of adult murine tissues. Results obtained show the major site of Ehoxexpression in the adult to be the thymus, with the only other sites of significant expression being the skin and testes (Fig. 2 b). Intriguingly, despite the preferential expression in the thymus, other lymphoid-associated organs, such as the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, do not reveal significant expression of Ehox. Thus, Ehox is expressed at varying levels in both undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells, as well as in adult tissues, indicating potential roles for this divergent homeobox-containing gene in both developmental and adult contexts. One advantage of using the in vitro differentiation of ES cells to identify novel genes is that this system can also be used to analyze the functional roles for identified genes. We have used an episomal expression system (28Burdon T. Chambers I. Stracey C. Niwa H. Smith A.G. Cells Tissue Organs. 1999; 165: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Gassmann M. Donoho G. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1292-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to characterize the impact of alterations inEhox expression levels on ES cell function and differentiation. This system involves transfection of an episomal expression construct containing a polyoma virus origin of replication into E14/T ES cells, a subclone of E14tg2a, which stably express the polyoma large T antigen. The interaction of the large T antigen with the polyoma origin of replication allows efficient episomal propagation of incoming plasmids. This system has high transfection efficiencies (supertransfection), and high levels of expression can be achieved and maintained. In addition, problems associated with ectopic gene expression in ES cells, such as site-specific silencing of integrated transgenes, are circumvented by supertransfection. Large numbers of clones are generated by this transfection system, thus allowing pools of clones to be isolated and phenotypically characterized, thereby avoiding interclonal variation. We have used this system to investigate the functional role ofEhox in ES cell differentiation using sense and antisenseEhox expression constructs. Prior to initiating the episomal transfection experiments, we sought to identify an effective antisense construct that was capable of neutralizing Ehox in transfected cells. We have tested two antisense cDNA constructs, the first containing a 220-bp antisense fragment specific for the 5′-non-homeobox-encoding region of the gene and the second containing the full-length Ehox antisense fragment (Fig.3 a). As ES cells do not express detectable levels of EHOX protein (see below), the effectiveness of these antisense cDNAs was tested in COS7 cells co-transfected with Ehox and either one or other of the antisense constructs. EGFP encoding vectors were also included in the co-transfections to allow comparison of relative transfection efficiencies between experiments. Western blot analysis of the COS7 cell lysates revealed that both antisense constructs were effective at reducing EHOX protein expression, although the full-lengthEhox antisense construct was most effective, resulting in almost complete neutralization of EHOX protein expression (Fig.3 b). This neutralization of expression was seen with both wild type protein and a MYC-tagged full-length protein. Given the apparently greater ability of the full-length antisense construct to neutralize EHOX protein expression, this construct has been used in the functional studies reported below. To assess the function of Ehox, we generated episomal expression constructs carrying sense or antisenseEhox cDNA driven by the ubiquitous CAG promoter. In a number of ES cell transfection experiments, large numbers of clones were generated with the control vector or antisenseEhox-expressing vector (TableI). In contrast, under directly comparable conditions, a markedly lower (150-fold) number ofEhox sense-expressing ES cell clones was generated. Northern blot analysis of the pools of supertransfected cells indicates high levels of expression of the Ehox antisense mRNA but lower levels of sense expression in the limited number of sense transfectants obtained (Fig. 3 c). Endogenous Ehoxexpression was undetectable, using Northern blotting, in wild type or vector control ES cells. EHOX protein was detectable by Western blotting of extracts from sense transfectants but, in keeping with the absence of detectable message, was not seen in the vector control cells (Fig. 3 c). It is important to note that, although high level expression of sense Ehox was difficult to attain in the ES cell transfectants, the cells that do express Ehox message and protein at the levels shown in Fig. 3 c display a normal phenotype and demonstrate no detectable differences in growth or survival compared with wild type or vector control ES cells. Therefore, it is clear that, although high level expression of Ehox is apparently incompatible with either survival of ES cells or with the maintenance of an undifferentiated phenotype, moderate expression levels can be attained with no obvious deleterious effects on measurable cellular parameters such as cell growth and survival.Table IMean number of puromycin-resistant colonies (± S.E.) generated from three supertransfections per constructConstructNo. of puromycin-resistant coloniesCAG puro (control)1938 ± 200CAG/senseehox/IRES puro13 ± 6CAG/antisenseehox/IRES/puro2156 ± 521 Open table in a new tab To assess the effects of variations in Ehox expression on ES cell differentiation in vitro, pools of sense and antisenseEhox-expressing and empty vector-containing ES cells (hereafter referred to as control ES cells) were allowed to form EBs and then to differentiate in the absence of LIF for 6 days. RNA was prepared from undifferentiated ES cells and from differentiating EBs at daily intervals over the 6 days of in vitro differentiation. The multilineage differentiation potential of the ES cells was analyzed using real-time PCR assessment of quantitative alterations in lineage-specific gene expression levels and the phenotypic consequences of Ehox sense or antisense expression defined on this molecular basis. This analysis has the advantage of being more rigorously quantitative than some of the available bioassays and can be used to measure emergence of gene expression patterns that precede the development of assayable lineage-specific cells, or that on their own are not able to define a cellular phenotype. The marker genes used in this study include hemopoietic, endothelial, cardiac, undifferentiated ES cell and housekeeping genes. Levels of both Gapdh andHprt were unaltered throughout the differentiation of the control ES cells or the ES cells expressing the Ehox sense or antisense constructs and displayed very similar absolute levels in each of the three cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2039293070,"Aquaporins are a growing family of transmembrane proteins that transport water and, in some cases, glycerol and urea across cellular membranes. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is enriched at the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle and may play a role in accommodating the rapid changes in cell volume and hydrostatic forces that occur during contraction in order to prevent damage to the sarcolemma. Recent evidence has shown that AQP4 is absent in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, suggesting that AQP4 associates with dystrophin and has a role in the dystrophic process. To examine the relationship between aquaporins and muscle disease, and between aquaporins and dystrophin, we have investigated aquaporin expression in various mouse models of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy before and after the onset of pathology. We find that AQP4 is expressed in prenecrotic mdx muscle despite the absence of dystrophin and that AQP4 is lost after the onset of muscle degeneration. Analysis of various dystrophin transgenic mice reveals that AQP4 is lost even when the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is present, suggesting that loss of AQP4 is not directly resulting from loss of the DGC. AQP4 was also lost in muscular dystrophies caused by primary mutations in the sarcoglycan genes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that AQP4 loss in skeletal muscle correlates with muscular dystrophy and is a common feature of pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016502506,"Actin depolymerization by latrunculin A (LAT-A) in mature starfish oocytes induces a massive calcium mobilization that results in the discharge of the cortical granules and in the elevation of the fertilization envelope. The Ca2+ liberation starts as a circumscribed subplasma membrane hotspot, which is followed by a flash of Ca2+ increase restricted to the cortical layer. Ca2+ propagates rapidly from these peripheral regions to the center of the oocyte, initiating calcium oscillations. Blockade of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors with heparin does not affect the liberation of Ca2+ at the initial hotspot or the cortical flash, but abolishes the centripetal spreading of the wave and the Ca2+ oscillations. In Ca2+-free medium, LAT-A also initiates Ca2+ release at a discrete cortical point, but then propagates throughout the cell without first forming the uniform cortical flash. The latter is thus linked to the influx of external Ca2+, somehow promoted by the depolymerization of cortical (microvillar) actin. The Ca2+ response to spermatozoa (i.e., peripheral hotspot, cortical flash, globalization of the signal) closely mimics that promoted by LAT-A. Thus, the initial cortical release of Ca2+ promoted by the sperm may be due to the depolymerization of actin."
https://openalex.org/W1987404510,"A significant fraction of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes become arrested when halted within a particular initially transcribed region after the synthesis of 23–32-nucleotide RNAs.

Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It is thus important to understand in detail the elements that affect the efficiency of elongation by RNA polymerase II transcription complexes. Both biochemical (reviewed in Ref. 2Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and structural studies of prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases support a particular model of the transcript elongation complex (3Cramer P.

Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). According to this model, ternary complexes are stabilized primarily by the presence of an 8–9-bp RNA-DNA hybrid just upstream of the catalytic center of the RNA polymerase and by a domain of the polymerase that serves as a sliding clamp, encircling the DNA just downstream of the active site and preventing dissociation of the template from the complex. This model explains certain examples of sequence-specific loss of elongation competence, or arrest, by multisubunit RNA polymerases. For example, RNA polymerase II arrests primarily at the boldfaced Ts while traversing the TIa sequence (nontemplate strand) TTTTTTTCCCTTTTTT from the histone H3.3 gene (8Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Complexes with U-rich 3′-ends contain the weakest possible RNA-DNA hybrid (U:dA). In response to this situation, the polymerase can translocate upstream, carrying the transcription bubble to a location where a more stable RNA-DNA hybrid forms. Indeed, an upstream translocated footprint was reported for polymerases arrested at the histone H3.3 TIasite (9Gu W. Powell W. Mote J., Jr. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Upstream translocation removes the 3′-end of the RNA from the active site and thus prevents transcription from continuing. Arrested complexes can be restarted by cleavage of the transcript such that the 3′ RNA end is again aligned with the enzyme catalytic center. This cleavage is catalyzed by the active site of the polymerase and is highly stimulated by the transcription factor SII for RNA polymerase II and by GreA and GreB in the case of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (11Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Reines D. Ghanouni P., Li, Q.Q. Mote J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have shown that although arrest at the histone H3.3 TIa site occurs within the upstream run of nontemplate strand Ts, the second, downstream T-run is also required for efficient arrest. The RNA polymerase must therefore recognize downstream DNA sequences as arrest signals at the DNA level. Consistent with this, upstream translocation of RNA polymerases stalled on different DNA templates was shown to be affected by DNA sequences downstream of the point of stalling (10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The model just discussed has provided a major advance in our understanding of transcript elongation and arrest at promoter-distal DNA sites. However, the model fails to explain the properties of newly initiated transcription complexes. Temporary stalling of RNA polymerase II complexes in the region of +20 to +25 at one particular promoter leaves complexes strongly upstream translocated but nevertheless fully or predominantly elongation-competent (10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made by Nudler et al. (17Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Komissarova and Kashlev (18Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), who have reported that E. coli RNA polymerase promoter-proximal complexes also translocate upstream. These results are significant, since in vivo pausing of RNA polymerase II in the same region, after the synthesis of a 20–40-nt1 transcript, has been shown to be important for the regulation of expression of many genes, including hsp70, c-myc, and c-fos (19Lis J.

Biol. 1998; 63: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) argued that upstream translocation of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II is not driven by weak RNA-DNA hybrids or downstream DNA elements, since initially transcribed sequences within which upstream translocation takes place present no barrier to polymerase translocation at promoter-distal locations. Complexes with transcripts longer than about 45 nt no longer showed upstream translocation (26Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5343-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), so transcript length seemed to be an important determinant of lateral stability on the template. However, the earlier study could not separate effects based simply on transcript length from those that also depended upon proximity to promoter sequences. We have now investigated directly the role of transcript length on the elongation competence of transcription complexes, independent of the presence of the promoter. Through the use of carefully controlled transcript cleavage procedures, we have prepared matched sets of transcription complexes with identical transcript length and nearly identical transcript sequence at promoter-proximal and promoter-distal locations. The corresponding complexes display very similar levels of transcriptional arrest. Thus, the nascent RNA itself, well upstream (i.e. 20–50 nt) of the 3′-end, facilitates continued transcript elongation by the ternary complex. FPLC-purified NTPs and RNase H (catalog no. 27-0894-02) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences;32P-labeled NTPs were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Bio-Gel A1.5m was from Bio-Rad; Deep Vent DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs; and ribonuclease inhibitor and restriction endonucleases were from Invitrogen. Recombinant human elongation factor SII was purified as described previously (27Yoo O. Yoon H. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Agarwal K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chimeric 2′-O-methyl-RNA/DNA oligonucleotides, synthesized by Oligos Etc., had the following sequences: chimera 1, 5′-dCdGdCdGGmGmUmGmCmCm-3′; chimera 2, 5′-dCdCdTdGCmCmGmCmGmGm-3′; chimera 3, 5′-dGdCdGdTCmUmCmGmCmUm-3′; chimera 4, 5′-dCdCdCdGGmGmUmUmUmAm-3′; chimera 5, 5′-dGdCdCdTCmGmUmCmGmCmCm-3′. The promoters in all plasmids are based on the adenovirus major late promoter. The construction of pML20–23 and the series of pML20–23like plasmids was described previously (16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid pML20–23like3, which was used in this study, has the following sequence on the nontemplate strand starting at position +1: ACAGGAAGAGGAAGAAGCAGGCCT. The last six bases form a recognition site for the restriction enzyme StuI; downstream of theStuI site, the pML20–23like plasmids have the same sequence as the pML20–42 construct (26Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5343-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence of pML20–23like3 downstream of position +2 is identical to the sequence of pML20–23 starting with position +130 (see Fig. 1). pML20–55 M was constructed by replacing the fragment between StuI (+25) andXhoI (+39) on pML20–42 with a 66-bp synthetic fragment of the following sequence (nontemplate strand): 5′-CCTCGGCTGCGTGCGCCGTCGGGCCCGGCACTCT- CTTCCCCTTCTCTTTAAAGGCCTCGGCCGCGC-3′. Plasmid DNA was either purified by cesium chloride centrifugation or by a Qiagen Maxi Plasmid kit. Closed circular DNA was used as the DNA template in experiments with the plasmid pML20–23. In the case of the pML20–23like3 plasmid, the template was produced by PCR that amplifies a 190-bp fragment with the transcription start site 96 bp from the 5′-end. DNA was purified with the Concert Rapid PCR purification system (Marligen Bioscience) and then cut downstream of the promoter with the restriction enzymeHindIII to yield a 178-bp template. The DNA was then phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Bead-attached templates for the experiment in Fig. 8 were made by PCR using the pML20–55 M plasmid and the methods described in Ref.16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. Preinitiation complexes were formed in a reaction containing 18 μg/ml circular plasmid or 10 μg/ml PCR fragment with HeLa cell nuclear extract and were purified through a Bio-Gel A1.5m column to remove contaminating NTPs as described (10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ternary complexes on the template pML20–23 containing 151 nt or longer RNAs were synthesized in multiple steps. Complexes stalled at position +20 were generated at 30 °C for 5 min with 1 mm ApC as the initiating dinucleotide; a 20 μm concentration each of UTP, CTP, and GTP; and 50 μm dATP as the energy source. After the addition of the detergent sarkosyl to 1%, complexes were gel-filtered (sarkosyl rinsing; see Ref. 10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sarkosyl-rinsed U20 complexes were elongated through a U-free cassette to make C151 complexes. If C151 complexes were analyzed directly, they were generated from U20 with 600 μm ATP, 100 μmCTP, 9 μm GTP, and 1 μm[α-32P]GTP for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of nonlabeled GTP to 600 μm with further incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. If complexes containing RNAs longer than 151 nt were required, C151 was synthesized without radiolabel for 10 min at 37 °C. The C151 complexes were gel-filtered to remove NTPs. U154, G157, or A160 were then generated by the addition of 1.5 μm [α-32P]UTP for 5 min at 37 °C followed by 50 μm nonlabeled UTP; UTP and GTP; or UTP, GTP, and ATP for 5 min at 37 °C (see Fig. 1 for the sequences). Ternary complexes (G17) stalled at position +17 on the pML20–23like3 template were synthesized by incubating preinitiation complex with 1 mm ApC, 20 μm ATP, 50 μm dATP, and 1 μm [α-32P]GTP for 5 min at 30 °C, followed by incubation for 5 min at 30 °C with nonlabeled 20 μM GTP and sarkosyl rinsing. Similarly, C23 was made from preinitiation complex with 1 mm ApC, 20 μmeach ATP and GTP, 50 μm dATP, and 1 μm[α-32P]CTP for 5 min at 30 °C followed by the addition of 20 μm nonlabeled CTP, 5 min of further incubation at 30 °C, and sarkosyl rinsing. G17 complexes were elongated to C18 and C23 complexes to U26, G29, or A32 by the addition of the appropriate NTPs at 50 μm and incubation for 5 min at 25 °C. The experiment in Fig. 8 used bead-attached templates generated by PCR from the pML20–55 M template. Primers for generating the PCR fragments, preparation of the bead attached templates, and assembly of preinitiation complexes on these templates were as described (16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complexes were advanced to the desired positions as given in the Fig. 8legend. 2′-O-methyl-RNA/DNA chimeras were added to ternary complexes stalled on pML20–23 at a final concentration of 0.1–10 μm and were incubated in the presence of a final concentration of 0.03 units/μl RNase H and 0.05 units/μl ribonuclease inhibitor for 10 min at 37 °C. This yields the site-specific cleavage of the RNA in the complex at the 5′-end of the chimera (28Lapham J. Crothers D.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lapham J., Yu, Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Crothers D.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 950-951PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that the faint bands that were occasionally seen above the main products (see, for example,lanes 2, 6, and 10 of Fig.2) are not due to variations in the location of RNase H digestion but rather to low levels of read-through RNA in the original transcription reaction (note, for example, the presence of 152-mers in the C151 preparation in Ref. 10Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This explanation is consistent with our results with U154 complexes, which were generated from C151 with low levels of UTP and which do not appear to have any read-through products. In that case, RNase H cleavage with the chimeric oligonucleotides gave essentially a single band (see Fig. 3). Transcript truncation for the experiment in Fig. 8 was performed using RNase T1 digestion as described in the legend to Fig. 8.Figure 3Truncation of the transcript in U154 complexes can lead to arrest. Complex U154 was synthesized on plasmid pML20–23 (lane 1) with only the last 3 nt labeled. RNA was cleaved by RNase H after annealing the indicated chimeric oligonucleotides as described under “Materials and Methods.” Oligonucleotides were used at the same concentrations as in the experiment in Fig. 2. Transcripts remaining in complex were initially chased with a 50 μm concentration of the indicated NTPs for 5 min at 37 °C. In lanes 4, 8, and 12, an additional 5-min chase with ATP at 50 μm was performed at 37 °C; in all other lanes (except lane 1), the initial chase incubation was simply continued for an additional 5 min. The percentages of the complexes that arrested were calculated by comparing the initial complex to the fraction that remained after single nucleotide chase. For example, 56% of the 21-mer in lane 2remained in lane 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complexes treated with RNase H were tested for transcriptional competence by the addition of 50 μm NTPs at 37 °C as described in detail in the figure legends. No chimeras or RNase H were added to the complexes synthesized on pML20–23like3, but these were also incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to mimic conditions of the RNase H cleavage experiment. These complexes were then immediately chased by further incubation with 50 μm NTPs at 37 °C for 5 min. When indicated, a final concentration of 18 μg/ml of SII (or 29 μg/ml, for the experiment in Fig. 8) was included in the chase reactions. It should be noted that C17 and G18 complexes showed significant transcript truncation, in the absence of added SII, during a 5-min incubation at 25 °C (compare lanes 2 and3 with lane 1 in Fig. 4). Truncation was more pronounced during mock-chase incubations at 37 °C (comparelanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 7). This transcript cleavage involved RNA polymerase, since it was completely inhibited by α-amanitin (data not shown) and was essentially confined to the C17 and G18 complexes. We did not observe breakdown with early elongation complexes walked to position +23 or later (Fig. 4), nor did we see this effect with promoter-distal complexes whose transcripts had been trimmed with RNase H to 18 nt or any other length (Figs. 2 and 3). We believe that the source of the cleavage is a very low level of SII from the nuclear extract that was not removed by the sakosyl rinsing, since the addition of sarkosyl to the C17 or G18 complexes prevented RNA breakdown without inhibiting the elongation of the transcripts upon chase (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that very early elongation complexes differ from later complexes in a way that renders their transcripts exceptionally labile to cleavage. If residual SII did remain in the promoter-proximal C17 and G18 complexes (Fig. 4), this cannot explain their very low level of arrest relative to, for example, C23 promoter-proximal complexes, since promoter-distal C18 complexes generated by RNase H cleavage, which show no RNA breakdown upon incubation, are also fully elongation-competent (Fig. 2). It is important to note that after the sarkosyl washing step, transcript initiation factors are removed (see Refs. 26Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5343-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 30Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, once transcript cleavage was performed with oligonucleotides and RNase H, there was no need to remove these components during subsequent chase reactions, since the transcript segments targeted by the oligonucleotides could not be regenerated. All transcription reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted and (except for the Fig. 7 experiment) ethanol-precipitated. The reactions in Fig. 7 were concentrated by lyophilization and loaded directly to avoid loss of the short transcript cleavage products. Samples were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide (19:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels with the following percentages of acrylamide: Fig.6, 6%; Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, 13%; Figs. 7 and 8, 20%. Radioactivity was visualized on a PhosphorImager, and quantitation was done with the program ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences).Figure 6Induction of arrest by hybridization of oligonucleotides to the nascent RNA.A, the indicated chimeras were annealed to body-labeled C151 RNA (see Fig. 1) at 37 °C for 10 min. RNase H was also added in the indicated lanes, to verify proper annealing of the oligonucleotides.

Each chimera annealed 3 nt more distal from the 3′-end of the RNA on the U154 complexes as compared with C151. The values for percentage arrest were corrected by subtraction of the percentage arrest observed in the absence of the chimeras.

That study employed a template, called pML20–23, which was constructed in such a way that RNA polymerase could be advanced in only two steps to position +151. The sequence TTTGGGAAACCC on the nontemplate strand immediately downstream of position +151 allowed walking of the polymerase from C151 to U154, G157, or A160 by incubating with a subset of NTPs (see Fig.1). All of the complexes stalled from +151 to +160 were found to be fully active in chase reactions (only about 5–10% failed to restart transcription), and their exonuclease III footprints advanced synchronously along the template with the polymerase active site. To study the same DNA sequence in a promoter-proximal context, the region downstream of position +130 on plasmid pML20–23 was moved to the beginning of the initially transcribed region of the adenovirus major late promoter, creating the pML20–23like series of plasmids (16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this case, the TTTGGGAAACCC sequence begins only 24 bases downstream of +1 (see Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the RNA polymerase II complexes corresponding to the +151 to +160 complexes on pML20–23, namely C23, U26, G29, and A32, were all found to be severely arrested on this template (16Pal M. McKean D. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 4). To determine the basis for the difference in elongation competence of these complexes, we cleaved the RNAs in the promoter-distal complexes so that they matched, in length and sequence, the transcripts in the promoter-proximal complexes. In our initial pilot experiments, we used RNase A to cut the transcripts in C151 complexes made on the pML20–23 plasmid. After the RNase A digestion, a prominent 21-nt-long RNA remained in the ternary complexes. We found that these 21-mer complexes were predominantly arrested (data not shown). Encouraged by this observation, we employed a procedure that permits sequence-specific cleavage of transcripts in ternary transcription complexes. This involved the use of RNase H in combination with different 2′-O-methyl-RNA/DNA chimeric oligonucleotides. When such chimeras containing four DNA residues at the 5′-end are annealed to RNA and the hybrids are treated with RNase H, cleavage has been shown to occur exclusively at the 5′-end of the chimera (28Lapham J. Crothers D.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 2 shows the results of an experiment in which chimeras 1–3 (Fig. 1) were separately annealed to body-labeled RNA in the C151 complex (uncut RNA is shown inlane 1). The conditions of the RNase H digestion were optimized so that more than 90% of the input RNA was cut in 10 min at 37 °C. We also confirmed that this incubation without the addition of RNase H did not deactivate the C151 complexes (see Fig.6A, lanes 1 and 2). Digestion with RNase H yielded primarily RNAs that were 18, 23, and 45 nt long (lanes 2–5, 6–9, and10–13, respectively), with a faint additional band 1 nt longer (see “Materials and Methods”). After cleavage, the complexes were immediately chased with 50 μm UTP or UTP and GTP at 37 °C for 5 min. At the end of the first chase, a final 50 μm GTP was added tolanes 4, 8, and 12, and all tubes were incubated for an additional 5 min. The amount of arrest was calculated as the percentage of the complex that could not be elongated in the chase reaction. For example, 11% of the C18 band remained inlane 3 as compared with C18 in lane 2. We consider complex C18 fully active, since about the same fraction (14%) of its parent complex, C151, cannot be chased after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C without RNase H (Fig.6A). In contrast to the C18 complex, complexes C23 and C45 were found to be arrested (73 and 53%, respectively) in this experiment. If the elongation factor SII was included in the chase reactions, nearly all (>95%) of the complexes could be elongated (data not shown; see Fig. 4). The same experiment was repeated with complex U154 (Fig.3). In this case, the RNA was 3′-end-labeled; therefore, only the 3′ segment is detectable after the cleavage reaction. Note the disappearance of the 5′ cleavage products from the top of the gel. We observed that the U21, U26, and U48 complexes were 56, 89, and 35% arrested, respectively. These results show that the promoter-distal complexes that are fully elongation-competent can be converted to complexes that are easily arrested, like their promoter-proximal counterparts. During these experiments, we noticed that the extent of arrest for a given complex was clearly dependent on the incubation time. For example, if C18 was chased in the presence of both UTP and GTP (Fig. 2,lane 5), most complexes successfully elongated to G24. If only UTP was included in the reaction mixture during the first 5 min, all complexes advanced to C21, but only a small fraction of them could be chased further to G24 by the addition of GTP in a second 5-min incubation (lane 4). Thus, the half-life of the transcriptionally active form of the C21 complex is less than 5 min. Similar results were seen with complexes U26 and U48 in Fig. 2 (comparelane 8 with lane 9 andlane 12 with lane 13) and with complexes U21 and U26 in Fig. 3 (compare lane 4 with lane 5 and lane 8 with lane 9). About 35% of the initial U48 complex failed to advance to G51 in a 5-min chase (lanes 10 and 11of Fig. 3). However, when the G51 complexes were chased in a second 5-min reaction, all of them extended their RNAs to A54 (lane 12). To test longer RNA sequences, we performed an experiment in which a 2′-O-methyl-RNA/DNA oligonucleotide was annealed from position 123 to 133 upstream from the 3′-end of the 151-nt RNA. After the RNase H cleavage, the ternary complex containing a 122-nt RNA remained as active as a mock-cleaved control complex (data not shown). To sample more complexes containing different lengths of RNA after the RNase H cleavage reaction, we repeated the above experiments on complexes G157 and A160. The sequences of these RNAs are shown in Fig.1, and results are summarized in Fig. 5. A clear trend could be discerned from these tests.

Approximately 14 hereditary neurological diseases are caused by the genetic instabilities of triplet repeat sequences (TRS)1 in or near relevant genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Wells, R. D., and Warren, S.

Long tracts of repeating CTG·CAG sequences are responsible for myotonic dystrophy and several other diseases. Normal individuals have 5–37 repeats in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene, whereas the mutations (expansions) can be in the range of 50–3000 repeats. Thus, an explosive allele length change during intergenerational transmission can occur in this autosomal dominant disease, thus causing an increase in the severity of the disease and a decrease of the age at onset (anticipation).

Similar findings have also been made with CTG·CAG repeats using a two-plasmid system in Escherichia coli (27Jakupciak J.P. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Multiple fold expansions, deletions, and the exchange of point mutations between tracts were found in this system; these events were dependent on the presence of TRS tracts on both plasmids, CTG·CAG repeat lengths longer than 30, and a functional recA gene. Previously (29Skowronski J. Plucienniczak A. Bednarek A. Jaworski J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 77: 399-416Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it was proposed that CTG·CAG tracts might function as recombination hot spots in the bovine genome. More recently, Younget al. (30Young E.T. Sloan J.S. Van Riper K. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) surveyed the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and suggested that these repeats could be recombination hot spots based on the distribution of triplet repeats therein. However, no experimental evidence exists regarding the capacity of triplet repeat sequences to influence the apparent frequency of homologous recombination. Here we present the first genetic assay for the determination of the apparent frequency of intermolecular homologous recombination between CTG·CAG tracts. We have identified several factors that influence the recombination frequency. In our companion paper (31Napierala M. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34087-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have furthermore established a genetic assay for monitoring the apparent recombination frequency of CTG·CAG repeats tracts in an intramolecular system. The (CTG·CAG)n repeats were obtained from pRW4026, pRW3297, pRW3246, and pRW3248 that contain (CTG·CAG)67, (CTG·CAG)73, (CTG·CAG)98, and (CTG·CAG)175, respectively, and were cloned into the HincII site of the polylinker of pUC19NotI (5Kang S.

Although the (CTG·CAG)67 and (CTG·CAG)98 tracts are uninterrupted (perfectly repeating) triplets, the (CTG·CAG)73 and (CTG·CAG)175 sequences contain two G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 59 or 28 and 69, respectively (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). All these repeated tracts have 19 and 41 bp of non-repetitive human flanking sequences 5′ and 3′, respectively, to the (CTG·CAG)n repeats (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

The plasmids were maintained inE. coli HB101 (Invitrogen) (mcrB, mmr, hsdS20(rB−, mB−), recA1, supE44, ara14, galK2, lacY1, proA2, rplS20, (SmR), xyl5, λ−, leuB6, mtl-1). The CTG·CAG-containing sequences were subcloned into pBR322 and pFW25 (34Wu F., Wu, J. Ehley J. Filutowicz M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4965-4974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. Fragments containing (CTG·CAG)n were prepared by digesting the pUC19NotI derivatives with eitherNotI or EcoRI/HindIII (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The DNA was then blunt-ended by filling in the cohesive ends with 1 unit of the Klenow fragment of E. colipolymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and dNTPs, electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) buffer, and the band containing the triplet repeat fragment excised. The DNA was then eluted from the excised band and purified by phenol extraction (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pBR322 and pFW25 vectors were prepared by digesting with PvuII and HincII, respectively. The vector and the insert were mixed and ligated for 16 h at 16 °C by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA ligase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). E. coli HB101 was used to maintain the pBR322-derived clones, whereas pFW25 and its derivatives were grown in E. coli ECF003.

Thus, for pBR322, the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli HB101 by electroporation and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. In the case of pFW25, the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coliECF003 and plated on LB agar plates with 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 0.1% arabinose. Plasmids were then isolated from individual transformants by the Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA purification System (Promega) and characterized by restriction mapping. By using this strategy, clones were obtained containing the CTG·CAG tracts in both orientations relative to the origin of replication (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

The TRS-containing NotI fragments were used to construct pRW4312, pRW4313, pRW4316, pRW4317, pRW4318, and pRW4319, and TRS-harboring EcoRI/HindIII inserts were used to create pRW4323, pRW4324, pRW4331, pRW4332, pRW4333, pRW4334, pRW4827, pRW4828, pRW4898, and pRW4899 (Table II).

Orientations A and B (for the 354-bp non-repeating sequence fragment) were defined by the presence of a KpnI recognition site, in the sequence, distal or proximal to the origin of replication, respectively. Two non-repeating sequences were used in this study as controls: a 564-bp HindIII fragment of bacteriophage λ DNA (spanning positions 36,895–37,459 of the λ genome) and a 354-bp segment of the human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (DMPK gene) (part of exon 7 and intron 7). The HindIII fragment was obtained by digesting the λ DNA with HindIII followed by blunt-ending of the cohesive ends. The insert was then cloned into thePvuII site of pBR322 or the HincII site of pFW25 (as described above). The DMPK fragment was prepared by PCR amplification of the sequence from the human genomic DNA (31Napierala M. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

In order to study the frequency of RecA-dependent homologous recombination, we used the following strains: E. coli AB1157 (F−thi-1 hisG4 Δ(gpt-proA)62 argE3 thr-1 leuB6 kdgK51 rfbD1 ara-14 lacY1 galK2 xyl-5 mtl-1 tsx-33 supE44 rpsL31 rac- λ- (38Bachmann B.J. Neidhardt F.D. Derivations and Genotypes of Some Mutant Derivatives of Escherichia coli K-12. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Genetics. 1979; 93: 321-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ECF006. The E. coliAB1157 and JC10287 strains were obtained from the E. coliGenetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT. The E. coli ECF005 and ECF006 strains were constructed as described below. The plasmid pFL814 is a derivative of plasmid pJW344 (kindly provided by Dr. Jadwiga Wild, UW Madison) into which pirallele that encodes π·P106L∧F107S was inserted downstream of the arabinose (ParaBAD) promoter, rendering π (over)expression dependent on externally supplied arabinose and permitting a site-specific integration of the pir allele into λattB. Briefly, pFL814 contains two NotI sites, cleaving of which generates two DNA fragments as follows: one fragment contains λattP, bla, and ParaBADpir (π·P106L∧F107S) and another fragment contains pBR322 oriV. The former DNA fragment was gel-purified, ligated under diluted conditions, and transformed into strains (DH10b, AB1157, and JC10287) each harboring a temperature-sensitive plasmid pJW289 (from J. Wild) that produces λ Int protein. Chromosomal integrants (Campbell recombinants) were selected on plates supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg per ml). Cells were then cured of the Ts plasmid pJW289 by several passages on plates incubated at 42 °C. Integration of the pBR322-oriV-less DNA was assessed by determining the ability of the resulting strains to support replication of plasmid pFW25 (γ ori) and by immunoassay using anti-π antibodies (data not shown). The resulting strains were designated ECF003, ECF005, and ECF006, respectively. For the recombination studies, plasmids containing TRS or non-repeating sequences were grown to A600 ∼0.5–0.6 in 500-ml LB cultures with the appropriate antibiotic, and the DNA was isolated using Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA purification System (Promega). The DNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel. The superhelical form of the DNA containing the undeleted CTG·CAG sequence was excised and electroeluted (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); this homogenous, undeleted plasmid was used for all the recombination experiments. pBR322 derivatives containing TRS or non-repeating tracts were transformed into the appropriate E. coli strain by electroporation (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The transformation mixture was inoculated into 10 ml of LB media (containing tetracycline at 5 μg/ml), and the cultures were grown at 37 °C at a shaking rate of 100 rpm. When the cultures reached an absorbance (600 nm) of ∼0.6 unit, an aliquot (1 ml) was inoculated into fresh 200 ml of LB (with tetracycline as before). The cultures were allowed to grow until they had reached anA600 value of 0.7 units. Aliquots of the cultures were used for plasmid isolation (as described before) to verify the integrity of the TRS-containing insert. These cultures were then used to prepare competent cells for electroporation. The pBR322 derivative-containing cells were then transformed with the purified pFW25 derivatives. The transformation mixture was then plated onto plates with tetracycline (5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (75 μg/ml). For all experiments, the E. coli cells (ECF005, ECF006, as well as AB1157 and JC10287) were grown in the presence of arabinose (0.1%). The colonies were counted after 14 h of incubation at 37 °C (∼25 cell generations), and these numbers were used to estimate the apparent frequency of recombination (see “Results”). For the restriction analyses and sequencing, single colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of LB with tetracycline (5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (75 μg/ml). When the cultures reached an absorbance (600 nm) of 1.0 unit (20–24 h), DNA was isolated and analyzed for single and double crossover events as well as TRS instability. As a control of the efficiency of transformation of E. coliAB1157 and ECF005 or JC10287 and ECF006, the cells containing pBR322 derivatives were then transformed with pACYC184 (for an explanation see “Results”). The pACYC184 plasmid contains the chloramphenicol resistance gene and the p15A origin of replication (40Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pACYC184 can co-exist in E. coli with pBR322 and can be replicated in the absence of the π protein (27Jakupciak J.P. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23468-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Jakupciak J.P. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1987; 238: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In order to study the recombination frequency, the pFW25 derivatives were transformed into E. coli AB1157 cells containing pBR322 derivatives (see “Results”). The pFW25 derivatives cannot replicate by themselves; the only way to obtain CmR colonies is when the two plasmids recombine, and the recombinant molecule uses the pBR322 origin of replication. However, the formation of CmR colonies is contingent not only upon the formation of recombinant plasmids after transformation but also their establishment and maintenance, particularly in the face of competition from multiple copies of the resident plasmid which is incompatible with the newly formed recombinant. Thus, the following questions were raised: is the establishment of the recombinant molecule influenced by the presence of an incompatible plasmid in the cell? Does the efficiency of establishment of the recombinant vary with the sequence composition of the insert? In order to address these questions, we measured the ability of isolated recombinant molecules (examples shown in Fig. 2) to transform and be maintained in host cells harboring the incompatible resident plasmid in multiple copies. If the answers to the questions raised were in the affirmative, and if these factors influenced the outcome of the recombination frequencies measured, then we would predict that there would be a 1:1 correlation between the transformation efficiencies of the recombinant molecules and the apparent recombination frequencies measured for plasmids harboring the same sequence insert. Hence, the following experiment was performed to test the effect of the incoming plasmid on the measurements. The recombinant molecules (examples shown in Fig. 2) from experiments done with various sets of monomer plasmids were electroeluted from an agarose gel as described above. The purified molecules containing different lengths of TRS or non-repeating sequences were transformed into plasmid-less AB1157 cells or into cells that carried a resident pBR322 derivative containing a DMPK insert. To control for the transformation efficiency of the host cells, pACYC184 was used. The efficiency of transformation was calculated by dividing the number of TetR, CmRcolonies obtained from transformation with the recombinant molecules by the number of colonies obtained after transformation with pACYC184. The results presented in Table I (1st and 3rd lines) show that there is no significant difference in the transformation efficiency between plasmid-less or pRW4870-containing cells. Therefore, the first conclusion is that there is no significant influence of the presence of a resident incompatible plasmid on the transformation efficiency with the recombinant molecules. The selection pressure for the antibiotic allows detection of all cells into which the recombinant molecule is introduced, regardless of the presence of the resident plasmid.Table IFrequency of transformation of E. coli AB1157 or ECF005 cells with “recombinant molecules”Cells harboring pBR322 derivativesFrequency of transformation of E. coli harboring pBR322 derivatives by recombinant molecules containing DMPK or (CTG·CAG)67 or (CTG·CAG)98DMPK sequences (×10−4)(CTG·CAG)67 sequences (×10−4)(CTG·CAG)98 sequences (×10−4)Plasmid-less AB11576.20.82.4Plasmid-less ECF0051.10.172.8pRW4870 (DMPK) in AB1157102.42.4pRW4870 (DMPK) in ECF0054.04.017pRW4827 (CTG·CAG)67 in AB11571.21.71.4pRW4827 (CTG·CAG)67 in ECF0050.20.526.1pRW4898 (CTG·CAG)98 in AB1157230120250pRW4898 (CTG·CAG)98 in ECF005732274E. coli AB1157 or ECF005 cells with or without pBR322 derivatives were transformed with recombinant molecules obtained from intermolecular recombination between pBR322 and pFW25 derivatives harboring different lengths of the (CTG·CAG)ntracts or the non-repeating sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transformation mixtures were plated onto plates with Cm and Tet, and the number of colonies was counted.

The efficiency of transformation was calculated (as described above), and the results are shown in Table I (3rd, 5th, and 7th lines). There was no difference in the transformation efficiencies whether the resident plasmids contained the non-repeating DMPK sequence or the (CTG·CAG)67. Surprisingly, we found that there was an increase in transformation efficiency when the resident plasmid contained (CTG·CAG)98. This appeared to indicate that the higher recombination frequencies measured were in fact due to the greater transformability of cells harboring (CTG·CAG)98. However, in our recombination assay, the apparent recombination frequency was measured as a ratio between TetR, CmR colonies obtained from AB1"

Here we show that whereas normal thyrocytes express FcRn, Graves' disease thyrocytes also express FcgammaRIIB2. We further find that expression of FcgammaRIIB2, but not FcRn, is repressed by dihydrotestosterone. By mediating the uptake and transport of autoantibodies, we suggest that these IgG Fc receptors contribute in various ways to the onset and/or progression of autoimmune thyroid diseases. The androgen-mediated decrease of FcgammaRIIB2 expression in Graves' disease thyrocytes also provides a rationale for the predominant susceptibility of women to develop an autoimmune thyroid disease. Our findings open up a new prospect to autoimmunity, linking the role of the target organ to the sex dependence in autoimmune disease."

A common feature for all RNRs isolated so far is a similar reaction mechanism involving free radicals and redox-active cysteines. The RNR enzymes can be grouped into three major classes based on the mechanism used for radical generation and on structural differences (3Reichard P.

The α2 dimers are called R1, and each subunit hosts an active site and binding sites for allosteric effectors. Each subunit of the β2 dimers (called R2) contains a μ-oxo-bridged diferric center (iron-oxygen cluster) (7Andersson K.K. Gra¨slund A. Adv. Inorg.

The radical originating from the tyrosyl radical of the R2 protein is transferred 35–40 Å to the active site cysteines in the R1 protein (5Eklund H. Uhlin U. Fa¨rnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P.

Substitution studies with other divalent metals that are less air-sensitive can provide useful information about this biological relevant form of the enzyme. In this study, Co(II) was chosen because cobalt ions exhibit characteristic spectra depending on ligand environments and thus provide the electronic structure for the metal ion site of mouse R2 (23Banci L. Bencini A. Benelinni C. Gatteschi D. Zanchini C. Struct. Bond. 1982; 52: 37-86Crossref Google Scholar, 24Bertini I. Luchianti C. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 6: 71-111PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous studies where the metal ion cluster has been replaced have provided significant structural information for many metalloproteins, among which are manganese- (25Atta M. Nordlund P. Åberg A.

Chem. 1994; 33: 891-894Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) substituted R2 RNRs. The x-ray manganese structures have served as good models for the reduced form of theE. coli R2 enzyme. Among the isolated and characterized non-corrin-cobalt-containing enzymes, the most relevant for comparison with R2 is the methionine aminopeptidases isolated from E. coli. The x-ray structure revealed a dinuclear cobalt site with carboxylate and histidine ligands (29Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This rich carboxylate coordination environment is very similar to the carboxylate-bridged dinuclear iron centers we find in the iron-oxygen proteins such as class I R2 RNR, methane monooxygenase hydroxylase (MMOH), and acyl-carrier-protein Δ9-desaturase, which are all capable of activating dioxygen for subsequent oxidation chemistry. However, this is not the case for the cobalt-containing methionine aminopeptidases, which fromE. coli requires two Co(II) atoms for hydrolytic activity to cleave the N terminus from newly translated polypeptide chains. In this study we report the first crystal structure of a fully occupied dinuclear site of mouse R2 RNR at pH 6. A structure at this pH is more physiologically relevant than the previous structure at pH 4.7. It also gives new insights into the structure and spectroscopic properties of the reduced diferrous center of mouse R2. Our EPR studies show that the cobalt atoms in the dinuclear site are ferromagnetically coupled in contrast to cobalt-substituted E. coli R2 (28Elgren T.E. Ming L.-J. Que L.J. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 891-894Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Several other non-corrin-cobalt enzymes other than methionine aminopeptidases have been isolated and characterized (prolidase, nitrile hydratase, glucose isomerase, methylmalonyl-CoA carboxytransferase, aldehyde decarbonylase, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and bromoperoxidase) (30Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the ferromagnetic coupled dinuclear Co(II) cluster in mouse R2 can serve as a model for active dinuclear cobalt-containing proteins. The cloned mouse R2 apoprotein was prepared as reported by Mann et al. (21Mann G.J. Gra¨slund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The apoR2 protein obtained after purification was pretreated with hydroxyurea and EDTA and passed down a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 column to remove all iron and reduce the tyrosyl radical before reconstitution with Co(II). The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or the molar extinction coefficient ε280–310 nm = 124 mm−1 cm−1/90 kDa (R2 dimer) (21Mann G.J. Gra¨slund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Optical absorption spectra were collected on a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. The EPR spectra were recorded at X-band on a Bruker ESP 300E, fitted with a Bruker ER4116DM dual mode cavity and an Oxford ESR 900 helium flow cryostat. The signals were measured at different microwave powers to prevent power saturation. They were quantitated by comparing double integrals of spectra with high spin Co(II) in either 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol or 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1.2 m NaCl, 20% glycerol depending on which pH the cobalt substitution of R2 was performed. The spectra were recorded under identical non-saturating microwave power. The R2 crystals were grown in hanging drops as described earlier (32Nielsen B.B. Kauppi B. Thelander M. Thelander L. Kjøller-Larsen I. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using 7.5 mg/ml protein in the presence or absence of 3.8 equivalents of Co(II)/R2 dimer and 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.7, containing 1.2 m NaCl. Diffraction below 3 Å resolution was observed at BM01A (Swiss-Norwegian Beamline, SNBL) and a dataset to 2.2 Å resolution was collected at ID14-1 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Map interpretation showed binding only of mononuclear cobalt in site 2 (the site farthest away from the tyrosyl radical site Tyr-177; see Fig. 7B). To increase the binding of cobalt, the crystals of apoR2 were soaked in 5 mm CoCl2 for 3 h, and the pH was increased gradually to about 6 by adding 1 m sodium acetate. Sodium ascorbate (2 mm) was added to the solution to prevent oxidation of the Co(II) ions. One crystal was transferred to a cryosolution of 25% glycerol, 5 mm Co(II), and 2 mm sodium ascorbate and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2.4 Å dataset was collected on a MAR CCD detector at beamline ID14-3 at ESRF in Grenoble. The 120 frames were measured, processed in DENZO, and merged in Scalepack (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and gave 99.3% completeness (15,274 unique reflections) between 30.0 and 2.4 Å resolution, aRmerge of 9.5% and I/ςIvalue of 9.6. Although our cobalt-substituted R2 and apoR2 proteins were crystallized using the same conditions as for the iron-reconstituted mouse R2 protein reported by Kauppi and co-workers (16Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Nielsen B.B. Kauppi B. Thelander M. Thelander L. Kjøller-Larsen I. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the cell dimensions (space group C2221, one monomer in the asymmetric unit) were shorter. Therefore, the molecular replacement technique had to be used for the structure determination. The R2 protein (PDB 1XSM) was used as search model, and all water molecules and the single iron ion were deleted. The rotation and translation searches were carried out with the CNS program package (34Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nigles M.

After the rigid body refinement, simulated annealing and positional refinement in CNS electron density maps (Fo-Fcand 2Fo-Fc) showed well defined electron density at an 8-ς level for the cobalt ions in the proposed metal center in the protein. The program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used for map inspection and model building. The cobalt ions were included in the coordinate file, and 113 water molecules were added in several iterations to the model and refined in CNS. Only water molecules with well defined density and reasonable hydrogen bond geometry were chosen. The refinement brought R and Rfree based on 5% of the data down to 21.8 and 29.7%, respectively. The 65–352-residue model of the Co(II)-substituted R2 protein refined to 2.4 Å showed good stereochemistry with deviations from ideal geometry of 0.024 Å for bond lengths, 2.1° for bond angles, and 21.8° for dihedral angles. In the CNS package (34Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nigles M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), the mean coordinate error was estimated to be 0.31 Å for the entire structure. The program PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton R.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 5: 802-810Google Scholar) estimated that 89.0% of the nonglycine and proline residues were in the most favored regions, whereas 9.5 and 1.5% were found either in other allowed or in generously allowed regions, respectively. Four amino acids (Arg-79, Phe-81, Arg-149, and Glu-307) in the latter mentioned region are all in flexible loops at the surface of the protein and have high temperature factors. The coordinates for the structures of mono-Co(II)-R2 and di-Co(II)-R2 are deposited in the Protein Data Bank and have been assigned PDB ID 1h0o.pdb and 1h0n.pdb, respectively. In this study, we have substituted the natural iron cluster with cobalt. We chose Co(II) because it would make a good model for the native dinuclear ferrous cluster of the enzyme. The mouse apoR2 protein after purification was pretreated with hydroxyurea and EDTA to remove all iron before incubation with Co(II). Aqueous solutions of Co(II) are readily oxidized to Co(III). The air-sensitive Co(II) buffer solutions were made fresh just before use. Unlike the very air-sensitive diferrous R2 protein, the cobalt-containing form of mouse R2 (Co(II)-R2) shows no difference in oxidation state whether the reconstitution was performed aerobically or anaerobically (data not shown). Unless otherwise indicated, all of the work represented in this paper is done aerobically. This apparent insensitivity to dioxygen is consistent with reports of other cobalt-substituted proteins such as the anaerobic prepared cobalt-substituted R2 protein from E. coli (28Elgren T.E. Ming L.-J. Que L.J. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 891-894Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This protein did not appear to bind or activate dioxygen. The reconstitution was first made at pH 7.6 by the aerobic addition of 10 molar excess of Co(II)/apoR2 dimer (typical [R2] was 0.2–0.5 mm). This yielded a pink cobalt R2 derivative within seconds. The sample was passed down a small Sephadex G-25 column at 4 °C to remove any unbound cobalt from the protein. The EPR spectrum at 4 K of the gel-filtered Co(II)-R2 sample had a broad signal from 50 to 370 mT, typical of Co(II) high spin S = 3/2 (Fig.1, dotted line). Systems with S > 1/2 can be described by the spin Hamiltonian (23Banci L. Bencini A. Benelinni C. Gatteschi D. Zanchini C. Struct. Bond. 1982; 52: 37-86Crossref Google Scholar, 24Bertini I.

The observed broad axial X-band EPR signal from Co(II)-R2 is typical for the lowest Kramers doublet (Ms = ± 1/2) from S = 3/2 high spin mononuclear Co(II) species. The signal has a geffat ∼170 mT (g ∼ 4.1) with a gmax value at ∼ 5.4 and a signal at g = 2.02 over a temperature range from 3.6 to 30 K. The g values of the Co(II)-R2 sample are close to the theoretical axial S = 3/2 g values at 4.0, 4.0, and 2.0. Different traces of Co(II) low spin (S = 1/2) impurities are observed above g = 2. No tyrosyl radical was generated during the aerobic reaction of apoR2 with Co(II) (Fig. 1, dotted line). A full occupancy of the native μ-oxo-diferric binding site will give a binding stoichiometry of 4 metal ions/R2 dimer. Quantitation of the observed broad axial gmax ∼ 5.4 EPR signal from the gel-filtered Co(II)-R2 sample against Co(II) in buffer showed that about 15–20% of the expected metal binding sites were occupied with EPR-active Co(II). To rule out the presence of EPR-silent Co(III), a reduction of the protein with dithionite was performed. This gave no change in the observed EPR signal (data not shown). The Co(II)-R2 sample was acid denatured (1.4 m HCl, 12 h at room temperature). The EPR spectrum of the acid-denatured Co(II)-R2 sample (Fig. 1, solid line) showed an increase in the intensity of the Co(II) S = 3/2 EPR signal compared with the intensity from the Co(II)-R2, pH 7.6, sample (Fig. 1, dotted line). Assuming that the intensity of the Co(II) signal after acid denaturation represents all Co(II) bound to R2, the results suggest that 80% of the metal binding sites in the Co(II)-R2 sample at pH 7.6 was occupied with EPR-silent Co(II). The EPR spectra of Co(II) in buffer did not change in shape or intensity when HCl was added. These results imply that the majority of the Co(II) atoms bound to R2 at pH 7.6 interact with each other to form a magnetically coupled dinuclear site that cannot be detected by perpendicular mode X-band EPR. The binding ratio of cobalt to R2 indicates that most of the available metal sites are occupied with magnetically coupled cobalt atoms in the gel-filtered Co(II)-R2 sample. The formation of the perpendicular mode X-band EPR-silent metal site at pH 7.6 can be followed by preparing EPR samples with an increasing ratio of Co(II) to apoR2 without gel filtration. The EPR spectra from the titration of R2 with 1–8 equivalents Co(II) are identical in shape to the spectrum observed from the gel-filtered Co(II)-R2 sample, although with different intensities (Fig. 2,B and C). When the ratio of the concentration of added Co(II) to apoR2 reached the level at which formation of magnetically coupled dinuclear cobalt sites becomes possible, the relative intensity of the gmax = 5.4 Co(II)S = 3/2 EPR signal from the cobalt-substituted R2 will no longer be comparable in intensity with that of a buffer sample of CoCl2 of identical concentration (Fig. 2, A andB). Thus, a quantitation of the Co(II) EPR signal of a sample containing 4 equivalents of cobalt/R2 dimer shows that the intensity drops to about 60% of the EPR signal from the same amount of cobalt in buffer. This means that about 40% of the cobalt bound to R2 is EPR-silent, and 60% behaves as Co(II) in buffer. To quantify the observed EPR signal, the D value has to be positive. The microwave power saturation behavior at different temperatures can give a D value using the method of Makinen and co-workers (37Yim M.B. Kuo L.C. Makinen M.W. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 46: 247-256Google Scholar, 38Makinen M.W. Wells G.B. Metals Ions Biol. Syst. 1987; 22: 129-206Google Scholar). Fig. 3,A and B, shows the effect of microwave power saturation at 3.6 and 5.8 K of the gmax signal from samples where 4 and 6 equivalents of cobalt/R2 dimer were added, respectively. Fig. 3B also shows the behavior of identical concentrations of Co(II) in buffer at 3.6 K (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol). TableI summarizes the EPR relaxation parameters of the gmax signal from the different samples at different temperatures. The parameters of the saturation curves in terms of microwave power at half-saturationP1/2 and b are summarized in Table I. The parameter b describes the contribution of nonhomogeneous broadening (41Sahlin M. Gra¨slund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 135-137Google Scholar) to the saturation curve as shown in Equation 2,Iα1(1+P/P1/2)b/2Equation 2 where I is the EPR amplitude and P is the microwave power.Table IMicrowave power saturation P12 values of the gmax 5.4 component at 3.6 and 5.8 K of Co(II)-substituted R2 and Co(II) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20% glycerolTemperature4 Co(II)-R2 dimer6 Co(II)-R2 dimerCo(II) in bufferP12bP12bP12bmWmWmW3.6 K0.20.650.20.760.31.185.8 K8.00.628.00.66P12 and b values were estimated from computer fitting of the microwave saturation curves.

TheP12 values do change slightly withb = 1; letting b float improves the fitting. The P1/2 values were estimated to 0.2–0.3 mW at 3.6 K and 8–16 mW at 5.8 K with b ∼ 0.7 orb = 1 for both Co(II)-R2 samples. TheP1/2 for the Co(II) in buffer was estimated to 0.3 mW at 3.6 K. The saturation behaviors of the three samples are similar (Table I). In the Co(II)-R2 samples, there might be a small fraction of mononuclear Co(II) bound to R2. Integration of the EPR signal under nonsaturating conditions demonstrates a 20–30% decrease at 5.8 K compared with 3.6 K. A negative D value would have increased the EPR-active Co(II) signal when the temperature was increased. Taken together with the microwave saturation behavior this shows a positive D value for the EPR-active species in Co(II)-R2 (37Yim M.B. Kuo L.C. Makinen M.W. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 46: 247-256Google Scholar, 38Makinen M.W. Wells G.B. Metals Ions Biol. Syst. 1987; 22: 129-206Google Scholar). The acid-treated Co(II)-R2 also has EPR properties identical to the high spin EPR-active Co(II) in Co(II)-R2 and in buffer (data not shown). The observed cobalt signals in all three of these samples have similar positive and large D values. This validates the quantitation of the EPR-active Co(II) in Co(II)-R2. It also shows that the majority of the EPR-active Co(II) present in mouse Co(II)-R2 is very similar to Co(II) in buffer. Fig. 4 presents the amount of EPR-active Co(II) in the Co(II)-R2 samples (dotted line) when increasing amounts of Co(II) are added to apoR2. At 100%, all Co(II) added is EPR-active, whereas lower values show the presence of EPR-silent cobalt. With 1 equivalent of Co(II)/R2 dimer, ∼ 90% of the cobalt is EPR-active. Addition of more equivalents of Co(II) decreases the intensity of the signal compared with the same amount of cobalt in buffer. This demonstrates the formation of the dinuclear cobalt site that is magnetically coupled and may therefore be EPR-silent in perpendicular mode. The lowest relative amount of EPR-active Co(II) and a nearly saturated cluster is at ∼ 6 equivalents of Co(II) added per R2 dimer. Adding 8 equivalents of Co(II)/R2 dimer gave an EPR signal with ∼ 60% intensity compared with the same amount of Co(II) in buffer. If R2 is saturated when 8 equivalents of Co(II) is added per R2 dimer this should give an intensity of the observed S = 3/2 Co(II) EPR signal corresponding to ∼ 50% of the signal observed for the same amount of Co(II) in buffer. The result indicates nearly saturated dinuclear sites with ∼ 4 equivalents of EPR-silent dinuclear Co(II)/R2 dimer when 8 equivalents are added. The titration illustrates that the affinity for Co(II) is low, and more than 4 Co(II)/R2 dimer is needed to occupy fully th"

Chem. 1995; 270: 28165-28168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because hydride ion transfer between NAD(H) bound to domain I and NADP(H) bound to domain III is direct, we reasoned that the respective nicotinamide moieties of these nucleotides must come within a few angstroms of each other for such direct hydride ion transfer to take place. If so, we further reasoned that the nucleotide binding regions of domains I and III must have complementary surfaces and attractive forces to allow the close approximation of the nicotinamide rings of their respective nucleotides. If these considerations were correct, then soluble domains I and III in the absence of the membrane-intercalated domain II might come together and catalyze transhydrogenation. This reasoning proved correct. We demonstrated that indeed isolated or recombinant transhydrogenase domains I and III from the same or different organisms did catalyze transhydrogenation when added to a reaction mixture in the absence of domain II (9Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28165-28168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that this transhydrogenation was especially efficient with recombinant R. rubrum domains I and III (10Yamaguchi M.

Sundaresan, M. Yamaguchi, Y. Hatefi, and C. D. Stout, submitted for publication. This paper concerns the proton channel of TH in the membrane-intercalated domain II of E. coli. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies have culminated in the identification of four amino acid residues, one each in domain II α helices 9, 10, and 13 and one in the loop connecting α helices 12 and 13, which appear to be required for coupled proton translocation by TH. On the basis of these and previous results, a mechanism for proton translocation coupled to transhydrogenation has been proposed. NAD, NADH, NADPH, and ATP were obtained fromCalbiochem. AcPyAD, AcPyADP, and 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) were obtained from Sigma. E. coli strain MC4100TH−, whose transhydrogenase gene was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene, was reported previously (18Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16653-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The wild type transhydrogenase gene (pDC21) was digested with SalI/BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragment was inserted into theSalI/BamHI site of pTZ18U. With this plasmid derivative, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the reagents and protocols outlined in the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene mutagenesis kit (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was prepared from individual colonies, and mutants were identified by DNA sequencing. The mutant DNA fragment was excised by appropriate restriction enzymes and replaced with the counterpart of pDC21. The E. coli strain MC4100TH− was transformed with pDC21 or mutant plasmids. Each single colony was inoculated into the LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml). Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C until the late logarithmic phase, collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min (Sorvall GSA rotor), and washed with 0.9% NaC1. The cells (wet weight, ∼ 0.65 g/liter LB medium) were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm MgC12 and sonicated in a Branson Sonifier at output 8 and 25% pulse for 5 min. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman model L ultracentrifuge, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min. Membranes were suspended in 1.3 ml of the same buffer and homogenized. Reverse transhydrogenase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 375 nm in a 37 °C reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm AcPyAD, and E. colimembranes (5–50 μg of protein). Cyclic transhydrogenase activity was measured at 375 nm in a 37 °C reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.0), 0.2 mm NADH, 0.2 mm AcPyAD, 10 μm NADPH, and E. coli membranes (5–50 μg of protein). ATP-dependent forward transhydrogenase activity was measured in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-H2SO4 (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 m KC1, 0.2 mm NADH, and 0.2 mm AcPyADP. This reaction was started by the addition ofE. coli membranes (20–50 μg of protein), and 2–3 min later, 5 μl of 0.2 m ATP were added. The reduction of AcPyADP before and after ATP addition was monitored at 375 nm. An extinction coefficient of 6.1 mm−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the rates. Proton translocation coupled to reverse transhydrogenation catalyzed by E. colimembranes was monitored by measuring the quenching of ACMA fluorescence. The reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 10 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3m KCl, 2 μm ACMA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.4 mm AcPyAD, and E. coli membranes (10–100 μg of protein). ACMA fluorescence was measured at 37 °C by a SLM photon-counting fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 415 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. The reaction was started by the addition of AcPyAD. Proton translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis or NADH oxidation was measured similarly in the above reaction mixture with the exception that NADPH and AcPyAD were not included and the reaction was started by the addition of 200 μm ATP or 50 μm NADH. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Meuller and Rydstro¨m (20Meuller J. Rydstro¨m J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19072-19080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that the membrane-intercalated domain II of the two-subunit E. coliTH monomer is composed of 13 transmembrane α helices, 4 helices at the COOH terminus of the α subunit and 9 helices at the NH2 terminus of the β subunit. The domain II of the single subunit bovine TH monomer is composed of 14 continuous transmembrane α helices (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 265-281Google Scholar). Meuller and Rydstro¨m (20Meuller J. Rydstro¨m J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19072-19080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that the E. coli TH lacks the segment corresponding to the fifth bovine α helix and recommended that for easy interspecies comparison, the transmembrane α helices of E. coli TH be designated as shown in Fig.1 (i.e. the α subunit ending with helix 4 and the β subunit starting with helix 6). For reasons that are detailed under “Discussion” (also for review see Ref. 1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we considered that the proton channel of TH is probably located in the segment of the β subunit between transmembrane α helices 9 and 14. Therefore, a systematic mutational study was undertaken in which the effects of mutations of prototropic residues were investigated, mainly in this segment of domain II of the E. coli TH. The mutant E. coli membranes were assayed for the following activities: reverse transhydrogenation from NADPH to the NAD analogue AcPyAD; cyclic transhydrogenation in the presence of NADPH from NADH to AcPyAD (10Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Fisher R.R. Earl S.R. Everse J. Anderson B. You K.-S. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); proton translocation coupled to reverse transhydrogenation; and proton translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis and/or NADH oxidation. The latter assays were considered important controls, because they checked membrane integrity where TH mutations appeared to have inhibited transhydrogenation-coupled proton translocation. The results obtained have been separated into two tables. Table I shows the results of the mutations of 21 conserved and semiconserved (with the exception of βLys-149) prototropic residues, which appeared to be nonessential. As seen in this table, certain mutations had large effects on one or more of the activities tested. In the absence of information regarding the overall structure of the TH molecule, it is difficult to rationalize the effects of these mutations on the TH activities shown in Table I. However, certain possibilities can be conceived regarding the results of mutations of βGlu-85, which are considered under “Discussion.”Table ICatalytic properties of E. coli TH mutated at 21 prototropic amino acid residues of the β subunit domain IIMutantReverse TH activityCyclic TH activityProton translocationMutantReverse TH activityCyclic TH activityProton translocation%%%%%%T137A≥10070≥100R31A1988R31E>10061>100K145A442150R31L411546K145E465767K145L19232N34T>10092>100K149Q495867K76Q9995≥100K153A171619K77A9411K153Q506067K77L13419K77Q494662R160A451813R160L974068E85A9199E85C438N164T>100>100≥100E85K15414E85L857S219A100>100>100E85Q324E85S22620S223A>100>100>100S92A>10095>100Y224F83>10095E124A286841S225A878857E124K463036S250A>100>100>100T135A735231T135C661316S251A>100>10077T135D713628T135K51001S256A89>10095T135L33779T135S231712Y257F>100>100>100All of the values given here and in Table II were calculated as the percent of the wild type activities, which were as follows: reverse TH activity, 1.66, μmol of AcPyAD reduced by NADPH (min · mg of protein)−1; cyclic TH activity, 8.7 μmol of AcPyAD reduced by NADH (min · mg of protein)−1; proton translocation, the initial rate in arbitrary units of ACMA fluorescence quenching per milligram of wild type membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Here and in Table II where mutations resulted in considerable activity loss, the results were confirmed in independent experiments. The data shown are averages of duplicate or triplicate experiments. Table II shows the results of mutations of four other prototropic residues of the β subunit of TH domain II. As was shown previously by others and confirmed here, βHis-91 (23Olausson T. Fjellstro¨m O. Meuller J. Rydstro¨m J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and βAsn-222 (24Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) appeared to be essential residues. One reason for repeating and extending the mutational studies of others was that they had not stated whether their E. coli membrane preparations containing the TH mutants incapable of transhydrogenation coupled proton translocation were otherwise intact and capable of forming a proton electrochemical potential coupled to ATP hydrolysis and/or respiration. Although not shown in Tables I and II, we carried out this important membrane integrity test in all of the cases where proton translocation rates and extents coupled to reverse transhydrogenation were nil or drastically diminished. The results showed that all theE. coli membrane preparations containing TH mutants with impaired proton translocation activity were capable of rapid proton translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis and NADH oxidation. Another reason was that certain literature reports showed substantial proton translocation activity for mutants that exhibited negligible reverse TH activity (see below).Table IICatalytic properties of E. coli TH mutated at amino acid residues βHis-91, βSer-139, βAsp-213, and βAsn-222MutantReverse TH activityCyclic TH activityProton translocationMutantReverse TH activityCyclic TH activityProton translocation%%%%%%H91A7100S139A6120H91C24110S139C346333H91D25120S139D240H91E1530S139G833141H91G27150S139H120H91I2862S139K240H91K51201S139L460H91L18112S139N330H91M163<1S139T967771H91N8680H91R780N222A18170H91S106<1N222C585911H91T176<1N222D212313H91V1730N222G220H91W330N222H35180H91Y781N222K11150N222L52281D213A13144N222Q15160D213E202818N222R290D213G230N222S310D213K4185N222Y370D213L463D213R5336 Open table in a new tab As seen in Table II, the mutation of βHis-91 appeared to be tolerated to various low extents for reverse and cyclic transhydrogenation but not for proton translocation. Among the βHis-91 mutations, the replacement of this residue with Asn did not alter the reverse TH activity but greatly diminished cyclic and proton translocation activities. Literature data on the activities of βH91N mutation are mixed. The reverse TH activity reported for this mutation ranges from 80 (25–27) to 18% (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) relative to the wild type activity. However, these reports agree that βH91N mutation greatly inhibits proton translocation. It has been reported that βH91K and βH91R mutants exhibit relative to the wild type, respectively, 2 and 1% reverse TH activity, and 30 and 25% proton pumping activity (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As seen in Table II, our βH91K and βH91R mutants were not only impaired for reverse transhydrogenation, they were also incapable of proton translocation. In the TH of certain microorganisms (e.g. Mycobacteria), the residue corresponding to βHis-91 is Asn. In these organisms, the amino acid residues following Asn are also different. In E. coli, the sequence starting at βHis-91 is HSFVGLA, whereas in Mycobacterium leprae andMycobacterium tuberculosis, the sequence is NGVGGGT. Whether the TH in these organisms is incapable of proton translocation or more probably the nearby residue changes make it possible for Asn to perform the same function as βHis-91 of E. coli TH remains to be seen (see also Ref. 29Bizouarn T. Meuller J. Axelsson M. Rydstro¨m J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, it should be mentioned that in these organisms the residues corresponding to the other three essential residues shown in Table II are all conserved. As seen in Tables I andII, cyclic TH activity is generally close to reverse TH activity with the exception of the case of βH91K mutation (Table II) where reverse TH activity is greatly diminished but cyclic activity is very high. This may be related to the finding of Bragg and Hou (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that βH91K mutants contain bound NADP(H), which would favor the cyclic reaction (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Fisher R.R.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Another domain II residue previously shown to affect TH catalytic and proton translocation activities when mutated is βAsn-222 (24Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our extensive mutational data in support of the essential role of βAsn-222 are shown in Table. II. It is seen that in contrast to all of the other βAsn-222 mutations, which completely inhibited proton translocation, βN222C and βN222D exhibited a low level of proton translocation activity (see also Ref. 24Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Glavas N.A. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Bragg P.D. Hou C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation is not inconsistent with our proposed mechanism of proton translocation by TH (see “Discussion”). We had shown earlier that βAsp-213, the only conserved dicarboxylic acid residue in the entire domain II of TH, appears to play a role in proton translocation (18Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16653-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Its mutation to Asn and Ile resulted in parallel losses, respectively, of 70 and 90% reverse transhydrogenation and proton translocation activities. The results of additional mutations of this residue shown in Table II support our previous findings. It is seen that the mutation of βAsp-213 to Glu was partially tolerated, but other mutations greatly inhibited catalytic activity and nearly completely abolished proton translocation activity. Our results regarding the mutation of βAsp-213 to Lys and Arg differ from those of others. Bragg and Hou (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have reported that as compared with wild type, βD213K exhibited 7% reverse and 49% proton translocation activities and βD213R showed 5% reverse and 28% proton translocation activities. Bragg and Hou (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) do not explain how it is possible for the rate of the exergonic reverse transhydrogenation to be so much lower than the rate of the coupled endergonic proton translocation (see also above for data on βH91K and βH91R mutants). We appreciate that the different monitoring methods used (absorbance versus fluorescence) can result in small differences between the estimated rates of hydride ion transfer and proton translocation, especially when the results are calculated as percent of wild type activities. However, in our hands, βH91K and βH91R were incapable of proton translocation (see above and Table II), and βD213K and βD213R exhibited marginal rates of proton translocation commensurate with their very low reverse transhydrogenation activities. The finding that βSer-139 appears to be essential is new and agrees with our previous suggestion regarding the possible role of conserved hydroxylated residues, which are prevalent in the distal helices of domain II (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The situation with βSer-139 is particularly interesting. As seen in Table II, this residue could not tolerate the mutation to Ala, Asp, His, Lys, Leu, or Asn. In all of these cases, proton translocation was completely abolished. However, the replacement of the hydroxymethyl group of βSer-139 with the hydroxyethyl of threonine or the thiomethyl of cysteine was tolerated. These results as well as the permissible βS139G mutation are understandable in terms of our concept regarding the mechanism of proton translocation by TH, which is described under “Discussion.” The reason for concentrating our domain II mutagenesis studies on the segment of this domain downstream of helix 8 was that this region contains a highly conserved sequence of amino acids, especially around βHis-91 in helix 9, around βSer-139 in helix 10, in the extramembranous loop connecting helices 12 and 13, and throughout the remainder of domain II and approximately 15 residues in the extramembranous region beyond helix 14. This high degree of sequence conservation is rare among the hydrophobic domains of other proteins and was therefore suggestive of functional significance. The data reported in Tables I and II show that among 25 conserved and semiconserved prototropic residues of domain II of the E. coli TH, which were mostly located in helices 9–14, four residues, namely, βHis-91, βSer-139, βAsp-213, and βAsn-222, appear to be essential for proton translocation. βAsp-213 is considered to be located outside the membrane in a cytosolic-side loop that connects transmembrane helices 12 and 13, whereas βHis-91, βSer-139, and βAsn-222 are located, respectively, in helices 9, 10, and 13 (Fig. 1). We propose that in the native structure of TH, α helices 9, 10, and 13 come together possibly with the highly conserved helix 14 to form a four-helix bundle in which residues βHis-91, βSer-139, and βAsn-222 participate together with bound water molecules in a hydrogen-bonded network for proton conductance (see also Ref. 29Bizouarn T. Meuller J. Axelsson M. Rydstro¨m J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The participation of bound water in proton conductance has been demonstrated in bacteriorhodopsin (30Lanyi J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 164-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Lanyi J.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 187: 161-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Maeda A. Balashov S.P. Luglenburg J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and appears very likely in cytochrome c oxidase (33Wikstro¨m M. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Zaslavsky D. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 164-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Wikstro¨m M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, βHis-91, βSer-139, and βAsn-222 are shown at approximately the same depth from either side of α helices 9, 10, and 13. However, it should be pointed out that the correct structure of domain II is not known, and it is possible that these essential residues are located in such positions in their respective α helices that together with bound water they span the membrane from the cytosolic to the periplasmic side. Furthermore, it may be noted that dispersed throughout the proposed four-helix bundle are eight conserved glycines in the 33 available TH sequences. In the E. coli TH (see Fig. 1) these conserved glycines are βGly-95 in helix 9, βGly-132 (Ala inEimeria tenella) and βGly-138 in helix 10, βGly-226 and βGly-233 in helix 13, and βGly-245, βGly-249 (Ala in E. tenella), and βGly-252 in helix 14. Together these conserved glycines may be required for the formation of a channel for bound water within the proposed four-helix bundle. A proton channel as proposed here would agree with the mutational data reported in Table II. Thus, the permissible mutations βS139T and βS139C are understandable, because the hydroxyethyl group of threonine and the thiomethyl group of cysteine could easily be considered to perform the same role as the hydroxymethyl of serine in the hydrogen bond network described above. The low proton translocation activities of βN222D and βN222C could also be rationalized in terms of the ability of Asp and Cys to participate via hydrogen bonding in proton conductance. Furthermore, the permissible βS139G mutation is not as surprising as it seems. One can conceive of the vacancy created by the absence of the hydroxymethyl of serine to be filled with a molecule of water and its participation in proton conductance through the hydrogen bond network. As seen in Table I, the mutations of βGlu-85 resulted in variable low activities. It is difficult to consider βGlu-85 as an essential residue, because in the TH of many organisms, βGlu-85 is replaced with Gln and because all of the βGlu-85 mutations shown in Table I were tolerated to variable small extents. However, the location of βGlu-85 is of interest (a) because of its proximity to βHis-91 in the α helical structure of helix 9, and (b) because in the proposed helix bundle, βGlu-85 may come close to βAsp-213 and assist in efficient proton conductance from βAsp-213 into the proton channel (see below). We have checked the possibility that in the E. coli TH βGlu-85 may take part together with βAsp-213 in proton conductance between domains II and III by mutating both residues to Ala. The resulting βE85A/βD213A double mutant showed only 1% reverse TH activity as compared with wild type and was completely incapable of proton translocation. As seen in Equation 1, reverse transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD is coupled to outward proton translocation. Because the difference in the reduction potentials of NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD couples is negligible (ΔE0′ ∼ 5 mV) and all of the substrates and products are located on the same side of the membrane, the driving force for outward proton translocation in the above reaction would have to be the difference in the chemical potentials of substrates and products, which in an enzymatic reaction means the difference in the binding energies of reactants and products. It further means that the enzyme would have to utilize this binding energy for outward proton translocation by undergoing a substrate-promoted conformation change. In forward transhydrogenation, the protonmotive force would then be expected to alter enzyme conformation and substrate/product affinities, resulting in facilitation of the forward reaction (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 265-281Google Scholar). Our early studies provided support for the above expectations. We first obtained evidence in submitochondrial particles that TH utilizes the proton motive force for cyclic conformation change in forward transhydrogenation (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Hatefi Y. Phelps D.C. Galante Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9526-9529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated a proton motive force-promoted substrate affinity increase of ∼9–10 kJ/mol during hydride ion transfer from NADH to the NADP analogue AcPyADP (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics.

Finally, using purified bovine TH, we showed for the first time that the binding of NADPH but not of NADH, NAD, or NADP, made two distant peptide bonds (Lys410–Thr411 at the junction of domains I and II and Arg602–Leu603 in the domain II extramembranous loop connecting α helices 6 and 7) susceptible to trypsin hydrolysis (4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 265-281Google Scholar, 39Yamaguchi M. Wakabayashi S. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4136-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results indicated that NADPH binding at domain III alters the conformation of this domain and its position relative to domains I and II. This finding was subsequently supported by data for the E. coli enzyme (40Tong R.C.W. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the conserved βAsp-213 of E. coliTH, which is probably located in the domain II extramembranous loop connecting α helices 12 and 13, is necessary for efficient proton translocation coupled to reverse transhydrogenation (Table II). This finding provides for a mechanism whereby the NADPH-promoted conformation change of domain III can be linked to the proton channel of the enzyme in domain II (see above). It has been suggested by others that the conserved βAsp-392 at the NADPH binding site may be involved in proton translocation (41Hu X. Zhang J. Fjellstro¨m O. Bizouarn T. Rydstro¨m J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One can certainly conceive of the possibility that the NADPH-promoted conformation change of domain III makes it possible for βAsp-392 to release a proton, which would somehow be conveyed to the domain II proton channel via βAsp-213 (Fig. 2). As mentioned above, the NADPH-promoted conformation change of domain III appears to move this domain away from the top of domain II as suggested by our previous work showing that Arg602–Leu603 bond in the loop between helices 6 and 7 becomes susceptible to trypsin attack (39Yamaguchi M. Wakabayashi S. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4136-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This movement of domain III away from domain II could make the environment of βAsp-213 more hydrophilic and lower its pKa, resulting in proton release into the nearby proton channel. Using the catalytically active cysteine-free mutant ofE. coli TH as the parent enzyme, Althage et al.(42Althage M. Bizouarn T. Rydstro¨m J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9968-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have converted βAsp-213 and βArg-265 separately and together to Cys in this otherwise cysteine-free protein. They have shown that both βD213C and βR265C mutants react with a fluorescent maleimide and that the presence of NADP(H) considerably increases the accessibility of the Cys residues to the maleimide derivative. βArg-265 is located five residues beyond helix 14 at the junction between domains II and III. When the fluorescent maleimide was added to the double mutant βD213C/βR265C, it reacted poorly, suggesting to the authors that the two Cys residues have formed a disulfide bond. The authors infer from these data that in the native TH βAsp-213 and βArg-265, which they consider is not an essential residue, form a salt bridge. If so, this interaction would interfere with our proposed role of βAsp-213 in proton conductance. However, Althage et al. (42Althage M. Bizouarn T. Rydstro¨m J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9968-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) state that their double mutant TH contained no bound nucleotides and have shown as recounted above that the presence of NADP(H) greatly increases the accessibility of βD213C and βR265C to modification by the fluorescent maleimide. Therefore, it seems probable that in the functioning enzyme substrate-promoted conformation changes, which increase the solvent exposure of these residues, would also prevent their coming together to form a salt bridge and allow βAsp-213 to function in proton conductance. Returning to the proposed mechanism, we would expect that in forward transhydrogenation, incoming protons would follow the path described above (i.e. through the hydrogen-bonded channel of domain II to βAsp-213 and domain III), resulting in affinity increase for NADP, which we have earlier shown (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics.

https://openalex.org/W2133071892,"Science is entering an alliance with the economy that will speed the effect of innovation through society. Despite the slowdown of the 'new economy', a cascade paradigm of innovation appears key to increasing the rate of economic growth. Yet for science to continue to thrive and make this contribution to innovation, it must traverse at least three key crossroads. First, while life sciences have built a strong advocacy model to secure growing federal research funding, the physical sciences (including mathematics and engineering) have not and must now do so to thrive. Second, the drop in the numbers of physical scientists and engineers must be reversed if we are to have the talent to maintain a strong trend of scientific advance. Third, although science advances are increasingly interdisciplinary and occurring in the space between the historic science stovepipes, the organization of federal science support is largely unchanged since the beginning of the cold war. While a decentralized model has value, we must also consider new approaches that encourage deeper cooperation across science sectors and agencies."
