https://openalex.org/W3036430987,"The bacteriophage population is vast, dynamic, old, and genetically diverse. The genomics of phages that infect bacterial hosts in the phylum Actinobacteria show them to not only be diverse but also pervasively mosaic, and replete with genes of unknown function. To further explore this broad group of bacteriophages, we describe here the isolation and genomic characterization of 116 phages that infect Microbacterium spp. Most of the phages are lytic, and can be grouped into twelve clusters according to their overall relatedness; seven of the phages are singletons with no close relatives. Genome sizes vary from 17.3 kbp to 97.7 kbp, and their G+C% content ranges from 51.4% to 71.4%, compared to ~67% for their Microbacterium hosts. The phages were isolated on five different Microbacterium species, but typically do not efficiently infect strains beyond the one on which they were isolated. These Microbacterium phages contain many novel features, including very large viral genes (13.5 kbp) and unusual fusions of structural proteins, including a fusion of VIP2 toxin and a MuF-like protein into a single gene. These phages and their genetic components such as integration systems, recombineering tools, and phage-mediated delivery systems, will be useful resources for advancing Microbacterium genetics."
https://openalex.org/W3035808854,"Sepsis is characterized by organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated immune response to infection. Currently, no effective treatment for sepsis exists. Platelets are recognized as mediators of the immune response and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis. We previously demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in sepsis-induced activated platelets was associated with multi-organ injury in the cecal-ligation puncture (CLP) rat model of sepsis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of NLRP3 would inhibit platelet activation and attenuate multi-organ injury in the CLP rat. CLP (n = 10) or Sham (n = 10) surgery were performed in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. A subset of CLP rats were treated with MCC950 (50mg/kg/d), a specific NLRP3 inhibitor (CLP+MCC950, n = 10). At 72 hrs. post-CLP, blood and organs were harvested for analysis of platelet activation, NLRP3 activation, inflammation and end organ damage. Platelet activation increased from 8±0.8% in Sham to 16±1% in CLP, and was reduced to 9±1% in CLP+M rats (p<0.05). NLRP3 activation was also increased in platelets of CLP vs Sham. NLRP3 expression was unchanged in kidney and lung after CLP, but Caspase 1 expression and IL-1β were increased. MCC950 treatment attenuated NLRP3 activation in platelets. Plasma, kidney, and lung levels of NLRP3 inflammasome associated cytokines, IL-1ß and IL-18, were significantly increased in CLP compared to Sham rats. Inhibition of NLRP3 normalized cytokine levels. Glomerular injury, pulmonary edema, and endothelial dysfunction markers were increased in CLP rats vs Sham. MCC950 treatment significantly decreased renal and pulmonary injury and endothelial dysfunction in CLP+M. Our results demonstrate a role for NLRP3 in contributing to platelet activation and multi-organ injury in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3036399812,"A nanofluid is a suspension of very small solid particles in a continuous fluid with significant improvement of heat transfer characteristics in the main liquid. In general, in industrial equipment, the heat transfer rate can be improved with optimization of equipment including the domain structure and using the different types of nanofluids. Still, there is a big challenge to analyze the heat transfer and fluid circulation in the domain. Having nanofluids with experimental observation as using sensors and probes are destructive for the liquid stream and they are costly to observe the details of particles and the original fluid. Over the 20 years, different numerical methods have been implemented in the modeling of the heat and fluid distribution in industrial equipment containing nanofluids. Among all mathematical and numerical methods, Cubic-Interpolated Pseudo-Particle (CIP) model provides a strong potential in the prediction of the fluid structure and heat analysis, when there is a complex structure of thermal walls and high concentration of nanoparticles. However, this method is not frequently used by researchers in nanofluids analysis. In this study, the Cubic-Interpolated Pseudo-Particle model is applied to predict the flow in the square domain. different thermal walls (multi-solid structure) and hot cylindrical wall are specifically used to observe the fluid flow and heat distribution in the domain. Additionally, for a better understanding of the flow in the domain, different numbers of cylinders are used and also different amounts of nanofluid in the continuous fluid are added. The results show that adding more walls in the domain causes the change in the vortex structure. Furthermore, using nanofluid results in better heat transfer rate in the system. The CIP method is also a capable tool to predict the heat and fluid flow in the multi-solid structure domain."
https://openalex.org/W3036168391,"Marine debris is currently a significant source of environmental and economic problems. Floating litter can be employed by marine organisms as a surface to attach to and use as spreading vector. Human activities are promoting the expansion of potentially harmful species into novel ecosystems, endangering autochthonous communities. In this project, more than 1,000 litter items were collected and classified from five beaches eastwards the port of Gijon, in Asturias, Spain. Next generation sequencing was employed to study biofouling communities attached to items of different materials. A dominance of DNA from Florideophyceae, Dinophyceae and Arthropoda was found, and four non-indigenous species (NIS) were identified. Results showed a clear preference of Florideophyceae and Bryozoa to attach on textile surfaces versus plastic ones. Considering that these taxa contain several highly invasive species described to date, these data emphasize the potential of textile marine debris as a vector for dispersal of NIS. Moreover, the closest beaches to the port contained a more similar biota profile than the farther ones, confirming that both plastic and textile marine litter can be vectors for species dispersal from ports."
https://openalex.org/W4241958184,"Sarcopenia has been associated with lower overall survival in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing surgical resection, TACE, TARE, or transplantation. This monocentric study evaluated the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in patients affected by HCC who received bland transarterial embolization (TAE) therapy, by analyzing its impact on survival and treatment-related complications. All consecutive patients who underwent the 1st TAE between March 1st 2011 and July 1st 2019 in our Institution were retrospectively studied. To evaluate sarcopenia, the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated by normalizing the cross-sectional muscle area at the level of L3 on an abdominal CT scan prior to embolization (cm2) by patient height (m2). SMI cut-off values for sarcopenia were considered ≤ 39 cm2/m2 for women and ≤55 cm2/m2 for men. Data about age, gender, body mass index (BMI), underlying liver disease, liver function, MELD score, Child-Pugh score, multifocal disease, performance status, previous interventions, length of stay (LOS), complications after the procedure, readmission rate within 30 days, survival time from TAE and total number and type of TAE received following the first procedure were collected. From 2011 to 2019, 142 consecutive patients underwent 305 TAEs. Observation time ranged from 1.4 to 100.5 months (median 20.1 SD = 22). Sarcopenia at baseline was present in 121 (85%) patients. Overall 87 (61.2%) patients died during follow-up with survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year of 71%, 41%, 22%, 16% and 11% respectively. After multivariate analysis sarcopenia (HR = 2.22, p = 0.046), previous ablation/resection (HR = 0.51, p = 0.005) and multifocal disease (HR = 1.84, p = 0.02) were associated with reduced survival. Sarcopenia did not influence the safety of TAE in terms of LOS (2 days vs 1.5 days, p = 0.2), early complications rate (8% vs 5%, p = 0.5) and readmission rate within 30 days (7% vs 5%, p = 0.74). Sarcopenia, estimated by the L3SMI method, is an emerging prognostic factor in patients with HCC undergoing bland TAE therapy as it is associated with increased mortality, without impairing the safety of the locoregional treatment. Measures to ameliorate the SMI, such as nutritional support and physical exercise, should be evaluated in clinical trials for HCC patients receiving liver embolization to determine their impact on overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W3036992598,"In poultry production, birds are raised under intensive conditions, which can enable rapid spread of infections, with Clostridium perfringens-caused necrotic enteritis (NE) being one of the most devastating for the industry. The current investigation was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Bacillus subtilis PB6 probiotic supplementation on bird’s post NE recovery, based on chicken performance, cecal microbiota composition, ileum histomorphometric measurements, and short-chain fatty acid production in the cecum of the birds that were challenged with NE mid-production. Birds were split into four groups, including a negative control, positive control challenged with C. perfringens, group supplemented with B. subtilis probiotic, and NE challenged birds supplemented with B. subtilis probiotic. Following NE challenge birds were allowed to reach the end of production time at 40 days, and samples were collected to estimate if probiotic supplementation resulted in better post-NE recovery. Intestinal lesion score across the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum indicated that at the end of production timeline NE challenged birds supplemented with B. subtilis probiotic had lower intestinal lesion scores compared to NE challenged birds without probiotic supplementation implying improved recovery. Probiotic supplementation improved performance of NE challenged birds only in the post-NE recovery stage. NE challenged birds had a significant increase in cecal propionic acid, which was not observed in NE challenged birds supplemented with B.subtilus. Both B. subtilis supplemented groups (challenged and unchanged) were characterized by a significant rise in cecal acetic and butyric acid. Our results demonstrate that B. subtilis supplementation can assist the birds in dealing with NE outbreak and long term recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3036876824,"The timed 4-stair climb (4SC) assessment has been used to measure function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) practice and research. We sought to identify prognostic factors for changes in 4SC, assess their consistency across data sources, and the extent to which prognostic scores could be useful in DMD clinical trial design and analysis. Data from patients with DMD in the placebo arm of a phase 3 trial (Tadalafil DMD trial) and two real-world sources (Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Belgium [Leuven] and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center [CCHMC]) were analyzed. One-year changes in 4SC completion time and velocity (stairs/second) were analyzed. Prognostic models included age, height, weight, steroid use, and multiple timed function tests and were developed using multivariable regression, separately in each data source. Simulations were used to quantify impacts on trial sample size requirements. Data on 1-year changes in 4SC were available from the Tadalafil DMD trial (n = 92) Leuven (n = 67), and CCHMC (n = 212). Models incorporating multiple timed function tests, height, and weight significantly improved prognostic accuracy for 1-year change in 4SC (R2: 29%-36% for 4SC velocity, and 29%-34% for 4SC time) compared to models including only age, baseline 4SC and steroid duration (R2:8%-17% for 4SC velocity and 2%-13% for 4SC time). Measures of walking and rising ability contributed important prognostic information for changes in 4SC. In a randomized trial with equal allocation to treatment and placebo, adjustment for such a prognostic score would enable detection (at 80% power) of a treatment effect of 0.25 stairs/second with 100–120 patients, compared to 170–190 patients without prognostic score adjustment. Combining measures of ambulatory function doubled prognostic accuracy for 1-year changes in 4SC completion time and velocity. Randomized clinical trials incorporating a validated prognostic score could reduce sample size requirements by approximately 40%. Knowledge of important prognostic factors can also inform adjusted comparisons to external controls."
https://openalex.org/W2953254539,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with a high degree of heterogeneity in its clinical features, rate of progression, and change of variables over time. In this work, we present a novel data-driven, network-based Trajectory Profile Clustering (TPC) algorithm for 1) identification of PD subtypes and 2) early prediction of disease progression in individual patients. Our subtype identification is based not only on PD variables, but also on their complex patterns of progression, providing a useful tool for the analysis of large heterogenous, longitudinal data. Specifically, we cluster patients based on the similarity of their trajectories through a time series of bipartite networks connecting patients to demographic, clinical, and genetic variables. We apply this approach to demographic and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset and identify 3 patient clusters, consistent with 3 distinct PD subtypes, each with a characteristic variable progression profile. Additionally, TPC predicts an individual patient's subtype and future disease trajectory, based on baseline assessments. Application of our approach resulted in 74% accurate subtype prediction in year 5 in a test/validation cohort. Furthermore, we show that genetic variability can be integrated seamlessly in our TPC approach. In summary, using PD as a model for chronic progressive diseases, we show that TPC leverages high-dimensional longitudinal datasets for subtype identification and early prediction of individual disease subtype. We anticipate this approach will be broadly applicable to multidimensional longitudinal datasets in diverse chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3035893467,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to health-care systems around the world. As approximately one-third of the world´s population is living under “lockdown” conditions, medical resources are being reallocated and hospital admissions are limited to emergencies. We examined the decision-making impact of these actions and their effects on access to hospital treatment in patients with neurosurgical conditions. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzes hospital admissions of two major neurosurgical services in Germany during the nationwide lockdown period (March 16th to April 16th, 2020). Spinal or cranial conditions requiring immediate hospital admission and treatment constituted emergencies. Results A total of 243 in-patients were treated between March 16th and April 16th 2020 (122 patients at the University Medical Center Mainz, 121 patients at the University Medical Center Göttingen). Of these, 38.0±16% qualified as emergency admission. Another 1,688 admissions were reviewed during the same periods in 2018 and 2019, providing a frame of reference. Overall, emergency admissions declined by 44.7±0.7% during lockdown. Admissions for cranial emergencies fell by 48.1±4.44%, spinal emergencies by 30.9±14.6%. Conclusion Above findings indicate that in addition to postponing elective procedures, emergency admissions were dramatically curtailed during the COVID-19 lockdown. As this surely is unexpected and unintended, reasons are undoubtedly complex. As consequences in morbidity and mortality are still unpredictable, efforts should be made to accommodate all patients in need of hospital access going forward."
https://openalex.org/W3036045780,"Snacks, while widely consumed in the United States (U.S.), do not have a standard definition, complicating research to understand associations, if any, with weight status. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between snacking frequency and weight status using various snacking definitions that exist in the scientific literature among U.S. adults (NHANES 2013-2016; ≥20y n = 9,711). Four event-based snacking definitions were operationalized including participant-defined snacks, eating events outside of meals, and operationally defined snacks based on absolute thresholds of energy consumed (>50 kcal). Weight status was examined using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and sagittal abdominal diameter risk. Logistic regression models examined snacking frequency and associations with weight status. Outcomes varied by the definition of a snack employed, but the majority of findings were null. Mean energy from snacks was significantly higher among women with obesity compared to women with normal weight when a snack was defined as any event outside of a typical mealtime (i.e. other than breakfast, lunch, dinner, super, brunch), regardless of whether or not it contributed ≥50 kcal. Further investigation into ingestive behaviors that may influence the relationship between snacking frequency and weight status is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3036472819,"Estimating the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and risk factors among the Roma population, the largest minority in Europe, and investigating the role of genetic or environmental/behavioral risk factors in CVD development are important issues in countries where they are significant minority. This study was designed to estimate the genetic susceptibility of the Hungarian Roma (HR) population to essential hypertension (EH) and compare it to that of the general (HG) population. Twenty EH associated SNPs (in AGT, FMO3, MTHFR-NPPB, NPPA, NPPA-AS1, AGTR1, ADD1, NPR3-C5orf23, NOS3, CACNB2, PLCE1, ATP2B1, GNB3, CYP1A1-ULK3, UMOD and GNAS-EDN3) were genotyped using DNA samples obtained from HR (N = 1176) and HG population (N = 1178) subjects assembled by cross-sectional studies. Allele frequencies and genetic risk scores (unweighted and weighted genetic risk scores (GRS and wGRS, respectively) were calculated for the study groups and compared to examine the joint effects of the SNPs. The susceptibility alleles were more frequent in the HG population, and both GRS and wGRS were found to be higher in the HG population than in the HR population (GRS: 18.98 ± 3.05 vs. 18.25 ± 2.97, p<0.001; wGRS: 1.52 [IQR: 0.99–2.00] vs. 1.4 [IQR: 0.93–1.89], p<0.01). Twenty-seven percent of subjects in the HR population were in the bottom fifth (GRS ≤ 16) of the risk allele count compared with 21% of those in the HG population. Thirteen percent of people in the HR group were in the top fifth (GRS ≥ 22) of the GRS compared with 21% of those in the HG population (p<0.001), i.e., the distribution of GRS was found to be left-shifted in the HR population compared to the HG population. The Roma population seems to be genetically less susceptible to EH than the general one. These results support preventive efforts to lower the risk of developing hypertension by encouraging a healthy lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W3035996140,"Perinatal factors can shape fecal microbiome patterns among pregnant women and their infants. However, there is scarce information about the effect of maternal demographics and perinatal exposures on antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) patterns in pregnant women and infants. We examined fecal samples from pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy (n = 51) and 6-month-old infants (n = 40). Of the 91 participants, 72 represented 36 maternal-infant dyads, 15 were additional pregnant women, and 4 were additional infants. We assessed the effects of demographics, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking and parity in the pregnancy resistome and the effects of demographics, delivery mode, feeding habits and prenatal antibiotic treatment on the infancy resistome. ARG and MGE richness and abundance were assessed using a SmartChip qPCR-array. Alpha diversity (Shannon and Inverse Simpson index) and beta diversity (Sorensen and Bray-Curtis index) were calculated. The Wilcoxon and the Kruskal non-parametric test were used for comparisons. There is a high variability in shared resistome patterns between pregnant women and their infants. An average of 29% of ARG and 24% of MGE were shared within dyads. Infants had significantly greater abundance and higher diversity of ARG and MGE compared to pregnant women. Pregnancy and infancy samples differed in ARG and MGE gene composition and structure. Composition of the fecal resistome was significantly associated with race in pregnant women, with non-white women having different patterns than white women, and, in infants, with extent of solid food consumption. Our data showed that the pregnancy and infancy resistome had different structure and composition patterns, with maternal race and infant solid food consumption as possible contributors to ARG. By characterizing resistome patterns, our results can inform the mechanism of antibiotic resistome development in pregnant women and their infants."
https://openalex.org/W3036214762,"Men who have sex with men and transgender individuals (MSM/TG) carry a disproportionately high burden of HIV, including in South Africa. However, there are few empirical population-representative estimates of viral suppression and the HIV care cascade including HIV testing among this population, nor of factors associated with these outcomes.We conducted a respondent driven sampling (RDS) survey among 301 MSM/TG in Johannesburg in 2017. Participants gave blood samples for HIV testing and viral load. Participants self-completed a survey including sociodemographics, HIV testing history, and engagement in care. We calculated RDS-II weighted estimates of the percentage of HIV-negative MSM/TG reporting HIV testing in the previous 6 months, their testing experience and preferences. Among those HIV-positive, we estimated the percentage status-aware, on ART, and virally suppressed (<50 viral copies/ml plasma). We conducted RDS-weighted robust Poisson regression to obtain weighted prevalence ratios of factors associated with 1) HIV testing among those HIV-negative; and 2) viral suppression among those HIV-positive.There were 118/300 HIV-positive MSM/TG, (37.5%). Of the HIV-negative MSM/TG, 61.5% reported that they had tested for HIV in the previous 6 months, which was associated with selling sex to men (Prevalence Ratio = 1.67, 95% CI 1.36-2.05). There were 76/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG (56.5%) who reported having previously tested positive for HIV and 39/118 (30.0%) who reported current ART. There were 58/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG with viral loads <50 copies/ml plasma (46.9%). Viral suppression was associated with older age (adjusted PR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06 for each year), neighbourhood, and having bought sex from men (adjusted PR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.08).HIV prevalence was very high. Viral suppression among those HIV-positive was similar to the general male population in South Africa, but remains far short of national and international targets. A majority of HIV-negative MSM/TG had HIV tested in the previous 6 months, though there is room for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3036232162,"We investigated the physiological and proteomic changes in the leaves of three Lolium perenne genotypes, one Iranian putative self-pollinating genotype named S10 and two commercial genotypes of Vigor and Speedy, subjected to drought stress conditions. The results of this study indeed showed higher RWC (relative water content), SDW (shoot dry weight), proline, ABA (abscisic acid), nitrogen and amino acid contents, and antioxidant enzymes activities of S10 under drought stress in comparison with the two other genotypes. A total of 915 proteins were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis, and the number of differentially abundant proteins between normal and stress conditions was 467, 456, and 99 in Vigor, Speedy, and S10, respectively. Proteins involved in carbon and energy metabolism, photosynthesis, TCA cycle, redox, and transport categories were up-regulated in the two commercial genotypes. We also found that some protein inductions, including those involved in amino acid and ABA metabolisms, aquaporin, HSPs, photorespiration, and increases in the abundance of antioxidant enzymes, are essential responses of the two commercial genotypes to drought stress. In contrast, we observed only slight changes in the protein profile of the S10 genotype under drought stress. Higher homozygosity due to self-pollination in the genetic background of the S10 genotype may have led to a lower variation in response to drought stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3036726602,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a major public health concern in many parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Americas. Sri Lanka experienced its largest dengue outbreak in 2017. Neurological symptoms associated with DENV infection have increasingly been reported in both children and adults. Here, we characterize DENV type 2 (DENV-2) strains, which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or serum of patients with dengue encephalitis. Acute serum and CSF samples from each patient were subjected to dengue-specific non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test, IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus isolation, conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Among the 5 dengue encephalitis patients examined, 4 recovered and 1 died. DENV-2 strains were isolated from serum and/or CSF samples of 3 patients. The highest viral genome levels were detected in the CSF and serum of the patient who succumbed to the illness. A phylogenetic tree revealed that the DENV-2 isolates belonged to a new clade of cosmopolitan genotype and were genetically close to strains identified in China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. According to the NGS analysis, greater frequencies of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations per gene were identified in the nonstructural genes. The full genomes of serum- and CSF-derived DENV-2 from the same patient shared 99.7% similarity, indicating that the virus spread across the blood-brain barrier. This is the first report to describe neurotropic DENV-2 using whole-genome analysis and to provide the clinical, immunological, and virological characteristics of dengue encephalitis patients during a severe dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka in 2017."
https://openalex.org/W3036401042,"Under the context of global climate change, vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced significant changes during the past three decades. In this study, the spatiotemporal changes of growing season vegetation index (GSVI) on the TP were analyzed using various methods from pixel level to ecoregion level. In addition, a relative importance approach was employed to investigate the regulating effect of temperature and precipitation on vegetation. During the period of 1982-2012, vegetation on the TP was generally experiencing a greening trend, but with pronounced fluctuations. The interannual variation of the long-term GSVI was most significant in the Qaidam Basin and southern forest. At ecoregion scale, vegetation in the arid and frigid arid zones showed a browning tendency, with other ecoregions presenting greener trends. Over a large proportion of the TP, there exist change points in the GSVI time series, which were mainly concentered around the year 1996 and 2000. The Hurst exponent identified that a majority (88%) of the vegetation on the plateau would maintain a persistent trend in the future, which would mainly consist of undetermined development and greening trends. TP vegetation during the 1990s experienced more greening than in the 1980s or 2000s according to the interdecadal analysis. The long-term change in growing season vegetation was most positively correlated with the temperature during the same period, followed by the temperature in the preseason and postseason periods. There were more negative relationships of vegetation change with precipitation than with temperature. The relative contribution of the temperature to the vegetation changes exhibited an opposite spatial pattern to that of precipitation. Overall, the findings in this work provide an essential archive of decade-scale vegetation dynamics that may be helpful for projecting the future ecosystem dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau, such as the consistent greening."
https://openalex.org/W3036591532,"Introduction Acrylamide is widely present in heat-processed food, cigarette smoke and environment. Reproductive toxicity was reported in animals treated with acrylamide, particularly in males. The reproductive toxicity of acrylamide and its active metabolite, glycidamide, was reported to be mainly mediated through DNA damage in spermatocytes. However, the effect of acrylamide on sex hormones in men is unknown. Methods There were 468 male subjects (age ≧ 12 years) enrolled to determine the relationships between hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and hemoglobin adducts of glycidamide (HbGA) with several sex hormones using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003 to 2004. All potential confounding variables in the data set were properly adjusted. Results We found that one unit increase in the natural log-transformed HbAA level was associated with an increase in natural log transformed serum inhibin B level by 0.10 (SE = 0.05; P = 0.046), and natural log transformed serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by 0.15 (SE = 0.15; P = 0.036). With respect to HbGA, one unit increase in the natural log-transformed HbGA level was associated with an increase in natural log transformed serum anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) level by 0.31 (SE = 0.00; P = 0.003). Conclusion In this representative cohort, we identified positive associations between acrylamide exposure and several sex hormones in men. The HbAA is positively associated with inhibin B and SHBG, and HbGA is positively associated with AMH. Other than genotoxicity, our findings suggested that altered sex hormones might also play a role in acrylamide-related reproductive toxicity in males."
https://openalex.org/W3036596217,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a frequent burden and a post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) can be a serious long-term consequence. Iliofemoral DVT should be associated with severe forms of PTS. Therefore an early thrombus removal has been recommended in specific conditions. The aim of this study was to find out both, the long-term results after surgical thrombectomy of iliofemoral DVT in respect of the development of PTS as well as the venous hemodynamics after surgery concerning venous reflux and venous obstruction.Sixty-seven patients who underwent surgical thrombectomy between the years 2000 and 2014 were included in this study; iliofemoral DVT was present in 52 of these patients. 35 patients could be reinvestigated after a mean follow-up of 8.5 years. CEAP (Clinical-Etiological-Anatomical-Pathophysiological) and Villalta scores were recorded in order to describe and assess PTS. Follow-up examinations included a detailed duplex mapping. Venous hemodynamics were measured by digital photoplethysmography and venous occlusion plethysmography.The primary patency rate of the iliofemoral segment was 88% after 8.5 years. 48% of all patients showed reflux in deep vein segments. Mild or moderate PTS occurred in 57% of all patients. Notably, there was no patient with an active ulcer or severe PTS. The mean venous outflow volume of all patients in the treated legs was 66.1 ml/100ml/min and significantly less than in the controlled contralateral non-treated legs (p<0.05). The mean venous refilling time was 16.3 seconds, while the mean value of the non-treated contralateral legs was 25.6 seconds and therefore significantly higher (p<0.05).Even though venous hemodynamics are significantly inferior in the treated legs, this study demonstrates excellent patency rates and good clinical outcome after surgical thrombectomy of iliofemoral veins."
https://openalex.org/W3035838139,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts and are the major stromal component in various types of malignancies. CAFs often undergo metabolic reprogramming to create an appropriate microenvironment for cancer progression. However, it remains unclear whether the metastatic properties of cancer cells affect aerobic glycolysis in stromal cells. Here, we show that gastric cancer (GC) cells with high metastatic potential strongly promote the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of glycolysis-related genes, such as LDHA and ENO2, significantly changed in fibroblasts when they were cocultured with cancer cells with high metastatic potential compared to fibroblasts incubated with cancer cells with low metastatic potential. Glucose uptake, lactate production and oxygen consumption in fibroblasts were changed by coculture with GC cells with high metastatic potential. Thus, metabolic reprogramming in CAFs may reflect the metastatic properties of GC cells."
https://openalex.org/W3036014612,"The transcription factor ZBED6 acts as a repressor of Igf2 and affects directly or indirectly the transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes. Here, we use gene editing in mouse C2C12 myoblasts and show that ZBED6 regulates Igf2 exclusively through its binding site 5′-GGCTCG-3′ in intron 1 of Igf2. Deletion of this motif (Igf2ΔGGCT) or complete ablation of Zbed6 leads to ~20-fold upregulation of the IGF2 protein. Quantitative proteomics revealed an activation of Ras signaling pathway in both Zbed6−/− and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts, and a significant enrichment of mitochondrial membrane proteins among proteins showing altered expression in Zbed6−/− myoblasts. Both Zbed6−/− and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts showed a faster growth rate and developed myotube hypertrophy. These cells exhibited an increased O2 consumption rate, due to IGF2 upregulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed ~30% overlap between differentially expressed genes in Zbed6−/− and Igf2ΔGGCT myotubes, with an enrichment of upregulated genes involved in muscle development. In contrast, ZBED6-overexpression in myoblasts led to cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, reduced mitochondrial activities, and ceased myoblast differentiation. The similarities in growth and differentiation phenotypes observed in Zbed6−/− and Igf2ΔGGCT myoblasts demonstrates that ZBED6 affects mitochondrial activity and myogenesis largely through its regulation of IGF2 expression. This study adds new insights how the ZBED6-Igf2 axis affects muscle metabolism."

This survey aimed to benchmark the current knowledge of the pharmacists concerning food-drug interactions (FDIs) in Jordan.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Amman, the capital and largest city of Jordan, using a validated questionnaire. It was distributed to pharmacists working in community and hospital pharmacies using a convenience sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed in this study.A total of 340 questionnaires distributed, 300 (88%) pharmacists responded. Over 50% of pharmacists claimed that they have sufficient knowledge regarding FDI. Virtually, the overall median (interquartile range) knowledge score was 18 (15-21), approximately 60%. The highest knowledge scores were for alcohol-drug interactions section (66.6%) followed by both common food-drug interactions and the timing of drug intake to food consumption sections with a score of (58.3%) for each, reflecting a suboptimal knowledge of FDIs among the pharmacists.Pharmacists had unsatisfactory knowledge about common FDIs, with no significant difference between hospital and community pharmacists. Therefore, more attention and efforts should be played to improve awareness about potential food-drug interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3036318510,"Background Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) employs the use of a near-infrared (NIR) laser to activate an antibody conjugated to a NIR-activatable dye to induce cancer cell death. PIT has shown to be effective in a number of studies, however, there are no data on its use in colorectal cancer in an orthotopic model. Methods Humanized anti-CEA antibody (M5A) was conjugated to NIR-activatable IRDye700DX (M5A-700). PIT was validated in vitro with a colon cancer cell-line, using a laser intensity of either 4 J/cm2, 8 J/cm2, or 16 J/cm2. Orthotopic colon cancer mouse models were established by surgical implantation of LS174T tumor fragments onto the cecum. M5A-700 was administered and PIT was performed 24 hours later using a 690 nm laser. Repeat PIT was performed after 7 days in one group. Control mice received laser treatment only. Results In vitro PIT demonstrated tumor cell death in a laser intensity dose-dependent fashion. In orthotopic models, control mice demonstrated persistent tumor growth. Mice that underwent PIT one time had tumor growth arrested for one week, after which re-growth occurred. The group that received repeated PIT exposure had persistent inhibition of tumor growth. Conclusion PIT arrests tumor growth in colon cancer orthotopic nude-mouse models. Repeated PIT arrests colon cancer growth for a longer period of time. PIT may be a useful therapy in the future as an adjunct to surgical resection or as primary therapy to suppress tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W3036728356,"Introduction Current methods of intraoperative margin assessment in breast conserving surgery are impractical, unreliable, or time consuming. We hypothesized that intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) imaging with an FDA-approved NIR optical contrast agent could identify canine mammary tumors, a spontaneous large animal model of human breast cancer, during surgery. Methods Dogs with mammary tumors underwent a standard of care lumpectomy or mastectomy with wide surgical margins 20 hours after indocyanine green administration (3 mg/kg IV). During surgery, NIR imaging was performed on tumors and wound margins in situ and tumors and lymph nodes ex vivo. Following resection, the wound bed was examined for residual fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity was determined by signal-to-background ratio (SBR). All tumors, areas of residual fluorescence, and lymph nodes underwent histopathologic analysis. Results There were 41 mammary tumors in 16 female dogs. Twenty tumors were malignant and 21 were benign. Twenty-eight tumors were fluorescent (mean SBR 1.5±0.2). Sensitivity of fluorescence for all malignant tumors was 80% (16/20) and 93.3% (14/15) for malignant tumors > 2 cm. Specificity for malignancy was low (< 2cm = 55%; > 2cm = 30%). Tumors > 2 cm were more likely to be fluorescent (OR 6.05, 95% CI 1.50–24.44, P = 0.011) but not more likely to be malignant (OR 3.09, 95% CI 0.86–11.14, P = 0.085) than tumors ≤ 2 cm. Four out of seven inguinal lymph nodes excised in the mastectomy specimen fluoresced. All four drained malignant tumors; however only 2/4 contained metastatic disease. Conclusion Systemic ICG accumulates reliably in malignant canine mammary tumors > 2 cm. Although no tumor margins fluoresced, a wider margin of normal tissue is removed in canine mastectomy, making direct comparisons with breast conserving surgery difficult. Targeted NIR imaging agents are likely required to improve detection of smaller tumors and improve the specificity of NIR imaging for residual disease and metastatic lymph node detection."
https://openalex.org/W3036925223,"Myocardial energy deprivation plays a causal role in the development of heart failure. A cardiac protection blend (CPB) of nutrients including medium chain triglycerides, fish oil and other key nutrients was developed to slow the progression of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). A six-month dietary intervention demonstrated efficacy of CPB in slowing MMVD progression. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of serum from these dogs identified 102 differential metabolites (adjusted P < 0.05). The ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid (FA) changed from 2.41 and 1.46 in control and CPB groups at baseline to 4.30 and 0.46 at 6 months respectively. A 2.7-fold increase of α-aminobutyrate, a myocardial modulator of glutathione homeostasis, was found in CPB dogs compared to 1.3-fold increase in control dogs. Arginine and citrulline, precursors of nitric oxide biosynthesis, were both increased 2-fold; caprate, a medium chain FA, was increased 3-fold; and deoxycarnitine, precursor of carnitine biosynthesis, was increased 2.5-fold in CPB dogs. Margarate and methylpalmitate decreased in response to CPB, a potential benefit in MMVD dogs as positive correlations were found between changes in both these FAs and left atrial diameter (r = 0.69, r = 0.87 respectively, adjusted P < 0.05). Sphingomyelins with very long chain saturated FAs associated with decreased risk of heart failure in humans were increased in MMVD dogs fed the CPB diet. Our data supports the hypothesis that CPB improves FA utilization and energetics, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in MMVD dogs. More studies are needed to understand the roles of specific metabolites in MMVD."
https://openalex.org/W3036981336,"This study analyzed the longitudinal association of changes in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) practice and television viewing (TV viewing) with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). The data about LTPA, TV viewing, and CMP were obtained in 2012 and after 24 months through individual interviews with schoolteachers from elementary and secondary education public schools in a large city in the southern region of Brazil. The statistical analysis was performed using generalized estimating equation regression models adjusted for sex, age, body mass index and depression. A total of 527 schoolteachers were studied, among which 66.6% were women, and the median age was 42 years (interquartile range: 34 to 49). A total of 170 (32.3%) participants reported CMP at baseline and 130 (24.7%) at follow-up. Both LTPA and TV viewing were independently and significantly associated with CMP regardless of all adjustment variables. Concretely, increasing LTPA by 60 minutes/week was associated with a 6.2% lower likelihood of CMP, and increasing TV viewing by 30 minutes/day was associated with a 5.1% higher likelihood of having CMP among the participants. In summary, this study showed that LTPA and TV viewing have independent and opposite relationships with the longitudinal risk of CMP, which suggests that the potential benefits obtained from practicing more LTPA are insufficient to compensate for the potential detrimental effect of viewing TV for longer with respect to the CMP."
https://openalex.org/W3035921035,"Background There is a growing interest in the life course approach for the prevention, early detection and subsequent management of morbidity in women of reproductive age to ensure optimal health and nutrition when they enter pregnancy. Reliable estimates of such morbidities are lacking. We report the prevalence of health or nutrition-related morbidities, specifically, anemia, undernutrition, overweight and obesity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or reproductive tract infections (RTIs), diabetes or prediabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and depressive symptoms, during the preconception period among women aged 18 to 30 years. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2000 nonpregnant married women aged 18 to 30 years with no or one child who wished to have more children in two low- to middle-income urban neighborhoods in Delhi, India, in the context of a randomized controlled trial. STIs and RTIs were measured by symptoms and signs, blood pressure by a digital device, height by stadiometer and weight by a digital weighing scale. A blood specimen was taken to screen for anemia, diabetes, thyroid disorders and syphilis. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify sociodemographic factors associated with individual morbidity. Results Overall, 58.7% of women were anemic; 16.5%, undernourished; 26%, overweight or obese; 13.2%, hypothyroid; and 10.5% with both symptoms and signs of STIs/RTIs. There was an increased risk of RTI/STI symptoms and signs in undernourished women and an increased risk of diabetes or prediabetes in overweight or obese women. An increased risk of undernutrition was also observed in women from lower categories of wealth quintiles. A decreased risk of moderate to severe anemia was seen in overweight women and those who completed at least secondary education. Conclusions Our findings show a high burden of undernutrition, anemia, RTIs, hypothyroidism and prediabetes among women in the study. This information will aid policymakers in planning special programs for women of reproductive age."

This study compared clinical and imaging characteristics between patients with CADASIL and cysteine-sparing NOTCH3 mutations and those with CADASIL and cysteine-involving NOTCH3 mutations.We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with CADASIL admitted to the Asan Medical Center between September 1999 and September 2017. We compared clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics based on the presence or absence of cysteine-involving NOTCH3 gene mutations. We compared white matter change frequencies and grades in specific spatial regions between the groups according to age-related white matter change (ARWMC) scores. We evaluated the presence, number, and anatomical distributions of cerebral microbleeds according to the microbleed anatomical rating scale.We reviewed data from 79 patients (55 cysteine-involving, 24 cysteine-sparing NOTCH3 mutations). Clinical symptoms and signs did not differ significantly between the groups. The white matter change frequency and ARWMC scores (adjusted for age and stroke risk factors) in the anterior temporal lobes were lower in cysteine-sparing patients than in cysteine-involving patients. Frequencies and grades of the other brain region's white matter changes and cerebral microbleeds were similar between the groups.Patients with CADASIL and cysteine-sparing NOTCH3 mutations showed less involvement of the anterior temporal lobes in brain MRI than those with CADASIL and cysteine-involving NOTCH3 mutations, although both groups showed similar clinical characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3036238706,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor leading to death in most of patients. It comprises almost 50–55% of all gliomas with an incidence rate of 2–3 per 100,000. Despite its rarity, overall mortality of glioblastoma is comparable to the most frequent tumors. The current standard treatment combines surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. In spite of this aggressive multimodality protocol, prognosis of glioblastoma is poor and the median survival remains about 12–14.5 months. In this regard, new therapeutic approaches should be developed to improve the life quality and survival time of the patient after the initial diagnosis. Before switching to clinical trials in humans, all innovative therapeutic methods must be studied first on a relevant animal model in preclinical settings. In this regard, we validated the feasibility of intratumoral delivery of a holmium (Ho) microparticle suspension to an induced U87 glioblastoma model. Among the different radioactive beta emitters, 166Ho emits high-energy β(-) radiation and low-energy γ radiation. β(-) radiation is an effective means for tumor destruction and γ rays are well suited for imaging (SPECT) and consequent dosimetry. In addition, the paramagnetic Ho nucleus is a good asset to perform MRI imaging. In this study, five minipigs, implanted with our glioblastoma model were used to test the injectability of 165Ho (stable) using a bespoke injector and needle. The suspension was produced in the form of Ho microparticles and injected inside the tumor by a technique known as microbrachytherapy using a stereotactic system. At the end of this trial, it was found that the 165Ho suspension can be injected successfully inside the tumor with absence or minimal traces of Ho reflux after the injections. This injection technique and the use of the 165Ho suspension needs to be further assessed with radioactive 166Ho in future studies."

To determine the explanatory power of the Australian football league (AFL) draft combine, participants drafted between 1999–2016 (n = 1488) were assessed. Testing performance, draft selection order and playing position, AFL matches played, AFL player ranking points and AFL player rating points were collected as career outcomes. Boosted regression tree analysis revealed that position and draft selection order were the most explanatory variables of career outcomes. Linear modelling based on testing results is able to explain 4% of matches played and 3% of in-game performance measures. Each individual combine test explained <2% of the matches played outcome. Draft selection order demonstrated mixed results for career outcomes relative to playing position. For instance, key forwards and draft selection order were observed as a slight negative relationship using the AFL Player Ranking points career outcome measure. These findings indicate that the AFL draft combine is a poor measure for informing talent selection, thus providing minimal utility for the practices investigated in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3036137889,"Introduction Autoantibodies (autoAbs) against desmoglein-1 (DSG1) and desmoglein-3 (DSG3) have conventionally been studied and well accepted in the pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus (PF). Recent studies have suggested that non-DSG autoAbs may contribute to the pathogenesis of pemphigus, including autoAbs directed at acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze PV and PF patient sera to better understand the relationship between anti-AChR and -TPO Abs to disease activity and DSG reactivity between patients treated with prednisone and steroid sparing agents (SSA; n = 22) or prednisone and rituximab (n = 21). Methods Patients were evaluated at 2 time points, T1 and T2, for disease activity using the Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI), and sera were tested for the presence of TPO, DSG1, DSG3, muscarinic (M3) and nicotinic (n) AChR IgG autoAbs, as well as antibodies against Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) by ELISA. Results Disease activity significantly decreased in patients from T1 to T2 (p < .0001). A significant difference was seen in IgG anti-DSG1 (p < .0001) and anti-DSG3 (p = .0049) levels when T1 was compared to T2 in both treatment groups. A significant increase was found between pemphigus patients and normal subjects with nAChR (p < .0001) at T1 but not with m3AChR, TPO or VZV Abs. No significant difference was seen between T1 and T2 values in patients with pemphigus for the non–desmoglein Abs TPO (p = .7559), M3AChR (p = .9003), nAChR (p = .5143) or VZV (p = .2454). These findings demonstrate that although an increase in IgG anti-nAChR autoAbs was found in PV and PF subjects, these Abs did not decrease with treatment. No other non-DSG Abs were increased or significantly changed over time in patients with pemphigus. This suggests that anti -AChR and -TPO Abs may not play a direct role in the pathogenesis of most patients with pemphigus, but does not rule out a role for non-DSG auto antibodies in distinct subsets of pemphigus patient."
https://openalex.org/W3036576846,"Eudiplozoon nipponicum (Goto, 1891) is a hematophagous monogenean ectoparasite which inhabits the gills of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Heavy infestation can lead to anemia and in conjunction with secondary bacterial infections cause poor health and eventual death of the host. This study is based on an innovative approach to protein localization which has never been used in parasitology before. Using laser capture microdissection, we dissected particular areas of the parasite body without contaminating the samples by surrounding tissue and in combination with analysis by mass spectrometry obtained tissue-specific proteomes of tegument, intestine, and parenchyma of our model organism, E. nipponicum. We successfully verified the presence of certain functional proteins (e.g. cathepsin L) in tissues where their presence was expected (intestine) and confirmed that there were no traces of these proteins in other tissues (tegument and parenchyma). Additionally, we identified a total of 2,059 proteins, including 72 peptidases and 33 peptidase inhibitors. As expected, the greatest variety was found in the intestine and the lowest variety in the parenchyma. Our results are significant on two levels. Firstly, we demonstrated that one can localize all proteins in one analysis and without using laboratory animals (antibodies for immunolocalization of single proteins). Secondly, this study offers the first complex proteomic data on not only the E. nipponicum but within the whole class of Monogenea, which was from this point of view until recently neglected."
https://openalex.org/W3036905563,"Objectives Accumulating evidence points to a relationship between hearing function and cognitive ability in later life. However, the exact mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear. This study aimed to characterise latent cognitive trajectories in recall memory and identify their association with subsequent risk of hearing impairment. Methods We analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing Wave 1 (2002/03) until Wave 7 (2014/15). The study population consisted of 3,615 adults aged 50+ who participated in the first wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, who had no self-reported hearing impairment in Wave 1, and who underwent a hearing test in Wave 7. Respondents were classified as having hearing impairment if they failed to hear tones quieter than 35 dB HL in the better ear. Results The trajectories of recall memory scores were grouped using latent class growth mixture modelling and were related to the presence of hearing impairment in Wave 7. Models estimating 1-class through 5-class recall memory trajectories were compared and the best-fitting models were 4-class trajectories. The different recall memory trajectories represent different starting points and mean of the memory scores. Compared to respondents with the highest recall memory trajectory, other trajectories were increasingly likely to develop later hearing impairment. Conclusions Long-term changes in cognitive ability predict hearing impairment. Further research is required to identify the mechanisms explaining the association between cognitive trajectories and hearing impairment, as well as to determine whether intervention for maintenance of cognitive function also give benefit on hearing function among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3035808001,"Large-scale genome wide association studies (GWASs) have led to discovery of many genetic risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as APOE, TOMM40 and CLU. Despite the significant progress, it remains a major challenge to functionally validate these genetic findings and translate them into targetable mechanisms. Integration of multiple types of molecular data is increasingly used to address this problem. In this paper, we proposed a modularity-constrained Lasso model to jointly analyze the genotype, gene expression and protein expression data for discovery of functionally connected multi-omic biomarkers in AD. With a prior network capturing the functional relationship between SNPs, genes and proteins, the newly introduced penalty term maximizes the global modularity of the subnetwork involving selected markers and encourages the selection of multi-omic markers with dense functional connectivity, instead of individual markers. We applied this new model to the real data collected in the ROS/MAP cohort where the cognitive performance was used as disease quantitative trait. A functionally connected subnetwork involving 276 multi-omic biomarkers, including SNPs, genes and proteins, were identified to bear predictive power. Within this subnetwork, multiple trans-omic paths from SNPs to genes and then proteins were observed. This suggests that cognitive performance deterioration in AD patients can be potentially a result of genetic variations due to their cascade effect on the downstream transcriptome and proteome level."
https://openalex.org/W3036123326,"Inequity aversion, the resistance to inequitable outcomes, has been demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Inequity aversion was hypothesised to have co-evolved with cooperation but only limited evidence supports this. Dogs provide a suitable model species to test this hypothesis as dogs were previously shown to be inequity averse and dog breeds vary in the extent to which they were selected for cooperativeness. Here, we compared the response of 12 individuals of “cooperative worker” breeds with that of 12 individuals of “independent worker” breeds in the “paw task” previously used to demonstrate inequity aversion in dogs. We also compared the two breed groups’ subsequent social behaviours in a food tolerance test and free interaction session. Although subjects in both breed groups were inequity averse, we found no considerable difference between the groups in the extent of the negative response to inequity or in the impact of the inequity on subsequent social behaviours. However, we found differences between the breed groups in the response to reward omission with cooperative breeds tending to work for longer than independent breeds. Additionally, in the free interaction session, individuals of cooperative breeds spent more time in proximity to their partner in the baseline condition than individuals of independent breeds. Overall, our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that inequity aversion and cooperation co-evolved. However, they illuminate potential differences in selection pressures experienced by cooperative worker and independent worker dog breeds throughout their evolutionary history."

Are some figures, like Santa Claus or an alien, perceived as more real than figures like Princess Elsa or a unicorn? We categorized 13 figures into five a priori categories based on 1) whether children receive direct evidence of the figure's existence, 2) whether children receive indirect evidence of the figure's existence, 3) whether the figure was associated with culture-specific rituals or norms, and 4) whether the figure was explicitly presented as fictional. We anticipated that the categories would be endorsed in the following order: 'Real People' (a person known to the child, The Wiggles), 'Cultural Figures' (Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy), 'Ambiguous Figures' (Dinosaurs, Aliens), 'Mythical Figures' (unicorns, ghosts, dragons), and 'Fictional Figures' (Spongebob Squarepants, Princess Elsa, Peter Pan). In total, we analysed responses from 176 children (aged 2-11 years) and 56 adults for 'how real' they believed 13 individual figures were (95 children were examined online by their parents, and 81 children were examined by trained research assistants). A cluster analysis, based exclusively on children's 'realness' scores, revealed a structure supporting our hypotheses, and multilevel regressions revealed a sensible hierarchy of endorsement with differing developmental trajectories for each category of figures. We advance the argument that cultural rituals are a special form of testimony that influences children's reality/fantasy distinctions, and that rituals and norms for 'Cultural Figures' are a powerful and under-researched factor in generating and sustaining a child's endorsement for a figure's reality status.

https://openalex.org/W3036617229,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is key to activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that drive development of some cancers. One challenge of RTK-targeted therapy is identification of those tumors that express non-mutated but activated RTKs. Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) RTK levels should be more predictive of the latter than expressed total protein. Western blotting (WB) with a pTyr antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection is sufficiently sensitive to detect pTyr-RTKs in human tumor homogenates. Presentation of results by comparing WB images, however, is wanting. Here we describe the preparation of a new pTyr-protein standard, pTyr-ALK48-SB (pA), derived from a commercial anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) recombinant fragment, and its use to quantify pTyr-epidermal growth factor receptor (pTyr-EGFR) in commercial A431 cell lysates. Linearity of one-dimensional (1D) WB plots of pA band density versus load as well as its lower level of detection (0.1 ng, 2 fmole) were determined for standardized conditions. Adding pA to two lots of A431 cell lysates with high and low pTyr-EGFR allowed normalization and quantification of the latter by expressing results as density ratios for both 1D and 2D WB. This approach is semi-quantitative because unknown RTKs may be outside the linear range of detection. Semiquantitative ratios are an improvement over comparisons of images without a reference standard and facilitate comparisons between samples."

However, the use of each of these sources is associated with its limitations potentially impacting the quality of the case ascertainment and prevalence estimation. This study aimed at ascertaining diabetes cases and estimating prevalence among mid- and older-age women through simultaneous use of a longitudinal survey and multiple healthcare administrative data sources.Data were available for 12,432 and 13,714 women born in 1921-26 and 1946-51 from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). Diabetes was ascertained using the ALSWH survey, health service use, and cause of death data. Parsimonious multiple logistic regression analyses tested associations between sociodemographic and health variables and the presence of diabetes.In both cohorts, two or more of the sources captured more than 80% of the women with diabetes. The point prevalence of diabetes increased from 8.4% when the mean age of the women were aged 73, to 22.0% of surviving women at age 90 in the 1921-26 cohort; and from 2.6% at age 48 to 15.8% at age 68 in the 1946-51 cohort. In the 1921-26 cohort, women who were obese (OR: 3.56; 95 CI: 3.04-4.17) and women who were sedentary (OR: 1.18; 95 CI: 1.09-1.40) were more likely to have diabetes compared to those who had a normal weight and engaged in a moderate level of physical activity. In the 1946-51 cohort, the odds of diabetes increased three times (OR: 2.99; 95 CI: 2.54-3.52) for overweight women and nine times (OR: 8.78; 95 CI: 7.46-10.33) for obese women compared to those who had normal weight.The simultaneous use of multiple data sources improved the validity of diabetes case ascertainment. Application of this methodology in future studies may have important benefits including estimation of disease burden, health service needs, and resource allocation with improved precision. Diabetes prevalence increased with age, was much higher in the 1946-51 cohort than in 1921-26 at similar ages, and was significantly associated with physical inactivity and obesity. Interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy weight are needed to prevent the rising prevalence of diabetes across successive generations."

To identify and characterize of AS events in Auxenochlorella protothecoides microalga grown in autotrophic and heterotrophic, RNA-Seq data were analysed. We found that AS increased with the transition from autotrophic to heterotrophic condition. 705 and 660 differentially expressed (DEG) and spliced (DAS) genes were identified for A.protothecoides was transferred from autotrophic to heterotrophic condition, respectively. Moreover, there was slight coverage between DEG and DAS genes. Furthermore, functional analysis showed that the DAS genes are most frequently related to ion binding and stimulus response. The results also indicated that prevalence of Intron retention is associated with down-regulation of the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. This study provides valuable insights into transcriptional and posttranscriptional plasticity of microalgae during growth mode change."
https://openalex.org/W3036010718,"Super-resolution (SR) technology provides a far promising computational imaging approach in obtaining a high-resolution (HR) image (or image sequences) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images by incorporating complementary information. In this paper, a three-stage SR method is proposed to generate a HR image from infrared (IR) LR Images acquired with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed method integrates a high-level image capturing process and a low-level SR process. In this integrated process, we incorporate UAV path optimization, sub-pixel image registration, and sparseness constraint into a computational imaging framework of a region of interest (ROI). To refine ROI complementary feathers, we design an optimal flight control scheme to acquire adequate image sequences from multi-angles. In particular, a phase correlation approach achieving reliable sub-pixel image feature matching is adapted, on the basis of which an effective sparseness regularization model is built to enhance the fine structures of the IR image. Unlike most traditional multiple-frame SR algorithms that mainly focus on signal processing and achieve good performances when using standard test datasets, the performed experiments with real-life IR sequences indicate the three-stage SR method can also deal with practical LR IR image sequences collected by UAVs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating HR images with good performance in terms of edge preservation and detail enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W3036155140,"Civil aviation is a distinctive career. Pilots need to monitor the entire system in real time. However, the psychophysiological mechanism of flying is largely unknown. The human brain is a large-scale interconnected organization, and many stable intrinsic large-scale brain networks have been identified. Among them are three core neurocognitive networks: default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). These three networks play a critical role in human cognition. This study aims to examine the dynamic properties of the three large-scale brain networks in civil aviation pilots. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from pilots. Independent component analysis, which is a data-driven approach, was combined with sliding window dynamic functional connectivity analysis to detect the dynamic properties of large-scale brain networks. Our results revealed that pilots exhibit an increased interaction of the CEN with the DMN and the SN along with a decreased interaction within the CEN. In addition, the temporal properties of functional dynamics (number of transitions) increased in pilots compared to healthy controls. In general, pilots exhibited increased between-network functional connectivity, decreased within-network functional connectivity, and a higher number of transitions. These findings suggest that pilots might have better functional dynamics and cognitive flexibility."

The results show that the study can realize real-time and effective monitoring in the operation state of the elevator, and can determine the fault type of the elevator by binding the abnormal operation state with the corresponding fault. The feasibility of the elevator safety monitoring efficiency is evaluated based on three indexes: mutual information, accuracy, and false positives. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed FSM algorithm has the largest mutual information (0.1337), the highest accuracy (0.9899), the lowest false positive rate (0.0624), and the lowest false negative rate (0.1126); compared with other models, the elevator fault warning model proposed in this study has the lowest root mean-square error (RMSE) value (0.0201), the highest accuracy (0.9834), the lowest Loss value (0.0012), and the shortest convergence time (88.2608s), indicating that the elevator safety monitoring system and elevator fault warning model are feasible. This study establishes a good direction for elevator safety monitoring efficiency in China."
https://openalex.org/W3036606072,"Renal dysplasia, the major cause of childhood renal failure, is characterized by defective branching morphogenesis and nephrogenesis. Beta-catenin, a transcription factor and cell adhesion molecule, is markedly increased in the nucleus of kidney cells in human renal dysplasia and contributes to its pathogenesis by altering target genes that are essential for kidney development. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, reduces nuclear beta-catenin levels and reduces beta-catenin transcriptional activity. In this study, we utilized wild type and dysplastic mouse kidney organ explants to determine if quercetin reduces beta-catenin activity during kidney development and whether it improves the severity of renal dysplasia. In wild type kidney explants, quercetin treatment resulted in abnormal branching morphogenesis and nephrogenesis in a dose dependent manner. In wild type embryonic kidneys, quercetin reduced nuclear beta-catenin expression and decreased expression of beta-catenin target genes Pax2, Six2, and Gdnf, which are essential for kidney development. Our RDB mouse model of renal dysplasia recapitulates the overexpression of beta-catenin and histopathological changes observed in human renal dysplasia. RDB kidneys treated with quercetin resulted in improvements in the overall histopathology, tissue organization, ureteric branching morphogenesis, and nephrogenesis. Quercetin treatment also resulted in reduced nuclear beta-catenin and reduced Pax2 expression. These improvements were associated with the proper organization of vimentin, NCAM, and E-cadherin, and a 45% increase in the number of developing and maturing nephrons. Further, our results show that in human renal dysplasia, beta-catenin, vimentin, and e-cadherin also have abnormal expression patterns. Taken together, these data demonstrate that quercetin treatment reduces nuclear beta-catenin and this is associated with improved epithelial organization of developing nephrons, resulting in increased developing nephrons and a partial rescue of renal dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3035776227,"Social mobility is high on the policy agenda and is an important component of reducing inequalities. Estimating the relationship across generations of multiple dimensions of mobility such as health and wages can be used to understand the current state of mobility. However, there has been little research on how policy impacts on the relationship of multiple outcomes across generations and how that may be contributing to health inequalities and long-term mobility. In this paper, we use the UK as a case study to evaluate the impact of three distinct policy periods: 1991-1998 (Increasing neo-liberalism); 1998-2009 (English Health Inequalities Strategy); 2010-2017 (Austerity) on the relationship across generations in health (self-assessed health (SAH) and mental health measured by General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12)) and hourly wages. We employ fixed effects models on data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) and its successor the Understanding Society Survey (2009-2017). To investigate the role of policy on inequalities, sub-group analysis is performed by parental socioeconomic status measured by parental educational attainment, parental occupation, and if a single parent household. Results show that for the population on average, a changing policy focus has no impact on the strength of the relationship across generations in both health and wages. However, when looking at sub-groups the strength of the relationship in SAH and wages is increasing for parents with basic and higher qualifications and their young adult children. Whereas the influence of parents on their young adult children's SAH, mental health, and wages has remained fairly constant over the period 1991-2017 for parents with manual occupations and professional occupations. There has been a slight weakening in the influence of parents on their young adult children's SAH and wages for single parent families from 2010."
https://openalex.org/W3036077740,"The World Health Organization's framework for TB/HIV collaborative activities recommends provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) of patients with presumptive TB. In Myanmar, PITC among presumptive TB patients was started at the TB outpatient department (TB OPD) in Mandalay in 2014. In this study, we assessed the uptake of PITC among presumptive TB patients and the number needed to screen to find one additional HIV positive case, stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics.This was a cross-sectional study using routinely collected data of presumptive TB patients who registered for PITC services at the TB OPD between August 2014 and December 2017 in Mandalay.Among 21,989 presumptive TB patients registered, 9,796 (44.5%) had known HIV status at registration and 2,763 (28.2%) were people already living with HIV (PLHIV). Of the remainder, 85.3% (10,401/12,193) were newly tested for HIV. Patients <55 years old, those registered in 2014, 2015 and 2017, those employed and those having a history of TB contact had higher uptakes of HIV testing. Among 10,401 patients tested for HIV, 213 (2.1%) patients were newly diagnosed with HIV and this included 147 (69.0%) who were not diagnosed as having TB. The overall prevalence of HIV (previously known and newly diagnosed) among presumptive TB patients was 14.8% (2,976/20,119). The number needed to screen to find one additional HIV case was 48: this number was lower (i.e., a higher yield) among patients aged 35-44 years and among those who were divorced or separated.Uptake of HIV testing among eligible presumptive TB patients was high with four out of five presumptive TB patients being tested for HIV. This strategy detected many additional HIV-positive persons, and this included those who were not diagnosed with TB. We strongly recommend that this strategy be implemented nationwide in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W3036291301,"The effects of hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as morbidity and mortality associated with cirrhosis and liver cancer, is a major public health issue in Australia. Highly effective treatment has recently been made available to all Australians living with HCV. A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the hepatology partnership, compared to usual care. A Markov model was chosen, as it is state-based and able to include recursive events, which accurately reflects the natural history of the chronic and repetitive nature of HCV. Cost-effectiveness of the new model of care is indicated by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), where the mean change to costs associated with the new model of care is divided by the mean change in quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). Ten thousand iterations of the model were run, with the majority (73%) of ICERs representing cost-savings. In comparison to usual care, the intervention improves health outcomes (22.38 QALYs gained) and reduces costs by $42,122 per patient. When compared to usual care, a partnership approach to management of HCV is cost-effective and good value for money, even when key model parameters are changed in scenario analyses. Reduction in costs is driven by improved efficiency of the new model of care, where more patients are treated in a timely manner, away from the expensive tertiary setting. From an economic perspective, a reduction in hospital-based care is a positive outcome and represents a good investment for decision-makers who wish to maximise health gain per dollar spent."
https://openalex.org/W3036406783,"The purpose of this study was to develop the Glasgow Antipsychotic Side effects Scale for Clozapine Japanese version (GASS-C-J) and examine its reliability to assess clozapine-related side effects. We developed the GASS-C-J using forward and backward translation. Semantic equivalence of the GASS-C-J to the GASS-C was confirmed by the original author. We then administered the GASS-C-J twice to 109 patients on clozapine treatment at two psychiatric hospitals in Japan. We assessed the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the GASS-C-J using Cronbach's alpha and weighted kappa coefficient, respectively. We also examined if discrepancies in each GASS-C-J item score between the first and second rating were correlated with items of the Brief Evaluation of Psychosis Symptom Domains (BE-PSD). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the GASS-C-J at the first and second rating was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.84) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.88), respectively. The weighted kappa coefficient of individual and total GASS-C-J item scores ranged from 0.45 to 0.88. Some symptom domains were correlated with discrepancies in specific items of the GASS-C-J: psychotic symptoms and nausea/vomiting (rs = 0.27), thirst (rs = 0.31), and appetite/weight gain (rs = 0.27); disorganized thinking and urinary incontinence (rs = 0.26); depression/anxiety and myoclonus (rs = 0.25), hypersalivation (rs = -0.27), and blurred vision (rs = -0.22). These findings demonstrate that the GASS-C-J can be used in clinical and research settings as a reliable scale to assess clozapine-related side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3036984172,"To investigate auricular reconstruction by tissue engineering means, this study compared cartilage regenerated from human chondrocytes obtained from either microtia or normal (conchal) tissues discarded from otoplasties. Isolated cells were expanded in vitro, seeded onto nanopolyglycolic acid (nanoPGA) sheets with or without addition of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), and implanted in nude mice for 10 weeks. On specimen harvest, cartilage development was assessed by gross morphology, histology, and RT-qPCR and microarray analyses. Neocartilages from normal and microtia surgical tissues were found equivalent in their dimensions, qualitative degree of proteoglycan and elastic fiber staining, and quantitative gene expression levels of types II and III collagen, elastin, and SOX5. Microarray analysis, applied for the first time for normal and microtia neocartilage comparison, yielded no genes that were statistically significantly different in expression between these two sample groups. These results support use of microtia tissue as a cell source for normal auricular reconstruction. Comparison of normal and microtia cells, each seeded on nanoPGA and supplemented with BMP7 in a slow-release hydrogel, showed statistically significant differences in certain genes identified by microarray analysis. Such differences were also noted in several analyses comparing counterpart seeded cells without BMP7. Summary data suggest a possible application for BMP7 in microtia cartilage regeneration and encourage further studies to elucidate whether such genotypic differences translate to phenotypic characteristics of the human microtic ear. The present work advances understanding relevant to the potential clinical use of microtia surgical remnants as a suitable cell source for tissue engineering of the pinna."
https://openalex.org/W3035819010,"Introduction The presence of poor quality antibiotics on the market has contributed to the antibiotics resistance and global threat to public health. Antibiotic resistance is now a global concern. One area to address this issue is by evaluating the quality of antibiotics accessible to the public. The purpose of this study was to test and compare (with corresponding pharmacopeia) the quality of common oral antibiotics available in the country of Belize with a view to providing base-line data on the testing of medications imported to the country for public consumption. The study focused only on level 2 field-based screening quality assurance on three Key Access Antibiotics from the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines. Methods Five brands of antibiotic tablets/capsules with denoted pharmacopeia imported into the country of Belize were tested for quality at The University of Belize pharmacy laboratory. A sample of 30 tablets/capsules each of the selected antibiotic brand were used for study. Visual inspection and weight variation were done for each sample while Monsanto type tablet hardness tester, Roche@Tablet Friability Test Apparatus (single drum), and Ajanta@ Tablet Disintegration Test Apparatus (double basket) were conducted on selected antibiotics. Results were recorded and compared with corresponding pharmacopoeia references. Results Most of the samples collected passed performed tests. Only a few samples from both BP and USP antibiotics failed in visual inspection and weight variation tests. All antibiotics tested conformed to their corresponding pharmacopeia reference in terms of friability and disintegration time. Conclusion Most of the selected antibiotics passed performed tests when compared with their pharmacopeia. Only a few samples from both BP and USP antibiotics failed the tests conducted. There is need for regular quality assurance tests on all medications imported to Belize especially antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3036112493,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are frequently altered in a variety of human cancer cells and are overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several literatures have proven that they are efficacious for HCC therapy, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found FGFR4 was overexpressed in HCC cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B and we used PD173074, an FGFR4 inhibitor, to explore the role of FGFR4 and its underlying mechanism in these cell lines. The results showed that PD173074 significantly arrested HepG2 and Hep3B cells in G1 phase and inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that PD173074 decreased the levels of P-FRS2α, P-ERK, CDK2, cyclin E and NF-κB (p65) in the nucleus while it increased the levels of ubiquitin and CUL3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase which involves in cyclin E degradation. Meanwhile, the data from RT-qPCR showed that PD173074 also decreased miR-141 level. In conclusion, these results suggest that FGFR4 is involved in HCC by ERK/CUL3/cyclin E signaling pathway, and the finding may provide a potential theoretical basis for treatment by targeting FGFR4 in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3036318869,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the principal causative agents of bacteremia which can progress to sepsis. Rapid diagnostic tests for identification and antibiotic resistance profiling of S. aureus would improve patient outcomes and antibiotic stewardship, but existing methods require a lengthy culture step to obtain enough material for testing. Complexity of the host matrix, where pathogenic microbes are often present, also interferes with many diagnostic methods. Here, we describe a straightforward and rapid method for enriching viable S. aureus using bio-orthogonal, or “click,” chemistry methods. Bacteria labeled in this manner can potentially be cultured, interrogated using molecular methods for pathogen identification, or used to test antibiotic susceptibility."
