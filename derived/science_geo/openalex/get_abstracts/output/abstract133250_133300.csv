https://openalex.org/W1998585620,"MyD88 has a modular organization, an N-terminal death domain (DD) related to the cytoplasmic signaling domains found in many members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily, and a C-terminal Toll domain similar to that found in the expanding family of Toll/interleukin-1-like receptors (IL-1R). This dual domain structure, together with the following observations, supports a role for MyD88 as an adapter in IL-1 signal transduction; MyD88 forms homodimers in vivo through DD-DD and Toll-Toll interactions. Overexpression of MyD88 induces activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the transcription factor NF-κB through its DD. A point mutation in MyD88, MyD88-lpr (F56N), which prevents dimerization of the DD, also blocks induction of these activities. MyD88-induced NF-κB activation is inhibited by the dominant negative versions of TRAF6 and IRAK, which also inhibit IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Overexpression of MyD88-lpr or MyD88-Toll (expressing only the Toll domain) acted to inhibit IL-1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation in a 293 cell line overexpressing the IL-1RI. MyD88 coimmunoprecipitates with the IL-1R signaling complex in an IL-1-dependent manner.

Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis, however, suggests that it may have signaling capabilities; MyD88 is predicted to have a modular organization consisting of an N-terminal death domain (DD) 1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; IL-1R, interleukin 1 receptor; AcP, accessory protein; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; NF, nuclear factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophroresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; Luc, luciferase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; db, DNA binding. separated by a short linker from a C-terminal Toll domain (2Feinstein E.

The N-terminal DD is related to a motif of approximately 90 amino acids that was initially defined as the region of similarity between the cytoplasmic tails of the FAS/Apo1/CD95 and TNF receptors required for their induction of cytotoxic signaling (8Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The DD, which has in recent years been found in many additional proteins, is now known to mediate protein-protein interactions with other DD sequences forming either homo- or heterodimers (10Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This property is utilized by many members of the TNF superfamily (i.e. FAS, TNF-R1, DR3/Apo3/WSL-1/TRAMP, and TRAIL-Rs 1 and 2), in response to ligand activation, to establish interactions that form the foundation for building signaling complexes that can induce responses such as cytotoxicity, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinases, and/or activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). MyD88's C-terminal Toll domain is comprised of approximately 130 amino acids (5Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This domain was originally described based on the homology between the cytoplasmic signaling regions of the Drosophila melanogaster transmembrane protein Toll and the IL-1RI, but is now found in an expanding family of proteins, most of which are cell surface receptors (5Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol.

MyD88 is the only reported mammalian protein with a Toll domain that is not predicted to be a transmembrane. The Toll domain lacks an intrinsic signaling capacity and thereby transduces signals by recruiting associated proteins. It is not known whether Toll domains function in an analogous manner to DDs by mediating Toll-Toll interactions. However, the discovery that the Toll-containing IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) acts as a co-receptor for IL-1RI and is an indispensable molecule in the IL-1RI signal transduction complex suggests that interactions between like domains may have a role in the formation of signaling complexes (15Greenfeder S.A.

A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In recent years some of the proteins involved in the proximal signaling events associated with IL-1RI-induced activation of NF-κB have been identified. This has revealed the striking similarity between the IL-1RI and Drosophila Toll signaling pathways. Toll induces Dorsal activation (a homolog of NF-κB) which like NF-κB is normally held in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by the IκB-like inhibitory protein, Cactus. Following stimulation, these inhibitory proteins become phosphorylated, ubiquinated, and degraded via proteasome-mediated pathways, which frees NF-κB/Dorsal to translocate into the nucleus and begin transcription. The DrosophilaSer/Thr kinase Pelle is believed to be involved in the phosphorylation of Cactus (18Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the IL-1 pathway, a Ser/Thr kinase that is rapidly recruited to the IL-1RI complex, within seconds of IL-1 binding, has recently been identified (19Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). This kinase, the IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK), is highly homologous to Pelle but not to other mammalian Ser/Thr kinases. Interestingly, both Pelle and IRAK have N-terminal DDs (19Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In the Toll pathway a second protein exists with a DD, Tube, which regulates the activity of Pelle through DD-DD interactions (20Galindo R.L. Edwards D.N. Gillespie S.K. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1995; 121: 2209-2218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Grosshans J. Bergmann A. Haffter P. Nusslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1994; 372: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Letsou A. Alexander S. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional DD-containing adapter molecules may, therefore, also exist in the IL-1 pathway. With its dual domain organization MyD88 has ideal properties to function as an adapter linking Toll and death modules. Here, we examine this intriguing possibility by analyzing the functional role(s) of the MyD88 domains. The 293T human embryonic kidney cell line or 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml of each) and grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Isolation of total RNA from various mouse tissues was carried out as described elsewhere (23Sappino A.P. Huarte J. Vassali J.D. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24French L.E. Chonn A. Ducrest D. Baumann B. Belin D. Wohlwend A. Kiss J.Z. Sappino A.P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A MyD88 antisense RNA probe was synthesized by in vitrotranscription in the presence of 12.5 μmα-[32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham International, Amersham, UK). Following extensive washing of the Northern blot, the membrane was exposed to x-ray films (XAR; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 4 days. Mouse MyD88 was first identified as a transcript encoding a protein of 243 residues (1Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar). However, since then several lines of evidence suggest that the transcript for MyD88 is 53 amino acids longer (predicted molecular mass of ∼33 kDa) and starts at Met minus 53 (4Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2467-2475PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harroch S. Gothelf Y. Revel M. Chebath J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length mMyD88 cDNA, total RNA isolated from murine bone marrow was reverse transcribed using a cDNA cycle kit from Promega, amplified by PCR (JT478 5′-gtt ctc cat acc ctt ggt-3′ and JT318 5′-cgc atc agt ctc atc ttc-3′) and subcloned into PCRII TA-cloning vector (InvitroGen). A modified pCRIII (InvitroGen) mammalian expression vector was constructed by cloning a Kozak consensus sequence (GCCACC) and the Flag epitope (MDYKDDDK) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of PCR-III to yield pMet-Flag-V63. MyD88 was subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into pMet-Flag-V63 to give pFlag-MyD88 or into pMet-Myc (27Bodmer J.L. Burns K. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Thome M. Bornand T. Hahne M. Schroter M.

MyD88-F56N (referred to as MyD88-lpr) and MyD88 lacking the DD (MyD88-ΔDD) were generated by PCR using the following primers: MyD88-lpr, JT317 5′-gga gat ggg caa cga gta ct-3′ and JT318; MyD88-ΔDD, JT386 5′-cga gga gga ctg cca gaa-3′ and JT318 and then cloned as EcoRI fragments into pMet-Flag-V63. MyD88 encoding the Toll domain (amino acids 161–296) and deletions within this region, Toll-N (amino acids 161–296), Toll-C (amino acids 230–296), and Toll-Δ282–296 (amino acids 161–281) were amplified by PCR with the following primers: Toll, JT749 5′-ttc gat gcc ttt atc tgc-3′ and JT318; Toll-N, JT749 and JT752 5′-cta gct ctg tag ata atc-3′; Toll-C, JT751 5′-agc aag gaa tgt gac ttc-3′ and JT318 and Toll-Δ282–296, with primers JT749 and JT750 5′-cta ggt gca agg gtt ggt-3′. MyD88-N was made by removing the EcoRV fragment from pFlag-MyD88. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast expression vectors were prepared by cloning DNA for MyD88 and the deletion mutants (indicated above) as EcoRI fragment into the LexA DNA-binding domain vector, pBTM116 (28Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector, pGBT9 (CLONTECH), and into the GAL4 activation domain vector, pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The following plasmids were obtained from the indicated sources: NF-κB luc (Victor Jongeneel, Lausanne, CH); Myc-IL-1RI, IRAK and IL-1RAcP (Keith Ray and Filippo Volpe, Glaxo Welcome, UK); Flag-JNK (Christian Widman, Denver, CO); TRAF6 (287–522) and TRAF2 (87–501) (Harold Wajant, Stuttgard, Germany). IRAK encoding the DD (amino acids 1–217) was amplified by PCR with the following primers: JT651 5′-gaa ttc atg gcc ggg ggg ccg-3′ and JT902 5′-tca ctt gag ctc ctc cga gaa gtt-3′. Protein/protein interactions were analyzed by cotransforming plasmids encoding the LexA-DNA binding (LexA-db) fusion proteins or GAL4-DNA binding (GAL4-db) fusion proteins with plasmids encoding the various GAL4-activation domain (GAL4-ab) fusion proteins (2.5 μg of each plasmid) into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CTY10–5d (used with LexA-db constructs) or Y190 (used with GAL4-db constructs) following the Two-Hybrid System protocol (CLONTECH). Filter lift assays for colony color development were done as described previously (29Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). MyD88 was cloned as an EcoRI fragment into pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl-thiogalactoside and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described elsewhere (30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled MyD88 and mutant versions were generated with the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following translation35S-labeled reticulocyte lysates (2 μl) were incubated with 20 μl of GST-MyD88 (∼3 μg) bound to the GST beads in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (31Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). After incubation the GST beads were pelleted for 2 min at low speed and then washed six times with binding buffer. The washed beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels which were enhanced by incubation in En3HanceTM (Du Pont) prior to fluorography at −80 °C. Monoclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitations and Western blotting include anti-Flag M2 antibody (Kodak Biosciences) used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, antibody against the Myc epitope (9E10, Sigma) used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, anti-VSV antibody (Sigma) used at a dilution of 1:20,000, anti-JNK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used at a dilution of 1:1000, and antibodies against the active phosphorylated form of JNK, Anti-ACTIVETM (Promega) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Antiserum against MyD88 (AL126) was generated using a peptide spanning amino acids 54–77 (MGFEYLEIRELETRPDPTRSLLDA), which was synthesized using the multiple antigen technology (31Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). The antiserum was affinity-purified on the MyD88 peptide coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and used at a dilution of 1:500. For Western analysis protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Life Science). Blots were incubated with the antibodies in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% skim milk) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Inc.) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. Bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham International) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 293T cells (1 × 107) were transiently transfected with Flag-MyD88 (12 μg). 24 h after transfection the cells were harvested and lysed in PBS (300 μl) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture by mild sonication (four times for 5 s each). The soluble cellular extract (150 μl) was mixed with the internal standards catalase and ovalbumin, then loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column, and the proteins were eluted in PBS at 0.5 ml/min. Every second fraction (250 μl) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody. The column was calibrated with the following standard proteins: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Tissue extracts were prepared from BalbC mice by homogenization in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). The extracts were spun at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for Western blotting analysis. Cellular extracts were obtained from 293T cells harvested 26 h after transfection and lysed as described previously (27Bodmer J.L. Burns K. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Thome M. Bornand T. Hahne M. Schroter M. Becker K. Wilson A. French L.E. Browning J.L. MacDonald H.R. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation of MyD88 and its deletion mutants, transfected 293T cells (1 × 106), were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA). The lysates were incubated with 3 μg of anti-Flag agarose at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the precipitated proteins were then fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. To detect MyD88 associated with the IL-1RI complex, 3 × 106 transfected 293T cells were first treated with IL-1β (200 ng/ml) for 3 min, the complex was then precipitated by the addition of 3 μg of anti-Flag M2 antibody to the cellular lysates (500 μl) for 3 h and then 10 μl of protein G-agarose for an additional hour, and MyD88 was detected by Western analysis. Cells were treated with IL-1β and lyzed as described elsewhere (19Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Protein content of tissue and cell extracts was determined using the BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (32Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular extracts were prepared from transfected 293 cells (2 × 106) using a high salt detergent buffer (Totex) (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmDTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in ice-cold PBS (Sigma), and resuspended in four cell volumes of Totex buffer. After 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 μl of buffer D+ (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerin, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 4 μl of buffer F (20% Ficoll 400, 100 mm Hepes, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 100,000 cpm (Cerenkov) of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 μl. For the supershift assays, 1.0 μl of antibody was added to the reaction simultaneously with the probe and incubated as described. Anti-p65 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega) was labeled using γ-[32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). For the NF-κB reporter assays, 2 × 105 293T or 293 Myc-IL-1RI cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. A stable cell line expressing the Myc-tagged IL-1RI cells was obtained by transfection of 293 with a Myc-IL-1RI expression plasmid and selection with G418 (600 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Drug-resistant clones were tested for expression of Myc-IL-1RI by Western analysis with Myc antibody. The cells were harvested 24–42 h after transfection and lysed with 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 14 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT). Where indicated IL-1β (Boehringer Mannheim) (10 ng/ml) was added to the medium 36 h after transfection for 6 h before the cells were harvested. Aliquots of cell lysates (1–5 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and the luciferase activity was determined using a biocounter M2500 luminometer (Inotech, Zurich). β-Galactosidase activity was determined in a mixture containing 50 μl of cell extract and 50 μl of a buffer containing the substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 37 °C until a yellow color developed, and then the absorbance was determined at 405 nm. These values were used to normalize transfection efficiency. 293T cells transfected with the Flag-JNK vector and the indicated expression plasmids were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. 38 h after transfection of 293 Myc-IL-1RI, 20 ng/ml IL-1β was added for an additional 7 h before the cells were harvested and lysed as above. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis with anti-JNK2 antibody or with Anti-ACTIVETM antibody (Promega). Kinase assays were performed on transfected cells (1 × 10 6) serum-starved for 16 h. JNK was immunoprecipated from cell extracts with 5 μg of anti-Flag antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The washed Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg of GST-JNK (Santa Cruz) in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mmNa3VO4) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. To ensure that comparable levels of JNK were present the membrane was probed with anti-Flag antibodies, following autoradiography. The murine MyD88 transcript was originally reported to be expressed in myeloid precursor enriched murine bone marrow cells and not in nonmyeloid tissues (1Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, MyD88 mRNA has been detected in a number of nonmyeloid cell lines (4Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2467-2475PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Parnet P. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Sims J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we extend this analysis to show that the murine MyD88 transcript (approximately 2.2 kilobase pairs) is present in many tissues, in fact in all tissues tested except for the brain (Fig.1 A). In order to examine the expression pattern of the MyD88 protein, we generated antibodies against a synthetic peptide (corresponding to residues 54–77) of murine MyD88, which specifically recognized the 30-kDa Flag-MyD88 protein expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B). MyD88 was detected in many tissues with highest levels found in the ovary, adrenal gland, prostate, and thymus (Fig. 1 C). However, in certain tissues (kidney, liver, and spleen), which have MyD88 transcript the protein was not detected, possibly as a result of post-transcriptional regulation in these tissues. Many adapter proteins involved in signal transduction form homo- and heterotypic interactions through like domains. As the death domain is a region that frequently promotes such interactions, MyD88 was analyzed for this capacity. Two-hybrid analysis, in vitro binding studies, and mammalian cell coimmunoprecipations revealed that MyD88 forms homodimers (Figs.2 and 3,A–C). To assess whether the DD mediates self-association, various point and deletion mutants of MyD88 were generated. Phe56 was chosen for mutagenesis based on sequence alignment of the MyD88 DD with the DD of Fas (3Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A mutation at this position corresponds to the lprcp mutation (33Nagata S. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) known to abolish cytotoxic signaling of Fas, probably by disrupting the conformation of the DD as revealed by recent NMR experiments (34Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Mutation of Phe56 to Asn inhibited association of full-length MyD88 with a truncated form containing the DD (MyD88-DD), indicating that dimerization is mediated through the DD of MyD88-DD. Surprisingly, MyD88-lpr was still capable of interacting with MyD88 (Figs. 2 and 3 A), suggesting the presence of a second domain involved in self-association. Two constructs encoding the Toll domain of MyD88 (MyD88-Toll and MyD88-ΔDD) were therefore tested for their ability to bind to MyD88 (Figs. 2 and 3, A andB). MyD88-Toll bound to full-length MyD88 and also to itself but not to MyD88-DD. However, MyD88-Toll did not dimerize with either Toll-N (containing the first half of the domain), Toll-C (containing the second half of the domain), or Toll-Δ282–296 (missing 15 amino acids at the C terminus), suggesting that the entire domain is required for dimerization. The peptide deleted in Toll-Δ282–296 is homologous to a peptide in the Toll domain of the IL-1RI within which are residues that have been shown to be critical for IL-1 signaling (35Heguy A.

A, the interaction of MyD88 expressed as a GST fusion protein was assayed with35S-labeled MyD88, MyD88-lpr, or 35S-MyD88-DDD. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with purified GST-MyD88 (left panel) or GST (right panel) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film overnight.

Anti-Flag (α-Flag) immunoprecipitates (IP) or total cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibodies, respectively. C, lysate from 293T cells transfected with Flag-MyD88 was fractionated on a Superdex-200 column. Every second fraction was analyzed by Western blotting, and MyD88 was detected with anti-Flag antibody. MyD88 migrates with a molecular mass of 30 kDa in SDS-PAGE.

It was also possible that the presence of these two dimerization domains could allow the formation of higher homo-oligomeric structures through head to tail aggregation. To address this question, Flag-MyD88 expression constructs were transfected into 293T cells, and cellular extracts were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography. MyD88 eluted as a defined peak with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa (corresponding to a 2.0-mer) suggesting that MyD88 forms homodimers in vivo (Fig. 3 C).

https://openalex.org/W2088002379,"Steroid receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors, and their association with steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) upon binding to DNA is necessary for them to achieve full transcriptional potential. To understand the mechanism of SRC-1 action, its ability to interact and enhance the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors was analyzed. First, we show that SRC-1 is a modular coactivator that possesses intrinsic transcriptional activity when tethered to DNA and that it harbors two distinct activation domains, AD1 and AD2, needed for the maximum coactivation function of steroid receptors. We also demonstrate that SRC-1 interacts with both the amino-terminal A/B or AF1-containing domain and the carboxyl-terminal D/E or AF2-containing domain of the steroid receptors. These interactions are carried out by multiple regions of SRC-1, and they are relevant for transactivation. In addition to the inherent histone acetyltransferase activity of SRC-1, the presence of multiple receptor-coactivator interaction sites in SRC-1 and its ability to interact with components of the basic transcriptional machinery appears to be, at least in part, the mechanism by which the individual activation functions of the steroid receptors act cooperatively to achieve full transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2061458010,"Changes in mean arterial pressure were monitored in rats following 50% isovolemic exchange transfusion with solutions of chemically modified hemoglobins. Blood pressure responses fall into three categories: 1) an immediate and sustained increase, 2) an immediate yet transient increase, or 3) no significant change either during or subsequent to exchange transfusion. The reactivities of these hemoglobins with nitric monoxide (⋅NO) were measured to test the hypothesis that different blood pressure responses to these solutions result from differences in ⋅NO scavenging reactions. All hemoglobins studied exhibited a value of 30 μm−1 s−1 for both⋅NO bimolecular association rate constants and the rate constants for ⋅NO-induced oxidation in vitro. Only the ⋅NO dissociation rate constants and, thus, the equilibrium dissociation constants varied. Values of equilibrium dissociation constants ranged from 2 to 14 pm and varied inversely with vasopressor response. Hemoglobin solutions that exhibited either transient or no significant increase in blood pressure showed tighter⋅NO binding affinities than hemoglobin solutions that exhibited sustained increases. These results suggest that blood pressure increases observed upon exchange transfusion with cell-free hemoglobin solutions can not be the result of ⋅NO scavenging reactions at the heme, but rather must be due to alternative physiologic mechanisms.

Control of blood pressure and resistance to blood flow is achieved by a dynamic constriction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue which surrounds all blood vessels except capillaries. Vascular smooth muscle tension is continually adjusted by a complex system that causes either vasoconstriction or vasodilation, depending on metabolic need (1Johnson P.C. Richmond K. Shonat R.D. Toth A. Pal M. Tischler M.E. Lynch R.M. Winslow R.M. Vandegriff K.D. Intaglietta M. Blood Substitutes: Physiological Basis of Efficacy. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1995: 175-186Crossref Google Scholar).

Among the findings was the demonstration that ⋅NO donors (e.g. nitroprusside, nitroglycerin) lead to vasorelaxation through activation of guanylate cyclase, whereas inhibitors of⋅NO synthesis (e.g. N G-monomethyl-l-arginine) or scavengers (e.g. hemoglobin) cause vasoconstriction (for reviews, see Refs. 2Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar and 3Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Since cell-free hemoglobin is being developed as a red cell substitute (4Winslow R.M. Hemoglobin-based Red Cell Substitutes. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1992: 72-97Google Scholar), reactions between hemoglobin and ⋅NO are of potential importance in maintenance of microvascular blood flow and O2 delivery. Despite the wide variation that exists in the physical properties (O2 affinity, molecular mass, and solution properties) of different cell-free hemoglobins, it appears vasoconstriction is a feature common to many hemoglobin solutions (for reviews, see Refs. 2Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 3Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol.

Blood Substitutes: Industrial Opportunities and Medical Challenges. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1997: 298-327Google Scholar). It is tempting to conclude that⋅NO scavenging is the principal, if not sole mechanism for vasoconstriction associated with cell-free hemoglobin. However, it is well established that multiple factors contribute to the physiological control of vascular smooth muscle tone, and other mechanisms may operate as well (6Intaglietta M. Johnson P.C. Winslow R.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 632-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, cell-free hemoglobin solutions that differ in blood pressure response were described by Migita et al. (7Migita R. Gonzales A. Gonzales M.L. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 1995-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These workers compared bovine hemoglobin chemically modified by surface conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG-Hb) with human hemoglobin cross-linked between the lysine 99 residues of the α subunits (αα-Hb). Isovolemic exchange transfusions in rats with a solution of αα-Hb resulted in a significant increase in MAP, whereas PEG-Hb solutions caused no significant change in blood pressure. If increases in MAP are due to ⋅NO scavenging reactions, then these two hemoglobins would be expected to exhibit different reactivities with ⋅NO. We have made a direct test of the hypothesis that the blood pressure response to cell-free hemoglobin is related to the reactivity of hemoglobin with ⋅NO by studying the vasopressor response to hemoglobin solutions and the rate constants for reactions with⋅NO. In addition to αα-Hb and PEG-Hb, we have studied four other chemically modified hemoglobins (see Table I). The list includes examples of the three principle types of hemoglobin modification under development for use as a red cell substitute: intramolecular cross-linking, polymerization, and surface conjugation.Table IProperties of modified hemoglobinsHemoglobinHemoglobin modificationMolecular massp 50n 50Vasopressor effectkDamm Hgαα-HbCross-linked tetramer6533.0 ± 0.22.45 ± 0.02SustainedTm-HbCross-linked tetramer6538.7 ± 2.02.80 ± 0.03Sustainedβ82-HbCross-linked tetramer6515.4 ± 0.32.04 ± 0.02TransientPHPPOE surface conjugated9720.4 ± 1.31.64 ± 0.02TransientPEG-HbPOE surface conjugated11710.2 ± 0.61.39 ± 0.04Noneo-R-poly-HbPolymer15652.6 ± 1.51.01 ± 0.04Sustained Open table in a new tab Chemically modified hemoglobin preparations were dissolved in Ringer's lactate to make the solutions used for both exchange transfusion experiments and in vitrokinetic studies.

Bovine hemoglobin surface conjugated to methoxypolyoxyethylene glycol (PEG-Hb, 5.5 g/dl, 3.4 mm heme) was supplied as a gift from Enzon, Inc. (12Zalipsky S. Seltzer R. Nho K. Dumm R.L. Ottenbrite R.M. Polymeric Drugs and Drug Delivery Systems. American Chemical Society, Washington, DC1991: 91-100Google Scholar). Measurements of mean arterial pressure were conducted using groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–350 g, Charles River Labs). All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Animals were fedad libitum prior to all experiments. Surgical preparation was performed 1 day prior to the exchange transfusion experiment. Rats were anesthetized with 250 μl of a mixture of ketamine (71 mg/ml; Aveco Co., Fort Dodge, IA), acepromazine (2.85 mg/ml; Fermenta, Kansas City, MO), and xylazine (2.85 mg/ml; Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA). The areas of the femoral arteries and veins were exposed by blunt dissection. A specially constructed polyethylene catheter (PE-10 connected to PE-50) was placed into the abdominal aorta via one femoral artery to allow rapid withdrawal of arterial blood. An identical catheter was placed in the femoral artery of the opposite leg to monitor blood pressure. A PE-50 catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava via a femoral vein to allow infusion of test solutions. Catheters were tunneled subcutaneously, exteriorized through the tail, held in place by a plastic sheath assembly, and flushed with approximately 100 μL of normal saline. Animals were allowed to recover from the surgical procedure and remained in their cages for an additional 24 h before being used in experiments. On the day of an exchange transfusion experiment, a conscious rat was placed in a plastic restrainer. The arterial and venous cannulae were flushed with 200 and 100 μl, respectively, of heparinized saline (100 units/ml). The venous catheter and the arterial catheter used for withdrawal were connected to a peristaltic pump (Labconco model 4262000, Kansas City, MO). The arterial catheter implanted to monitor blood pressure was connected to a pressure transducer (UFI model 1050, Morro, CA). Arterial pressure was sampled continuously at 100 Hz using a MP100WSW data collection system (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The data were stored in digital form for subsequent off-line analysis. Animals were monitored for 30 min to acquire base-line data. An isovolemic exchange transfusion to 50% of total blood volume (calculated as 1/2 × 0.065 × g of body mass) was then performed with a hemoglobin test solution. The pump was operated so that blood was removed at exactly the same rate as test material was infused (0.5 ml/min). The duration of the exchange depended on the volume infused and lasted between 20 and 30 min. Test solutions were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter immediately prior to infusion, and the infusate tubing was passed through a 37 °C water bath. Systolic and diastolic pressures were the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as diastolic + (systolic-diastolic)/3. Values of mean arterial pressure were averaged for each minute of data collected at 100 Hz. Statistical analyses were done using PROPHET software (BBN, Cambridge, MA). Errors were estimated as the standard error of the mean. Changes in MAP were considered significant based on thet test when p < 0.05. Hemoglobin-oxygen equilibrium curves were measured as described by Vandegriff et al. (13Vandegriff K.D. Rohlfs R.J. Magde Jr., M.D. Winslow R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin solutions (0.1 m bis-Tris propane, 0.1 m Cl−, pH 7.4) were rapidly deoxygenated using the protocatechuic acid/protocatechuic acid 3,4-dioxygenase system (14Bull C. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12673-12680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the enzyme and substrate were obtained from Sigma. The deoxygenation reaction was followed by simultaneous measurements of hemoglobin visible spectra andpO2 using a Milton Roy 3000 diode array spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL) and a micro-oxygen electrode (Microelectrodes, Inc., Londonderry, NH). Data were analyzed as hemoglobin fractional saturation versus ofpO2 and fitted for Adair constants,p 50, and Hill's coefficient at 50% saturation (n 50). All gases were obtained from Matheson. Sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) was provided as a gift from Hoechst-Celanese. Sodium chloride, and bis-Tris propane were obtained from Sigma. Anaerobic buffers were prepared by bubbling the solutions with either nitrogen or argon. ⋅NO gas was scrubbed before use by bubbling through anaerobic 2 m potassium hydroxide solution to remove contaminating products of ⋅NO autoxidation. The scrubbed ⋅NO gas was flushed through a glass tonometer equipped with input and output stopcocks and a side port that was sealed with a rubber septum. After flushing the tonometer with⋅NO gas, anaerobic 0.1 m bis-Tris propane, 0.1m Cl−, pH 7.4, buffer was added to the tonometer through the septum. The buffer was equilibrated under 1 atm of ⋅NO gas to produce [⋅NO] = 1.97 mm stock solutions. Solutions at lower ⋅NO concentrations were prepared by dilution of a stock ⋅NO solution with the appropriate volume of anaerobic buffer. Nitrosylhemoglobin (Hb-NO) samples were prepared by equilibrating anaerobic solutions of deoxyhemoglobin under 1 atm of ⋅NO gas. A Sephadex G-25 column (1 cm × 20 cm) was equilibrated with anaerobic 0.1 m bis-Tris propane, 0.1 mCl−, pH 7.4 buffer. A few crystals of solid sodium dithionite were added to 0.5 ml of stock oxyhemoglobin and immediately passed through the column. The deoxyhemoglobin was eluted off the column through a needle directly into a tonometer containing 1 atm of⋅NO gas, prepared as described above, and equilibrated to produce a [⋅NO] = 1.97 mm Hb-NO solution. This solution was used directly for dissociation experiments or diluted with appropriate volumes of anaerobic and ⋅NO-equilibrated buffers to produce Hb-NO samples at a heme concentration of 100 μm, and a defined ⋅NO concentration, for laser photolysis experiments. Bimolecular association kinetics were measured by laser flash photolysis, a technique which takes advantage of the photosensitivity of the bond between ferrous heme protein and ligand (15Saffran W.A. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7955-7958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Lumonics XeCl Excimer (308 nm) laser pumped a dye laser to produce a light pulse 4 ns in duration that averages 3 mJ per pulse at 540 nm. The observation light was provided by a tungsten-halogen lamp, and both the photolysis and observation beams impinged from counterpropagating directions onto a 2-mm path length cuvette containing the Hb-NO sample. ⋅NO recombination kinetic transients were monitored at 435 nm. Substantially less than 1% photolysis was produced by 100% laser light intensity due to the extremely low quantum yield for dissociation of Hb-NO complexes (15Saffran W.A. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7955-7958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1000 transients were averaged for each sample to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and produce usable ⋅NO recombination time courses. The time courses were fitted to a single exponential expression, taking into account the shape of the laser pulse and the response time of the instrument, using an iterative non-linear least squares algorithm to obtain the observed rate constants (k obs). Under these conditions, the reaction is pseudo first order and the bimolecular association rate constants were obtained by dividing the observed rate constants by the ⋅NO concentration (k′ =k obs/[⋅NO]). ⋅NO unimolecular dissociation kinetics were measured by ligand displacement reactions. Approximately 1 mg of solid sodium dithionite was added to a 1-cm path length cuvette that was sealed with a rubber septum. The cuvette was flushed with either nitrogen or argon and then completely filled, such that there was no gas space, with anaerobic 0.1m bis-Tris propane, 0.1 m Cl−, pH 7.4, buffer that had been equilibrated previously with 1 atm of carbon monoxide gas ([CO] = 1 mm). The ⋅NO displacement reaction was initiated by introducing a few microliters of stock nitrosylhemoglobin solution prepared as described above. The excess dithionite reacts with free ⋅NO dissolved in solution but does not react with ⋅NO bound to hemoglobin (16Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the ⋅NO dissociates, it is destroyed by the dithionite, and CO binds to the heme. Kinetic transients were monitored as the conversion of Hb-NO to Hb-CO with a Milton Roy 3000 diode array spectrophotometer. Time courses were fitted to a biexponential expression (Equation 1) using an iterative nonlinear least squares algorithm to obtain the observed rate constants and the fractional amplitudes of each kinetic phase. In Equation 1, A t is the absorbance at a given point in the time course, ΔA tot is the fitted total absorbance change, f rapid is the fitted fractional amplitude of the rapid kinetic phase,A ∞ is the fitted final absorbance, andk rapid and k slow are the fitted rate constants for the rapid and slow kinetic phases, respectively. Under these conditions,At=frapidΔAtotexp(−krapidt)+(1−frapid)ΔAtotexp(−kslowt)+A∞Equation 1 the observed rate constants are virtually identical to the actual dissociation rate constants (17Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An overall dissociation rate constant (k) for each hemoglobin was calculated as the mean of the dissociation rate constants for the rapid and slow kinetic phases weighted by the fractional contributions (k = (f rapid k rapid + (1 − f rapid)k slow). Overall equilibrium constants were calculated as the ratio of the overall dissociation rate constant to the corresponding association rate constant (K d = k/k′). The kinetics of ⋅NO-induced oxidation of Hb-O2 were measured by conventional rapid mixing techniques using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics model 17MV, London, UK). Solutions of air-equilibrated hemoglobin were mixed against anaerobic solutions of ⋅NO, and the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored by the absorbance change at 419 nm. The value of the bimolecular rate constant for this reaction is reported to be extremely large, on the order of 10 μm−1s−1 (18Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), so the concentration of ⋅NO after mixing was kept low (≤10 μm) in order to minimize loss of the reaction time course in the mixing time of the stopped-flow apparatus. Under these conditions, the rate of the autoxidation reaction of ⋅NO with dissolved O2 is negligible compared with the rate of reaction with oxyhemoglobin (20Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5881-5883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Hb-O2 after mixing was at least a factor of 5 less than that of ⋅NO (usually [Hb-O2] = 0.5 μm) in order to use a pseudo first order approximation. The low Hb-O2 concentrations resulted in small absorbance changes, and ten kinetic transients were signal-averaged for each time course in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The time courses were fitted to a single exponential expression using an iterative non-linear least squares algorithm to obtain the observed rate constants. The bimolecular rate constants were obtained by dividing the observed rate constants by the ⋅NO concentration (k ox′ =k obs/[⋅NO]). The mean arterial pressure responses to a 50% isovolemic exchange transfusion with the six different cell-free hemoglobin solutions are shown in Fig.1. The data are divided into two panels and plotted as the percent change in blood pressure during the base-line and exchange periods. Fig. 1 shows the final 10 min of the 30-min base-line period followed by the 30-min exchange transfusion period. The x-axis is scaled such that the exchange begins at time = 0 min. The different types of MAP response observed with the different hemoglobin solutions used in these experiments can be put into three categories based on their changes from base line (TableI): 1) an immediate and sustained increase (αα-Hb, Tm-Hb, and o-R-poly-Hb); 2) an immediate but transient increase (PHP and β82-Hb); and 3) no significant (p > 0.05) increase (PEG-Hb). The time period between exposure to cell-free hemoglobin and appearance of a significant increase in MAP is approximately 8–10 s for the five groups of rats that show blood pressure increases. The average MAP of rats receiving solutions of αα-Hb (n = 6) increased from 110 ± 2 to 135 ± 3 mm Hg and achieved the maximal value 5–6 min after start of the exchange (Fig. 1 A). A similar result was observed with rats that received Tm-Hb (n = 9, Fig. 1 B). The MAP increased from 115 ± 3 mm Hg to a maximal value of 135 ± 4 mm Hg, the maximum also occurring 5–6 min after the start of exchange. Rats that received o-R-poly-Hb (n= 5) showed a smaller average sustained MAP increase, rising from 115 ± 3 to 126 ± 2 mm Hg and achieved a maximal MAP value more rapidly (2–3 min) than αα-Hb or Tm-Hb rats (Fig.1 B). In all three of these cases, the rapid increase in MAP coupled with a maximal value that is sustained throughout the exchange transfusion period leads to the “square wave” appearance of these time courses. Transient increases in the average MAP were observed in rats that received solutions of either PHP or β82-Hb. For both of these Hb solutions, the rapid increase was followed by a decrease in MAP value back to base-line levels before conclusion of the 30-min exchange period. In the case of rats receiving PHP, the MAP increased at the start of the exchange from a base-line value of 112 ± 2 mm Hg to a maximal value of 126 ± 2 mm Hg at 3 min into the exchange (n = 16, Fig. 1 A). The MAP then decreased to 118 ± 4 mm Hg at 15 min after the start of exchange, a value not significantly different from base line. The β82-Hb group showed an increase similar in magnitude to that of the PHP group (from 108 ± 4 to 123 ± 4 mm Hg in 3 min) with a more rapid return to base line, 10 min into the exchange (n = 4, Fig.1 B). The MAP response in rats to 50% isovolemic exchange transfusion with PEG-Hb is different from the responses observed in the five other groups (n = 5, Fig. 1 A) (7Migita R. Gonzales A. Gonzales M.L. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 1995-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No significant increase in the average MAP above the base-line value (109 ± 4 mm Hg) was observed for the PEG-Hb group at anytime during exchange transfusion. A small increase in MAP (maximal value of 114 ± 4 mm Hg) was observed approximately 3 min after the start of exchange transfusion, and this trend returned to base line within 10 min after the start of the exchange. To test the hypothesis that different patterns of MAP response can be explained by different degrees of ⋅NO scavenging, the reaction of ⋅NO at the hemes of these six hemoglobins was studied in vitro. Kinetic and equilibrium binding constants were determined for the reaction between ⋅NO and the reduced, unliganded form of these hemoglobins. The reaction between ⋅NO and the oxygenated forms of these hemoglobins was also studied. The bimolecular recombination time courses for ⋅NO binding to all six chemically modified hemoglobins studied, and native human HbA0 as a control, are identical within experimental error (TableII). Recombination time courses subsequent to the laser pulse were best described by a single exponential function. The concentration of free ⋅NO is in vast excess of the concentration of photolysed hemes (<1 μm) and a pseudo-first order approximation is valid for the recombination reaction. The overall bimolecular association rate constants for these reactions are obtained by dividing the fitted value of the observed rate constant by the concentration of ⋅NO. All of the hemoglobins studied exhibited values for the association rate constant that are, within experimental error, equal to 30 μm−1 s−1. This value is essentially the same as the value previously reported for ⋅NO binding to native human hemoglobin (25 μm−1s−1) (21Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and indicates that the various types of chemical modification (i.e. cross-linking, surface modification, polymerization) have no measurable effect on the room temperature association kinetics of ⋅NO binding to the heme of hemoglobin.Table IINitric oxide reaction parametersHemoglobink′k rapidf rapidk slowkK dk′oxμm −1 s −1×10 5 s −1%×10 5 s −1×10 5 s −1pmμm −1 s −1HbA032 ± 413 ± 525 ± 31.9 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.330 ± 9αα-Hb31 ± 261 ± 1234 ± 35.5 ± 0.424 ± 1.97.9 ± 1.131 ± 12Tm-Hb31 ± 366 ± 8.435 ± 16.1 ± 0.628 ± 1.48.5 ± 1.225 ± 12β82-Hb30 ± 419 ± 5.921 ± 13.6 ± 0.36.9 ± 0.82.3 ± 0.630 ± 12PHP30 ± 326 ± 6.236 ± 34.6 ± 0.312 ± 1.14.0 ± 0.828 ± 8PEG-Hb30 ± 323 ± 5.554 ± 54.4 ± 0.914 ± 1.54.7 ± 1.030 ± 10o-R-poly-Hb29 ± 2104 ± 3235 ± 25.0 ± 0.440 ± 5.714 ± 3.031 ± 14 Open table in a new tab Bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of ⋅NO with the oxygenated forms of the chemically modified hemoglobins were measured by rapid mixing techniques.

RICK is composed of an N-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal region containing a caspase-recruitment domain. RICK physically interacts with CLARP, a caspase-like molecule known to bind to Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8.

Deletion mutant analysis revealed that both the kinase domain and caspase-recruitment domain were required for RICK to promote apoptosis. Significantly, expression of a RICK mutant in which the lysine of the putative ATP-binding site at position 38 was replaced by a methionine functioned as an inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis.

The surface CD95 death receptor (also known as Fas or APO1), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is widely expressed and plays a critical role in the regulation and homeostasis of the immune system (1Nagata S.

RIP is a protein kinase that was identified by its ability to interact with the intracytoplasmic region of CD95 (7Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). RIP contains a death domain that was shown to mediate the interaction with CD95 (7Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, it has proven difficult to show interaction between RIP and CD95 in vivo (7Stanger B.Z.

Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a kinase other than RIP could be involved in the regulation of CD95-mediated apoptosis. In this report, we describe the identification and initial characterization of RICK, a novel protein kinase. While the N terminus of RICK contains a serine/threonine catalytic kinase domain, its C-terminal region contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) with amino acid homology to the pro-domains of CED-3 related mammalian caspases, Caenorhabditis elegans CED-4 and its mammalian homologue, Apaf-1. The partial nucleotide sequences of cDNAs encoding peptides with homology to RIP were found in EST data bases of GenBank using the TBLASTN program. The entire nucleotide sequence of EST clone 591081, 239957, and 633044 was determined by dideoxy sequencing. The entire cDNA insert of EST clone 591081 was radiolabeled by random priming using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and applied for analysis of human poly(A)+ RNA blots from various tissues (CLONTECH Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The entire cDNA insert (1.8 kilobase pairs) of EST clone 591081 was cloned into theEcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3-RICK. To produce tagged proteins, we constructed pcDNA3-Flag, pcDNA3-myc, pcDNA3-AU1, and pcDNA3-HA which are derivatives of pcDNA3 and share common restriction enzyme sites for cloning. 2N. Inohara and G. Nunez, unpublished results. The entire open reading frame of RICK was inserted into the XbaI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3-Flag to produce N-terminal Flag-tagged RICK. Deletion mutants of RICK (Δ53, Δ247, Δ364, and Δ366–531) were constructed by digestion of the pcDNA3-Flag-RICK construct with restriction enzymes AflII, NdeI,XbaI, and XbaI/ApaI, respectively. The human caspase-10 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of pcDNA3-AU1 to produce C-terminal AU1-tagged caspase-10. pcDNA3-p35, pcDNA3-caspase-8-AU1, and pcDNA3-caspase-8-mt-AU1 were previously described (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The human caspase-1, caspase-2, and caspase-10 cDNAs were cloned into theBamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-AU1 to C-terminal AU1-tagged AU1 proteins. The human CLARP cDNA, its alternative splicing form CLARP-N, and the mutant CLARP-C were cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA to produce C-terminal HA-tagged proteins. 5 × 106human 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids by a calcium phosphate method as described (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 plasmid to be the same within individual experiments. After transfection, 293T cells were harvested at different times and lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The B lymphocyte-derived BJAB cell line was stably transfected by electroporation with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Flag-RICK (K38M). After selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml), bulk cell lines were tested for RICK protein expression with anti-Flag antibody by flow cytometric analysis. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of soluble protein was incubated with 10 μg/ml polyclonal anti-Flag, anti-Myc, or control antibody overnight at 4 °C and tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunoprecipitated proteins or total lysates were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to HA (Boehringer Mannheim) or Flag (Kodak). 5 × 105 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pcDNA3-β-gal plus each expression plasmid in triplicate by the calcium phosphate method as reported (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 20 μm of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products) or 12.5 μl of medium from COS-6 cells producing Fas ligand (a gift of Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) was added at 8 h after transfection. At 18 or 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed, stained for β-galactosidase as described (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and assayed for morphological features of apoptosis. At least 300 blue-staining cells were counted. BJAB apoptosis induced by anti-Apo1 mAb was determined by flow cytometric analysis of nuclei stained with propidium iodide as described (11Merino R. Grillot D.A. Simonian P.L. Muthukkumar S.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Neuman-Keuls post-doc comparisons. The human FADD cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-myc to produce C-terminal Myc-tagged FADD. 5 × 106 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-caspase-8-AU1, or pcDNA3-caspase-8-mt-AU1 (10Inohara N.

At 16 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). AU1-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb to AU1 and the Ac-DEVD-AMC cleavage activity was measured as described previously (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 human 293T cells were transfected with 8 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Flag-RICK, or pcDNA3-Flag-RICK-K38M. Flag-RICK proteins were immunoprecipitated mAb to Flag. Kinase assay was performed as described (12del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). As control experiment, one-twentieth of total lysate was immunoblotted with mAb to Flag. To identify potential RIP-related genes, we searched public data bases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for clones with homology to the catalytic domain of RIP (7Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Three ESTs encoding novel overlapping peptides were identified with significant amino acid homology to the kinase domain of RIP. Sequence analysis of the three cDNAs demonstrated that the three clones represent fragments of the same gene. The longest cDNA clone had an 1.8-kilobase insert and an open reading frame encoding a protein of 531 amino acids with an estimated molecular size of 60,332 Da (Fig.1 A). We have designated this protein RICK (RIP-like interactingCLARP kinase). Analysis of the RICK amino acid sequence revealed that it contains an N-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain with significant amino acid similarity to the kinase catalytic domain of RIP (Fig. 1, B and C). Unlike RIP, the C-terminal region of RICK had significant similarity to the pro-domain of several caspases including caspase-1 and -2 (Fig.1 D). In addition, the same C-terminal fragment of RICK (residues 426–517) had significant amino acid similarity to regions from other apoptosis regulatory proteins including RAIDD, cIAP-1, the N terminus of Apaf-1 (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), and its C. elegans homologue CED-4 (Fig. 1 D). The region of homology between RICK and CED-3-like caspases/CED-4/Apaf-1/RAIDD/cIAP corresponds to a domain previously named CARD (14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We performed Northern blot analysis to determine the distribution of RICK RNA transcripts in various human tissues. RICK was detected in heart, brain, placenta, lung, pancreas, spleen, lymph node, and peripheral blood lymphocytes as two transcripts of 2.5 and 1.8 kilobases (Fig.2). Further analysis revealed that the difference in RICK mRNA transcripts is due to differential polyadenylation.2 To begin to elucidate the physiological function of RICK, expression constructs producing Flag-tagged RICK, native RICK, or control proteins were introduced into 293T which were subsequently observed for features of apoptosis. Expression of caspase-8 and -10, two caspases known to be activated during CD95 signaling (5Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M.

A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), induced significant apoptosis but RICK did not (Fig.3 A). Significantly, expression of RICK augmented apoptosis promoted by caspase-8 and caspase-10 (Fig.3 A). The enhancement of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis induced by RICK required a catalytic active caspase-8 since RICK did not augment the level of apoptosis induced by caspase-8-mt, a mutant caspase-8 protein with a single amino acid change (Cys377to Ser) in the conserved active pentapeptide (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, caspase-8-induced apoptosis potentiated by RICK was inhibited by the broad-based caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk and baculovirus p35 (Fig. 3 A). The potentiation of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis by RICK suggested that RICK could enhance the activation of caspase-8. To measure the protease activity associated with caspase-8, lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with AU1-tagged caspase-8 and Flag-tagged RICK were incubated with anti-AU1 antibody to immunoprecipitate caspase-8, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for enzymatic activity using the Ac-DEVD-AMC (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin) fluorogenic substrate (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The analysis showed that RICK enhanced the enzymatic activity of wild-type (wt) caspase-8 but not that of caspase-8-mt (Fig.3 B). Moreover, the caspase promoting activity induced by RICK was similar to that observed when caspase-8 was co-expressed with FADD (Fig. 3 B), a protein known to activate caspase-8 (4Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar,5Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A.

The results presented in Fig. 3 suggested that RICK could be involved in the regulation of apoptosis induced by CD95 receptor stimulation. Catalytically inactive mutants of serine threonine kinases often act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the active kinase (16Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase FactsBook: Protein-serine Kinase. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). Therefore, we engineered a mutant form of RICK (RICK-K38M) in which the lysine of the putative ATP-binding site at position 38 was replaced by a methionine to test if this mutant could regulate CD95-mediated apoptosis. Expression constructs producing Flag-tagged RICK-K38M or empty vector were stably transfected into BJAB, a human B cell line that undergoes apoptosis upon CD95 stimulation (3Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). To minimize clonal variation, bulk BJAB cell lines expressing RICK-K38M or control were selected with puromycin and analyzed 2 weeks after transfection. BJAB expressing the RICK-K38M mutant were significantly less sensitive to anti-APO1-induced apoptosis than BJAB cells transfected with control plasmid (Fig. 3 C,p < 0.001). Protein analysis revealed that BJAB transfected with RICK-K38M expressed the Flag-tagged RICK mutant protein (Fig. 3 C, inset). These results indicate that the RICK-K38M mutant inhibits apoptosis induced by CD95 stimulation and suggests that RICK is involved in regulation of the CD95 signaling pathway. To confirm defective kinase function of RICK-K38M mutant, the wild type and mutant RICK proteins were expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with mAb to Flag. The K38M mutation in RICK dramatically decreased its autophosphorylation in vitro(Fig. 3 D). We engineered deletion mutant forms of RICK to further characterize their abilities to regulate apoptosis (Fig. 4 A). Deletion mutants of the N-terminal region spanning the catalytic kinase domain (Δ53, Δ247, and Δ364) failed to potentiate apoptosis of 293T cells induced by Fas, Fas plus FasL, or caspase-8 (Fig.4 A). In addition, a deletion mutant missing the C-terminal 165 amino acids that span the CARD domain did not enhance apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that wt and mutant forms of RICK were expressed ruling out loss of function due to inappropriate levels of expression (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that both the kinase catalytic domain and the C-terminal region containing the CARD domain are required for enhancement of apoptosis by RICK. The presence of the CARD domain suggested that RICK could promote apoptosis by interacting with signaling molecules of the CD95 death pathway. To test this, expression constructs producing several HA-tagged apoptosis-regulatory proteins and Flag-tagged RICK were transiently co-transfected into 293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. The analysis shown in Fig. 4 D revealed that RICK co-immunoprecipitated with CLARP, a caspase-related protein also known as Casper, c-FLIPL, I-FLICE, FLAME-1, CASHL, and MRIT that interacts with FADD and caspase-8 (10Inohara N.

We engineered two mutant forms of CLARP to determine the regions of CLARP required for its interaction with RICK.

RICK interacted with the C-terminal caspase-like domain but not with the N-terminal DED-containing domain of CLARP (Fig. 4 D). Thus, RICK interacts with the C-terminal caspase-like domain of CLARP. Upon activation, the CD95 receptor recruits FADD and caspase-8 into a death-inducing signaling complex that is induced or enhanced by CD95 receptor oligomerization and activation (4Boldin M.P.

Thus, CLARP could function as an adapter molecule to link RICK to proximal components of the CD95 signaling complex. RICK-K38M, a mutant in which the lysine of the putative ATP-binding site at position 38 was replaced by a methionine, functioned as an inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis. Identical mutations in the ATP-binding site of several serine threonine kinases lead to catalytically inactive proteins that act as dominant-negative mutants (16Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase FactsBook: Protein-serine Kinase. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that RICK is a kinase that is involved in the regulation of apoptosis induced by the CD95 receptor pathway. The protein substrate(s) that are targets of RICK are presently unknown. One candidate substrate for RICK is CD95. The intracytoplasmic region of CD95 can be phosphorylated (24Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and this phosphorylation event might regulate CD95-induced apoptosis. Another potential substrate is FADD since RICK could associate with FADD-containing complexes via CLARP. The C-terminal caspase-like domain of CLARP associates with RICK, while the N-terminal domain that contains the DED modules is involved in the interaction with FADD (17Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V.

Upon cross-linking and activation of CD95, FADD is phosphorylated on serine residues in vivo (23Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

However, it is possible that phosphorylation of FADD may lead to increased activation of caspase-8 which is consistent with our observation that RICK increases the activity of caspase-8.

https://openalex.org/W2071160031,"The 31-amino acid proteolipid, sarcolipin (SLN), is associated with the fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1). Constructs of human and rabbit SLN and of rabbit SLN with the FLAG epitope at its N terminus (NF-SLN) or its C terminus (SLN-FC) were coexpressed with SERCA1 in HEK-293 T-cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate colocalization of NF-SLN and SERCA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and to demonstrate the cytosolic orientation of the N terminus of SLN. Coexpression of native rabbit SLN or NF-SLN with SERCA1 decreased the apparent affinity of SERCA1 for Ca2+ but stimulated maximal Ca2+ uptake rates (V max). The N terminus of SLN is not well conserved among species, and the addition of an N-terminal FLAG epitope did not alter SLN function. Anti-FLAG antibody reversed both the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by NF-SLN at low Ca2+concentrations and the stimulatory effect of NF-SLN onV max. Addition of the FLAG epitope to the highly conserved C terminus decreased the apparent affinity of SERCA1 for Ca2+ relative to native SLN and decreasedV max significantly. Mutations in the C-terminal domain showed that this sequence is critical for SLN function. Mutational analysis of the transmembrane helix, together with the additive regulatory effects of coexpression of both SLN and phospholamban (PLN) with SERCA1, provided evidence for different mechanisms of interaction of SLN and PLN with SERCA molecules. Ca2+ uptake rates in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, isolated from rabbit fast-twitch muscle (tibialis anterior) subjected to chronic low frequency stimulation, were reduced by approximately 40% in 3- and 4-day stimulated muscle, with a marginal increase in apparent affinity of SERCA1 for Ca2+. SERCA1 mRNA and protein levels were unaltered after stimulation. In contrast, SLN mRNA was decreased by 15%, and SLN protein was reduced by 40%. Reduced SLN expression could explain the decrease in SERCA1 activity observed in these muscles and might represent an early functional adaptation to chronic low frequency stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2061822552,"Adenovirus E1B-19K and BCL-2 anti-apoptosis proteins interact with certain BCL-2 family pro-apoptotic proteins. A conserved domain, BH3, present in these proteins is essential for their pro-apoptotic activity and for heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins. Cellular protein BNIP3 (previously NIP3) interacts with E1B-19K, BCL-2, BCL-xL, and EBV-BHRF1. BNIP3 contains a motif similar to the BH3 domain. Deletion of the BH3-like motif in BNIP3 abrogates its ability to heterodimerize with E1B-19K and BCL-xL. Substitution of the BH3 domain of BNIP3 for the corresponding sequences of BAX functionally restores the pro-apoptotic and protein heterodimerization activities of BAX. BNIP3 exhibits a delayed cell death activity that is partially relieved by deletion of the BH3 domain. BNIP3 suppresses the anti-apoptosis activity of BCL-xL in a BH3-dependent manner. BNIP3 contains a C-terminal trans-membrane (TM) domain similar to other BCL-2 family proteins and BNIP1 (previously NIP1). The TM domains of BNIP3 and BNIP1 can functionally substitute for the TM domain of a BCL-2 family member EBV-BHRF1. The BNIP3 TM domain exclusively targets the heterologous green fluorescent protein (GFP) to mitochondria. These results suggest that BNIP3 is a member of the BH3-contaning BCL-2 family of pro-apoptotic proteins and functions in mitochondria.

Apoptosis is an essential physiological process of selective elimination of cells in multicellular organisms. This process is invoked during normal organ development and tissue homeostasis and also during certain pathological conditions that result in degenerative diseases. Apoptosis plays an important role in regulating the multiplication of and pathogenesis by a number of viruses (for review, see Ref. 1Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In virus-infected cells, apoptotic paradigms are initiated as a cellular defensive mechanism to eliminate infected cells. However, a number of viruses encode proteins that suppress apoptosis resulting in efficient viral replication and pathogenesis. Human adenoviruses have evolved multiple strategies employing proteins coded by three different gene blocks, E1B, E3, and E4, to overcome the effect of apoptosis of infected permissive cells (for review, see Ref. 2Chinnadurai G. Semin. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). One of the proteins coded by the E1B region, the 19K protein, efficiently suppresses apoptosis manifested during viral infection and in cells exposed to several different heterologous stimuli. E1B-19K is a functional homolog of the cellular anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2. The mechanism by which E1B-19K and the related BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins promote cell survival remains to be elucidated. In order to gain insight into the possible mechanism(s) by which these proteins exert their activity, several investigators have searched for cellular proteins that complex with E1B-19K and BCL-2. Such searches have thus far identified seven cellular proteins that complex with E1B-19K (3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G.

Three of these proteins, BAK, BAX, and BIK, are potent pro-apoptotic proteins and are members of the BCL-2 family proteins. Coexpression of the anti-apoptosis proteins with the pro-apoptotic proteins results in suppression of cell death to varying extents. Thus, one of the mechanisms by which E1B-19K, BCL-2, and related proteins promote cell survival may involve antagonizing the activities of pro-apoptotic proteins through direct protein heterodimerization. Among the three BCL-2 family pro-apoptotic proteins that complex with E1B-19K and BCL-2, BAK and BAX are more closely related to BCL-2 and share more extensive homology with other BCL-2 family proteins. In contrast, BIK shares a single domain (designated BH3 domain) with other BCL-2 family proteins (in addition to a C-terminal trans-membrane domain characteristic of most BCL-2 family proteins; Ref. 4Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Since the discovery of BIK, two other pro-apoptotic proteins, BID (10Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) that share only the BH3 domain with BCL-2 family proteins have been identified. In addition, a previously identified pro-apoptotic protein BAD (12Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) has recently been recognized as a BH3 domain-containing protein; Ref. 13Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J.

The BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic proteins serves a dual function. It is essential for their cell death activity and for mediating heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins (4Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang K. Yin X.M.

Since BH3 alone-containing pro-apoptotic proteins (BIK, BID, HRK, and BAD) share only the BH3 domain in common, it is believed that the BH3 domain is the death effector domain and is postulated to elicit its cell death activity by inactivating the anti-apoptotic proteins through heterodimerization. However, detailed mutational analysis of one pro-apoptotic protein, BIK, suggests that heterodimerization with survival proteins alone is insufficient for its cell death activity (17Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24494-24498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present communication, we report that the cellular protein BNIP3 (previously NIP3, according to Human Gene Nomenclature Committee) identified and cloned in our laboratory (3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) also contains a functional BH3 domain. The BH3 domain of BNIP3 mediates protein heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins, and when substituted in a different pro-apoptotic protein, BAX, can elicit both cell death and heterodimerization activities. The BH3 domain of BNIP3 is required for its ability to antagonize the activity of BCL-xL and is partially required for its pro-apoptotic activity. Most of the BCL-2 family proteins contain a characteristic C-terminal trans-membrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, trans-membrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DB, DNA binding; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AD, activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BRK, baby rat kidney; wt, wild type; HA, hemaglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: TM, trans-membrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DB, DNA binding; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AD, activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BRK, baby rat kidney; wt, wild type; HA, hemaglutinin. domain that appears to target these proteins to subcellular regions such as mitochondria and nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum regions. Deletion of the TM domain results in varying effects on the activity of various anti-apoptotic proteins. In certain members like EBV-BHRF1, it is essential (18Theodorakis P. D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar) while in other members, like BCL-2 and BCL-xL, it is not always required. Deletion of the TM domain of BCL-2 results in partial reduction of the anti-apoptosis activity under certain conditions (19Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar), whereas under other conditions, no significant reduction results (20Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this communication, we report that both BNIP1 and BNIP3 also contain functional TM domains suggesting that these proteins function at subcellular locations where other BCL-2 family proteins function. Further, the domain of BNIP3 can specifically target a heterologous non-BCL-2 family protein to mitochondria. Plasmids pMA424–19K, pACT-BNIP3, and pcDNA3-BNIP3 have been described (3Boyd J.M.

Plasmid pBNIP3 (puro) was constructed by cloning BNIP3 in pBabe-puro (21Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMA424-BCL-xL was constructed by cloning PCR-amplified BCL-xL DNA in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding (DB) domain. Plasmids pcDNA3-BAX and pcDNA3-BAXΔGD (referred to here as ΔBH3) were gifts from Tom Chittenden (16Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGST-BCL-xL was a gift from Robert Lutz. Deletion mutants of BNIP3 as well as BAX BH3 domain substitution mutants were constructed by PCR. Plasmids expressing EBV-BHRF1 and BHRF1ΔTM (previously mutant Y164–91) have been described (18Theodorakis P. D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar). To construct various TM domain substitution mutants, the DNA sequences encoding the various TM domains were amplified by PCR. The PCR primers were engineered to contain a BamHI site at the 5′ end and anXhoI site at the 3′ end. The PCR-generated DNA fragments were used to replace the corresponding sequences in pcDNA3-HABHRF1. pcDNA3-GFP was constructed by cloning the GFP gene from Alpha+GFP Cycle (22Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) in pcDNA3. The GFP-TM chimeric genes were constructed by substituting the GFP gene (engineered to contain a BglII site at the 3′ end) for the BHRF1 open reading frame in plasmids expressing the BHRF1/BNIP1-TM or BHRF1/BNIP3-TM fusion proteins. Yeast indicator strain GGY1::171 was transformed with a bait plasmid expressing a fusion protein consisting of E1B-19K or BCL-xL tagged with the GAL4 DB domain (pMA424–19K; Ref. 3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar. or pMA424-BCL-xL) and prey plasmids (pACT-BNIP3 (wt or the BH3 deletion mutant)) expressing BNIP3 protein tagged with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) using established procedures (23Chien C.T.

Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The relative levels of protein interaction were determined by estimating the levels of expression of the reporter gene Escherichia coli lacZ. A comparable number of yeast transformants were pooled and grown in liquid selective media (lacking histidine and leucine), equal number of cells were lysed, and the levels of β-galactosidase were determined using the substrate O-nitrophenylgalactosidase (ONPG) (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), and these results were expressed as units defined by Miller (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). To examine the in vitro protein binding, 35S-labeled proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation of various BAX mutants cloned in pcDNA3 vector using a commercially available kit (Promega). The labeled proteins were incubated with GST-BCL-xL fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, washed five times in the same buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were carried out in COS-7 cells (plated on coverslips in 35-mm dishes) transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3-HA BHRF1 wt or various mutants expressing TM domain fusion proteins. For mitochondrial staining, 25 nm of MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to the media for 30 min at 24 h post-transfection. Cells were immediately fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, and then were stained with monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). Cells were photographed using a 495-nm filter to visualize BHRF1 and a 546-nm filter to visualize mitochondria. For GFP fluorescence, COS-7 cells were transfected as above, with 5 μg of pcDNA3-GFP wt or pcDNA3 containing various GFP-TM domain chimeric genes. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red and photographed using a 495-nm (for GFP fluorescence) or 546-nm filter (to visualize mitochondria). Cell survival assays were carried out using a baby rat kidney (BRK) cell line (BRK/p53val135-E1A) transformed by cotransfection of p53val135 (27Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and adenovirus E1A (28Subramanian T. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2403-2409PubMed Google Scholar). To assay the effect of BHRF1, pRcCMV-based plasmids expressing wt or mutant proteins were transfected in BRK/p53val135-E1A cells, and G418-resistant colonies (∼100) from each transfection were pooled (at 37.5 °C). These cells were assayed for survival at 32.5 °C at 24, 48, and 72 h by counting the Trypan-blue excluding cells as described earlier (18Theodorakis P. D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of BNIP3 on the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-xL, the BRK/p53val135-E1A cell line was transfected with pcDNA3-BCL-xL (neo) and pBabe-BNIP3 (puro), and the transfected cells were maintained at 32.5 °C for 5 days. The surviving cells were then allowed to form visible colonies by growing at 37.5 °C in the presence of 100 μg of G418 and 1 μg of puromycin, stained with Giemsa, and counted. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-based plasmids expressing BAX or BAX mutants or BNIP3 (2 μg) along with the reporter plasmid pCMV-βgal (0.5 μg). After 12 or 48 h of transfection, the cells were fixed, stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and microscopically examined. 100 to 200 blue color cells were microscopically scored as flat (live) and round (apoptotic) cells. Since the BH3 domain of several BCL-2 family proteins mediates heterodimerization with BCL-2 and related proteins, we searched BNIP1–3 for BH3-like sequence motifs. We noted a BH3-like motif in BNIP3 between residues 110 and 118 (Fig.1 A). This motif of BNIP3 resembles the known BH3 domains of various BCL-2 family proteins, particularly the recently identified BH3 domain of BAD (Fig.1 B). In order to determine if the putative BH3 domain in BNIP3 mediates heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins, we constructed a 6-amino acid (residues 110–115) deletion mutant encompassing the BH3 domain of BNIP3 (BNIP3ΔBH3) (Fig.1 A). We then examined the ability of this mutant to heterodimerize with E1B-19K and BCL-xL by two-hybrid analysis in yeast. The relative levels of interaction of BNIP3 or BNIP3ΔBH3 were determined by quantitating the levels of expression of the E. coli lacZ reporter gene. Ten to twenty independent transformed yeast colonies were pooled, and the relative levels of β-galactosidase expression were colorimetrically determined (Fig.2). Cells expressing either E1B-19K or BCL-xL (as GAL4 DB domain fusion protein) and BNIP3 wt (tagged with the GAL4 AD) induced significant levels of β-galactosidase compared with the control cells expressing the respective DB fusion protein and AD vector (pACT). In contrast, cells expressing the DB fusion proteins and the respective AD-tagged BH3 deletion mutant of BNIP3 did not induce significant levels of β-galactosidase. These results suggest that the BH3-like motif deleted in BNIP3ΔBH3 mutant is essential for heterodimerization with E1B-19K and BCL-xL.Figure 2Yeast two-hybrid interaction of BNIP3 with E1B-19K and BCL-xL. The relative levels of β-galactosidase expressed in the indicator yeast cells (GGY::171) transformed with the vector expressing the GAL4 activation domain (indicated as Vector) or the activation domain-tagged BNIP3 wt or BNIP3ΔBH3 and plasmids expressing GAL4 (DNA binding domain)-E1B 19K or BCL-xL fusion proteins are shown. The data shown are the activities of β-galactosidase (mean ± S.D.) from 10 to 20 individual transformants recovered from three different transformations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further substantiate the presence of a BH3 domain in BNIP3, we carried out a domain substitution study with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX. We constructed two substitution mutants of BAX in which a 9- (BAX/BNIP3BH3–9) or a 16-amino acid region (BAX/BNIP3BH3–16) corresponding to the BH3 domain of BNIP3 was substituted for the corresponding sequences of BAX (Fig.3 A). The 16-amino acid region containing the BH3 region was chosen since this region of BAX and BAK corresponds to a BH3-containing α-helical region of BCL-xL and since peptides of BAK and BAX containing the 16-amino acid region efficiently bind to BCL-xL (29Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). The effect of these substitution mutations on the apoptotic activity of BAX was determined by transient transfection (16Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 30Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) in MCF-7 cells. Plasmids expressing various BAX mutants or BNIP3 were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the E. coli lacZ reporter gene. Transfected cells were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantitated by microscopically counting the number of round (apoptotic) blue cells from the total number of blue cells (Fig. 3 B). Transfection of BAX wt resulted in 50–60% of apoptotic cells while transfection of a BH3 deletion mutant (BAXΔBH3) of BAX (16Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) severely impaired apoptosis. Substitution of the 9- or 16-amino acid region of BNIP3 also fully restored the pro-apoptotic activity of BAX. We also determined the ability of the various BAX mutants to heterodimerize with BCL-xL. Various mutant proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation and incubated with GST-BCL-xL fusion protein. The protein complexes were separated by chromatography on the glutathione-agarose affinity matrix and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 C). As expected, BAX bound to BCL-xL while BAXΔBH3 mutant did not. Both chimeric BAX proteins containing the BH3 domain of BNIP3 also bound to BCL-xL. These results suggest that the BH3 domain of BNIP3 is functionally equivalent to the BH3 domain of BAX based on two functional criteria (i.e. induction of apoptosis and heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins). In cells transfected with BNIP3, only a marginal amount of apoptosis, compared with cells transfected with the empty vector, was observed at 12 h after transfection (under conditions where BAX induces efficient apoptosis) (Fig. 3 B). To determine if BNIP3 can induce apoptosis after extended periods of time, we examined the transfected cells 48 h after transfection. Under these assay conditions, BNIP3 induced significant cell death (Fig.4 A). Cells transfected with a BH3 deletion mutant of BNIP3 exhibited reduced levels of apoptosis, albeit detectable residual cell death activity. These results suggest that the BH3 domain may only be partially required for the cell death activity manifested by BNIP3. We then determined if BNIP3 could antagonize the activity of an anti-apoptosis protein. For this purpose, BRK/p53val135-E1A cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing BCL-xL (and theneo selection marker) or BNIP3 (and the puroselection marker) and maintained at 37.5 °C for 24 h and shifted to 32. 5 °C for 5 days. The surviving cells were then allowed to proliferate (in the presence of G418 and puromycin) and form visible colonies at 37.5 °C and then were quantitated. In the absence of any anti-apoptosis protein, the BRK/p53val135-E1A cells undergo total apoptosis and do not result in detectable colony formation, suggesting that it is a sensitive assay for the anti-apoptosis proteins (Fig. 4 B). Transfection of BCL-xL resulted in significant colony formation while cotransfection with BNIP3 reduced the colony formation by about one-half. This inhibitory effect of BNIP3 is relieved by the ΔBH3 mutation (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that coexpression of BNIP3 may directly or indirectly suppress the activity of BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins through the BH3 domain. Previous indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that BNIP3 localizes primarily in punctate cytoplasmic structures characteristic of mitochondria while two other M r =19,000-interacting proteins (BNIP1 and BNIP2) were found to localize in the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum regions (3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analysis of the BNIP3 sequence suggests that the C-terminal region could potentially form a trans-membrane (TM) domain similar to other BCL-2 family proteins. In order to determine if the TM domain of BNIP3 could determine the specific subcellular localization pattern previously observed with BNIP3, we carried out a domain substitution study with EBV-BHRF1. For this study, we chose BHRF1 since the TM domain is essential for the anti-apoptosis activity of BHRF1 (18Theodorakis P. D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar) and its subcellular localization pattern (punctate) appears to resemble that of BNIP3 (31Tarodi B. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1994; 201: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Henderson S. Huen D. Rowe M. Dawson C. Johnson G. Rickinson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8479-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In the present study, the TM domains of BCL-2 and BNIP1 were also used for comparison. The TM domains of BNIP3, BCL-2, or BNIP1 were fused to BHRF1, taking advantage of a unique BamHI site at the C terminus of BHRF1 just upstream of the TM domain (Fig.5 A). We then determined if the various TM domains could functionally substitute for the TM domain of BHRF1 in a functional anti-apoptosis assay and then determined the subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence. The effect of various BHRF1 mutants on apoptosis induced by a tsallele of p53 tumor suppressor protein (p53val135) was determined (18Theodorakis P. D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar). A BRK cell line transformed with E1A and the ts mutant of p53 (BRK/p53val135-E1A) was transformed with various BHRF1 mutants, and pooled cell lines were established from a comparable number of G418-resistant colonies. The effect of BHRF1 on apoptosis was determined by shifting the cells from the permissive temperature (37.5 °C) to the non-permissive temperature (32.5 °C) and counting the number of live cells (based on Trypan blue exclusion) at 24 h intervals (Fig. 5 C). Cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector lost >90% viability within 48 h after shifting to 32.5 °C. Similarly, cells transfected with the BHRF1 mutant lacking the C-terminal TM domain (BHRF1ΔTM) also lost about 90% viability within 48 h at 32.5 °C. In contrast, cells transfected with wt BHRF1 retained about 60% cell viability during a period of 48–72 h at 32.5 °C. Interestingly, cells expressing the BHRF1 chimeric proteins containing the TM domain of BCL-2 (BHRF1/BCL2-TM) or BNIP1 (BHRF1/BNIP1-TM) exhibited even enhanced cell viability, suggesting that the TM domains of these proteins can efficiently substitute for the TM domain of BHRF1. The BHRF1 chimeric protein containing the TM domain of BNIP3 (BHRF1/BNIP3-TM) also conferred significant viability, albeit at reduced levels than BHRF1/BCL2-TM or BHRF1/BNIP1-TM. However, examination of the levels of the chimeric protein expressed in the various cell lines indicates that the BHRF1/BNIP3-TM chimeric protein is expressed at reduced levels compared with other proteins that may contribute to the observed lower anti-apoptotic activity (Fig. 5 B). These results clearly indicate that the TM domains of BNIP3, BNIP1, and BCL-2 can functionally substitute for the TM domain of BHRF1. The subcellular localization of the various BHRF1 mutant proteins (tagged with HA) was determined in comparison to wt BHRF1. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with various BHRF1 expression plasmids and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6, A-E). Since BHRF1 (31Tarodi B. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1994; 201: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and BNIP3 (3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) appear to be localized significantly to the mitochondria, cells were double stained with MitoTracker Red, a mitochondrial specific dye (Fig. 6, F-J). In cells transfected with the BHRF1 mutant lacking the TM domain (BHRF1ΔTM), the HA-specific fluorescence was observed throughout the cell including the nucleus (Fig. 6 A), whereas in cells expressing wt BHRF1, primarily cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig.6 B) that coincides with MitoTracker fluorescence (Fig.6 G) was observed. A pattern similar to wt BHRF1 was also observed in cells expressing the BHRF1/BNIP3-TM chimeric protein (Fig.6, E and J). In cells expressing the chimeric proteins BHRF1/BCL2-TM and BHRF1/BNIP1-TM, both punctate cytoplasmic fluorescence and nuclear envelope fluorescence (HA-specific) was observed (Fig. 6, C and D). The cytoplasmic HA-specific punctate fluorescence appears to coincide with the MitoTracker-specific fluorescence (Fig. 6, H andI). These results suggest that the TM domain of BNIP3 appears to target BHRF1 primarily to the mitochondria, whereas the TM domains of BCL-2 and BNIP1 can target BHRF1 to nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial regions. In addition, we also determined if the TM domain of BNIP3 by itself could target a heterologous (non-BCL2 family) protein to mitochondria. For this purpose, we fused the TM domain of BNIP3 to the C terminus of GFP and analyzed the GFP-fluorescence in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. For comparison, we also used the GFP fusion proteins containing the TM domains of BCL-2 or BNIP1. It has previously been shown that the TM domain of BCL-2 targets a heterologous protein, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), to mitochondria (33Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing GFP showed fluorescence throughout the cell, which was concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, in cells expressing the GFP/BCL2-TM or GFP/BNIP1-TM fusion proteins, the fluorescence was primarily associated with the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic punctate structures (Fig. 7, B andC). Cells expressing the GFP/BNIP3-TM fusion protein exhibited primarily punctate cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig.7 D). The transfected cells were also stained with the MitoTracker Red dye to determine if the TM domain fusion proteins are localized to the mitochondria. In cells expressing GFP, the observed cytoplasmic punctate fluorescence did not correspond to the GFP fluorescence (Fig. 7 E). In cells expressing the GFP/BNIP3-TM fusion protein, clear punctate cytoplasmic fluorescence that coincides with the GFP fluorescence was observed (Fig. 7 H), suggesting that most of this fusion protein localizes primarily in mitochondria. In cells expressing GFP-BCL2-TM or GFP/BNIP1-TM, significant punctate fluorescence coincident with the MitoTracker dye was also observed (Fig. 7, F and G). These results suggest that the TM domains of BCL-2 and BNIP1 can target a heterologous protein to both nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum regions as well as to mitochondria, whereas the TM domain of BNIP3 primarily targets to mitochondria. We have shown that the cellular protein, BNIP3, which binds to the BCL-2 family of anti-apoptosis proteins, contains a BH3 domain. We have demonstrated that the BH3 domain of BNIP3 is functional since substitution of the corresponding sequences in a different pro-apoptotic protein BAX restores two activities of BAX, induction of cell death and heterodimerization with anti-apoptosis proteins, both of which are ascribed to the BH3 domain. The BH3 domain of BNIP3 more closely resembles the BH3 domain of BAD (Fig. 1 B). Thus, BNIP3 appears to have an overall resemblance to several BH3 alone-containing BCL-2 family proteins such as BIK, BID, HRK, and BAD. The BH3 domain of these proteins plays a crucial role in their pro-apoptotic activity. Recent in vitro studies indicate that BH3 domains of BAX and BAK alone are sufficient to induce apoptosis (34Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although BNIP3 does not possess a potent pro-apoptotic activity like other BH3-contaning pro-apoptotic proteins, the BH3 domain appears to play some role in the pro-apoptotic activity of BNIP3. However, the BNIP3 BH3 domain is as efficient as the BAX BH3 domain in eliciting apoptosis under the context of BAX. It is possible that the pro-apoptotic activity dictated by the BH3 domain is suboptimal in the context of the BNIP3 protein, and such activity may be enhanced by exposure to certain apoptotic stimuli or by other protein interactions. Our results raise the possibility that the cell death activity dictated by the BH3 domain is also influenced by the other sequences within the cognate protein. Sequence comparisons of BNIP3 indicate that there are several human homologs of this protein. Interestingly, there is also a BNIP3 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans. The possibility that BNIP3 or its homologs may function cooperatively with other apoptotic factors remains to be investigated. We have shown that coexpression of BNIP3 results in suppression of the anti-apoptosis activity of BCL-xL. Since the suppressive effect of BNIP3 is relieved by the deletion of the BH3 domain, it appears that BH3 may directly or indirectly modulate the activity of survival proteins. Since the BH3 domain also mediates heterodimerization with survival proteins, the simplest explanation would be that BNIP3 and the survival proteins may form inactive dimers. However, we note that others have observed certain BH3 mutants of BAX and BAK retain their ability to antagonize the activity of BCL-2/BCL-xL (35Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Andrews D.W. Leber B. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32073-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Nunez G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, BCL-xS that does not appear to complex with BCL-xL also suppresses the activity of BCL-xL (37Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is possible that physical interaction between the BNIP3 and anti-apoptosis proteins may modulate the activity of the latter proteins by altering the conformation and/or accessibility to other cofactors. It is possible that BH3 mutants of BAX and BAK may suppress the activity of anti-apoptosis proteins by competing for certain cofactors or simply clogging or displacing anti-apoptosis proteins from subcellular sites where these proteins are active. We have provided evidence that BNIP3 may primarily function in mitochondria where most other BCL-2 family proteins appear to function. Here, we have shown that the C-terminal TM domain of BNIP3 can target a BCL-2 family protein (BHRF1) and a heterologous protein (GFP) to mitochondria. Although the cellular protein BNIP1 is not characterized here, based on the subcellular localization dictated by the C-terminal trans-membrane domain, we believe that it may also function at locales (nuclear envelope and mitochondria) where other BCL-2 family proteins function. Among the two TM domains we have studied here, it appears that the TM domain of BNIP3 is efficient in mitochondrial targeting, whereas the TM domains of BCL-2 and BNIP1 appear to target GFP to both the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum regions and mitochondria. It appears that in addition to the TM domains of certain BCL-2 family proteins, other internal sequences may also play a role in subcellular targeting. For example, BCL-2 mutants lacking the TM domain appear to be fully functional under certain assay conditions while a comparable mutant that also lacks the internal non-conserved region has been shown to be functionally defective (20Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the GFP/BNIP3-TM and GFP/BNIP1-TM exhibit similar subcellular localization patterns as the native BNIP1 and BNIP3 proteins (3Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), it appears that the TM domains of these proteins may alone be sufficient for subcellular targeting. Several recent studies have revealed that both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins modulate mitochondrial functions (for review, see Ref. 38Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar).

We report here that p38 is specifically activated by signals that lead to interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in T lymphocytes. A p38 activator MKK6 was also markedly activated by the same stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, as well as expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MKK6, suppressed the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter. We also demonstrated that MKK7, a recently described MAPK kinase family member, plays a major role in the activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in T lymphocytes. Moreover, a dominant-negative mutant of MKK7 abrogated the transcriptional activation of the distal nuclear factor of activated T cells response element in the IL-2 promoter. Cyclosporin A, a potent immunosuppressant, inhibited activation of both p38 and SAPK/JNK pathways but not the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Our results indicate that both MKK6 to p38 and MKK7 to SAPK/JNK signaling pathways are activated in a cyclosporin A-sensitive manner and contribute to IL-2 gene expression in T lymphocytes. p38/CSBP, a subgroup member of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily molecules, is known to be activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses.

This pathway consists of three protein kinases, MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK kinase; MAPKK kinase phosphorylates and activates MAPKK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (1Cobb M.H.

Three distinct subgroups of the MAPK superfamily have been identified in mammalian cells (7Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). These are classical MAPK (also termed extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, ERK), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK; also termed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)), and p38 (also termed MPK2, RK, CSBP, or HOG1). Studies on the MAPK/ERK and SAPK/JNK subgroups have led to insights into their physiological functions (8Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). For example, previous studies have implicated a role of MAPK/ERK and SAPK/JNK in activation of T lymphocytes leading to interleukin-2 (IL-2) production (9Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M.

Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It has been shown that p38 is activated by proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α) and cellular stresses (e.g. osmotic shock and ultraviolet light) (14Han J. Lee J.-D.

Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). However, its role in T lymphocyte activation has been unclear. IL-2 production, which is a critical step for T lymphocyte activation and proliferation, requires two coordinate signals; the primary stimulus is the interaction of antigen with the T cell receptor (TCR)·CD3 complex (21Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar), and the secondary stimulus, called costimulation, is generated by the interaction of CD28 auxiliary receptors on T cells with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells (22Schwartz R.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 1065-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Various studies indicate that activation signals for IL-2 production can be bypassed by phorbol esters (such as TPA) and Ca2+ionophore (such as A23187) (23Koyasu S. Suzuki G. Asano Y. Osawa H. Diamantstein T. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4689-4695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Crabtree G.R.

Several lines of evidence for involvement of p38 and SAPK/JNK in IL-2 gene expression are presented. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml kanamycin, and 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human CD3 (NU-T3) and human CD28 (KOLT-2) were purchased from Nichirei. PD98059, SB203580, and CsA were purchased from New England Biolabs, Calbiochem,and Wako, respectively. mAb NU-T3 (5 μg) was immobilized on a 35-mm dish by incubation for 12 h at 4 °C. mAb KOLT-2 (5 μg) was preincubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C to induce cross-linking and then was added to Jurkat cells (2 × 106), or cells were stimulated with various reagents such as TPA (Sigma) and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Wako). After a 24-h treatment of Jurkat cells with various stimuli, IL-2 production was measured using ELISA (Endogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following stimulation, cells were washed once with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline and then lysed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmEGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% aprotinin and were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 30 min at 2 °C. The supernatant (approximately 0.1 mg/ml cellular protein) was subjected to in-gel kinase assays or immune complex kinase assays. Immunoprecipitation and immune complex kinase assays were performed as described previously (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Matsuda S. Kawasaki H. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

To assay for p38 activity, p38 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates in the presence of 0.1% SDS and assayed for kinase activity using ATF-2 as a substrate. Anti-SEK1 (36Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies were previously produced and characterized. pME-MKK6, an expression plasmid for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MKK6 under a control of the SRα promoter, has previously been characterized (28Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative MKK6 (MKK6(AA)) was constructed by replacing Ser-207 and Thr-211 with alanine residues. The mutation was made by site-directed mutagenesis (Quick ChangeTM, Stratagene) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. An HA-tagged kinase-negative MKK7 (MKK7(KL)), constructed by replacing ATP-binding lysine with leucine residue, has previously been reported (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the human IL-2 enhancer/promoter element (encompassing nucleotides −326 to +47), IL-2-Luc, was kindly provided by Dr. M. Iwashima (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation Yokohama Research Center, Japan). Another luciferase reporter plasmid with three tandem repeats of the NFAT site, NFAT-Luc (37Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Transient transfection of Jurkat cells (5 × 106) was performed using SuperFectTM (Qiagen) with luciferase reporter plasmids (either 1 μg of IL-2-Luc or 0.5 μg of NFAT-Luc) along with various amounts of expression plasmids. The total amount of DNA transfected was maintained at 5 μg with pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were stimulated for 8 h with indicated reagents and then lysed for luciferase assay. Luciferase in cell lysates was measured in duplicate by a luminometer (LB9507, Berthold), using a luciferase assay system (Promega). The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and used for normalization of the luciferase assays. Expression of HA-tagged proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 mouse mAb against the HA epitope. In a human T cell line, Jurkat, the activity of p38 markedly increased in response to signals generated by TPA and Ca2+ ionophore, whereas each stimulus alone resulted in little or no activation (Fig.1 A, shaded bar). Similar to its effect on IL-2 production (37Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CsA inhibited the activation of p38 (Fig. 1 A, shaded bar). SAPK/JNK was also activated in a similar manner as reported previously (Fig. 1 A, black bar (9Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar)). In contrast, incubation with TPA was sufficient for efficient activation of MAPK/ERK, which was neither enhanced by Ca2+ ionophore nor inhibited by CsA (Fig. 1 A, white bar). Interestingly, treatment with TPA and Ca2+ionophore did not induce the activation of p38 in non-lymphoid cells such as an epidermoid carcinoma cell line, KB (data not shown). We next examined whether MKK6, an upstream activator of p38 (27Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is activated in parallel with p38 activation during T cell activation. Whereas TPA alone had little effect on MKK6 activity, it induced marked activation of MKK6 in combination with Ca2+ ionophore (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, CsA inhibited the activation of MKK6 as observed in the p38 activation (Fig. 1 B). Although treatment with Ca2+ ionophore alone induced slight activation of MKK6 in the Jurkat cells used here (Fig. 1 B), this is not the case with another Jurkat line, TAg Jurkat (data not shown). The reason for this inconsistency remains to be determined. Whereas incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 mAb alone had little effect on either p38 activity or MKK6 activity, simultaneous incubation with both mAbs resulted in synergistic activation of both MKK6 and p38 and IL-2 production (Fig. 1 C). Activation of MKK6 and p38 induced by simultaneous stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs was also inhibited by CsA (data not shown). One of the MAPKKs, SEK1 (also termed as MKK4 or JNKK) has previously been reported to function as a direct activator of SAPK/JNK (19Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 39Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In addition to SEK1, we have previously identified an activity to phosphorylate and activate SAPK distinct from SEK1 (36Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This novel kinase has been identified by cDNA cloning and named MKK7 (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus examined whether SEK1 or MKK7 plays a major role in SAPK/JNK activation during T cell activation. Whereas incubation of Jurkat cells with either anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 mAb alone had a weak effect on MKK7 activity, simultaneous incubation with both mAbs resulted in strong synergistic activation of MKK7, which was inhibited in the presence of CsA (Fig.2 A). SEK1 activity was only slightly activated in response to TPA and Ca2+ ionophore, whereas activation of MKK7 activity was more prominent to the same stimulation (Fig. 2 B), which was also sensitive to CsA (data not shown). Note that both SEK1 and MKK7 activities markedly increased when Jurkat cells were exposed to hyperosmolar media as expected (Fig.2 B) (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in mouse thymocytes (Fig. 2 C) and splenic T cells (data not shown). These results suggest that MKK7 acts as a major upstream activator of SAPK/JNK during T cell activation, as is the case with tumor necrosis factor-α and Fas signaling pathway (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that SAPK/JNK activation is not induced in thymocytes of SEK1-deficient mice in response to TPA and Ca2+ ionophore (42Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 43Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveria-dos-Santos A.J.

Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The activation pathway of SAPK/JNK might be developmentally regulated such that SEK1 but not MKK7 activates SAPK/JNK in the thymus. Functions of SEK1 and MKK7 in SAPK/JNK pathway in thymocytes remain to be investigated in further studies. Activation of MAPK/ERK alone was not sufficient to induce IL-2 production (Fig. 1 A) (9Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of MAPK/ERK in IL-2 production directly, we employed PD98059, a specific inhibitor of classical MAPKK (also termed as MEK) (44Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar, 45Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, preincubation with PD98059 prevented IL-2 production induced by simultaneous stimulation with TPA and Ca2+ ionophore in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of PD98059, which inhibits IL-2 production by 50% in Jurkat cells (<5 μm), is similar to that inhibiting activation of MAPKK/MEK in vitro and in vivo (44Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). We also found that IL-2 production induced by stimulation via CD3 and CD28 was almost completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 20 μm PD98059 (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, prevention of MAPK/ERK activation resulted in the suppression of IL-2 promoter-driven transcriptional activity (data not shown (46Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar)). It is noteworthy that preteatment of the cells with 20 μmPD98059 did not prevent the activation of SAPK/JNK or p38 (data not shown). These results clearly indicated that the activation of MAPK/ERK pathway is required for IL-2 production. To evaluate the biological significance of p38 activation in T lymphocytes, we examined the effect of SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor for p38 (47Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar, 48Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), on the IL-2 promoter-driven transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 4 A, pretreatment of the Jurkat cells with SB203580 resulted in the reduction of IL-2 promoter-driven luciferase (IL-2-Luc) activity in a dose-dependent manner. IL-2 production induced by simultaneous stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs was also inhibited by SB203580 by 50% (data not shown). We further investigated the effect of SB203580 on the transcriptional activation driven by the distal NFAT site in the IL-2 promoter, which is essential for full transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene (for review see Ref. 49Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). NFAT-driven luciferase (NFAT-Luc) (37Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activity was increased after stimulation with TPA and Ca2+ ionophore as previously shown (50Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and pretreatment of the cells with SB203580 led to marked reduction of luciferase activity (Fig. 4 B). The same concentration of SB203580 used in this study does not inhibit the activity of SAPK/JNK or MAPK/ERK (Refs. 47Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar and 48Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar and data not shown). Furthermore, high concentrations of SB203580 (up to 10 μm) had little effect on SV40 promoter-driven luciferase activity (data not shown). The specificity of SB203580 indicates that the prevention of the IL-2 gene expression resulted from the blockade of p38 activity. To further elucidate whether the p38 signaling pathway functions in the IL-2 gene expression, we examined the effect of a dominant-negative form of MKK6 (27Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), referred to here as MKK6(AA). The expression of MKK6(AA) reduced the NFAT-Luc activity (Fig.4 C) and the IL-2-Luc activity (data not shown) induced by TPA and Ca2+ ionophore (Fig. 4 C) and by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (data not shown), whereas the expression of wild type MKK6 slightly increased the NFAT-Luc activity (Fig.4 C). These data clearly indicate that p38 is significantly involved in the signaling pathway leading to IL-2 gene expression. It was noted that neither SB203580 nor MKK6(AA) showed complete inhibition of the NFAT- or IL-2-Luc activity. It is possible that recently identified molecules, SAPK3 and SAPK4 (51Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 52Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), which are resistant to SB203580 treatment, might contribute to the residual transcriptional activity in the presence of SB203580. This possibility seems unlikely, however, since a dominant-negative mutant of MKK6, which can also function upstream of SAPK3 and SAPK4, had the same effect as SB203580 as shown in Fig. 4 C. One possibility is that p38 and SAPK/JNK exhibit redundant functions in vivo. To test this possibility, the roles of MKK7 and SAPK/JNK in the signaling pathway leading to IL-2 gene expression were examined. We employed a kinase-negative mutant of MKK7 (referred to here as MKK7(KL)), which can inhibit the activation of SAPK/JNK induced by tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, the expression of MKK7(KL) resulted in the inhibition of the NFAT-Luc activity induced by TPA and Ca2+ ionophore (Fig.4 D) and by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (data not shown) in a dose-dependent manner. In this case, too, MKK7(KL) showed only partial inhibition of the NFAT-Luc activity. We thus evaluated the effect of SB203580 on the NFAT-Luc activity in MKK7(KL)-transfected Jurkat cells. Interestingly, a blockade of both signaling pathways further reduced the NFAT-Luc activity to near basal level (Fig. 4 E). It is therefore likely that the MKK6 to p38 and the MKK7 to SAPK/JNK cascades comprise redundant signaling pathways leading to the IL-2 gene expression. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that p38 and SAPK/JNK have a similar specificity of substrate recognition in vitro, although MAPK/ERK displays a distinct substrate selectivity (26Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 53Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 54Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Further studies on downstream targets of p38 and SAPK/JNK in T lymphocytes should elucidate mechanisms by which the p38 signaling pathway affects IL-2 production. It has been widely accepted that CsA binds to cytosolic protein, cyclophilin, and that the CsA-cyclophilin complex blocks the IL-2 production by inhibiting the activity of Ca2+calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (55McKeon F. Cell. 1991; 66: 823-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,56Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). We found that activation of MKK7 and MKK6, but not MAPKK/MEK, was inhibited by CsA (Fig. 1 B, Fig. 2, and data not shown). It is possible that calcineurin positively regulates the activity of MKK7 and MKK6 through a mechanism yet to be determined. Alternatively, CsA-cyclophilin complex may directly inactivate an upstream activator of these MAPKKs. Nevertheless, current studies show that the signaling pathways mediated by SAPK/JNK and p38/CSBP could be alternative targets of CsA. Precise mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CsA on SAPK/JNK and p38/CSBP are now under investigation. We are grateful to Dr. Y. Gotoh for the initial involvement in this study. We are grateful to Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University) and Dr. M. Iwashima (Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) for NFAT-Luc and IL-2-Luc, respectively. We thank Dr. S. Yonehara (Kyoto University) for critical reading of the manuscript, A. Minowa for technical support, and members of the Nishida laboratory for helpful discussion."

In addition, elevated serum levels of MRP8 and MRP14 have been found in patients suffering from a number of inflammatory disorders including cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic bronchitis (10Wilson G.B.

Jonsson R. Haga H.J. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting possible extracellular roles for these proteins. In the new S100 protein nomenclature, MRP8 and MRP14 are designated as S100A8 and S100A9, respectively (14Schäfer B.W. Wicki R. Engelkamp D. Mattei M.G. Heizmann C.W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Other names for the MRP8/MRP14 complex include calprotectin (15Steinbakk M. Naess-Andresen C.F. Lingaas E. Dale I.

Methods. 1986; 91: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Some evidence suggests that MRP14 alone is the cystic fibrosis antigen (19Murao S. Collart F.R. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8356-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and murine MRP8 has been referred to as the murine chemotactic cytokine (CP-10) (20Lackmann M. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7499-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that MRP8 and MRP14 form a heterodimeric complex in a calcium-dependent manner (21Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, once this complex is formed, it is stable upon the addition of EDTA (22Klempt M. Melkonyan H. Nacken W. Wiesmann D. Holtkemper U. Sorg C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these proteins have independent biological functions or whether their function is strictly dependent on heterocomplex formation. Although the general consensus is that protein function is dependent on heterodimer formation, studies also support the possibility that these proteins may have individual functions. For example, MRP14 is shown to be expressed independently of MRP8 in acutely inflamed tissues (23Delabie J. de Wolf-Peeters C. van Den Oord J.J. Desmet V.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwaldo-Klarwasser G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus-Hager G. Sorg C. Eur. J.

Like a number of other S100 proteins (S100α, S100D, S100E, S100L, p11, CAPL, calcyclin/2A9, and psoriasin), the genes encoding MRP8 and MRP14 have been located on chromosome 1q21 (11van Heyningen V. Hayward C. Fletcher J. McAuley C. Nature. 1985; 315: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the structure of the gene loci encoding S100 proteins is highly conserved (28Zimmer D.B. Chessher J. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the primary protein sequences are similar, there is less similarity at the nucleotide level, with the greatest divergence in the untranslated regions. Since S100 proteins exhibit very specific patterns of expression, it has been suggested that these untranslated regions may be involved in directing the expression of specific S100 proteins in specific cell types (28Zimmer D.B. Chessher J. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequences of MRP8 and MRP14 indicate that each protein is composed of two EF-hand domains characteristic of the S100 calcium-binding protein family (27Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 29Potts B.C.M. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Google Scholar, 30Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). S100 proteins are characterized by relatively low molecular masses, generally on the order of 10 kDa, and a unique consensus sequence in their calcium-binding sites making them a diverse, multifaceted family of proteins (31Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 297-490PubMed Google Scholar). They have been shown to play roles in cell cycle progression, regulation of intracellular phosphorylation events, and cytoskeletal membrane interactions, as well as extracellular events such as the stimulation of glial proliferation, prolactin secretion, and neuronal differentiation (30Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 32Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). MRP8 and MRP14 have molecular masses of 11 and 14 kDa and are composed of 93 and 114 amino acids, respectively. A number of possible functions for these proteins have been proposed including differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, regulation of intracellular calcium levels in neutrophils, inhibition of casein kinase I and II activity, and a zinc-mediated biostatic activity (19Murao S. Collart F.R. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8356-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1995; 42: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The extended carboxyl-terminal tail of MRP14 makes it the largest member of the S100 family, and it is believed that MRP14 represents the regulatory unit of this unique heterodimeric complex. Studies have shown that the penultimate amino acid of MRP14, Thr113, is phosphorylatedin vivo (8Edgeworth J. Freemont P. Hogg N. Nature. 1989; 342: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Guignard F. Mauël J. Markert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the phosphorylation event triggers the translocation of this protein to the cytoskeleton (36van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar). Possible functions for the tail of MRP14 may include neutrophil immobilization (37Watt K.W.K. Brightman I.L. Goetzl E.J. Immunology. 1983; 48: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of cytoskeletal translocation of the MRP8/MRP14 complex (36van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of the onset of the intrinsic coagulation cascade (38Hessian P.A. Wilkinson L. Hogg N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The only function assigned to MRP8 to date is the potent chemotactic activity assigned to linker region of murine MRP8 (20Lackmann M. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7499-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,39Lackmann M. Rajasekariah P. Iismaa S.E. Jones G. Cornish C.J. Hu S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J.

Acta. 1996; 1313: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the roles MRP8 and MRP14 play in the developmental stages of inflammatory responses, we have cloned these two proteins and developed highly efficient expression and purification protocols. This has allowed for biophysical characterization by UV, CD, fluorescence, and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopies, as well as chemical cross-linking experiments. MRP8 and MRP14 are shown to be stable globular proteins that form dimers and preferentially associate as heterodimers. The MRP8 and MRP14 cDNAs were a generous gift of Professor Clemens Sorg (University of Münster, Germany). The primers MRP8–5′ (5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GTT GAC CGA GCT GGA GAA-3′) and MRP8–3′ (5′-CGG GAT CCC ACT CTT TGT GGC TTT CTT C-3′) were used to PCR amplify the human MRP8 gene from the pMRP-8-trp expression vector, and the primers MRP14–5′ (5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GAC TTG CAA AAT GTC GCA G-3′) and MRP14–3′ (5′-CGG GAT CCT TAG GGG GTG CCC TCC CC-3′) were used to amplify the human MRP14 gene from the pMRP-14-trp expression vector. ANdeI restriction site was engineered into the 5′-primers, and a BamHI restriction site was engineered into the 3′-primers for proper insertion of the gene into the pET1120 expression vector. Amplification was conducted in a total volume of 100 μl containing 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25 °C), 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2.0 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm dNTPs, 5.0 units of vent DNA polymerase, and 100 pmol of primers. A small amount of mineral oil was added to the top of the reaction mixture to inhibit evaporation. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25–30 cycles of 95, 60, and 75 °C for 30 s each and a final extension at 75 °C for 2 min. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Full-length oligonucleotides were doubly digested with 20 units BamHI and 40 units NdeI for 2 h at 37 °C. The digested fragments were purified on a 1.3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The bands containing the MRP8 and MRP14 genes were excised and purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit. The MRP8 and MRP14 genes were then cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET1120 vector using standard methods (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pET1120 vector was created by isolating the two BamHI/PstI fragments of Novagen's pET11 and pET20 vectors and ligating the large fragment of pET20 digestion with the small fragment of pET11 digestion. These plasmids have the β-lactamase gene and multiple cloning sites downstream of the efficient T7-polymerase promoter but are void of thelac repressor gene. Competent DH5α cells were transformed with the pET1120-MRP8wt and pET1120-MRP14wt vectors and used to produce plasmid stocks. Proper insertion and DNA sequences were confirmed by fluorescent thermal dye DNA sequencing methods (43Trower M.K. Burt D. Purvis I.J. Dykes C.W. Christodoulou C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2348-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To construct the MRP8C42S gene, the primers, MRP8C42S-5′ (5′-CTC GGT CTC GAG CAA TTT CTT C-3′) and MRP8–5′ were used to PCR amplify the 5′-half of the MRP8C42S gene, and the primers MRP8C42S-3′ (5′-TTG CTC GAG ACC GAG TCT CCT CAG TAT ATC-3′) and MRP8–3′ were used to PCR amplify the 3′-half of the MRP8C42S gene. The two amplified half-fragments were purified on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide. The bands containing the two fragments were excised and purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). The two purified half-fragments were used as primers for each other, and the full gene was made using the PCR methods described above. Since this did not result in the amplification of the entire gene, a small aliquot of the above reaction mixture, which had small amounts of the full-length mutant gene, was used as a template to PCR amplify the full-length MRP8C42S gene using MRP8–5′ and MRP8–3′ as the amplification primers. To construct the MRP14C3S gene, the primers MRP14C3S-5′ (5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GAC TAG TAA AAT GTC GCA GCT GG-3′) and MRP14–3′ were used with the wild-type template in one PCR step. Transformation and sequencing of mutants were performed as described for the wild-type proteins. Overexpression of the gene products was achieved in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). For unlabeled protein, cells were grown at 37 °C in (2× YT) media supplemented with ampicillin to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. 500-ml cultures were inoculated with 5 ml of an overnight culture grown in the same media. Cells were allowed to grow another 18–24 h before harvesting. Since the pET1120 plasmid contains no lac repressor gene, protein expression was not tightly controlled, and the system was leaky enough to produce large amounts of protein in rich media without the need for induction. For 15N-labeled protein, cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal media supplemented with basal medium Eagle vitamin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source, and glucose as the carbon source. Ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. 5-ml inoculants were grown overnight, and inoculated cultures were allowed to grow to anA 600 between 0.1 and 0.5 before induction with isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.05 mm. Cells were grown an additional 24 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested and inclusion bodies were isolated following methods described by Sambrook et al. (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pellet containing the inclusion bodies was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, 20 mm dithiothreitol at pH 8.0 in a volume sufficient to completely dissolve the pellet. These protein solutions were dialyzed for 4 days against 2 × 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA, pH 8.0, in 3.5-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane. The dialyzed solutions were centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 20 min and then filtered through a 0.2 μm acrodisc syringe filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) prior to further purification. The MRPs were isolated by preparative reverse-phase HPLC on a DeltaPak C18 column (PrepPak 500 cartridge, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using a gradient of 36–51% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min. Fractions containing protein were lyophilized and then dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Perceptive Biosystems BioCAD Sprint perfusion chromatography system using a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1.0 mmEDTA/EGTA, pH 8.0, with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. All buffers used in the purification of wild-type proteins contained 20 mm dithiothreitol to inhibit disulfide bond formation. Fractions containing protein were desalted and concentrated using Millipore Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter devices (5-kDa cut-off). Extinction coefficients were determined from 1 mg/ml samples of MRP8C42S and MRP14C3S by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a Multiphor II isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Servalyt Precote polyacrylamide gels (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) and a Pharmalyte 3–10 broad pI calibration kit. Sample volumes were 5 μl at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. The maximum power was set to 4 watts, and the initial voltage was set to 200 V. Focusing continued until a maximum voltage of 2000 V was reached. Gels were fixed for 10 min in a 20% solution of trichloroactetic acid, stained with SERVA Blue W dye tablets for 5 min with constant shaking, and destained in H2O until background color was at an acceptable level. Isoelectric points were determined by plotting the retention versus isoelectric point of known standards. The analysis of MRP8/MRP14 complex formation was carried out by using the bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) method described by Teigelkamp et al. (21Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant MRP8 and MRP14 were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 8.5 to a final concentration of 50 μm. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of freshly prepared bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (20 mm stock solution) to a final concentration of 5 mm. Solutions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of 1 m Tris to quench the reaction. Cross-linked samples were incubated with β-mercaptoethanol prior to visualization on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Circular dichroism experiments were carried out on an Aviv 61DS spectropolarimeter with 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Protein solutions (20 μm MRP8C42S, 20 μm MRP14C3S, and 10 μm MRP8C42S plus 10 μm MRP14C3S) were prepared in 1 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. The solution was brought to 2.5 mm CaCl2, to obtain the spectra of the calcium-loaded state. Spectra were collected with an average time of 3 s for each point and a step size of 0.50 nm from 200 to 260 nm. All spectra were collected in triplicate and background-corrected against a buffer blank. A perl program (leastellip.pl) was written to determine the optimal least squares fit. 2This program is available on the World Wide Web at chazin.scripps.edu/wisdom. Data were converted to mean residue ellipticity [θ] m (degrees cm2dmol−1) by using [θ] m = θ/(10lcn), where θ is the measured ellipticity, l is the cell path length in cm, c is the molar concentration of protein in mol/liter, and n is the number of residues/chain. The α-helical content was estimated by using the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (44Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations (20–25 μm) were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Measurements of the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were conducted at 25 °C on a SLM-AMINCO Series 2 Spectrofluorometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard Pavilion 5040 personal computer. Excitation spectra were measured from 250 to 320 nm with emission monitored at 335 nm. Scans were performed at 1 nm/s with the excitation and emission band pass set at 16 and 4 nm, respectively. Emission spectra were measured from 300 to 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Scans were performed at 1 nm/s with the excitation and emission band pass set at 4 nm. Each 1.5-ml sample contained 5 μm total protein (MRP8C42S, MRP14C3S, or a 1:1 mixture) in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA at pH 8.5. For the calcium-loaded state, 1m CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm. All samples were preequilibrated overnight prior to the fluorescence measurements. Each experiment was collected in triplicate, and a perl program (leastgen.pl) was written to fit the data using a least squares algorithm.2 Wild type and mutant protein samples were dissolved and concentrated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mmEDTA/EGTA, at pH 8.5. For NMR samples of wild-type protein, deuterated dithiothreitol was also added to a final concentration of 5.0 mm. Pure 2H2O was added to a final concentration of 10% for the spectrometer lock system. Spectra were recorded for the following samples: 15N-MRP8wt,15N-MRP8wt + MRP14C3S, 15N-MRP8C42S + MRP14C3S,15N-MRP14wt, MRP8C42S + 15N-MRP14wt, and MRP8C42S + 15N-MRP14C3S. The mixtures were made up in a 1:1.2 ratio of labeled to unlabeled protein (0.75–1.0 mmfinal concentration). All NMR experiments were performed at 27 °C on a Bruker AMX500 operating at 499.87 MHz for 1H and 50.65 MHz for15N. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional data were recorded using the method of States et al. (45States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the H2O peak at 4.75 ppm, and the 15N shifts were referenced indirectly using the 1H frequency of the H2O resonance (46Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). The15N-1H HSQC spectra (47Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) were recorded with 16 transients/increment, a total of 128 complex points int 1 and 512 points in t 2, and spectral widths of 1500.15 Hz in ω1 and 4000 Hz in ω2. All two-dimensional data sets were processed on a Sun SPARCstation LX workstation using FELIX (version 95.0; MSI, San Diego, CA.). The model of apo-MRP8/MRP14 was generated using the Homology module of the InsightII package (MSI, San Diego, CA), based on the low resolution structure of the apo state of the related S100 protein calcyclin (29Potts B.C.M. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Google Scholar). Calcyclin is a symmetric homodimer, so the model was created with MRP8 aligned to one subunit and MRP14 aligned to the other. The automated sequence alignment algorithm in the software was used to define the conserved regions of MRP8 and MRP14. Residues 1–42 and 51–88 of MRP8 were assigned to residues 1–42 and 53–90 of calcyclin, respectively, and residues 4–45 and 57–96 of MRP14 were assigned to residues 1′–42′ and 53′–90′ of calcyclin, respectively. After construction of the conserved regions, the loop or “hinge” regions were generated for residues 43–50 of MRP8 and residues 46–56 of MRP14, and then the model was minimized using 3000 iterations of steepest descents minimization in the Discover module of InsightII. During minimization, the atomic coordinates for residues 1–42 and 51–88 of MRP8 and residues 4–45 and 57–96 of MRP14 were held fixed. The ω angles within the hinge regions of MRP8 (residues 43–50) and MRP14 (residues 46–56) and the tail region of MRP14 (residues 97–114) were constrained to −180° throughout the minimization process. The model was considered sufficiently minimized when no van der Waals violations were detected. In order to obtain sufficient quantities of protein for biophysical characterization and structure/function studies, the cDNA containing the entire coding sequence for human MRP8 and MRP14 was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET1120. This expression vector was previously shown to efficiently overexpress the very closely related S100 protein calcyclin. 3M. Lubienski, J. Glasser, and W. J. Chazin, unpublished results. The cDNAs were engineered with 5′ NdeI restriction sites and 3′BamHI restriction sites for facile insertion into the expression vector downstream of the efficient T7 polymerase promoter. All gene sequences were confirmed by standard DNA sequencing methods. MRP8 and MRP14 each contain a single cysteine residue. To avoid problems associated with the formation of unwanted disulfide bonds, the MRP8C42S and MRP14C3S mutant genes were also constructed and inserted into the pET1120 expression vector. DNA sequencing showed that the gene encoding MRP14C3S had a single base pair mutation (G to A) at position 318. However, both codons (AAG, AAA) code for the amino acid lysine, making this a silent mutation. The expression vectors containing the cDNA for MRP8wt, MRP8C42S, MRP14wt, and MRP14C3S were used to transform the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21(DE3). In rich media, BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the expression plasmids overexpressed proteins that migrated in SDS gels with apparent molecular masses of 8 kDa (MRP8wt, MRP8C42S) or 14 kDa (MRP14wt, MRP14C3S). Overexpression of MRP8 and MRP14 proved not to be detrimental to the bacteria, presumably because the proteins formed inclusion bodies (Fig.1). Since these plasmids do not carry thelac repressor gene, high level expression of these proteins in rich (2× YT) media was attained without the need for induction. However, in M9 minimal media, protein expression was enhanced considerably after induction with isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside. In minimal media, cells were grown from mid- to late log phase and induced with isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside and then grown an additional 24 h before harvesting. Approximately 100 mg of crude protein could be obtained from 1-liter cultures in 2× YT media, whereas expression levels dropped to nearly half in minimal media. Since tens of milligrams of purified, isotopically enriched protein is necessary for multidimensional NMR studies, the cost effectiveness of different carbon sources on expression levels in minimal media were explored. The choice of carbon sources (glycerol or glucose) made little difference to the overall expression le"
https://openalex.org/W2055585878,"Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene account for approximately 50% of the cases of autosomal dominant, early onset, inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PS-1 is an integral membrane protein expressed in neurons and is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PS-1 mutations may promote neuronal degeneration by altering the processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and/or by engaging apoptotic pathways. Alternative processing of APP in AD may increase production of neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and reduce production of the neuroprotective α-secretase-derived form of APP (sAPPα). In differentiated PC12 cells expressing an AD-linked PS-1 mutation (L286V), sAPPα activated the transcription factor NF-κB and prevented apoptosis induced by Aβ. Treatment of cells with κB decoy DNA blocked the antiapoptotic action of sAPPα, demonstrating the requirement for NF-κB activation in the cytoprotective action of sAPPα. Cells expressing mutant PS-1 exhibited an aberrant pattern of NF-κB activity following exposure to Aβ, which was characterized by enhanced early activation of NF-κB followed by a prolonged depression of activity. Blockade of NF-κB activity in cells expressing mutant PS-1 by κB decoy DNA was associated with enhanced Aβ-induced increases of [Ca2+] i and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of cells with sAPPα stabilized [Ca2+] i and mitochondrial function and suppressed oxidative stress by a mechanism involving activation of NF-κB. Blockade of ER calcium release prevented (and stimulation of ER calcium release by thapsigargin induced) apoptosis in cells expressing mutant PS-1, suggesting a pivotal role for ER calcium release in the proapoptotic action of mutant PS-1. Finally, a role for NF-κB in preventing apoptosis induced by ER calcium release was demonstrated by data showing that sAPPα prevents thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, an effect blocked by κB decoy DNA. We conclude that sAPPα stabilizes cellular calcium homeostasis and protects neural cells against the proapoptotic action of mutant PS-1 by a mechanism involving activation of NF-κB. The data further suggest that PS-1 mutations result in aberrant NF-κB regulation that may render neurons vulnerable to apoptosis.

On the other hand, sAPPα stabilizes neuronal calcium homeostasis and protects neurons against excitotoxic, metabolic, and oxidative insults including exposure to Aβ (40Mattson M.P. Cheng B.

Fox M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1882-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that sAPPα induces activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in cultured hippocampal neurons (42Barger S.W. Mattson M.P. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). NF-κB exists in the cytosol as an inducible three-subunit complex consisting of the transcription factor dimer (p50 and p65) and an associated inhibitory subunit called I-κB (43Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation occurs when I-κB is induced to dissociate from the complex, a process that may involve phosphorylation, proteolysis, and/or oxidative damage to I-κB. Recent findings suggest that NF-κB plays an antiapoptotic role in nonneuronal cells (44Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar, 45Wu M. Lee H.

Agents that activate NF-κB (e.g. tumor necrosis factor and ceramide) can prevent cell death induced by excitotoxic, metabolic, and oxidative insults including exposure to Aβ (49Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 50Goodman Y. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), whereas κB decoy DNA (which blocks NF-κB activity) enhances cell death in several paradigms (47Taglialatela G. Robinson R.

Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity may be altered in vulnerable brain regions in AD patients, such that its activity is increased in neurons associated with plaque amyloid (51Terai K. Matsuo A. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1996; 735: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 52Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Volk B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We now report that sAPPα counteracts the proapoptotic actions of mutant PS-1 by activating NF-κB and stabilizing calcium homeostasis. NF-κB appears to interrupt the apoptotic program at an early stage prior to oxyradical production and mitochondrial dysfunction. An abnormal sustained suppression of NF-κB activity following exposure of cells to Aβ occurred in cells overexpressing mutant (but not wild-type) PS-1, suggesting a role for this transcription factor in the pathogenic mechanism of PS-1 mutations. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines stably expressing human wild-type PS-1 and mutant PS-1 (L286V) were established using the “Tet-off” expression system (Promega), where the expression of the transgene is under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive transactivator, as described in detail in our previous studies (28Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For differentiation, cells were maintained in the presence of 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 14 days in RPMI containing 2% bovine serum albumin in the continued presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline; the tetracycline was then removed for 48 h to induce PS-1 expression. Preliminary Western blot analyses demonstrated responsiveness of PS-1 expression to tetracycline withdrawal and that lines expressing wild-type and mutant PS-1 overexpressed the proteins at comparable, moderately high, levels (28Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); two lines overexpressing wild-type PS-1 (PS-1C3 and PS-1C7) and two lines overexpressing the L286V PS-1 mutation (PS1L286VC1 and PS1L286VC9) at similar levels were used in the present study. Synthetic Aβ-(1–42) was synthesized at the University of Kentucky Macromolecular Analysis Facility and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and it was stored lyophilized; a 1 mm stock solution was prepared in sterile deionized water approximately 16 h prior to use. Immediately prior to experimental treatment, the culture medium was switched to Locke's solution, which contained 154 mm NaCl; 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2). Secreted APPα (sAPPα695) was purified from the culture supernatant of human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with the corresponding cDNA constructs as described previously (40Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A. Esch F. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by Western blot analysis and silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Double-stranded κB decoy DNA was prepared by annealing complementary single strands (2 mm each) with the sequences 5′-GAGGGGACTTTCCCT-3′ and 5′-AGGGAAAGTCCCCTC-3′. Nifedipine, sodium dantrolene, and thapsigargin were purchased from Sigma and prepared as 500 × stocks in ethanol. Methods for analysis of apoptosis are detailed in our previous studies (28Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding dyes Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide, and cells were visualized under epifluorescence illumination. Cells with condensed and fragmented (apoptotic) nuclei were counted in four random × 40 fields per culture; counts were made without knowledge of cell line or treatment history. Images of propidium iodide-stained cells were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Molecular Dynamics; 488-nm excitation and 510-nm barrier filter) using a × 60 oil immersion objective. Two methods were employed to assess mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was assessed using the dye rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as described previously (53Mattson M.P. Zhang Y. Bose S. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for 30 min in RPMI 1640, containing 5 μm rhodamine 123, and were then washed with Locke's solution. Cellular fluorescence was imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. Levels of cellular MTT reduction, a measure of mitochondrial energy charge/redox state (54Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), were quantified as described previously (36Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MTT solution (5 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline) was added to cultures (1:10, MTT solution:culture medium, v/v) and allowed to incubate for 3 h. The cells were washed three times with Locke's solution and solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance (592 nm) in each well was quantified using a plate reader. Fluorescence ratio imaging of the calcium indicator dye fura-2 was performed as described previously (37Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mattson M.P. Tomaselli K. Rydel R.E. Brain Res. 1993; 621: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Briefly, following exposure to Aβ, cells were loaded with fura-2 (30-min incubation in the presence of 10 μm fura-2), and maintained in the presence of Aβ and other treatments during imaging. Fluorescence was imaged using a Zeiss AttoFluor system with a × 40 oil objective; the average [Ca2+] i in individual neuronal cell bodies was determined from the ratio of the fluorescence emissions obtained using two different excitation wavelengths (334 and 380 nm). The system was calibrated using solutions containing either no Ca2+ or a saturating level of Ca2+ (1 mm) using the formula [Ca2+] i =K d [(R −R min)/(R max −R)](F o /F s ). Relative levels of cellular peroxides were quantified in individual PC12 cells by confocal laser scanning microscope analysis using the dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes) as described previously (33Goodman Y. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 128: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 50 min in the presence of 50 μm dye and were then washed three times (2 ml/wash) in Locke's solution. Images of cellular fluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Molecular Dynamics) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. The intensity of the laser beam and the sensitivity of the photodetector were held constant to allow quantitative comparisons of relative fluorescence intensity of cells between treatment groups. Cells were located under visible light and scanned only once with the laser to avoid artifacts associated with photo-oxidation. Fluorescence intensities in cell bodies were quantified using Molecular Dynamics “Imagespace” software. These methods were similar to those described previously (46Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 48Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts containing DNA-binding proteins were prepared, and gel shift assays were performed using a commercially available assay kit (Promega). Double-stranded, 32P-labeled DNA (κB consensus sequence 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′; 100,000 cpm) was added to a reaction mixture containing 5 μl nuclease-free water, 2 μl of gel shift binding 5× buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dl-dC)-poly(dl-dC), and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) and 2 μl (5 μg) of cell extract. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature, and then 1 μl of gel loading 10× buffer (40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added. Samples were separated by electrophoresis through a nondenaturing 4% acrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. To demonstrate the specificity of the inducible NF-κB complexes in PC12 cells overexpressing PS-1 mutation detected in gel shift reactions, we performed five reactions: a positive control (where the 32P-labeled specific NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction), a negative control (where no DNA-binding protein extract was added in the binding reaction), a specific competition assay (where an excess of unlabeled specific competitor NF-κB oligonucleotide probe was included in the binding reaction), a mutant κB competition assay (where an excess of unlabeled mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Santa Cruz, CA) was included in the binding reaction), and a nonspecific competition assay (where excess unlabeled noncompetitor AP2 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′ was included in the binding reaction). To further determine the specificity of the gel shift reaction and to examine the possible subunit composition of the inducible NF-κB complexes, we performed supershift experiments using antibody raised against p50 or p65 proteins purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-p50 antibody was rabbit IgG raised against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 350–363 within the nuclear localization signal region of human p50. The anti-p65 antibody was rabbit IgG raised against the N-terminal amino acids 3–19 of the human p65. As a control for p50 and p65 antibodies, extracts of DNA-binding proteins were also incubated in the presence of preimmune rabbit serum. Supershift experiments were performed by adding 1.0 μl of the antibody per 10 μl of reaction volume prior to the addition of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Relative levels of DNA-protein hybrids were quantified by densitometric analysis of scanned gel images using NIH Image 1.47 software. We examined the effects of mutant PS-1 and sAPPα on vulnerability of PC12 cells to apoptosis induced by Aβ (Aβ-(1–42)) using two cell lines overexpressing wild-type human PS-1 (PS-1C3 and PS-1C7), two lines expressing the L286V PS-1 mutation (PS-1L286VC1 and PS-1L286VC9), a vector-transfected control line, and the untransfected parent cell line. Preliminary Western blot analysis showed that levels of overexpression of wild-type and mutant PS-1 48 h following withdrawal of tetracycline were similar in the selected cell lines under the conditions employed (data not shown;cf. Ref. 28Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal levels of apoptosis in the various cell lines ranged from 1 to 4% (Fig. 1). In previous concentration-effect studies, we found that an Aβ-(1–42) concentration of 50 μm reliably induced a moderate level of apoptosis in untransfected PC12 cells during 24–48-h exposure periods (28Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to 50 μm Aβ for 48 h induced apoptosis in 30–40% of cells in control PC12 cell lines and lines expressing wild-type PS-1; apoptosis was significantly enhanced (to 60–70%) in lines expressing mutant PS-1 (Figs. 1 and2). Mutations in APP responsible for some inherited forms of AD may promote neuronal degeneration by increasing levels of neurotoxic Aβ and/or by decreasing production of sAPPα, which has been shown to protect neurons against excitotoxic and oxidative insults (for a review, see Ref. 31Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). When cell lines were pretreated for 24 h with 10 nm sAPPα, there was a highly significant suppression of Aβ-induced apoptosis in both control lines and lines expressing mutant PS-1 (Fig. 1).Figure 2Confocal laser scanning microscope images of PC12 cells (expressing mutant PS-1) stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding dye propidium iodide. The DNA in cells in control cultures and cultures pretreated with sAPPα and then exposed to Aβ for 48 h is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus (arrowhead), whereas the DNA is condensed and fragmented 48 h following exposure to 50 μm Aβ alone and in cultures pretreated with decoy DNA plus sAPPα and then exposed to Aβ (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W2086966984,"The hect domain protein family was originally identified by sequence similarity of its members to the C-terminal region of E6-AP, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Since the C terminus of E6-AP mediates thioester complex formation with ubiquitin, a necessary intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination, it was proposed that members of the hect domain family in general have E3 activity. The hect domain is approximately 350 amino acids in length, and we show here that the hect domain of E6-AP is necessary and sufficient for ubiquitin thioester adduct formation. Furthermore, the human genome encodes at least 20 different hect domain proteins, and in further support of the hypothesis that hect domain proteins represent a family of E3s, several of these are shown to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin. In addition, some hect domain proteins interact preferentially with UbcH5, whereas others interact with UbcH7, indicating that human hect domain proteins can be grouped into at least two classes based on their E2 specificity. Since E3s are thought to play a major role in substrate recognition, the presence of a large family of E3s should contribute to ensure the specificity and selectivity of ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathways.

Ubiquitin-dependent degradation operates through a two step mechanism (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Ciechanover A.

Firstly, ubiquitin is covalently attached to a substrate protein. Ubiquitin itself can then serve as a substrate for ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitination) which results in the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Finally, ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome or, as shown for some membrane proteins, internalized and degraded via the lysosomal pathway (6Hicke L. Riezman H.

Ubiquitination of proteolytic substrates requires the concerted action of ubiquitin-activating enzymes E1, 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; SCF, SKP1, CDC53,F-box protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPV, human papillomavirus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2, and probably in most cases, ubiquitin-protein ligases E3 (1Ciechanover A.

First, ubiquitin is activated at the expense of ATP and is covalently linked to E1 via a thioester bond. Ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 to an E2, preserving the high energy thioester bond. Finally, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate protein is catalyzed by the E2s, often in conjunction with an E3. Although the mechanisms of substrate recognition are still poorly understood, this sequential mode of ubiquitin transfer indicates that E2s and, in particular, E3s play a major role in mediating substrate recognition. Based on their mode of action, E3s can be classified into two categories. Some E3s may function as docking proteins by binding specifically to substrate proteins and E2s, thereby allowing E2s to ubiquitinate substrate proteins. Such E3s may be represented by the recently identified SCF complexes (9Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 10Feldman R.M. Corell C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). SCF complexes consist of CDC53, SKP1, and one of a number of F-box proteins (e.g.Cdc4, Grr1) (11Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), which appear to determine the substrate specificity of the respective SCF complex (9Skowyra D. Craig K.L.

Furthermore, SCF complexes have been shown to cooperate with the E2 UBC3/Cdc34 in the ubiquitination of substrate proteins. Other E3s appear to directly catalyze the attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate protein, since some E3s are loaded with ubiquitin by E2s via thioester formation. E3s with thioester-forming capacity include yeast UBR1 (5Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), mammalian E6-AP (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and presumably the members of an E6-AP-related family of putative E3s termed hect domain proteins (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 13Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Members of this family have been described in all eukaryotes examined and are characterized by a C-terminal region of approximately 350 amino acids in length, the hect domain (homologous to E6-AP C terminus). E6-AP was originally identified as a protein that is required for ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor protein p53 induced by the E6 oncoprotein of HPVs associated with cervical cancer (14Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4129-4135Crossref Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 15Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that E6-AP has the function of an E3 (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that E6-AP forms thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and distinct E2s, and the position of the putative catalytic site cysteine residue was mapped to the C terminus (12Scheffner M.

The position of this cysteine residue as well as of several surrounding residues is highly conserved among hect domain proteins, suggesting that these proteins in general share the ability to form ubiquitin thioester adducts. In support of this hypothesis, three hect domain proteins from three different organisms,Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSP5, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pub1, and a rat 100-kDa protein have been shown to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin (13Huibregtse J.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The turnover of many cellular proteins appears to involve ubiquitin-dependent pathways, indicating that a cell contains a number of different E3s with different substrate specificities. Indeed, the genome of S. cerevisiae encodes for five hect domain proteins (4Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar), of which two (RSP5, UFD4) have been shown to be involved in the degradation of natural as well as of artificial substrate proteins (18Hein C. Springael J.-Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 19Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here we report that the minimal domain of E6-AP and RSP5 required for ubiquitin thioester formation coincides with the size of the hect domain. Based on this information, data base searches revealed that the human genome encodes at least 20 different hect domain proteins. Ubiquitin thioester complex formation assays show that human hect domain proteins can be classified into two groups based on their preference for distinct E2s. Finally, generation of chimeric proteins between E6-AP and other hect domain proteins indicates that hect domains are not freely interchangeable but rather that a given hect domain has to be in a proper structural context to induce ubiquitination of associated proteins. The p53 plasmid for in vitrotranscription and translation has been described previously (21Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding the various N-terminal-truncated E6-AP forms, the N-terminal-truncated forms of RSP5, and the hect domains of seven different human hect domain proteins were constructed by ligating PCR products into pGEM-1 for in vitro transcription and translation. Expression plasmids encoding the hect domain of E6-AP and the E6-AP/p532 chimeric protein consisting of amino acids 200–491 of human E6-AP isoform 1 (22Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) fused to amino acids 4495–4861 of p532 (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M.

The cDNAs used as templates in PCR for E6-AP, RSP5, and p532 (hectH6) have been described (13Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the hect domain of human hect domain proteins other than E6-AP and p532 were obtained from the following sources: hectH2 (GenBank accession number D13635) and hectH3 (D25215) were kindly provided by N. Nomura; hectH4 (D28476) and hectH5 (D42055) were obtained by RNA PCR using cytoplasmic RNA prepared from HeLa cells; hectH9 (human homolog to a rat protein termed UREB1, accession number U08214) was obtained by RNA PCR followed by screening of a HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH); hectH7 was obtained from two EST clones (accession numbers T93069 and H19362; I.M.A.G.E. consortium). Plasmids encoding the GST-ubiquitin fusion protein and the 75-kDa form of E6-AP as a GST fusion protein have been described (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). E1, UbcH1, UbcH5, UbcH6, and UbcH7 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using the pET expression system as described previously (25Hatfield P.M. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14799-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For ubiquitination and ubiquitin thioester formation assays, E1 was partially purified by anion exchange chromatography as described (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). As a source of UbcH1, UbcH5, UbcH6, or UbcH7, crude bacterial extracts containing the respective E2s were used. The GST fusion proteins (ubiquitin, 75-kDa form of E6-AP, hect domain of E6-AP, E6-AP/p532 chimeric protein, and E6-E7) were expressed inE. coli DH5α, affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 10 mmglutathione. In experiments using radiolabeled ubiquitin, the GST-ubiquitin fusion protein was radioactively labeled while bound to glutathione-Sepharose using protein kinase A (Sigma) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione and cleaved with thrombin (Novagen) to yield free ubiquitin. Upon cleavage, thrombin was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 15 min. For in vitro expression, the various proteins (p53, hect domains, and N-terminal truncation mutants of E6-AP and RSP5) were generated by in vitro transcription-translation. Transcription and translation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Translation was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or in wheat germ extract in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine as indicated in the text. As a source of the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein, E6 was prepared from insect cells (High Five cells; Invitrogen) infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing E6 (kindly provided by J. M. Huibregtse). For partial purification of E6, crude extracts from infected insect cells were loaded onto a Mono S column (Amersham), the column was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, and bound proteins were eluted with 400 mm NaCl. l-[35S]Methionine-labeled forms of E6-AP and RSP5 synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were partially purified by anion exchange chromatography as follows. 100 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with mRNA encoding for the respective proteins were loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham), the column was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and bound proteins were eluted with 500 μl of the same buffer but containing 400 mm NaCl instead of 50 mm NaCl. 10 μl of the partially purified proteins were tested in ubiquitin thioester formation assays in the presence of E1, E2s as indicated (UbcH1, UbcH5, UbcH6, UbcH7), and native ubiquitin or GST-ubiquitin as described previously (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar amounts of the different E2s were used as assessed by their ability to form thioester complexes with 32P-labeled ubiquitin in the presence of E1. To test the capacity of the hect domain of human hect domain proteins to form ubiquitin thioester complexes, the respective hect domains were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and 5 μl of the respective translate were used in standard ubiquitin thioester formation assays as described above. Thioester formation assays using GST fusion proteins (GST-hect E6-AP, GST-75 kDa E6-AP, GST-E6-AP/p532) were performed using32P-labeled ubiquitin as described for baculovirus-expressed E6-AP (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). p53 ubiquitination assays were performed as described (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar) using wheat germ extract-translated p53, partially purified HPV-16 E6 expressed in insect cells, and 1 μg of GST-75 kDa E6-AP, GST-E6-AP/p532, or GST-hect E6-AP. Ubiquitination assays using bacterially expressed GST-E6-E7 as a substrate were performed as described (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). p53 binding assays using GST fusion proteins (GST-hect E6-AP, GST-75 kDa E6-AP, and GST-E6-AP/p532) in the presence of the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein were performed as described (28Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As a source of radiolabeled p53, p53 expressed in wheat germ extract was used. The hect domain proteins are characterized by a conserved C-terminal region of approximately 350 amino acids (13Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region may be necessary and sufficient to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of distinct E2s. To test this hypothesis, a series of N-terminal-truncated forms of E6-AP (Fig.1 A) were generated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The resulting E6-AP forms were then partially purified by anion exchange chromatography to remove endogenous ubiquitin as well as E2 activities present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate that are known to interact with E6-AP (26Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the partially purified forms of E6-AP were tested for ubiquitin thioester formation in the absence or presence of distinct E2s, i.e. UbcH1 (the human homolog ofS. cerevisiae UBC2/RAD6), UbcH5 (the human homolog ofS. cerevisiae UBC4/UBC5), UbcH6, and UbcH7 (Fig. 1) (26Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This revealed that the minimal domain of E6-AP, which is necessary and sufficient for ubiquitin thioester formation, comprises amino acid residues 492–852 (numbering is according to the sequence of E6-AP isoform 1 (22Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). It should be noted that C-terminal-truncated forms were not generated, since the putative catalytic site cysteine residue of E6-AP is located at amino acid residue 820 (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and thus, the information obtained in a deletion analysis of the C terminus would be rather limited. As expected from previous studies (26Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), thioester formation of all the E6-AP forms tested was observed in the presence of UbcH5 and UbcH7 but not UbcH1. Additionally, thioester formation was not observed in the presence of UbcH6. This is in contrast to the results obtained previously with the 95-kDa form of E6-AP expressed in the baculovirus system that was reported to form thioester complexes in the presence of UbcH6 although significantly less efficiently than in the presence of UbcH5 or UbcH7 (27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The reason for this apparent difference is presently unknown, but it may simply reflect different sensitivities of the respective thioester assays. Based on the results obtained for E6-AP, two N-terminal truncation mutants of S. cerevisiae RSP5 were generated (for sequence comparison, see Fig. 3 A) and tested for ubiquitin thioester formation. Similar to E6-AP, a deletion mutant of RSP5 comprising amino acid residues 447–809 was active in ubiquitin thioester formation, whereas deletion of the N-terminal 472 amino acids resulted in an inactive form of RSP5 (Fig. 2). Thioester formation of the truncated form of RSP5 was observed in the presence of UbcH5, UbcH7, and, to a lesser extent, UbcH6. In this context it should be noted that in this experiment, as well as in all the other ubiquitin thioester experiments presented, similar amounts of UbcH1, UbcH5, UbcH6, and UbcH7 were used as determined by their ability to form thioester complexes with radioactively labeled ubiquitin in the presence of E1. Furthermore, titration experiments using decreasing amounts of the respective E2s were performed. This showed that UbcH5 and UbcH7 were similarly active in transferring ubiquitin to the truncated form of RSP5, even under conditions where the amounts of UbcH5 and UbcH7 used were rate-limiting. 2S. E. Schwarz and M. Scheffner, unpublished data. Again, this is in contrast to results previously obtained with baculovirus expressed RSP5 (27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this case, UbcH7 was significantly less efficient in loading RSP5 with ubiquitin than UbcH5. The reason for this discrepancy is presently unclear.Figure 2The hect domain of RSP5 is necessary and sufficient for ubiquitin thioester formation. Two N-terminal truncation mutants of S. cerevisiae RSP5 comprising amino acids 447–809 (ΔN446) and 473–809 (ΔN472), respectively, were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The radiolabeled RSP5 forms were then incubated in the absence (input) or presence of ubiquitin (Ub) or GST-ubiquitin, E1, and the respective recombinant E2s as indicated. After 5 min at 25 °C, reaction mixtures were stopped in the absence or presence of a reducing agent and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The reactions stopped in the presence of a reducing agent are not shown but it should be noted that, under these conditions, the ubiquitin adducts of RSP5 observed in the absence of a reducing agent could not be detected. This indicates that the observed ubiquitin adducts represent thioester complexes of ubiquitin with the respective RSP5 form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence alignment of the minimal region of E6-AP and RSP5 necessary for ubiquitin thioester formation with the amino acid sequences of other hect domain proteins present in available data bases revealed that this region coincides with the size of the region that appears to be conserved among all known members of the hect domain family (Fig. 3 A). To obtain further evidence that a general feature of hect domain family members is the capacity to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin, the cDNAs encoding the hect domain of seven different human hect domain proteins were obtained (for further details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The respective proteins were expressed in the reticulocyte lysate system and tested for ubiquitin thioester formation without further purification. As summarized in Fig.4, six of these proteins formed thioester complexes with ubiquitin, whereas one designated as hectH5 was inactive in the presence of the E2s used in this study (see “Discussion”). Furthermore, it appears that human hect domain proteins can be grouped into two classes based on their interaction with distinct E2s. Some hect domain proteins (e.g. hectH6 that represents the recently identified protein p532 (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5738Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar); Fig. 4 A) form ubiquitin thioester complexes preferentially in the presence of UbcH5, whereas others (e.g. hectH7; Fig. 4 B) form thioester complexes preferentially in the presence of UbcH7. It is widely assumed that E3s play a major role in the recognition of substrates of the ubiquitin-conjugating system. Therefore, to ensure the specificity and selectivity of ubiquitin-dependent degradation, it seems likely that a cell contains a number of different hect domain proteins involved in the degradation of different proteins. This notion is supported by Northern blot analyses showing that the genes encoding the hect domain proteins tested in this study are coexpressed in several tissues, most prominently in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5), and by RNA PCR analyses demonstrating that at least six of the eight human hect domain genes tested are expressed in the cell lines HeLa (cervical carcinoma) and H1299 (non-small cell lung cancer).2 The studies presented above are in support of the hypothesis that hect domain proteins have a modular structure consisting of a conserved catalytic C-terminal domain (i.e. the hect domain) and different N-terminal extensions that determine the substrate specificity of the respective hect domain protein. If this is indeed the case, it may be possible to generate fusion proteins consisting of the hect domain fused to an unrelated protein or region of a protein that is known to mediate interaction with a protein of choice. Such fusion proteins could then be used to target proteins that otherwise would not be recognized by hect domain proteins selectively for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In a first attempt to test the feasibility of this approach, a cDNA encoding a chimeric protein consisting of amino acid residues 200–491 of E6-AP and the hect domain of hectH6 (amino acid residues 4495–4861) (Fig.6 A) was constructed, and the chimeric protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli for the following reasons. (i) The 75-kDa form of E6-AP, which starts at amino acid 200 of E6-AP isoform 1 (22Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), has been shown to contain the regions that are necessary and sufficient to bind to the HPV E6 oncoprotein and to p53 in the presence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein (see Fig. 6 A) (28Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and (ii) the 75-kDa form of E6-AP expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli has been shown to facilitate ubiquitination of an artificial E6-E7 fusion protein as well as of p53 in the presence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The resulting E6-AP/hectH6 chimeric protein was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and tested for ubiquitin thioester complex formation, binding to the E6-E7 fusion protein as well as to p53, and ubiquitination of the E6-E7 fusion protein and p53 (Fig. 6,B–D). As controls, the 75-kDa form of E6-AP and the hect domain of E6-AP expressed as GST fusion proteins were used. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the 75-kDa form of E6-AP, as well as the E6-AP/hectH6 chimeric protein, were able to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of UbcH5. In addition, both proteins bound with a similar efficiency to the E6-E7 fusion protein, and both bound to p53 in the presence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein, although the E6-AP/hectH6 chimeric protein was reproducibly less efficient in binding p53 than the 75-kDa form of E6-AP (Fig.6 C). In contrast to the 75-kDa form of E6-AP, however, ubiquitination of neither the E6-E7 fusion protein nor p53 was observed in the presence of the chimeric protein (Fig. 6 D). Taken together, these results suggest that binding of a hect domain protein to a potential substrate protein is not sufficient to induce ubiquitination of the substrate protein. A likely possibility to account for the observed specificity and selectivity of ubiquitin-dependent degradation is the presence of a number of different E2s and E3s, which have been proposed to play a major role in substrate recognition. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that S. cerevisiae, for instance, encodes for 13 different E2s (4Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar), and according to data base searches, the human genome apparently encodes at least 20 different E2s. 3M. Scheffner, unpublished data. With the exception ofS. cerevisiae UBR1 (5Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), however, the molecular identity of E3s remained enigmatic until recently. Similar to E2s, which are characterized by a highly conserved catalytic region termed the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain (4Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that eukaryotic cells encode at least two families of putative E3s. These are the hect domain proteins (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 13Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) and the so-called SCF complexes (see Refs. 9Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar and 10Feldman R.M. Corell C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar for further details). The family of hect domain proteins was originally identified based on amino acid sequence similarity of its members to the C-terminal region of E6-AP. In support of the hypothesis that hect domain proteins in general have E3 function, the present study revealed that the hect domain of several different proteins is both necessary and sufficient to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of distinct E2s. Thus, the hect domain can be considered as being functionally equivalent to the UBC domain of E2s in that it constitutes the catalytic domain of the hect family of E3s. Data base searches indicate that the human genome encodes at least 20 different human hect domain proteins. The rationale for choosing the particular human hect domain proteins used in this study was that when this study was initiated, cDNAs encoding the full-length protein were available for five of these (E6-AP, hectH2-hectH5). Subsequently, cDNAs encoding the full-length protein for hectH6 (p532 (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and hectH9 (see below) became available. For hectH7, a cDNA was originally isolated encoding a C-terminal-truncated protein (32Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol.

Ren K. Dubner R. Iadarola M.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Initial interest in this protein was raised, since it was described to consist of approximately 300 amino acids and, thus, to represent an N-terminal-truncated hect domain. However, our own studies indicate that the human homolog of UREB1 consists of at least 800 amino acids.2 Moreover, no evidence has been obtained to suggest that human cells contain an mRNA species encoding for a similar truncated protein as has been described in rat cells.2 The notion that the human homolog of UREB1 is a regular hect domain protein insofar that it consists of a hect domain of approximately 350 amino acids and an N-terminal extension is further supported by a recent data base entry (accession number AB002310) indicating that human UREB1 consists of 1906 amino acids. We previously suggested that hect domain proteins can be classified into two groups based on their preferential interaction with distinct E2s (27Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding that some hect domains derived from different human proteins form ubiquitin thioester complexes preferentially in the presence of UbcH5, whereas others form thioester complexes preferentially in the presence of UbcH7. The only exception was hectH5, for which complex formation with ubiquitin was not observed. However, hectH5 represents the human homolog of murine Nedd4, which was recently shown to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the presence of UbcH5 in vitro (34Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This indicates that hectH5 may have the ability to form ubiquitin thioester complexes but that such complexes cannot be detected in the system used in the present study. The hect domain of E6-AP as well as of RSP5 appears to be somewhat different to the other hect domains in that the hect domain of both appears to interact in vitro with UbcH5 as well as with UbcH7. In contrast to these in vitroresults, it was recently reported that in the yeast two-hybrid system, interaction of E6-AP can only be detected with UbcH7 and not with UbcH5, whereas interaction of RSP5 was observed with UbcH5 but not with UbcH7 (35Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies will be required to determine which if any of the interactions observed in vitro and in the two-hybrid system are of functional significance in vivo. The finding that the hect domain is necessary and sufficient to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin indicates that hect domain proteins have a modular structure consisting of a catalytic domain (i.e. the hect domain) and different N-terminal extensions that determine the substrate specificity of the respective hect domain protein. This suggests the attractive possibility that, by fusion to suitable protein binding domains, a given hect domain could bind and ubiquitinate proteins that normally would not be recognized. It should be noted that a similar approach to target proteins for selective ubiquitination and degradation was suggested in previous studies using the HPV E6 oncoprotein (36Scheffner M. Münger K. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or certain E2s (37Gosink M.M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9117-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In an attempt to test the feasibility of this approach, the N-terminal region of E6-AP was fused to the hect domain of hectH6 (p532). Although the resulting E6-AP/hectH6 fusion protein could bind to an artificial substrate protein of E6-AP with an efficiency similar to E6-AP, ubiquitination of this protein was not observed. Thus, binding of a hect domain protein to a potential target protein may not be sufficient to induce ubiquitination, suggesting that a substrate protein and a given hect domain protein have to interact in a structurally well defined manner to allow ubiquitination of the substrate protein. Furthermore, the fusion protein was able to bind to p53 in the presence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein but less efficiently than E6-AP. This suggests that, at least in some cases, the hect domain contributes toward defining the substrate specificity or, at least, in modulating the binding efficiency of the respective hect domain protein. The fact that the similarity among human hect domain proteins is mostly limited to the hect domain indicates that different hect domain proteins are involved in the recognition and ubiquitination of different proteins. Mutations in the E6-AP gene have been reported to be the cause of a familial neurological disorder termed Angelman syndrome (38Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 39Matsuura T. Sutcliffe J.S. Fang P. Galjaard R.J. Jiang Y.H. Benton C.S. Rommens J.M. Beaudet A.L. Nat.

Genet. 1997; 17: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of a recent report suggesting that the human homolog of S. cerevisiae RAD23 constitutes a substrate of E6-AP (35Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), substrate proteins of E6-AP in the absence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein have not yet been identified. p532 (hectH6) was shown to interact with the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 and, possibly, with certain Rab proteins (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5738Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, whether ARF1 and Rab proteins are targets of p532 or regulators of p532 activity or if the observed interaction is unrelated to the proposed E3 activity of p532 is unknown at present. Nedd4, the proposed murine homolog of hectH5, was reported to bind to the epithelial Na+ channel (41Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that the stability and function of the epithelial Na+ channel is regulated by ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (8Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, whether Nedd4 is indeed involved in this process or not remains to be determined. Similar to Nedd4, the N-terminal extension of at least two additional human hect domain proteins contains WW domains (hectH7 and hectH8) (32Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and both p532 (hectH6) and hectH3 contain RCC1-like motifs (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).2 WW domains have been implicated in the binding of peptides containing PY and PY-like domains (Ref. 32Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, and references therein), and it is suggested that RCC1-like domains bind small GTP-binding proteins (23Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Again, however, substrates of these particular hect domain proteins have not yet been identified. In conclusion, to further understand the role of human hect domain proteins in ubiquitin-dependent degradation, it will be necessary to define both their respective cellular function and their target proteins.

The activated GTP bound G protein then dissociates into its constituent α- and βγ-subunits, both of which can activate a variety of different effector systems. The G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a family of serine/threonine kinases, play an important role in regulating this signal transduction process (reviewed in Refs. 1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 2Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

GRKs specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs, which are the only known substrates for these enzymes. GRK-mediated phosphorylation of agonist-activated GPCRs promotes the high affinity binding of cytosolic arrestin proteins (β-arrestins) to the receptors (4Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 5Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestin binding has two functional consequences. First, the binding of β-arrestin sterically inhibits coupling of the receptor to its respective G protein (4Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 5Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding thus lead to diminished receptor signaling, i.e. receptor desensitization (6Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, β-arrestin binding initiates the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (sequestration) of activated receptors (7Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.J. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). GRK-mediated phosphorylation of activated GPCRs thus plays a critical role in regulating both the activity and number of plasma membrane receptors. GRK2 is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme that becomes membrane-localized following GPCR activation (8Strasser R.H. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6362-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The compartmentalization of GRK2 at the plasma membrane requires that its carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain binds both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gβγ) (10Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22552-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since the membrane association of GRK2 requires free Gβγ and the release of Gβγ from the α-subunit is catalyzed by receptor activation, the membrane association of GRK2 is agonist-dependent. Thus GRK2 activity is regulated by several interdependent mechanisms. Agonist occupancy of the receptor and the targeting of GRK2 to different cellular compartments by Gβγ regulate the rate of receptor phosphorylation by increasing the local GRK2 concentration. Additionally, allosteric activation of GRK2 occurs when it is complexed with Gβγand an activated receptor substrate (12Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2222-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was demonstratedin vitro by measuring a potentiation of GRK-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate in the presence of activated GPCR and Gβγ (13Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to serving as GRK2 substrates, agonist-occupied GPCRs bind to and directly activate membraneassociated GRK2. The activation of membrane-associated GRK2 by agonist-occupied GPCRs suggests, potentially, the existence of a signaling pathway in which GRK2 is the effector. To date, however, no substrates for these enzymes other than the receptors themselves have been found. Accordingly, we sought to identify GRK2-binding proteins and potential substrates by performing overlay assays and by examining the intracellular distribution of GRK2 using fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Nitrocellulose overlay assays, in which protein extracts immobilized on nitrocellulose are incubated with a protein probe, have been successfully used to identify a number of proteins that interact with the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A, termed A kinase anchoring proteins (reviewed in Ref. 14Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C-binding proteins (receptors for activated protein kinase C) (reviewed in Ref. 15Mochly-Rosen D. Smith B.L. Chen C.H. Disatnik M.H. Ron D. Biochem. Soc.

In this study, we identify tubulin as a GRK2-binding protein and a novel GRK2 substrate. The potential implications of GRK-mediated tubulin phosphorylation on GPCR function are discussed. Propranolol and isoproterenol were from Sigma or RBI. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Sigma and Molecular Probes, Inc. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the 12CA5 (hemagglutinin) epitope were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and monoclonal M2 anti-Flag® antibody was purchased from Kodak IBI. Cell culture media were purchased from Medtech, and fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals. Physiological buffers were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega or New England Biolabs, T4 DNA ligase from Promega, and Hot Tub DNA polymerase from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmids containing variants of green fluorescent protein were purchased fromCLONTECH. The Flag peptide sequence (DYKDDDDK) was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis before the C-terminal leucine residue of the GRK2 backbone residing in the vector pcDNA1/Amp. A cDNA fragment coding for the insert was ligated between the XhoI restriction site of GRK2 and the SalI site of pcDNA1/Amp and verified by sequencing. A mutant GFP (pS65T-GFP) with a red shifted excitation spectrum and enhanced fluorescence compared with wild type GFP was attached to the C terminus of the Flag® epitope tagged GRK2 (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The (TAA) stop codon following the C-terminal leucine was replaced using site-directed mutagenesis (20Valette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with an in frameBamHI restriction site. The proximalHindII/XhoI fragment was ligated with theXhoI/BamHI fragment into (pS65T-GFP) between theHindIII/BamHI polylinker restriction sites. To survey for the presence of GRK2-binding proteins, various bovine tissues (frozen in liquid nitrogen), were thawed and homogenized (5 ml/g, wet weight) in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mm benzamidine-HCl). Tissue samples were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 15 min. The supernatant, termed crude homogenate, was further fractionated into particulate and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting particulate fractions were resuspended in buffer A (5 ml/g of tissue in the original homogenate). All operations were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. GRK2-binding proteins were identified using a modification of a procedure initially described by Leiser et al. (21Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in samples to be probed were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose filters were incubated in blotto (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, and 0.02% NaN3) for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed three times with binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl). GRK2-binding proteins were detected by incubating the nitrocellulose filters with purified autophosphorylated GRK2. GRK2 (3 μm) purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, described by Kim et al. (23Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar), was autophosphorylated by incubation in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol containing 60 μm ATP (∼6000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Prior to incubation with the nitrocellulose filters, the GRK2 was desalted over G25 columns (1 ml) to remove excess [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled GRK2 (0.2 μm) was incubated with the nitrocellulose filters in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed extensively with binding buffer to reduce nonspecific binding and were subsequently exposed to x-ray film. Purified microtubules containing microtubule-associated proteins were prepared from homogenates of bovine brain using the antimitotic drug taxol as described by Vallee (24Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin was prepared from extracts of freshly isolated bovine brain as described by Simon et al. (25Simon J.R. Adam N.A. Salmon E.D. Micron Microsc. Acta. 1991; 22: 405-412Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain was homogenized at a ratio of 0.5 ml of buffer/g of tissue in 100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, containing 2 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgSO4 (PEM buffer), that also contained 1 mm ATP and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with PEM containing 60% glycerol and 0.2 mm GTP (PEMG buffer). After a 45-min incubation to polymerize tubulin, microtubules were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 29 °C. The microtubule pellet was processed through a second depolymerization/polymerization step by cycling between 4 °C and 37 °C. The two-cycle purified tubulin was subsequently purified to >99% homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography as described by Voter and Erickson (26Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified tubulin was stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Western blots were performed by standard procedures using monoclonal antibodies against GRK2 (27Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against β-tubulin (Sigma). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of antigens (DuPont) was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with 2.0–5.0 μg of plasmid containing GRK2-Flag-GFP cDNA using coprecipitation with calcium phosphate (28Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in 100-mm dishes or transferred to 22-mm square, ethanol-sterilized coverslips in six-well plates as necessary. Cell lines permanently expressing GRK2-Flag-GFP or the GRK2-Flag construct were made using G418 (Geneticin) selection (0.5 mg/ml) of calcium phosphate-transfected HEK-293 cells. Plasmids encoding bovine GRK2 (28Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the human M2 Flag-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor in pcDNAs (28Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) were also used in this study. Serum-starved HEK-293 cells overexpressing GRK2 or GRK2 and β2-adrenergic receptor were treated with agonists as described in the figure legends. Medium was subsequently removed, and cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were subsequently lysed by scraping into 1% CHAPS-HEDN buffer (HEDN contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl), 1 ml of buffer per 150-mm plate of 80% confluent cells. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants incubated with 15 μg of immunoprecipitating antibody. A monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma) (see Figs. 2 and 11) or a monoclonal anti-GRK2 antibody (27Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 10) was used. Incubations were performed at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence of 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose (Calbiochem). Following this incubation period, protein A/G-Sepharose-bound immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times in CHAPS-HEDN. Proteins were removed from the Sepharose beads with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (8% SDS, 25 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue), resolved by electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels, and subjected to Western blot analysis.Figure 11Tubulin is phosphorylated following β-AR activation. HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing GRK2 and β-AR were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were subsequently left unstimulated (−) or treated with isoproterenol for 10 min (+). Following harvest, a membrane fraction was prepared from which tubulin was immunoprecipitated. Tubulin immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and exposed to film. A control in which the immunoprecipitating antibody was omitted is also shown (sham ip). The results shown are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 10Activation of GPCRs facilitates the interaction of GRK2 with tubulin. GRK2 was immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cell lysates transiently overexpressing this enzyme. Cells were either unstimulated (unstim.) or treated with isoproterenol (+ ISO), lysophosphatidic acid (+ LPA), or the thrombin agonist peptide, SFLLRN, (+ Thrombin) for 5 min prior to harvest. GRK2 immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-tubulin antibody. Purified tubulin (tubulin) and 10 μg of HEK-293 cell lysate (Cell lysate) were used as positive controls. A control in which the immunoprecipitating antibody was omitted (sham ip) is also shown. The migration position of molecular weight standards and tubulin is indicated. The result shown is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taxol-precipitated microtubules (200 nm) were incubated in a volume of 25 μl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼6000 cpm/pmol) (buffer B). Incubations were performed at 30 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample loading buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis to determine the number of pmol of phosphate transferred to tubulin. Incubation with protein kinase A inhibitor (10 μg/ml), staurosporine (10 nm), heparin (5 μm), GTP (10 mm), and monoclonal antibodies (10 μg) was used to elucidate the biochemical characteristics of the microtubule associated tubulin kinase. Phosphorylation reactions were performed essentially as described above with two exceptions. First, tubulin purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and devoid of endogenous kinase activity was used as a substrate. Second, purified recombinant GRK2 (50 nm) (23Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar) was included in the phosphorylation reactions. Tubulin concentrations ranging between 0.03 and 0.9 μm were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C to determine the kinetic parameters for GRK2-mediated tubulin phosphorylation.

Phosphorylation reactions were incubated and analyzed as described under “Phosphorylation of Tubulin by the Microtubule-associated Tubulin Kinase.” β-AR concentrations ranging between 0.03 and 0.9 μm were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to determine the kinetic parameters of GRK2-mediated β-AR phosphorylation. A rhodopsin concentration of ∼30 μmwas used in assays utilizing this substrate. A stock solution of the purified peptide (RRREEEEESAAA) was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 by the addition of Tris base. GRK-mediated peptide phosphorylation was determined by incubating peptide (10 μm to 1 mm) and GRK2 (50 nm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mmEDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼2000 cpm/pmol). The final reaction volume was 25 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for 15 min. Phosphorylation reactions were linear over this time period. Reactions were stopped by spotting onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2-cm squares). Free [γ-32P]ATP was subsequently removed by washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid as described previously (31Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). GRK2-mediated peptide phosphorylation was determined by subtracting the counts incorporated in the absence of peptide from the counts incorporated in the presence of this substrate. HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing GRK2 and β-AR were starved in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h. These cells were subsequently incubated in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) for 2 h to label intracellular pools of ATP. Cells were treated with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 μm for 10 min), washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and harvested in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors. Following a low speed spin to remove nuclei (600 × g for 15 min), membranes were prepared by spinning the clarified cellular homogenate at 150,000 × g for 20 min. Tubulin was subsequently immunoprecipitated from these cells as described under “Immunoprecipitation of GRK2 and tubulin.” GRK2-Flag-GFP or GRK2-Flag-expressing HEK-293 cells transfected as described were plated onto ethanol-sterilized glass coverslips in growth medium at least 24 h prior to observation. Coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Antibody labeling or washing of fixed cells was performed at room temperature in a solution of PBS containing 0.008% saponin (w/v) and 1% bovine serum albumin at pH 7.2. A primary rabbit, anti-tubulin antibody originally raised against sea urchin tubulin, a gift of Dr. K. Fujiwara, was kindly provided by Prof. Harold Erickson (Duke University) and was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The mouse monoclonal M2 anti-Flag® epitope antibody was used to localize GRK2-Flag. All antibody incubations were performed at room temperature for 40–60 min with three or four washes following each incubation. Either fluorescein or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) was used as required at 1:250 dilutions. Coverslips were inverted, mounted on glass slides over a drop of PBS, and sealed with clear nail polish prior to viewing. Samples were observed with a Leica model DM50 epifluorescence microscope with one port connected to an Optronics VI-470 CCD video camera system with 768 × 494 active pixels set in manual gain mode. GRK2-Flag-GFP fluorescence and fluorescein fluorescence were visualized using a fluorescein (GFP) excitation and emission filter cube, whereas Texas Red was observed using a broad band excitation rhodamine cube. The electronic cell images obtained from the camera were printed using a Sony model UP-5600 MD color video printer with a UPK-5502SC digital interface board, and imported into Adobe Photoshop (2.5) using the accompanying Sony import module. Flow cytometry analysis was performed as follows. GRK2, GRK2-Flag, or GRK2-Flag-GFP was coexpressed in HEK-293 cells with the 12CA5 epitope-tagged Y326A mutant β-AR (32Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L.

Cells were grown in six-well Falcon dishes at a density of 250,000–400,000 cells/well with equal seeding per well. Following aspiration and washing of each well with serum-free medium, serum-free media with or without isoproterenol was added at 37 °C for 30 min. The incubations were stopped by aspiration of medium and the addition of ice-cold PBS to each well. Following washing in PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with a 1:400 dilution of anti-12CA5 antibody in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 4 °C, washed three times in cold PBS, incubated with a 1:250 dilution of goat anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody, and then fixed and stored in 3% formaldehyde for flow cytometry. 50,000 cells were analyzed for each condition using 520-nm excitation. Confluent 100-mm dishes of permanently transfected, GRK2-Flag-expressing HEK-293 cells or untransfected cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed in PBS, and treated at room temperature for 60 min with a 0.008% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin PBS solution containing a 1:500 dilution of M2 anti-Flag antibody or a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-tubulin antibody. They were then washed three times with PBS to remove free antibody and prepared for electron microscopy as follows. Cells were pelleted, further fixed in paraformaldehyde in 200 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, coated with agar to hold them together, infiltrated with 2.1m sucrose for cryoprotection, placed onto stubs, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were stored in a liquid nitrogen freezer until sectioned. Ultrathin cryosections were cut on a Reichert-Jung ultracut E, equipped with an FC4 cryochamber (Leica, Deerfield, IL). Sections were collected on Formvar and carbon-coated nickel grids, incubated on 5% fetal calf serum in PBS, and followed by 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS. Grids not previously treated with anti-tubulin primary antibody were incubated over a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-tublulin antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed. Grids were further labeled by incubation with goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with either 5-nm or 10-nm colloidal gold (Aurion) at a 1:10 dilution. After thorough washing in PBS followed by washing in water, they were embedded in a 9:2 mixture of 2.1 m methyl cellulose and 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Grids were viewed in a Philips EM300 electron microscope. Crude extracts (C) derived from various bovine tissues, together with a soluble (S) and a particulate (P) fraction derived from this extract (Fig.1 A) were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filters were subsequently incubated with a purified preparation of autophosphorylated 32P-labeled GRK2. Following extensive washing, GRK2 retained on the filter was detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, very few GRK2-binding proteins were detected under these conditions. GRK2 was retained on the filter by proteins of 55-kDa present in the crude extracts and particulate fraction derived from bovine brain and retina. Additionally, a 42-kDa GRK2-binding protein was detected in the crude and particulate fraction derived from bovine heart. A similar pa"

The localization pattern is similar regardless of whether the antibodies are generated to either N- or C-terminal epitopes, raising the possibility that the NTFs and CTFs remain in proximity to each other. However, these studies cannot distinguish the full-length presenilin molecules from the stable fragments. APP is also located in the ER and Golgi, where direct or indirect interaction with the presenilins may contribute to the production of longer forms of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (15Weidemann A. Paliga K.

Thus, knowledge of the processing and trafficking of presenilin molecules is important to our understanding of the pathways of Aβ production.

To date, neither the subcellular distribution of the holoprotein and its fragments nor the compartment where endoproteolytic cleavage occurs is known. To define the distribution of full-length forms and stable fragments of PS1 and PS2, we carried out subcellular fractionation of stably transfected cells. Our results indicate that full-length PS1 and PS2 are located mainly in the ER, while their N- and C-terminal fragments are located principally in the Golgi. Turnover rate of the ΔE9 mutant PS1 protein was slower than wild type (WT) PS1 holoprotein. Concomitantly, the steady state subcellular distribution of ΔE9 PS1 extends to both ER and Golgi fractions. Finally, pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation suggested that the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 takes place in the ER. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with WT or mutant (M146L or C410Y) PS1, or with WT or mutant (N141I) PS2 were described previously (10Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D.

Stable cell lines were selected for Zeocin and G418 resistance. PS1 expression was induced by overnight treatment with 0.0625–1.0 μm muristerone A. PS1 polyclonal antibodies J27 and 4627 were raised against residues 27–42 and 457–467 of PS1, respectively, and have been previously characterized (9Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R.

A PS2 polyclonal antibody, 1209, was raised against a glutathione S-transferase bacterial fusion protein encompassing residues 1–70 of PS2. Polyclonal antibody CT15 was raised against the last 15 residues at the C terminus of the APP (19Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional polyclonal antibodies included calnexin (StressGen) and rat Na+/K+-ATPase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), plus a monoclonal antibody to Na+/K+-ATPase (America BioResearch Co.). Confluent CHO and 293 cells were incubated in methionine-deficient medium for 1 h, followed by pulse labeling with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 20 min. The cells were then either lysed immediately or chased in regular medium for 1–8 h. The cells were then collected and fractionated as described below. Cultured CHO and 293 cells were detached from confluent cultures grown in 15-cm dishes with 20 mm EDTA in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0. 25 m sucrose, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were disrupted using 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by four passages through a 25-gauge needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants from both centrifugation steps were combined and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h. The vesicle pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of homogenization buffer. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Each cell line was analyzed 2–5 times, and representative experiments are shown under “Results.” The viscosity of the gradient medium is a major determinant of the sedimentation rate. In addition, because subcellular organelles are osmotically sensitive, the osmotic activity of the gradient medium is particularly important. Thus, although sucrose, glycerol, and Ficoll are widely used for gradient fractionation of cellular membranes, they are not ideal in osmolality and viscosity. OptiPrep (60% (w/v) Life Technologies, Inc.) is a ready made solution of Iodixanol, 5,5′-[(2-hydroxy-1–3-propanediyl)-bis(acetylamino)] bis[N,N′-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenecarboxamide]. The advantage of using Iodixanol gradient is that osmolality and viscosity remain relatively constant with changes in the density of the gradient. Under this mild iso-osmotic condition, all organelles and endosomes can be isolated intact, without loss of water as the density of the gradient increases. A gradient stock solution of 50% Iodixanol was prepared by diluting in 0.25 m sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at a 5:1 ratio. Linear gradients of 1–20% Iodixanol were formed using a gradient maker. The resuspended vesicle preparations were loaded on top of the gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 200,000 ×g for 3 h at 4 °C. Sequential 1-ml fractions were then collected from the bottom of the gradient. The subcellular markers, calnexin, galactosyltransferase, and Na+/K+-ATPase, were analyzed in each gradient preparation. Subcellular fractions collected from linear Iodixanol gradients were lysed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%. Immunoprecipitations from whole cell lysates or Iodixanol gradient fractions were performed as described previously (10Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7977-7982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Resultant immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated in 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to either polyvinylidene difluoride or supported nitrocellulose membranes. Samples from pulse-chase experiments were transferred to membranes following fractionation and quantitated directly by phosphor imaging. Western blotting was carried out with antibodies as indicated for each experiment. Primary antibodies were visualized with either125I-conjugated secondary antibody or with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected with Super-Signal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The signals were quantitated by phosphor imaging or densitometry, respectively. β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase assay was performed from the Iodixanol fractions according to the method of Bretz and Staubli (20Bretz R. Staubli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in which the addition of [3H]galactose onto the oligosaccharides of an acceptor protein, ovomucoid, was measured. CHO cells, stably transfected with PS1 (WT, M146L, or C410Y) or PS2 (WT or N141I), and 293 cells, stably transfected with PS1 (WT or ΔE9), under the ecdysone-inducible system were analyzed by subcellular fractionation. Subcellular vesicles were separated on 1–20% continuous Iodixanol gradients as described under “Materials and Methods.” ER-rich fractions were found, as expected, at the bottom of the gradient, using an antibody against the well characterized ER marker protein, calnexin (21Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A andB). Calnexin-reactive ER vesicles were most enriched in fractions 1–4. Golgi-containing fractions were identified by assaying for β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme (20Bretz R. Staubli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and this was principally found in fractions 4–7 (Fig. 1,A and B). Immunoreactivity against Na+/K+-ATPase, a marker for plasma membrane, was found on the top of the gradient, i.e. fractions 9–12, although lesser amounts of immunoreactivity were also present in the mid-density region (fractions 5–8) (not shown). The latter reactivity was derived from molecules transiting the Golgi. As an additional marker, CHO cells stably expressing WT APP751 were fractionated and analyzed by blotting with antibody CT15 (to the C terminus of APP). As expected, the immature (primarily N-glycosylated) forms of APP appeared in the ER-rich fractions (fractions 1–4) (Fig.1 C), whereas the mature (N- plusO-glycosylated) forms of APP appeared only in Golgi-rich fractions 4–7. These data indicate that ER and Golgi plasma membrane fractions are effectively separated on these 1–20% Iodixanol gradients. To determine the distribution of PS1, we performed Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions from PS1 stably transfected CHO cells. Antibody J27 raised to the N terminus of PS1 recognized a ∼45-kDa PS1 holoprotein derived from the transgene mainly in gradient fractions 1–4, where it co-localized with the ER marker calnexin (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, the major N-terminal endoproteolytic fragment (∼29 kDa) was consistently localized to the lighter fractions toward the middle of the gradient, principally in fractions 4–7 (Fig. 2, A andB). Similarly, the major C-terminal fragment (∼18 kDa) was distributed in fractions 3–8 (Fig. 2, C and D). Both PS1 NTF and CTF colocalized with the Golgi marker, β-1,4-galactosyl-transferase. Fractionation of stable transfectants expressing the PS1 missense mutations M146L or C410Y showed no significant differences from WT PS1 in subcellular distribution of the holoprotein and its N- and C-terminal fragments (not shown). We next examined CHO cells stably transfected with PS2 cDNA using the same gradient fractionation and blotting with a PS2 N-terminal antibody (antibody 1209). Full-length PS2 molecules were detected as a characteristic ∼50-kDa band principally in ER-rich fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas the N-terminal fragment was localized primarily in Golgi-rich fractions 5–8. Moreover, as seen above with PS1 mutations, the distribution of the N141I mutant form of PS2 was identical to that of WT PS2 (data not shown). Therefore, the subcellular distribution of PS2 and its proteolytic fragment was very similar to that obtained for PS1 and its fragments. 293 cells expressing WT PS1 showed a pattern of distribution of holoprotein and stable fragments very similar to that seen in the CHO-transfected cells, although there was a tendency for the Golgi fractions to be distributed over a larger number of lighter fractions. However, ΔE9 mutant protein, which does not undergo the conventional endoproteolytic cleavage (12Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Rotovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), was widely distributed throughout the gradient fractions (Fig. 4, Aand B). The extension of ΔE9 PS1 into the lighter Golgi fractions was not a result of overexpression, because the same result was seen when muristerone A was reduced in this cell line to match the level of expression seen in WT PS1-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 4,A and B). As expected, we observed no conventional proteolytic fragments from ΔE9 PS1 protein. Furthermore, as reported (22Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the level of N-terminal fragment derived from endogenous PS1 decreased as the ΔE9 PS1 expression increased with higher muristerone A induction (Fig. 4 A). The distribution of the NTF in the WT PS1 and ΔE9-transfected cell lines, the latter with or without induction, was identical; in the case of the latter cells, the NTF was derived only from endogenous PS1. Therefore, the subcellular distribution of transgene-derived PS1 fragments was not altered by the transfection or overexpression. It has been reported that transfected full-length presenilin, mainly located in ER as shown above, has a short half-life, while N- and C-terminal fragments, mainly located in Golgi as shown above, have a substantially longer half-life (9Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H.M. Seubert P. St. George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Futhermore, our results showed that ΔE9 protein, extending from ER to Golgi-rich and lighter fractions, had a distinctly different subcellular distribution as compared with WT PS1 holoprotein. To determine whether the ΔE9 mutant has a different turnover rate, WT and ΔE9 PS1 stably transfected 293 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min and chased for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. The half-life of WT PS1 was under 1 h (average of approximately 50 min from multiple experiments) for the holoprotein and more than 8 h for the NTF (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, the half-life of ΔE9 was consistently twice as long as WT PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 5, A and B). At steady state conditions as documented in the experiments described above, ΔE9 protein was also present in the Golgi fractions, where stable proteolytic fragments derived from endogenous PS1 were located. Surprisingly, the distribution of the ΔE9 mutant PS1 was not substantially altered during the chase period (Fig. 5 C). After 4 h, the profile of ΔE9 protein was similar to that seen at earlier time points, i.e. predominantly in ER fractions, whereas there was virtually no labeled PS1 WT holoprotein remaining in the cell (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, diminished degradation within the ER appears to account in large part for the prolonged half-life of ΔE9 rather than a shift of the proteins into the Golgi fractions, where the turnover rate may be slowed. Closer inspection of the NTF generated during the pulse-chase period showed that at time 0, small amounts of labeled NTF can be detected in the PS1 WT cell line (Fig. 5 C). Surprisingly, at this time point, the distribution of NTF was virtually identical to the full-length protein, i.e. with the peak signal in fractions 3 and 4. After 1 h of chase, the levels of labeled NTF were increased and were distributed more widely, extending into the lighter fractions. Finally, after 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was predominantly within the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at the steady state conditions. These findings indicated that the initial cleavage of PS1 occurred in the ER and the proteolytic fragments were subsequently transported to the Golgi. Similar localization of labeled NTF to the Golgi fractions was seen in ΔE9 cell line at the 4-h chase time, representing fragments derived from endogenous PS1 (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, endogenous NTF in the ΔE9 cell line was not visible until the 4-h time point, suggesting a delay in the formation of this proteolytic species. The mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 and PS2 result in the early onset of the AD phenotype are unclear. It is hypothesized that the selective increase in the production and release of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 as a result of the presenilin mutations is a key factor in the pathogenesis of FAD (10Xia W.

At present, the intracellular compartment where presenilin interacts directly or indirectly with APP is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of presenilins in transfected cells. Our results showed that PS1 and PS2 are similarly distributed, with holoproteins being principally located in the ER, while the stable PS1 and PS2 fragments were principally located in the Golgi. The ΔE9 PS1 mutation results in a broader distribution of the protein in both ER and Golgi-rich fractions as well as a prolonged turnover rate due to diminished degradation within the ER. Our results also indicate that endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments occurs in the ER. Previous immunolocalization studies of transfected cells demonstrated that both PS1 and PS2 are located in the ER and Golgi (13Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T.-W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E.

These studies, however, could not distinguish the signals derived from full-length protein versus stable NTFs and CTFs. We therefore carried out subcellular fractionations of CHO and 293 cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilin and its fragments. Our results showed that full-length PS1 and PS2 were distributed in dense fractions that colocalized with the ER marker, calnexin. Both stable NTF and CTF were distributed predominantly in the lighter fractions that colocalized with the Golgi marker, β-galactosyltransferase activity. In these gradient fractions, the ER and Golgi fractions overlapped with each other and did not represent distinct populations. We also cannot exclude the possibility of other organelles containing presenilins that may co-purify into same gradient fractions. Therefore, our studies can only determine the predominant localization of these presenilin protein species to these compartments. Lesser amounts of protein in other locations cannot be excluded, nor did we examine the nuclear localization of the presenilins as was reported recently (27Li J. Xu M. Zhou H. Ma J. Potter H. Cell. 1997; 90: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the clear subcellular separation between the full-length presenilins and the stable fragments is noteworthy, because it is not known whether the normal physiological function of presenilin is provided by full-length molecules or proteolytic fragments. In our study, the subcellular distributions for two PS1 mutations (M146L and C410Y) and the N141I PS2 mutation were similar to each other and to the respective WT presenilins. Therefore, most mutations do not overtly alter presenilin trafficking. In contrast, the noncleavable ΔE9 PS1 mutant was localized to a larger number of gradient fractions, being distributed to both ER and Golgi fractions. In addition, as was shown recently (22Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), pulse-chase studies showed that the turnover rate of ΔE9 mutant protein was considerably slower than WT PS1 holoprotein. We initially speculated that the transport of ΔE9 to the Golgi compartment where the stable presenilin fragments are located may underlie the decrease in turnover rate of this mutant protein species. However, pulse-chase labeling combined with subcellular fractionation showed that a significant pool of pulse-labeled ΔE9 protein remained intact within the ER at a time when WT PS1 holoprotein was completely degraded. This result suggests that reduced proteolytic degradation of ΔE9 within the ER is responsible for the increased half-life of this molecule. In time, a small fraction of undegraded protein, together with the endogenous NTF and CTF, are found in the Golgi compartment. Previous studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between ΔE9 expression and endogenous NTF levels (22Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K. Davenport F. Ratovitski T. Prada C.-M. Kim G. Seekins S. Yager D. Slunt H.H. Wang R. Seeger M. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Price D.L. Younkin S.G. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), suggesting that mutant holoprotein competes with the normal cleavage of endogenous PS1. In this study, increasing expression of ΔE9 mutant protein by muristerone A induction similarly led to progressively lower levels of endogenous PS1 stable fragments. Interestingly, in the pulse-chase/fractionation studies, the appearance of labeled endogenous fragments was delayed. Therefore, production of NTF from proteolysis of endogenous PS1 is affected both quantitatively and kinetically in the presence of ΔE9 mutant protein. This competition is likely to occur in the ER, because ΔE9 appeared to be largely degraded in this compartment. Our study also provides evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 to generate stable NTF and CTF occurs in the ER. Pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation showed that the initial pool of labeled NTF, albeit in very low levels, was located predominantly in the ER fractions, similar to labeled holoprotein. During the chase period, however, the amount of labeled NTF increased, consistent with a precursor-product relationship between full-length protein species and their fragments within the ER. Importantly, the NTF was seen to distribute to lighter fractions during the chase. By 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was distributed predominantly to the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at steady state. Taken together, these observations provide compelling evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 occurs initially in the ER compartment. With the notable exception of the ΔE9 mutation, the subcellular distribution of all of the other PS1 (M146L, C410Y) and PS2 (N141I) mutations was indistinguishable from WT PS1 and PS2, respectively. Since all of these presenilin mutations have been reported to show a selective increase in Aβ42 production (10Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P.

S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), our results suggest that perturbations in the ER to Golgi processing at this level cannot explain how mutants alter Aβ42 generation. Like the presenilins, maturation of APP in the exocytic pathway occurs in the ER and Golgi compartments. Thus, colocalization of both APP and presenilins in the same subcellular compartments leads to the possibility of an interaction between these two molecules, as has been reported in transfected cells (15Weidemann A.

Using subcellular fractionation, we have recently detected increased levels of Aβ42 in ER and Golgi fractions of cells expressing mutant presenilins (16Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski B. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 294Google Scholar). These observations suggest that understanding the molecular interactions between APP and presenilins as well as other proteins within these cellular compartments will be important in resolving the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1984251709,"Long term potentiation (LTP) in dentate gyrus is impaired in aged rats, and this has been associated with an age-related decrease in membrane arachidonic acid concentration. In this study, we considered whether the trigger for this age-related decrease in arachidonic acid might be increased lipid peroxidation stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β. Groups of aged and young rats were fed on a control diet or a diet supplemented with α-tocopherol and assessed for their ability to sustain LTP. Aged rats fed on the control diet exhibited an impaired ability to sustain LTP and analysis of tissue prepared from these rats exhibited increased interleukin-1β, increased lipid peroxidation, and decreased membrane arachidonic acid concentration compared with young rats fed on either diet. Aged rats fed on the supplemented diet sustained LTP in a manner indistinguishable from young rats, and the age-related increases in interleukin-1β and lipid peroxidation and the decrease in membrane arachidonic acid concentration were all reversed. We propose that interleukin-1β may be the trigger that induces these age-related changes and may therefore be responsible for the deficit in long term potentiation in aged rats. The observation that α-tocopherol reverses these changes is consistent with the hypothesis that some age-related changes in hippocampus might derive from oxidative stress.

Aging is associated with compromised neuronal activity, perhaps typified by a deficit in cognitive function. One particular age-related impairment in neuronal function in the rat is a decrease in ability to sustain long term potentiation (LTP 1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; ANOVA, analysis of variance; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDA, malondialdehyde; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential.1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; ANOVA, analysis of variance; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDA, malondialdehyde; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential.; Refs. 1Landfield P.W.

Evidence suggests that a cascade of biochemical changes, initiated by activation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor is required to support this form of synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (6Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9392) Google Scholar). Although the underlying cause of the age-related impairment in ability to sustain LTP is not known, down-regulation of several components of the biochemical cascade has been identified in aged rats. Thus, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity is compromised with age (e.g. Ref. 7Davis S. Markowska A.L. Wenk G.L. Barnes C.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1993; 14: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas down-regulation of other factors that play a role in induction of LTP, like calcium handling by cells (1Landfield P.W. McGaugh J.L. Lynch G. Brain Res. 1978; 150: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and activation of enzymes such as phospholipase A2 (3Lynch M.A. Voss K.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and protein kinases (8Battaini F. Elkabes S. Bergamashchi S. Ladisa V. Lucchi L. DeGrann P.N.E. Schuurman Y. Wetsel W.C. Trabbucchi M. Govoni S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), has been reported. Similarly, factors that play a role in maintenance of LTP, like increased glutamate release, have also been shown to be compromised in hippocampus of aged rats (3Lynch M.A. Voss K.L. Eur. J.

In addition, the more persistent aspects of LTP, which rely on increased synthesis of new proteins (10Krug M. Lossner B. Ott T. Brain Res.

Lynch M.A. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Geinisman Y. deToledo-Morrell L. Morrell F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Despite this immense body of data, the underlying cause of the impairment in ability of aged rats to sustain LTP is not known. One unifying cause of the age-related changes in biochemical parameters might be a change in membrane composition. Thus, one might predict that, if membrane fluidity is altered, the activation of membrane proteins like receptors, ion channels, and membrane-associated enzymes might also be altered. Membrane arachidonic acid concentration has been shown to be markedly decreased with increasing age (3Lynch M.A. Voss K.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5McGahon B. Clements M.P. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); this is likely to decrease membrane fluidity (see Ref. 15Zs-Nagy I. The Membrane Hypothesis of Aging. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar) and is therefore one change that might explain significant changes in activity of the hippocampal membrane-associated proteins that impact on expression of LTP. In the context of the change in membrane arachidonic acid concentration and the presumed increase in membrane rigidity, it is important to consider the growing body of evidence that supports the original hypothesis of Harman (16Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6329) Google Scholar) that free radicals contribute to age-related changes in the central nervous system. One hallmark of free radical damage is lipid peroxidation; most reports indicate that lipid peroxidation increases with increasing age (17Noda Y. McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Neurobiol.

Gerontology. 1991; 37: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and this is supported by the observation that lipofuscin, one characteristic reaction product, accumulates in the aged brain (18Gupta A. Hasan M. Chandler R. Kapoor N.K. Gerontology. 1991; 37: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With specific reference to the hippocampus, recent evidence from this laboratory has indicated that there is an age-related increase in lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of aged rats (19Lynch M.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 501P: 5S-6SGoogle Scholar), supporting earlier findings (Ref.20Mizuno Y. Ohta K. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 21Cini M. Moretti A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been acknowledged for many years that lipid peroxidation will profoundly affect membrane composition since it results in depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (22Reiter R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar); therefore, the increase in lipid peroxidation in hippocampus may be the underlying cause of the age-related decrease in membrane arachidonic acid concentration (3Lynch M.A. Voss K.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5McGahon B. Clements M.P. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An increase in lipid peroxidation will be triggered by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and this arises from a compromise in antioxidant defenses. Neuronal tissue is particularly vulnerable to oxidative insults; the vulnerability results from high oxygen consumption of brain tissue, coupled with modest antioxidant defense (23Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar), high concentrations of iron, particularly in hippocampus (24Benkovic S.A. Connor J.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 338: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are target substrates for reactive oxygen species (25Rice-Evans C. Burdon R. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 71-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Accumulation of oxidative damage is readily observed in neuronal tissue (26Choe M. Jackson C. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J.-R. Andrus P.K. Hall E.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1640-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and there is substantial evidence that expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and its receptor are increased in brain tissue exhibiting oxidative damage (28Rothwell N.J. Luheshi G. Toulmond S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 69: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The importance of α-tocopherol, one naturally occurring antioxidant, for normal neuronal cell function has been defined most clearly by studies that assess the consequences of vitamin E deficiency. Thus, vitamin E deficiency in patients leads to, among other problems, neurological deficiencies (29Muller D.P.R. Goss-Sampson M.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1990; 5: 239-255PubMed Google Scholar), whereas prolonged vitamin E deficiency in rats leads to demyelination of axons and gliosis (30Vatassery G.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 669: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Maintenance of rats on a vitamin E-deficient diet markedly reduced the vitamin concentration in whole brain (31Urano S. Asai Y. Makabe S. Matsuo M. Izumiyama N. Ohtsubo K. Endo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or cortex (32MacEvilly C.J. Muller D.P.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (17Noda Y. McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 1982; 3: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Urano S. Asai Y. Makabe S. Matsuo M. Izumiyama N. Ohtsubo K. Endo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32MacEvilly C.J. Muller D.P.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas protection against oxidative damage was offered by vitamin E administration (31Urano S. Asai Y. Makabe S. Matsuo M. Izumiyama N. Ohtsubo K. Endo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In parallel, vitamin E-deficient rats had impaired ability to sustain LTP (33Xie Z. Sastry B.R. Brain Res. 1995; 681: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas α-tocopherol induced synaptic potentiation (34Xie Z. Sastry B.R. Brain Res. 1993; 604: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we considered that the impaired ability of aged rats to sustain LTP might be due to a decreased in membrane arachidonic acid. Our hypothesis is that this change is triggered by increased lipid peroxidation, which in turn is triggered by IL-1β, perhaps through formation of reactive oxygen species. To test this hypothesis, aged and young rats were fed on either a control diet or a diet enriched in α-tocopherol and l-ascorbate (to limit oxidation of α-tocopherol). At the end of this period, rats were analyzed for their ability to sustain LTP in dentate gyrus in vivo and these data were interpreted in parallel with analyses performed on tissue prepared from hippocampus obtained from these rats at the end of the electrophysiological recording period. We report that dietary supplementation with antioxidant vitamins reversed the age-related decrease in α-tocopherol concentration and concomitantly restored ability of these rats to sustain LTP. The data presented are consistent with the view that an age-related increase in endogenous concentrations of IL-1β may be the underlying cause of certain neuronal impairments in hippocampus of aged rats. Groups of male Wistar rats (average ages: 4 months and 22 months) were used in these experiments. Animals were housed in groups of 2–4 under a 12-h light schedule. Ambient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 °C. Food and water was freely available, and intake was measured daily for 2 weeks before commencement of the experiment and throughout the experiment. Aged (22 months) and young (4 months) rats were then randomly subdivided into two groups. One group received normal laboratory chow with addeddl-α-tocopheryl acetate (250 mg/rat/day dissolved in corn oil; Beeline Healthcare, Dublin, Ireland) and drinking water to whichl-ascorbic acid (250 mg/rat/day; Beeline Healthcare) was added. l-Ascorbic acid was included since it has the ability to recycle vitamin E by reducing the oxidized form (35Tappel A.L. Geriatrics. 1968; 23: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar, 36Packer J.E. Slater T.F. Willson R.L. Nature. 1979; 278: 737-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The second group received normal laboratory chow with corn oil added to ensure isocaloric intake with the first group. Food and water intake did not vary between groups, and there was no significant difference in daily food and water intake before and after dietary modifications were made. Rats were fed on the respective control or supplemented diet for 3 months; at the end of this time, ability of animals to sustain LTP was assessed. Animals were housed in the BioResources Unit at Trinity College, Dublin under veterinary supervision for the duration of this experiment. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane; the absence of a pedal reflex was used as the indicator of adequate anesthesia. Young animals initially received 1.5 g/kg urethane, and an additional increment of up to 0.5 g/kg if required; the mean dose of urethane administered to 4-month-old rats was 2.07 g/kg (± 0.11; S.E.). In the case of 22-month-old animals, the initial dose of urethane was reduced to 1.0 g/kg and topped up if necessary; the mean dose of urethane given to 22-month-old rats was 1.63 g/kg (± 0.10). LTP was induced in perforant path-granule cell synapses as described previously (5McGahon B. Clements M.P. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were placed in a head holder in a stereotaxic frame and a window of skull was removed to allow placement of a bipolar stimulating electrode in the perforant path (4.4 mm lateral to lambda) and a unipolar recording electrode in the dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to bregma). The depths of the stimulating and recording electrodes were adjusted to maximize the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the stimulating intensity was adjusted to produce a population spike amplitude of about 1 mV. Test shocks were delivered unilaterally at 30-s intervals and after a 10-min control period, three trains of stimuli (250 Hz for 200 ms) were delivered with an intertrain interval of 30 s. (Previous experiments indicated that this stimulation paradigm produced saturation of LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses.) Recording at test shock frequency then resumed for 40 min. Data were stored on disk for later analysis. At the end of the recording period, rats were killed by cervical dislocation. The dentate gyri from the ipsilateral (i.e. tetanized) and contralateral (i.e.untetanized) sides were cross-chopped (350 μm × 350 μm) and frozen separately in 1 ml of Krebs solution (composition of Krebs in mm: NaCl 136, KCl 2.54, KH2PO41.18, MgSO4·7H2O 1.18, NaHCO3 16, glucose 10, CaCl2 1.13) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide as described previously (37Haan E.A. Bowen D.M. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The remaining hippocampal (i.e. whole hippocampus minus dentate gyrus) tissue was treated in the same way, and all samples were stored at −80 °C until required. For analysis, slices were thawed rapidly (1.5–2 min) by agitation at 37 °C and rinsed four times in excess fresh oxygenated Krebs solution. Analysis of IL-1β, lipid peroxidation, and arachidonic acid were made in samples prepared from untetanized dentate gyrus. Formation of reactive oxygen species was analyzed in stored contralateral (untetanized) hippocampal tissue (minus dentate gyrus). We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for analysis of IL-1β (DuoSet ELISA Development System, Genzyme Diagnostics). Slices of dentate gyrus prepared from aged and young animals were homogenized in Tris buffer (50 mm,; 250 μl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 50 μm leupeptin, and 50 μm aprotonin. For analysis of IL-1β, 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of capture antibody (2.0 μg/ml final concentration, diluted in 0.1m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5; monoclonal hamster anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 250 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3; 0.1 m with 4% bovine serum albumin). Blocking buffer was aspirated, and aliquots (100 μl) of samples or IL-1β standards (0–1000 pg/ml) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed, secondary antibody (100 μl; final concentration 0.8 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin; biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) was added to each well, and incubation continued for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed, 100 μl of detection agent (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin) was added to each well, incubation continued for another 15 min at 37 °C, and plates were again washed. Aliquots of substrate (100 μl; tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate; Sigma) were added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar), and results were expressed as nanograms of IL-1β/mg of tissue corrected for protein concentration. Formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) was used to assess lipid peroxidation as described previously (39Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22498) Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) of homogenate prepared from dentate gyrus were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, at which time 8.1% (w/v) SDS (30 μl), 20% acetic acid (pH 3.5 with NaOH; 225 μl), and 0.8% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid (225 μl) were added. The volume was then adjusted with H2O to 600 μl, and the samples were incubated for another 60 min at 95 °C, cooled at room temperature, and absorbance assessed at 532 nm with reference to a standard curve made using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane. In some experiments, IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) or hydrogen peroxide (5 mm) were added to analyze its effect on lipid peroxidation; the effect of antioxidants (±)-α-tocopherol phosphate (disodium salt; 200 μm) or melatonin (5 mm) on IL-1β- or hydrogen peroxide-induced effects were also assessed. Results were expressed as nanomoles of MDA/mg of protein for the in vitro experiments. Since we observed that values for protein/mg of tissue were different in hippocampal preparations obtained from aged and young rats, data from these experiments were expressed as nanomoles/mg of tissue corrected for protein concentration. The formation of reactive oxygen species was assessed in hippocampal tissue (minus dentate gyrus) as described previously (40Lebel C.P. Bondy S.C. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The method relies on oxidation of the non-fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, by reactive oxygen species, to the highly fluorescent 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein. To assess reactive oxygen species production, either homogenate or the synaptosomal pellet, P2, was resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Aliquots (1 ml) of synaptosomes or homogenate were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (10 μl; final concentration 5 μm; from a stock solution of 500 μm in methanol) at 37 °C for 15 min. Analysis was performed in hippocampal preparations under control conditions (i.e. no additions), in the presence of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) or in the presence of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) and (±)-α-tocopherol phosphate (disodium salt; 200 μm). In a separate group of experiments, we analyzed reactive oxygen species production in tissue prepared from aged and young rats that were fed on the control diet, and aged and young rats that were fed on the experimental diet. To terminate the reaction, the dye-loaded synaptosomes were centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 8 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Aliquots of resuspended synaptosomes (750 μl) were incubated in the presence or absence of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml). Fluorescence was monitored at a constant temperature of 37 °C immediately before stimulation with IL-1β, and 15 min after stimulation, at 488 nm excitation (bandwidth 5 nm) and 525 nm emission (bandwidth 20 nm). Reactive oxygen species formation was quantitated from a standard curve of 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein in methanol (range: 0.05–1 μm). Results were expressed as nanomoles/mg of tissue corrected for protein. Aliquots (150 μl) of homogenate prepared from dentate gyrus were added to chloroform:methanol (2:1 (v/v); 1 ml) and fatty acids were extracted by vigorous shaking for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min to separate the phases. The aqueous layer was discarded, and the chloroform phase was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in ethanol for analysis. Arachidonic acid was analyzed as its 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatives by reverse phase HPLC (41Miwa H. Yamamoto M. Nishida T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1986; 55: 95-102Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were derivatized by adding 2-nitrophenylhydrazine-HCl solution (0.02 m 2-nitrophenylhydrazine-HCl in 40 mm HCl-ethanol (3:1, v/v)) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride solution (0.25 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride in ethanol mixed in equal volumes with 3% ethanolic pyridine), and incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. After addition of KOH (15% (w/v) in MeOH:H2O, 80:20) samples were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min and cooled in running water. Fatty acid derivatives were concentrated; n-hexane and phosphate buffer (0.033m, pH 6.4, in 0.5 m HCl) were added, samples were vortex mixed for 30 s, centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 ×g, and the hexane phase evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. For HPLC analysis, samples were resuspended in methanol and injected onto a Microsorb C18 column (maintained in a column oven at 30 °C), and fatty acid derivatives were separated in isocratic mode with a mobile phase of 85% methanol:15% water (maintained at pH 4.5 with HCl) and detected by UV spectroscopy at 230 nm. Arachidonic acid concentration, expressed as micromoles/mg of tissue, was estimated using the external standard method. Hippocampal preparations were homogenized in ice-cold Krebs solution. Aliquots (150 μl) were incubated in the presence of ethanol containing 0.025% butyl-hydroxytoluene (150 μl), 25% ascorbic acid (70 μl), 10% potassium hydroxide (135 μl) for 30 min at 60 °C. Hexane (540 μl) containing 0.025% butyl-hydroxytoluene was added, and samples were vortex-mixed for 1 min and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 6 min. The hexane phase was removed and evapourated to dryness under nitrogen. For HPLC analysis, dried samples were resuspended in methanol (150 μl) containing 0.025% butyl-hydroxytoluene and 30-μl volumes were injected onto an Intersil C18 column (maintained at 40 °C). Separation of α-tocopherol was achieved using a mobile phase of 75% acetonitrile:25% methanol at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min and samples were detected by uv spectroscopy at 292 nm. α-Tocopherol concentration was estimated by the external standard method and expressed as micrograms/mg of tissue, corrected for protein concentration. Either Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When ANOVA was used and when this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student-Neumann-Keul test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other. The mean pretetanus EPSP slope was similar in 4-month-old and 22-month-old rats (1.13 mV/ms ± 0.11 (S.E.) and 1.11 mV/ms ± 0.09, respectively). Dietary supplementation with α-tocopherol and ascorbate significantly increased mean EPSP slope to 1.40 mV/ms (± 0.10 S.E.; p < 0.05; Student's t test for independent means) in young rats but not aged rats (mean value, 1.03 mV/ms ± 0.06). There was an age-related decrease in mean amplitude of the response; the mean values were 3.51 ± 0.35 mV and 2.18 ± 0.17 mV in 4-month-old and 22-month-old rats fed on the control diet (p < 0.01; Student's ttest for independent means). This was partially reversed by dietary supplementation; the corresponding mean values were 3.10 ± 0.21 mV and 2.59 ± 0.18 mV. The stimulus strength required to induce a response at which the spike became evident was slightly, although not significantly, greater in aged (4.29 ± 0.54 V) compared with young (3.57 ± 0.21 V) rats. Dietary supplementation with vitamins had little effect on induction of LTP in either 4-month-old or 22-month-old rats. In contrast, a significant effect on maintenance of LTP, particularly in aged rats, was observed; in this study, we compared mean EPSP slopes and mean amplitude of the responses in the last 5 min of the experiment with the values in 5 min immediately before tetanic stimulation. In 4-month-old rats, the mean percentage changes in EPSP slopes (± S.E.) were 134.27% (2.67) in rats fed on control diet compared with 126.88% (1.83) in rats fed on the experimental diet; these values were not significantly different (Fig.1 A). The corresponding values for mean amplitude of the response were 142.76% (3.56) and 128.55% (1.70) in the groups fed on control and experimental diets, respectively; thus mean amplitude of the response was significantly decreased in rats fed on the experimental diet (p < 0.05; Student's t test for independent means; data not shown). Fig. 1 B indicates that LTP, as measured by the change in EPSP slope, was impaired in aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats, but that this impairment was reversed in aged rats fed on the experimental diet. The mean percentage changes (± S.E.) in EPSP slope in the last 5 min of the experiment compared with the 5 min immediately before tetanic stimulation were 107.99% (2.92) in aged rats fed on control diet compared with 124.07% (1.89) in aged rats fed on the experimental diet. The corresponding values for the mean percentage change in the amplitude of the response were 109.01% (2.47) and 131.51% (2.56) for aged rats fed on the control"

The mechanisms of tolerance, defined as the diminishing effect of the drug in response to chronic exposure, are not fully understood. It has been postulated that receptor desensitization and down-regulation could be associated with aspects of tolerance in vivo (1Nestler E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Opioid receptors undergo homologous desensitization upon continuous or repeated agonist exposure in a fashion similar to other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin; DPDPE,d-Pen2,d-Pen5-enkephalin; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase.

Desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor involves agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor, most likely by a member of the family of G-coupled receptor protein kinases (GRKs) (4Raynor K.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, upon phosphorylation and uncoupling from the G protein, the receptor is bound to β-arrestins and internalized into endosomes, reducing the number of receptors available at the cell surface for further agonist binding (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor has been mainly described as the attenuated reduction of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in response to the agonist (2Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol.

However, other signaling pathways might also be desensitized upon prolonged agonist exposure. GPCRs can trigger a Gβγ-mediated activation of a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Ras-dependent MAPK signaling pathway (8Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Opioid receptors stimulate MAPK activity as well, although the components of this signaling cascade have not been fully described (10Fukuda K. Kato S. Morikawa H. Shoda T. Mori K. J.

In this report we have examined the role of the MAPK (Erk1/2) signaling pathway on μ-opioid receptor desensitization. This pathway, which involves the activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity as well as Raf and MEK1/2, is essential for μ-opioid receptor desensitization. [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), dermorphin, morphine, Met-enkephalin, naloxone,d-Pen2,d-Pen5-enkephalin (DPDPE), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), pertussis toxin, cycloheximide, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) were from Sigma. Wortmannin and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), Elk-1 (Ser-383), MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221), as well as a control (phosphorylation-independent) MAPK antibody, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were from New England Biolabs. A stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing the murine μ-opioid receptor cDNA (13Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R.

In a typical MAPK induction experiment cells were grown in 6-well plates for 24 h prior to treatment, washed, and incubated in serum-free medium for 1–2 h prior to agonist stimulation as indicated in the figures. Incubation with vehicle (0.04% dimethyl sulfoxide) or the inhibitors was initiated 1 h (PD98059), 15 min (wortmannin and LY2940092), 5 min (naloxone), or 16 h (pertussis toxin) prior to agonist stimulation. For desensitization experiments, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium before 100 nm–1 μm of DAMGO or morphine, and different inhibitors were added to the medium for 2 additional hours. The cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to a second agonist stimulus, typically 100 nm DAMGO for 5 min. C6 glioma cells were transfected with DNA constructs expressing the murine μ-opioid receptor and dominant negative forms of MEK (S221A) (14Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4822-4829Google Scholar), using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 100 nm DAMGO for 5 min prior to extract preparation. For Western blot experiments, cell extracts were prepared using Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as described (16Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). For MAPK activity assays, cells were grown in 10-cm plates for 24 h, treated as indicated, and extracted using a non-denaturing lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl), protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. Active MAPK was immunoprecipitated using a phospho-MAPK specific antibody and used in kinase reactions to phosphorylate 1 μg of GST-Elk-1 (307–428) fusion protein as substrate. Elk-1 phosphorylation was then analyzed by immunoblotting using a phospho-Elk-1 specific antibody (16Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 6-well plates for 24 h prior to experimental treatment, washed, and incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h, followed by 2 h of incubation in the presence of agonists and different inhibitors. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and 5 μm forskolin, and 0.5 mm IBMX was added with or without 1 μm DAMGO for 10 min. Cells were then extracted using 0.1n HCl and assayed using the Biotrak enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ). Before membrane preparation, we followed the same desensitization procedures described above and in Fig. 4. Plasma membranes were prepared essentially as described (3Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]naloxone (specific activity, 53.7 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products ) using 25 μg of membrane protein was performed according to the previously described method (3Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kansra V. Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F53-F59PubMed Google Scholar). To generate saturation isotherm the ligand concentration was varied from 0.2 nm to 16 nm. The reaction (90 min at 25 °C) was terminated by a rapid filtration followed by three washes with ice-cold buffer using a Brandel harvester. Cold naloxone, 100 nm, was used to define nonspecific binding. Binding data from saturation experiments were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 2.01 program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). We first confirmed that selective μ-opioid agonists were capable of inducing MAPK activity in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with the murine μ-opioid receptor (13Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A. Evans C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MAPK activity and phosphorylation peaked at 5 min after agonist addition, rapidly decreasing to reach background levels between 30 and 60 min after stimulation (Fig. 1 a). Increased phosphorylation and enzymatic activity were already detectable at low levels (10 nm) of the μ-receptor agonist DAMGO (data not shown). MAPK phosphorylation was not induced by DPDPE, a selective agonist for the δ-opioid receptor, and was blocked by naloxone and pertussis toxin, confirming that MAPK activation in these cells is specifically mediated by a Go/Gi-coupled μ-opioid receptor (Fig.1 b). In all experiments, MAPK phosphorylation correlated with enzymatic activity as measured in Fig. 1 a.Identical results were obtained using morphine or peptide μ-agonists such as dermorphin and Met-enkephalin (data not shown). Consistently, DAMGO also induced the phosphorylation of the MAPK-activating kinase MEK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 a, upper panel), which is indicative of Raf kinase activation, and following a similar time course as shown for MAPK (not shown). DAMGO-induced MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by the specific inhibitor of MEK activation, PD98059 (18Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), at concentrations as low as 5 μm (Fig. 2 a, center panel), and by expression of dominant negative forms of MEK1/2 and Ras (Fig.2 a, bottom panel). MAPK phosphorylation was also reduced by the selective inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin, and LY294002 at concentrations considered to be specific for PI3K inhibition (8Hawes B.E.

These results suggest that μ-agonist activation of the MAPK pathway requires the involvement of a wortmannin/LY294002-sensitive PI3K, Ras, Raf, and MEK, as has been shown for other Gi-coupled receptors (8Hawes B.E.

Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization has been extensively studied in the β-adrenergic receptor system (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been described for opioid receptors mostly in terms of the diminishing agonist inhibition of cAMP levels induced by forskolin (2Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol.

We investigated whether desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor could be analyzed by monitoring phosphorylation of MAPK. We first measured the time necessary for cells exposed continuously to 100 nmDAMGO to lose their capability to respond to a second agonist stimulus. Fig. 3 a shows the progressive desensitization of the μ-receptor-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation. A significant decrease (approximately 50–60% of maximum levels) in phosphorylated MAPK was already detected after 5 min of agonist exposure corresponding to the time frame of short-term desensitization (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). No receptor response, in terms of MAPK phosphorylation stimulated by a second agonist stimulus, could be detected after 2 h of agonist exposure (Fig. 3 a). Identical results were obtained using morphine instead of DAMGO for the 2-h desensitizing period. Desensitization of MAPK phosphorylation was also dependent upon agonist concentration used in the first stimulus (Fig. 3 b). The attenuated receptor response is reversed upon agonist removal (19Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We next measured the time required for the MAPK signal to become resensitized. The cells recovered their responsiveness to a second DAMGO stimulus only after 15–30 min of incubation in agonist-free medium (Fig. 3 c). This parallels the resensitization timing reported for the β-adrenergic receptor (20Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar levels of MAPK phosphorylation as those induced in non-desensitized cells are nearly reached after a 2-h relapse in agonist-free medium (Fig.3 c). The μ-agonist-induced desensitization of the MAPK response could be homologous (the loss of response to a specific stimulus) or heterologous (the loss of response to diverse stimuli). To distinguish between these two possibilities we used LPA, which stimulates MAPK phosphorylation via an endogenous Gi-coupled receptor (8Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cells preincubated for 2 h with DAMGO were washed and then exposed to LPA or DAMGO for 5 min (Fig.3 d). Whereas DAMGO pretreatment greatly reduced the response to a second DAMGO stimulus, it did not affect the levels of MAPK phosphorylation induced by LPA as compared with those of cells stimulated with LPA but not pretreated with the μ-agonist (Fig.3 d). This indicates that the MAPK signal desensitization provoked by a 2-h exposure to a μ-specific agonist had no effect upon any component of the LPA-induced MAPK pathway. Therefore, the MAPK pathway induced by μ-opioid receptor agonists is subject to homologous desensitization in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The desensitization process is critical for timing the duration of the cell response to a particular stimulus. Upon signaling through GPCRs the regulation of this process can theoretically occur at any level of the interaction between receptor, G-protein, and effector pathway. The role of GRKs and β-arrestins in receptor phosphorylation, uncoupling, and internalization has been described (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), as well as the importance in these processes of GRK-specific interactions with the Gβγ subunit (22Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 23Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that other signals contribute to the desensitization process as well. We hypothesized that a feedback signal originating at the effector pathway itself, in this case the MAPK pathway, may help initiate the desensitization mechanism. This signal could induce the molecules that actively uncouple the receptor from the downstream effector pathways. We tested whether blocking the MAPK signal transduction cascade would affect the desensitization of a μ-opioid receptor stimulus. Cells expressing the μ-receptor were exposed to 100 nm DAMGO alone or together with 10 μm naloxone or 20 μm PD98059 for 2 h, the time required for complete desensitization as shown in Fig. 3 a. The cells were then extensively washed to eliminate agonist and inhibitors and subjected to a second stimulation with 100 nm DAMGO for 5 min before extracts were harvested to assay MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 a, upper and middle panels) and MAPK activity (Fig.4 a, bottom panel). Cells exposed to DAMGO alone for 2 h did not respond to a second agonist stimulus. In contrast, the presence of PD98059 during preincubation with DAMGO prevented the desensitization of μ-receptor signaling, similar to the expected effect of the antagonist naloxone. We also obtained identical results in these experiments using morphine as the first desensitizing stimulus. At the concentrations used in this study, PD98059 was shown to be highly specific in preventing the activation of MEK, without affecting the activity of 18 other tested Ser/Thr kinases (18Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Thus the inhibition of MEK activation and consequently of MAPK caused the receptor to remain sensitive despite 2 h of agonist exposure. If MAPK induced a desensitizing feedback signal that acts at the level of the receptor or G-protein, then inhibition of this signal should also affect the desensitization of other downstream effectors, such as the cAMP pathway. We then examined whether desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor adenylate cyclase signaling could be blocked by PD98059, as well as by wortmannin and LY294002. These MEK and PI3K inhibitors block the MAPK pathway (Fig. 2) but do not affect the cellular cAMP levels induced by forskolin (not shown). As described previously (13Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A. Evans C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), DAMGO reduced cAMP levels induced by forskolin and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (Fig. 4 b). Pre-exposure to DAMGO for 2 h desensitized the receptor, thereby abolishing this effect. However, when the cells were preincubated with DAMGO in the presence of naloxone, PD98059, wortmannin, or LY294002, a second agonist stimulus reduced the forskolin-stimulated levels of cAMP as in non-desensitized cells. Thus, multiple inhibitors acting at different points along the MAPK cascade are capable of blocking the μ-agonist-induced desensitization of cAMP signaling (Fig.4 b). It has been shown that, except for morphine (24Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), agonist-induced μ-opioid receptor desensitization is accompanied by the loss of membrane receptor (3Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar, 24Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Total receptor binding using the opioid antagonist [3H]naloxone was determined to test whether inhibition of the MAPK pathway would block not only desensitization but also the agonist-induced receptor internalization. [3H]Naloxone binding to membranes of desensitized cells was performed by following the same experimental protocol described in Fig. 4; we expose the cells to no agonist (vehicle, 0.04% dimethyl sulfoxide) or to 1 μm DAMGO, 1 μm morphine, 1 μm DAMGO in the presence of 20 μmPD98059, or to 20 μm PD98059 alone. After 2 h of treatment the cells were extensively washed, and plasma membranes were prepared for radioligand binding assays. [3H]Naloxone bound in a saturable manner to all cell membrane preparations (not shown). Scatchard analysis of the binding results was performed to calculate B max data for each treatment, and these values are compared in the histogram shown in Fig.5. The results revealed a decrease of approximately 60% in receptor number in cells pretreated with DAMGO (B max, 1217 ± 136 fmol/mg protein,n = 4) as compared with untreated cells (B max, 2894 ± 144 fmol/mg protein,n = 4). A similar degree of internalization caused by agonist exposure was reported for the μ- and δ-opioid receptors (24Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 25Gaudriault G. Nouel D. Dal Farra C. Beaudet A. Vincent J.P. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Total receptor number in cells pretreated with morphine shows no significant difference to that of untreated cells (B max, 2813 ± 123 fmol/mg protein,n = 3). Pretreatment with the agonist in the presence of PD98059 was able to prevent the loss of μ-opioid receptor density (B max, 2753 ± 311 fmol/mg protein,n = 3), compared with untreated cells, whereas pretreatment with PD98059 alone had no effect upon μ-opioid receptor density (B max, 2761 ± 98 fmol/mg protein,n = 3). The K d measured for the four treatment groups are: untreated cells (0.9 ± 0.2 nm,n = 3); desensitized with DAMGO, (0.9 ± 0.2 nm, n = 3); desensitized with morphine (3.7 ± 0.4); desensitized with DAMGO in the presence of PD98059 (1.6 ± 0.6 nm, n = 3), and PD98059 treatment alone (0.5 ± 0.08 nm, n = 3). Thus, the inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the level of MEK1/2 also impaired the agonist-induced receptor internalization yielding a number of coupled receptors available sufficient to maintain an intact signaling response (Fig. 4). Our results suggest that upon agonist activation a feedback signal emanates from the MAPK cascade to promote the desensitization of receptor signaling, since blocking this pathway at different points with different inhibitors prevented the desensitization of two independent effector cascades (Fig. 4). Moreover, the results of the binding studies indicate that an active MAPK pathway also contributes to receptor internalization (Fig. 5). Morphine does not cause receptor internalization even at concentrations that strongly inhibit adenylate cyclase and stimulate MAPK (24Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus, morphine activation of the MAPK pathway (Fig. 1 and Ref. 12Li L.Y. Chang K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 599-602PubMed Google Scholar) may not require immediate receptor internalization as recently reported for the β-adrenergic and LPA receptors (27Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that morphine is capable of desensitizing the μ-opioid receptor-stimulated MAPK pathway, and this effect is blocked by PD98059, without affecting internalization (Figs.4 and 5). This is consistent with reports suggesting that sequestration is not required for desensitization (20Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study also supports the notion that different μ-agonists can induce two distinct receptor conformational changes, one necessary for signaling and desensitization and a second required for internalization (7Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 24Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Whereas morphine would induce only the former, other opioid agonists would always induce both. What then are the potential targets for this desensitizing signal emanating from the MAPK cascade? According to our results (Figs. 4 and5), particularly the effects of morphine on signaling, desensitization, and internalization, we speculate that this signal should act before internalization is initiated. One possibility is the direct phosphorylation of the receptor by MAPK as was reported for the AT1 receptor (28Yang H. Lu D. Vinson G.P. Raizada M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1660-1669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is the direct or indirect interaction between the MAPK cascade and GRK2, as GRK2 has been recently implicated in agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of opioid receptors (4Raynor K. Kong H. Hines J. Kong G. Benovic J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1381-1386PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol.

We are currently investigating this hypothesis. A feedback signal promoting uncoupling at the level of the G-protein itself is also possible. Such signal could act on either subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein or affect the function of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS proteins) (30Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Further investigation on how the MAPK pathway affects μ-opioid receptor desensitization will contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tolerance to opiate drugs. We thank C.

However, the functional properties of the gene product have yet to be elucidated. We cloned rat DTDST cDNA from rat UMR-106 osteoblastic cells. Northern blot analysis suggested that cartilage and intestine were the major expression sites for DTDST mRNA. Analysis of the genomic sequence revealed that the rat DTDST gene was composed of at least five exons. Two distinct transcripts were expressed in chondrocytes due to alternative utilization of the third exon, corresponding to an internal portion of the 5′-untranslated region of the cDNA. Injection of rat and human DTDST cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes induced Na+-independent sulfate transport. Transport activity of the expressed DTDST was markedly inhibited by extracellular chloride and bicarbonate. In contrast, canalicular Na+-independent sulfate transporter Sat-1 required the presence of extracellular chloride in the cRNA-injected oocytes. The activity profile of sulfate transport in growth plate chondrocytes was studied in the extracellular presence of various anions and found substantially identical to DTDST expressed in oocytes. Thus, sulfate transport of chondrocytes is dominantly dependent on the DTDST system. Finally, we demonstrate that undersulfation of proteoglycans by the chlorate treatment of chondrocytes significantly impaired growth response of the cells to fibroblast growth factor, suggesting a role for DTDST in endochondral bone formation.

In contrast, canalicular Na+-independent sulfate transporter Sat-1 required the presence of extracellular chloride in the cRNA-injected oocytes. The activity profile of sulfate transport in growth plate chondrocytes was studied in the extracellular presence of various anions and found substantially identical to DTDST expressed in oocytes. Thus, sulfate transport of chondrocytes is dominantly dependent on the DTDST system. Finally, we demonstrate that undersulfation of proteoglycans by the chlorate treatment of chondrocytes significantly impaired growth response of the cells to fibroblast growth factor, suggesting a role for DTDST in endochondral bone formation. In animals, most of the bone initially forms as cartilage (cartilaginous bone rudiments), which is later replaced by bone (endochondral ossification) (1Horton W.A. Growth Genet. Horm. 1990; 6: 1-3Google Scholar). In adults, cartilage is left in particular body portions such as rib, auricle, and joints and functions as a load-bearing tissue. Thus, cartilage is essential for growth and maintenance of animal skeletal systems. Biological functions of cartilage are mostly dependent on the properties of its extracellular matrix, whose major components are cartilage-specific collagens and sulfated proteoglycans (2Comper W.D. Hall B. Newman S. Cartilage: Molecular Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 59-96Google Scholar).

The gene, the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter (DTDST), is presumed to encode a Na+-independent sulfate transporter on the basis of its structural similarity with rat hepatocanalicular sulfate transporter (Sat-1) and human intestine-specific sulfate transporter (DRA;down-regulated in adenoma) (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A.

In the present study, we directly characterized the sulfate transport activity of rat DTDST by injection of its cRNA into Xenopus oocytes and compared it to that of normal rat costal chondrocytes. The activity profile of the gene product showed an ion dependence of transport distinct from that of Sat-1, suggesting that DTDST was a sulfate/chloride antiporter. Hästbacka and co-workers (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I.

Histological observations of diastrophic dysplasia patients would suggest cartilage to be the most relevant tissue to examine. However, they did not include cartilage in their study. The present Northern blot analysis clearly indicated that the level of DTDST mRNA was particularly high in cartilage and intestine. Only a marginal level of the transcript was detected in other tissues. A unique ion dependence of sulfate transport in culture chondrocytes further supported the notion that cartilage is predominantly dependent on the DTDST system for its sulfate utilization. Chondrocytes were isolated from growth plate cartilage of ribs of young Wistar rats (weighing 90–110 g), as described (9Shimomura Y. Yoneda T. Suzuki F. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 19: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After removal of peripheral muscular tissues and perichondrium from whole ribs, a portion of the growth plate cartilage was isolated and minced. Cells were isolated by sequential treatment of cartilage with EDTA, trypsin, and collagenase. The isolated cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-multiwell plates, 2 × 104 cells/well in 48-multiwell plates, or 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-multiwell plates in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% FBS. Cells were grown to confluency at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The culture medium was renewed every other day. Rat UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS as described (10Gutierrez G.E. Mundy G.R. Katz M.S.

Human placenta cDNA (Quick-Clone cDNA) was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and was used to amplify human DTDST cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and specific primers to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the entire coding sequence in human DTDST cDNA: primer 1 and primer 2. Further 5′-regions of human DTDST cDNA were amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) with the gene-specific antisense primer (hDTD-GSP1) and the nested gene-specific antisense primer (hDTD-NGSP1).Table ISummary of PCR primers used in this studyPrimersNucleotide sequencesSpecific primers for amplification of human DTDST coding region Primer 15′-GCTGAACCATCTATCTCC-3′ Primer 25′-CTAGACATTCTTCTATCTAC-3′The gene-specific and the nested gene-specific primers for 5′-RACE of human DTDST hDTD-GSP15′-TACTTGATTCCCTTTGAAGTTCCAG-3′ hDTD-NGSP15′-CTTCAGCTGAGTCTCTGGGTGAAAC-3′Specific primers for rat Sat-1 coding region Primer 35′-CAAAGAGCCTGGTGTGACAG-3′ Primer 45′-CTTGGCTCTTGAGGAAGCGG-3′Primers for amplification of rat DTDST cDNA fragment Primer 55′-TTGCCAACCAAAGAACTC-3′ Primer 65′-TGTGATCACACCAAGGAC-3′Primers for amplification of the entire coding region of rat DTDST cDNA Primer 75′-ATGTCTTCAGAAAGTAAAGA-3′ Primer 85′-ATTAGCAGAAGGACCAACAG-3′ Primer 95′-TTGCCAACCAAAGAACTC-3′ Primer 105′-TCACTACTAAGACTCAGACC-3′The gene-specific and the nested gene-specific primers for 5′-RACE of rat DTDST rDTD-GSP15′-GCAGTGGAAGAAGGAGGGTATG-3′ rDTD-GSP25′-CCGGCACCAATTCCAACTGAGC-3′ rDTD-NGSP15′-GCATACATTTCCTGATTGGCTTTC-3′ rDTD-NGSP25′-AGCTCATTGTCGTTGTGGCAGC-3′Specific primers for amplification of 5′-untranslated region of rat DTDST gene Primer 115′-AGACATCATCTTCTGGCTTC-3′ Primer 125′-TGGTTTCTCATGGAGTTCCA-3′Primers for amplification of further 5′-region of rat DTDST gene rDTD-GSP35′-ATCACTGTTACTCAGAGGGTGCTTC-3′ rDTD-NGSP35′-GACAGACACACATCACTTATGGAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Total RNAs isolated from rat UMR-106 cells and rat kidney were reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dT) primer using the cDNA synthesis Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA from rat kidney was used to amplify an entire coding sequence rat Sat-1 cDNA by PCR with the specific primer set (primer 3 and primer 4). The resulting cDNA was cloned into pCRII vector. The cDNA from UMR-106 was used to amplify rat DTDST cDNA by PCR with the primers designed from the human DTDST sequence (primer 5 and primer 6). Then two sets of specific primers were used to amplify the entire coding region in rat DTDST; one was composed of the 5′-end of human DTDST coding region (primer 7) and the internal site in rat DTDST (primer 8). The other set was a combination of the internal site of human DTDST coding region (primer 9) and the 3′-end of human DTDST coding region (primer 10). Further 5′- and 3′-regions of rat DTDST cDNA were amplified by the RACE method using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) with the gene-specific primers (rDTD-GSP1 and rDTD-GSP2) and the nested gene specific primers (rDTD-NGSP1 and rDTD-NGSP2). Since initial PCR with GSP1 and GSP2 did not give rise to any distinct bands, the initial PCR products were subjected to a nested PCR reactions. The resulting 5′-RACE products and 3′-RACE products were cloned into pCRII vector, respectively. To construct plasmids containing 5′-coding region, 3′-coding region, and entire coding region of rat DTDST cDNAs, the overlapping cDNA clones obtained by RT-PCR and RACE were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Rat genomic DNA was purchased from CLONTECH and used to amplify DTDST genomic DNA sequences. The 5′-untranslated region of rat DTDST gene was amplified by PCR with sense primer 11 and antisense primer 12. An approximately 1.3-kb genomic DNA fragment was amplified. Further 5′-regions of rat DTDST genomic sequence were amplified using the GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH) by two steps of PCR reactions with the gene-specific antisense primer (rDTD-GSP3) and the nested gene specific antisense primer (rDTD-NGSP3), corresponding to the sequence in exon I. The PCR products were cloned into pCRII vectors by TA cloning for sequence analysis. The DTDST cDNA and genomic sequences were determined by dye terminator cycle-sequencing reactions using specific primers and the purified PCR fragments or cloned plasmids as templates and an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A, Perkin-Elmer). Sequences were analyzed using DNASIS software (Hitachi Software Engineering) and the computer programs BLAST (11Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) and MACAW (12Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from various rat tissues by a single step method according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Isolated total RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cloned rat DTDST and Sat-1 cDNA fragments were labeled by the BcaBEST labeling kit (TAKARA, Ohtu, Japan) and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human β-actin cDNA was similarly labeled and used as a control probe. The blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) in 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 2 × Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testis DNA (Sigma). The filters were washed twice at room temperature for 15 min in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS and then washed twice at 50 °C for 40 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP x-ray films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Total RNAs (2.5 μg each) isolated from UMR-106 cells and rat growth plate chondrocytes were reverse transcribed into cDNA with random hexamer using the cDNA synthesis Superscript preamplification system. One-fiftieth or one-hundredth of the cDNAs were used to amplify two alternative spliced transcripts of the DTDST gene by PCR. PCR amplification was performed by using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and sense primer 11 and antisense primer 12 (Table I). Thermal cycling was carried out for 28 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). Aliquots of the PCR products were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gel along with molecular size markers, and the amplified products were stained with ethidium bromide. Plasmids harboring cloned sulfate transported cDNAs were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes that have a cleavage site immediately downstream of the cDNA insert. Capped cRNAs were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, T3 RNA polymerase, or SP6 RNA polymerase using the mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with Quick Spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), and cRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in water for injection into oocytes. The handling of Xenopus laevis oocytes and the transport assay were carried out as reported by Bissig (8Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]Sulfate (carrier-free) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Oocytes were washed twice in ion-free washing solution (200 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5). The oocytes were then incubated in 100 μl of uptake solution per oocyte (200 mm sucrose or 100 mm various salts, 1 mm[35S]sulfate (40 μCi/ml), 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. Sulfate uptake was stopped by washing the oocytes three times with ice-cold washing solution containing 5 mm K2SO4. Each oocyte was then dissolved in 0.2 ml of 10% SDS, and the oocyte-associated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer after the addition of scintillation fluid (ACS II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sulfate uptake was measured as described by Hästbacka (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A.

Confluent chondrocytes cultured in 24-multiwell plates were washed three times in ion-free washing solution (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5). The cells were then incubated in 500 μl of uptake solution (300 mm sucrose or 149 mm various salts), 1 mm [35S]sulfate (40 μCi/ml), 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) for 5 min at 37 °C. Uptake was stopped by washing the cells four times with ice-cold washing solution containing 5 mm K2SO4. The cells were then dissolved in 0.3 ml of 10% SDS, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined. For measurement of sulfate efflux from the cells, confluent rat growth plate chondrocytes were prelabeled with [35S]sulfate by incubation in uptake solution (300 mm sucrose, 1 mm [35S]sulfate (40 μCi/ml), 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) for 5 min at 37 °C. Efflux of sulfate was initiated by replacing the uptake solution with the efflux solution (300 mm sucrose or 149 mmvarious salts, 1 mm cold sulfate, 10 mmHEPES/Tris, pH 7.5). Radioactivity retained in the cells was determined. For determination of thymidine incorporation, rat growth plate chondrocytes were grown to confluency in DMEM/F-12 medium or sulfate-free DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% FBS with or without sodium chlorate (Sigma) in 96-multiwell plates. Sulfate-free DMEM/F-12 medium, in which all of the sulfate salts in the standard formula were substituted by chloride salts, was specially prepared and obtained from Nikken Biomedical Lab (Osaka, Japan). Antibiotics, which are the significant sources of sulfate, were also omitted. Humphrieset al. (14Humphries D.E. Sugumaran G. Silbert J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 428-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) noted that the antibiotic- and sulfate-free medium thus prepared may still contain 0.01 mm sulfate as a possible minor contaminant. Sulfate concentration in serum was also reported to be 0.3–2.5 mm (15Mulder G.J. Mulder G.J. Sulfation of Drugs and Related Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1981: 31-52Google Scholar). In this study, serum sulfate concentration and a sulfate contaminant in the sulfate-free DMEM/F-12 were assumed to be 2.5 and 0.01 mm, respectively. Cells were preincubated in the same medium containing 0.3% FBS for 24 h. The medium was replaced by the same medium containing 0.3% FBS with human recombinant FGF-2 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml heparin (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Cells were incubated for another 26 h and labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the last 4 h. Radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined as described previously (16Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Shigeno C. Sanma Y. Bentz H. Rosen D.M. Asada A. Suzuki F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For determination of proteoglycan synthesis, chondrocytes were grown to confluency in 48-multiwell plates. The medium was replaced with 0.3 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium or sulfate-free DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.3% FBS with or without sodium chlorate and incubated for 48 h. Then the cultures were labeled with 5 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate or 10 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for another 24 h. After incubation, the medium was collected, and the cell layer was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteoglycans recovered in the medium and PBS rinse were combined. [35S]Sulfate and [3H]glucosamine incorporated into proteoglycans were determined after Pronase E digestion and precipitation by 1% cetylpyridinium chloride in the presence of chondroitin sulfate, as described (16Hiraki Y.

Developing bovine tails were collected from 5-month-old fetuses and fixed overnight at 4 °C in periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde solution in 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4). The caudal vertebrae were dissected out, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal serial sections were cut at 6 μm. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 1% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity and washed in PBS. Sections were treated with 500 units/ml testicular hyaluronidase (type V, Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C and rinsed in PBS. The slides were covered with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min and then with anti-FGF-2 monoclonal antibody (bFM-1) at a dilution of 1:50 (17Matsuzaki K. Yoshitake Y. Matuo Y. Sakaki H. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9911-9915Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Preimmune mouse IgG was used as a negative control. Immunoreactions were performed using a Vectastain peroxidase rabbit ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Sections were washed with PBS, and the antigenic sites were demonstrated by treating the sections with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dojin Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) and 0.01% H2O2 for 7 min. Nuclei were stained with methyl green. Then the sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Permount (Fisher). Physicochemical properties of extracellular matrix profoundly affect growth and differentiation of cells in animals. Bone and cartilage produce a large amount of extracellular matrix components, which include sulfated proteoglycans. Thus, these tissues are assumed to develop an efficient transport system for sulfate anion to meet their demand for sulfate during proteoglycan synthesis. To study the properties of the sulfate transporting system and its role in the growth regulation, we attempted to clone rat DTDST cDNA. Using RT-PCR with human DTDST-specific primers 5 and 6 (TableI), we amplified rat cDNA from total RNA isolated from rat UMR-106 osteoblastic cells. Then the entire coding region and the 5′- and 3′-regions of the cDNA were isolated by RT-PCR and RACE reactions. In the coding region, the cloned cDNA sequence had a higher similarity to human DTDST cDNA (73% identical) than that of rat hepatocanalicular sulfate transporter Sat-1 cDNA (43% identical) (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A.

For comparison, we also cloned human DTDST cDNA from human placenta cDNA by PCR using primers 1 and 2 and then 5′-RACE (Table I). The resultant RACE fragments contained the 5′-flanking sequence (−77 to −1) of the putative initiator ATG of human DTDST cDNA (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve Daly M.P.

Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the previously reported genomic sequence revealed the presence of 3′-splice acceptor and an exon/intron junction at −26/−25 (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A.

Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two forms of rat DTDST cDNA that differ in their 5′-untranslated region were isolated by RACE reactions. One contained an additional 130-base pair insert that was absent from the other. To explore the cause of the differences between the two cDNA clones, we analyzed the corresponding genomic sequences by PCR reactions using GenomeWalker kit. Comparison of the genomic sequence with the cDNA sequence revealed that the 5′-untranslated region of rat DTDST sequence is encoded by four exons (exons I–IV), as shown in Fig.1 A. These exons were separated by intron I (8 kilobase pairs), intron II (512 base pairs), and intron III (1 kilobase pair). We also confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.8-kilobase pair intron after codon 233, the position of which is identical to that previously reported in human DTDST (3Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I. Lander E.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that two forms of cDNA were generated by alternative utilization of exon III (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, RT-PCR using sense primer 11 and antisense primer 12 revealed the presence of these two alternative transcripts in UMR-106 osteoblastic cells and growth plate chondrocytes. These transcripts were also detected in articular cartilage (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of rat DTDST cDNA are shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2The nucleotide sequence of rat DTDST cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2The nucleotide sequence of rat DTDST cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the anion transport function of DTDST gene product unequivocally, we injected cRNAs of human and rat DTDST intoXenopus oocytes and compared them to cRNA prepared from rat Sat-1 cDNA. First, we examined endogenous sulfate transport inXenopus oocytes using water-injected oocytes and found that water-injected oocytes displayed only low [35S]sulfate uptake (data not shown). In contrast, human or rat DTDST cDNA-injected oocytes displayed significant uptake of [35S]sulfate in the outside sulfate pool in the presence of sodium gluconate outside (Fig. 3). The level of [35S]sulfate uptake in the presence of sodium gluconate was nearly the same as that in the sucrose-containing medium without sodium gluconate (data not shown), indicating a Na+-independent sulfate transport of DTDST. The presence of outside chloride anion, however, resulted in a significant inhibition of the DTDST-directed sulfate uptake. In contrast to DTDST, Sat-1 cRNA-injected oocytes displayed a chloride-dependent sulfate uptake as previously reported (8Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that DTDST constitutes a unique transport system distinct from that of Sat-1 (Fig.3). We then studied the cis-inhibition pattern of DTDST-directed sulfate transport activity (Fig. 4). Human DTDST-directed sulfate uptake was sensitive to thiosulfate and oxalate. 4,4′-Diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS; 1 mm) completely blocked the sulfate transport activity of DTDST. In agreement with a previous report (8Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Sat-1-directed sulfate uptake displayed an identical cis-inhibiti"

The ability of both tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and BRCA1, to induce the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 in combination with the inhibitory activity of p21WAF1/Cip1 against cyclin-dependent kinases suggests that the regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression is an important aspect of mammalian cell cycle growth control. To elucidate the role of serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5 (PP5) in processes regulating cell cycle progression, we developed antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against PP5 (e.g. ISIS 15534) that specifically inhibit PP5 gene expression. Employing ISIS 15534, we demonstrate that the specific inhibition of PP5 gene expression has a marked antiproliferative effect on cells, characterized by induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 and the subsequent arrest of cell growth. Investigations into the mechanisms leading to growth arrest reveal that, in the absence of PP5, the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 is induced in p53-competent A549 cells but not in p53 protein-deficient T-24 cells. Employing a stable cell line derived from p53-deficient human fibroblast that contains tetracycline-regulated transactivator and operator plasmids to control the expression of wild-type p53 (TR9-7 cells), we then show that the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1, which occurs in response to the inhibition of PP5 expression, requires the p53 protein. Additional studies indicate that PP5 acts upstream of p53, influencing both the phosphorylation state and the ability of p53 to bind DNA, without causing an increase in p53 gene transcription. Together these studies suggest that PP5 is a regulatory component of a signaling pathway that affords replicating cells G1 checkpoint growth control and that it is the regulation of PP5 that, in turn, controls p53-mediated expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 and growth arrest in this pathway. In addition, since the inhibition of PP5 gene expression has marked antiproliferative activity and the overexpression of p21WAF1/Cip1 blocks the growth of tumor cells, these studies suggest that compounds that inhibit of PP5 gene expression may be useful in the treatment of human cancers.

The reversible phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on proteins is a mechanism utilized by eukaryotic cells to regulate the biological activity of many enzymes, and phosphorylation influences cellular events as diverse as metabolism, signal transduction, and cell cycle progression. Although the kinases involved in these processes are well recognized, the critical contribution of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PPase or PP, serine/threonine protein phosphatase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat.1The abbreviations used are: PPase or PP, serine/threonine protein phosphatase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat. has only been appreciated more recently (1Cohen P.T.W.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-119PubMed Google Scholar). Traditionally, mammalian PPases have been grouped into four subtypes (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) based on 1) their biochemical characteristics, 2) their sensitivities to specific inhibitors, and 3) a limited amount of substrate specificity that can be demonstrated in vitro (3Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Emerging structural data, however, indicate that PP1, PP2A, and PP2B are related, while PP2C is structurally distinct. In addition, three isoforms of PP1, which demonstrate >90% identity (4Song Q.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have been identified. Based on a comparison of their sequences, these mammalian PPases have been placed into five distinct subfamilies termed PP1, PP2A (which includes PP4 and PP6), PP2B, PP5, and PP7 (1Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 16Huang X. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Much of the knowledge concerning the cellular roles of the individual PPases has been derived from studies using what has become a fairly large number of naturally produced toxins that inhibit the activity of certain serine/threonine protein phosphatases. To date, the known PPase inhibitors include okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, nodularin, cantharidin, calyculin A, tautomycin, and fostriecin (17Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 18Honkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Moore R.E. Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J. Biol.

All of these compounds demonstrate inhibitory activity against PP2A and PP1. However, okadaic acid has been utilized the most extensively due to its ability to penetrate cell membranes and its ability to selectively inhibit the activity of PP2A under appropriate experimental conditions (17Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 23Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). With the exception of fostriecin, which demonstrates even more selectivity against PP2A than okadaic acid (22Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the other mentioned PPase inhibitors affect both PP1 and PP2A with relatively similar potencies (17Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 18Honkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Moore R.E. Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast, PP2B, PP7, and PP2C are not affected or resistant to inhibition by these compounds (16Huang X. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Studies with recombinant PP4 and PP5 have complicated the interpretation of data obtained using okadaic acid, because these studies indicate that both PP4 and PP5 are also sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid and microcystin-LR (12Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-99613Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 12: 4278-4290Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the sensitivity of PP6 to okadaic acid has not yet been determined. Because many signaling cascades leading to cell growth are stimulated by phosphorylation-mediated events, it has been assumed that PPases are negative regulators of cellular growth. Reports indicating that okadaic acid (at micromolar concentrations (1–125 μm)) has tumor-promoting activity in the mouse skin model have furthered the speculation that okadaic-sensitive PPases participate in the regulation of cell growth and suggest that certain PPases may function as tumor suppressor proteins (Refs. 24Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 85: 1768-1771Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar and 25Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Yoshizawa S. Nishiwaki S. Winyar B. Sugimura T. Environ. Health Perspect. 1991; 93: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 29Walter G. Mumby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 207-226PubMed Google Scholar). However, fostriecin, which is currently under evaluation in clinical trials to determine its potential use as an antitumor drug in humans, has marked antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo (26de Jong R.S. de Vries E.G. Mulder N.H. Anticancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, cantharidin and structural derivatives of cantharidin have been reported to have antitumor activity both in vivo and in vitro (27Walter W.G. J. Pharm. Sci. 1989; 78: 66-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Chen R. Hua Z. Yang J. Han J. Zhang S., Lü, F. Xü B. Chinese Med. J. 1980; 93: 183-187PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest that, when administered at (1–20 nm) nanomolar concentrations, okadaic acid can inhibit tumor cell growth and neoplastic transformation (for a review, see Ref.29Walter G. Mumby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 207-226PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for these apparently conflicting findings is that the ability of a particular PPase inhibitor to act as either a tumor-promoting agent or an antitumor drug is determined by the subset of PPases that are affected by the inhibitor under the conditions utilized in a particular study. Alternatively, there may be a single PPase (or a subset of PPases) that is sensitive to fostriecin and cantharidin yet resistant to inhibition by okadaic acid or vice versa. The presence of multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) sequences in PP5 implies that PP5 interacts with other TPR-containing proteins, many of which are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression (1Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,14Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining if PP5 participates in the regulation of signal transduction pathways that influence cell proliferation. With the realization that, in addition to PP1 and PP2A, both PP4 and PP5 are sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, it became apparent that deciphering the contributions of PP5 to cell cycle progression would require the development of a more specific inhibitor. Therefore, in the present study we developed antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting human PP5 to specifically inhibit PP5 gene expression in human cells. Using these antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that the expression of PP5 is necessary for A549 cell proliferation and that the inhibition of PP5 expression results in the hyperphosphorylation of p53 and the induction of p21WAF1/Cip1. Together, these studies suggest that PP5 acts upstream of p53 and participates in a signaling pathway that regulates p21WAF1/Cip1-mediated G1 growth arrest. Human A549 lung carcinoma cells and T-24 bladder carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and routinely passed when 90–95% confluent. TR9-7 cells, which were derived from the p53−/− human fibroblasts (MDAH041) and contain tetracycline-regulated transactivator and operator plasmids to control the expression of wild-type p53 (31Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Drs. G. Stark and M. Agarwal. TR9-7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and the indicated amount of tetracycline. Phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides and 2′-O-(2-methyoxy)ethylphosphothioate deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described previously (32Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A549 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. When the cells were about 70% confluent, they were treated with oligonucleotides as described previously (32Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with DMEM. A solution (1 ml) of DMEM containing the oligonucleotides at the indicated concentration and 15 μg/ml DOTMA/DOPE (Lipofectin®; Life Technologies, Inc.) was then added. After incubating the cells at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells were washed and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 17 h. The cells were then harvested, and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the methods of the manufacturer. Total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to DURLON-UV (Stratagene) nylon membranes. Following UV cross-linking, the filters were hybridized with a32P-labeled probe for human PP5. The human PP5 cDNA probe was generated from the full-length coding region of PP5 and32P-labeled with DECAprime® DNA labeling kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization was performed in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C for 16 h. Following hybridization, the membrane was subjected to two low stringency washes (2 × SSC) at room temperature and then two high stringency washes (0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 55 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography, and the filters were then stripped and reprobed with a 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe to confirm equal loading. Quantification of hybridization signals was achieved by analysis of the scanned autoradiograms using the NIH Image program (ImagePC). Western analysis was performed essentially as described previously using polyclonal rabbit antibodies generated against a synthetic 15-amino acid peptide identical to the C-terminal region of PP5 (14Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells grown in T-75 flasks were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then 250 μl of lysis buffer was added to each flask. The extract was then subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was removed for protein determination. The remaining supernatant was added to an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein quantitation assay, with bovine serum albumin as standards. Typically 25–50 μg of protein was then separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel was electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) and blocked for 1 h with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 5% nonfat milk. To detect PP5, membranes were incubated with anti-PP5 antibody diluted in Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 containing 2% nonfat milk for 18 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed, and the primary antibody was detected employing ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the protocols of the manufacturer. A549 cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/dish. On the next day, the cells were treated with PP5 specific antisense oligonucleotides (ISIS 15534) or the scrambled mismatch control (ISIS 15521) at a final concentration of 300 nm as described above. On each of the next 5 days, the cell cultures were treated briefly with trypsin to detach the cells from the dish (three wells from each test group). The number of cells was then determined by counting using a hemacytometer. Cell viability was determined with trypan blue staining. The percentage of viable cells was calculated by dividing the number of cells excluding trypan blue by the total number of cells, and the results are reported as the mean ± S.D. of data collected from three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts and gel mobility shift assays were conducted as described previously (34Li Y.C. Ross J. Scheppler J.A. Franza Jr., B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1883-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and treated with ISIS 15521 or ISIS 15534 antisense oligonucleotides as described above, three dishes per group. Six hours after treatment, the cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were then lysed by adding 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vigorous vortexing for 10 s. Nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle shaking, and then subjected to centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein was determined as described above. Binding reactions were performed by incubating 10 μg of each nuclear extract with 1 ng of 32P-end-labeled p53CON and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.25m EDTA, 50 μm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol) at room temperature for 20 min. Anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was then added to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing Tris borate/EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography. A549 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes until the cell cultures were ∼80% confluent, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and placed for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cell cultures were then treated with ISIS 15521 or ISIS 15534 as described above, three dishes per group, and [32P]phosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) was added to the media. Six hours after treatment, the cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. Cell lysates were prepared by incubating the thawed cells at 4 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and precleared by incubation with 1.2 μg of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The protein concentration of precleared cell lysates was determined as described above, and equal amounts of protein from each precleared lysate were incubated in the presence of 1 μg of anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. Twenty μl of protein A-agarose was added to the mixture, which was then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rocking. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer. After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 2× sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. The bands were visualized by autoradiography. Fifteen oligonucleotides 20 bases in length predicted to hybridize to different regions of human PP5 mRNA were synthesized. The oligonucleotides tested in the initial screen were “chimeric” oligonucleotides, containing eight central phosphorothioate oligodeoxy residues (“oligodeoxy gap”) flanked by six 2′-methoxyethyl residues on the 3′- and 5′-ends. These modifications have been shown previously to enhance the potency of antisense oligonucleotides targeting mRNAs encoding other proteins (32Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the oligonucleotides tested in the initial screen were designed to target specific regions in the protein coding region or the 3′-untranslated region of human PP5 mRNAs (Fig.1). Because phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have been shown to commonly act through an RNase H-dependent mRNA cleavage mechanisms in cells (35Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), the ability of each oligodeoxynucleotide to specifically inhibit the expression of PP5 was initially determined by Northern blot analysis probing for levels of PP5 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). PP5 mRNA was detected using a PP5-specific cDNA probe, which forms a hybrid with a single ∼2.3-kilobase transcript. A comparison of PP5 mRNA levels in A549 human lung carcinoma cells treated with 300 nm PP5-specific antisense oligonucleotides in the presence of cationic lipids is shown in Fig. 1. The cationic lipids (DOTMA/DOPE; Lipofectin®) were used to facilitate the uptake of the oligonucleotides (36Bennett C.F. Chiang M.Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar), and the reduction in PP5 mRNA levels observed in response to treatment was varied. Treatment with some oligonucleotides had little or no effect on the inhibition of PP5 mRNA levels, while others had a moderate effect and a few had pronounced effects (Fig. 1 B). The antisense oligonucleotide with the most potent activity against PP5 mRNA identified in this series was ISIS 14504, which targets a region contained in the 3′-untranslated region of PP5. To increase the potency of 14504, oligonucleotides containing additional modifications were synthesized and tested. One oligonucleotide (ISIS 15534), in which the “oligodeoxy gap” region was increased from 8 to 10 contiguous phosphorothioate nucleotides, proved more potent than ISIS 14504, and was chosen for further development. All of the effective oligonucleotides and several of the oligonucleotides with moderate or no effect were also tested against other human cell lines (T-24 bladder carcinoma and TR9-7 human fibroblasts) for effects on the expression of PP5 mRNA levels with essentially identical results. Western analysis indicates that the treatment of cells with ISIS 15534 also effectively decreases PP5 protein levels in <18 h (Fig.1 F). To examine the specificity of ISIS 15534-mediated effects on PP5 mRNA expression, the effects of ISIS 15534 and mismatch control analogues (i.e. ISIS 15521) were tested. The mismatch control analogues contain the same base composition as ISIS 15534 but with sequences noncomplementary to PP5 (i.e. ISIS 15521). As seen in Fig. 1, D and E, treatment of A459 cells with ISIS 15534 caused a dose-dependent reduction of PP5 mRNA levels with an IC50 ≅ 50 nm. No effect was observed following treatment with the mismatch controls (i.e. ISIS 15521), even when applied at concentrations 10 times that of the IC50 for ISIS 15534. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe to demonstrate equal RNA loading. Studies with additional mismatch controls and different cell types produced similar results (data not shown). To further test the specificity of the antisense oligonucleotides targeting PP5 mRNA, the effect of ISIS 15534 on expression of other cellular mRNA was evaluated. As seen in Fig. 1, D andG, ISIS 15534 has no effect on the expression of structurally related PPases (PP1, PP2A, PP4) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in A549 cells, even at a concentration of 500 nm (Fig. 1 G). Since the sequence targeted by ISIS 15534 is not contained in PP1, PP2A, PP4, or GAPDH, ISIS 15534 would not be expected to inhibit the expression of these proteins if ISIS 15534 is inhibiting the expression of PP5 mRNA via an antisense mechanism. Similar effects were also observed with T-24 bladder carcinoma cells and TR9-7 human fibroblast"
https://openalex.org/W1987148306,"The effect of suramin, a well known antitrypanosomal drug and a novel experimental agent for the treatment of several cancers, on protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) has been examined. Suramin is a reversible and competitive PTPase inhibitor withK is values in the low μm range, whereas the K is for the dual specificity phosphatase VHR is at least 10-fold higher. Although suramin can also inhibit the activity of the potato acid phosphatase at a slightly higher concentration, it is 2–3 orders of magnitude less effective against the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 1α and the bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Suramin binds to the active site of PTPases with a binding stoichiometry of 1:1. Furthermore, when suramin is bound to the active site of PTPases, its fluorescence is enhanced approximately by 10-fold. This property has allowed the determination of the binding affinity of suramin for PTPases and several catalytically impaired mutant PTPases by fluorescence titration techniques. Thus, the active site Cys to Ser mutants bind suramin with similar affinity as the wild type, while the active site Arg to Ala mutant exhibits a 20-fold reduced affinity toward suramin. Interestingly, the general acid deficient Asp to Ala mutant PTPases display an enhanced affinity toward suramin, which is in accord with their use as improved “substrate-trapping” agents. That suramin is a high affinity PTPase inhibitor is consistent with the observation that suramin treatment of cancer cell lines leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. Given the pleiotropic effects of suramin on many enzyme systems and growth factor-receptor interactions, the exact in vivo actions of suramin require further detailed structure-activity investigation of suramin and its structural analogs.

Given the pleiotropic effects of suramin on many enzyme systems and growth factor-receptor interactions, the exact in vivo actions of suramin require further detailed structure-activity investigation of suramin and its structural analogs. Suramin is a polysulfonated naphthylurea compound (see Fig.1 A) that has been widely used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and onchocerciasis since the early 1920s (1Hawking F. Adv. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1978; 15: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It was originally synthesized by Bayer AG in 1916 based on the observation that trypan red and trypan blue exhibited trypanocidal activity (2Dressel J. Oesper R.E J. Chem. Educ. 1961; 38: 620-621Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3La Rocca R.V. Stein C.A. Danesi R. Myers C.E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since the last decade, many new and therapeutically significant properties of this compound have been identified. For example, suramin has been shown to prevent the infection of T lymphocytes by human immunodeficiency virus in vitro (4Mitsuya M. Popovic M. Yarchoan R. Matsushita S. Gallo R.C. Broder S. Science. 1984; 226: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Suramin has also been shown to exert antiproliferative activities by interfering with the binding of a number of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-β (5Williams L.T. Tremble P.M. Lavin M.F. Sunday M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5287-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hosang M. J. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6344-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to their corresponding receptors. The ability of suramin to block the activity of several growth factors that play important role in tumor cell biology has prompted studies directed at the use of suramin as an antineoplastic agent (3La Rocca R.V. Stein C.A. Danesi R. Myers C.E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, subsequent investigations have shown that suramin exhibits antitumor activity against several metastatic cancers such as renal cancer, adrenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and prostate cancer (11Stein C.A. LaRocca R.V. Thomas R. McAtee N. Myers C.E. J. Clin. Oncol. 1989; 7: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar).If the antitumor property of suramin is solely due to its ability to antagonize the activity of growth factors that stimulate the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors, one would expect a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation in cancer cells upon exposure to suramin. Unexpectedly, suramin treatment of epidermal carcinoma and several prostate, breast, gastric, and colon cancer cell lines causes rapid and dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (13Sartor O. McLellan C.A. Myers C.E. Borner M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Cardinali M. Sartor O. Robbins K.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations cast doubt about the notion that the antitumor action of suramin simply arises from abrogation of growth factor functions and suggest the possibility that suramin may suppress cell growth by altering directly the enzymatic activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate. PTPases, in conjunction with protein-tyrosine kinases, control the state of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins, which regulate a wide variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation and oncogenic transformation (15Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Although suramin is capable of reducing the activity of Ser/Thr kinases such as protein kinase C (17Hensey C.E. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,18Mahoney C.W. Azzi A. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5424-5428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cdc2 (19Bojanowski K. Nishio K. Fukuda M. Larsen A.K. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the effect of suramin on protein-tyrosine kinase activity is unknown. Interestingly, suramin has also been reported to enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 kinase in a nuclear extract (19Bojanowski K. Nishio K. Fukuda M. Larsen A.K. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the tyrosine phosphatase activity of a preparation of immunoprecipitated plasma membrane bound CD45 in a noncompetitive and irreversible manner (20Ghosh J. Miller R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Given the structural and chemical nature of suramin (Fig.1 A), we were intrigued by the observation that suramin inhibits the CD45 phosphatase activity noncompetitively and irreversibly. Suramin lacks a reactive functionality and possesses six sulfonic acid groups attached directly to aromatic rings. Thus, it is possible that suramin may bind the PTPase active site, which recognize phosphotyrosine (21Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and acts as a competitive, reversible PTPase inhibitor. This possibility together with the observation that suramin enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation level of several proteins in tumor cells and in Cdc2 prompted us to carry out detailed kinetic and binding studies on homogeneous recombinant Yersinia PTPase, the mammalian PTP1B, and several active site-directed mutant PTPases in order to define the mode of action of suramin on PTPases. Furthermore, we have also studied the effect of suramin on the reaction catalyzed by the dual specificity phosphatase VHR, the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 1α, the potato acid phosphatase, and the bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase.DISCUSSIONWe have examined the effect of suramin on two representative PTPases, human PTP1B and the Yersinia PTPase, both of which have been extensively characterized biochemically and structurally (36Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Included in the PTPase superfamily is a subfamily of enzymes called dual specificity phosphatases that can catalyze the hydrolysis of not only phosphotyrosine but also phosphoserine/threonine (37Guan K.L. Broyles S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The effect of suramin on the human dual specificity phosphatase VHR, the best characterized member of this family of phosphatases, is also investigated. Using a variety of kinetic and fluorescence titration techniques, we show that suramin is indeed a high affinity PTPase inhibitor. In addition, we demonstrate that the mode of suramin inhibition is competitive and that the binding of suramin to the PTPases and VHR is rapid and reversible. Finally, we conclude that the binding stoichiometry of suramin to PTPases is 1:1 and suramin binds directly to the active site of the PTPases and VHR. These results are in direct contrast to a previous report that suramin inhibits the phosphatase activity of the receptor-like PTPase CD45 noncompetitively and irreversibly (20Ghosh J. Miller R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We do not know the source for this discrepancy. We note that, in the early work, an immunoprecipitated plasma membrane-bound CD45 preparation was used, while in our experiments, homogeneous recombinant PTPases were employed.Although the amino acid sequence of the Yersinia PTPase is only ∼20% identical to PTP1B, it is clear that their structures share a common secondary structural scaffold, with close similarity in tertiary structure (25Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 26Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, the majority of the residues conserved among PTPases are located in and around the phosphotyrosine-binding site. Thus it is not surprising that PTP1B and the Yersinia PTPase bind suramin with similar affinity. The dual specificity phosphatases share little sequence identity with the PTPases, except in the region of the active site phosphate binding loop. The three-dimensional structure of the dual specificity phosphatase VHR reveals a general fold that occurs in the PTPases, which retains many of the secondary and tertiary structural elements characteristic of PTPases (38Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It appears that the dual specificity phosphatases and the PTPases also utilize a common chemical mechanism for phosphate monoester hydrolysis (36Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the affinity of VHR for suramin is 10–40-fold lower than those of the PTPases.To answer the question whether suramin displays a special affinity for PTPases, we also examined the ability of suramin to inhibitpNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by the nonspecific acid and alkaline phosphatases as well as protein phosphatase 1α. At the pH optima for activity measurement, suramin inhibits the potato acid phosphatase-catalyzed reaction noncompetitively, with dissociation constants severalfold higher than those of the PTPases, whereas suramin is not an effective inhibitor for protein phosphatase 1α and alkaline phosphatase, with dissociation constants 2 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the PTPases. Thus it does not appear that suramin inhibit phosphatases nondiscriminately.We have also established that sulfosalicylic acid is a competitive inhibitor for the Yersinia PTPase. However, the affinity of sulfosalicylic acid for the Yersinia PTPase is 5,700-fold lower than that of suramin. This implies that structural features in addition to the aryl sulfonate motif in suramin are required for high affinity binding. It is known that the phosphotyrosine binding site (the active site) of PTP1B possesses significant plasticity so that substituted naphthalene derivatives containing a difluoromethylenephosphonyl group can also be accommodated (39Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Yan X. Wang S. Jia Z. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the polysubstituted sulfonyl naphthalene moiety may be responsible for the enhanced affinity of suramin for PTPases. It is possible that the additional polysubstituted sulfonyl naphthalene moiety and/or other functionalities in suramin are also important for the high affinity binding.When suramin is bound to the active site of PTPases, its fluorescence is enhanced approximately 10-fold. This property makes suramin a valuable tool to study the ligand binding reaction for the catalytically impaired PTPase mutants. The active site Cys residue in PTPases acts as a nucleophile to attack the phosphorous atom on the substrate (40Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although replacing the Cys residue with a Ser residue abolishes the PTPase activity (27Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the mutant protein can still bind substrates, i.e. Tyr(P)-containing peptides/proteins (42Milarski K.L. Zhu G. Pearl C.G. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. MacLean D. Thieme-Sefler A. Zhang Z.-Y. Sawyer T. Decker S.J. Dixon J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Consistent with these observations, our work shows that PTP1B/C215S and Yersinia PTP/C403S retain similar affinity for suramin as the wild type enzymes. Elimination of the guanidinium side chain of Arg-409 in the YersiniaPTPase, a residue important for the binding of the phosphate group in a substrate, reduces the affinity of the PTPase for suramin by 20-fold, which is consistent with the conclusion that suramin binds to the PTPase active site. When the invariant catalytic Asp residue is changed to an Ala, the phosphatase activity of the general acid/base-deficient PTPases is reduced dramatically. Interestingly, the affinity of PTP1B/D181A and Yersinia PTP/D356A for substrate and suramin increases by 5–30-fold. This is consistent with the observation that the general acid-deficient mutant PTPase is a better “substrate-trapping” reagent than is the active site Cys to Ser mutant for the identification of physiological PTPase substratesin vivo (45Flint A.W. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar).Suramin is being evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. It is believed that the beneficial effects of suramin treatment derive from its ability to block the activity of a number of growth factors. The concentration of suramin required for maximal effect was within clinically achievable and tolerable plasma suramin levels (300 μg/ml) (12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). This concentration (200 μm) of suramin is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that required to shut down the in vitro activity of PTPases, which play important roles in regulating signal transduction processes initiated by growth factors. This large difference between the therapeutically effective serum suramin concentration and the concentration required to inhibit PTPasesin vitro may not be too surprising for the following reasons. It is known that suramin is highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin (46Collins J.M. Klecker R.W. Yarchoan R. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Redfield R.R. Broder S. Myers C.E. J. Clin. Pharm. 1986; 26: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 47Bos O.J. Vansterkenburg E.L.M. Boon J.P.C. Fischer M.J.E. Wilting J. Janssen L.H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1595-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which may reduce the effective free suramin concentration in circulation. Furthermore, because of its charge, suramin is membrane impermeable and has to be actively transported into cells (12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of suramin inside the cell may well be much lower than the therapeutic suramin concentration in the serum. It is possible that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins and some of the beneficial effects by suramin treatment may come from the inhibition of PTPases.In addition to the growth factors and PTPases, suramin also exerts pleiotropic effects on a variety of enzyme systems. For example, within the concentration range between 1 and 100 μm, suramin can inhibit the activity of protein kinase C (17Hensey C.E. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Mahoney C.W. Azzi A. Huang K.P. J. Biol.

Clearly, a detailed understanding of the effects of suramin in vivo and which of these effects are important for the antitumor activity requires further systematic structure-activity studies of suramin and its structural analogs.

LaRocca R.V. Thomas R. McAtee N. Myers C.E. J. Clin. Oncol. 1989; 7: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). If the antitumor property of suramin is solely due to its ability to antagonize the activity of growth factors that stimulate the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors, one would expect a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation in cancer cells upon exposure to suramin. Unexpectedly, suramin treatment of epidermal carcinoma and several prostate, breast, gastric, and colon cancer cell lines causes rapid and dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (13Sartor O. McLellan C.A. Myers C.E. Borner M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Cardinali M. Sartor O. Robbins K.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations cast doubt about the notion that the antitumor action of suramin simply arises from abrogation of growth factor functions and suggest the possibility that suramin may suppress cell growth by altering directly the enzymatic activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate. PTPases, in conjunction with protein-tyrosine kinases, control the state of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins, which regulate a wide variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation and oncogenic transformation (15Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Although suramin is capable of reducing the activity of Ser/Thr kinases such as protein kinase C (17Hensey C.E. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,18Mahoney C.W. Azzi A. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5424-5428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cdc2 (19Bojanowski K. Nishio K. Fukuda M. Larsen A.K. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the effect of suramin on protein-tyrosine kinase activity is unknown. Interestingly, suramin has also been reported to enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 kinase in a nuclear extract (19Bojanowski K. Nishio K. Fukuda M. Larsen A.K. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the tyrosine phosphatase activity of a preparation of immunoprecipitated plasma membrane bound CD45 in a noncompetitive and irreversible manner (20Ghosh J. Miller R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given the structural and chemical nature of suramin (Fig.1 A), we were intrigued by the observation that suramin inhibits the CD45 phosphatase activity noncompetitively and irreversibly. Suramin lacks a reactive functionality and possesses six sulfonic acid groups attached directly to aromatic rings. Thus, it is possible that suramin may bind the PTPase active site, which recognize phosphotyrosine (21Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and acts as a competitive, reversible PTPase inhibitor. This possibility together with the observation that suramin enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation level of several proteins in tumor cells and in Cdc2 prompted us to carry out detailed kinetic and binding studies on homogeneous recombinant Yersinia PTPase, the mammalian PTP1B, and several active site-directed mutant PTPases in order to define the mode of action of suramin on PTPases. Furthermore, we have also studied the effect of suramin on the reaction catalyzed by the dual specificity phosphatase VHR, the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 1α, the potato acid phosphatase, and the bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase. DISCUSSIONWe have examined the effect of suramin on two representative PTPases, human PTP1B and the Yersinia PTPase, both of which have been extensively characterized biochemically and structurally (36Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Included in the PTPase superfamily is a subfamily of enzymes called dual specificity phosphatases that can catalyze the hydrolysis of not only phosphotyrosine but also phosphoserine/threonine (37Guan K.L. Broyles S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The effect of suramin on the human dual specificity phosphatase VHR, the best characterized member of this family of phosphatases, is also investigated. Using a variety of kinetic and fluorescence titration techniques, we show that suramin is indeed a high affinity PTPase inhibitor. In addition, we demonstrate that the mode of suramin inhibition is competitive and that the binding of suramin to the PTPases and VHR is rapid and reversible. Finally, we conclude that the binding stoichiometry of suramin to PTPases is 1:1 and suramin binds directly to the active site of the PTPases and VHR. These results are in direct contrast to a previous report that suramin inhibits the phosphatase activity of the receptor-like PTPase CD45 noncompetitively and irreversibly (20Ghosh J. Miller R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We do not know the source for this discrepancy. We note that, in the early work, an immunoprecipitated plasma membrane-bound CD45 preparation was used, while in our experiments, homogeneous recombinant PTPases were employed.Although the amino acid sequence of the Yersinia PTPase is only ∼20% identical to PTP1B, it is clear that their structures share a common secondary structural scaffold, with close similarity in tertiary structure (25Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 26Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, the majority of the residues conserved among PTPases are located in and around the phosphotyrosine-binding site. Thus it is not surprising that PTP1B and the Yersinia PTPase bind suramin with similar affinity. The dual specificity phosphatases share little sequence identity with the PTPases, except in the region of the active site phosphate binding loop. The three-dimensional structure of the dual specificity phosphatase VHR reveals a general fold that occurs in the PTPases, which retains many of the secondary and tertiary structural elements characteristic of PTPases (38Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It appears that the dual specificity phosphatases and the PTPases also utilize a common chemical mechanism for phosphate monoester hydrolysis (36Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the affinity of VHR for suramin is 10–40-fold lower than those of the PTPases.To answer the question whether suramin displays a special affinity for PTPases, we also examined the ability of suramin to inhibitpNPP hydrolysis catalyzed by the nonspecific acid and alkaline phosphatases as well as protein phosphatase 1α. At the pH optima for activity measurement, suramin inhibits the potato acid phosphatase-catalyzed reaction noncompetitively, with dissociation constants severalfold higher than those of the PTPases, whereas suramin is not an effective inhibitor for protein phosphatase 1α and alkaline phosphatase, with dissociation constants 2 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the PTPases. Thus it does not appear that suramin inhibit phosphatases nondiscriminately.We have also established that sulfosalicylic acid is a competitive inhibitor for the Yersinia PTPase. However, the affinity of sulfosalicylic acid for the Yersinia PTPase is 5,700-fold lower than that of suramin. This implies that structural features in addition to the aryl sulfonate motif in suramin are required for high affinity binding. It is known that the phosphotyrosine binding site (the active site) of PTP1B possesses significant plasticity so that substituted naphthalene derivatives containing a difluoromethylenephosphonyl group can also be accommodated (39Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Yan X. Wang S. Jia Z. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the polysubstituted sulfonyl naphthalene moiety may be responsible for the enhanced affinity of suramin for PTPases. It is possible that the additional polysubstituted sulfonyl naphthalene moiety and/or other functionalities in suramin are also important for the high affinity binding.When suramin is bound to the active site of PTPases, its fluorescence is enhanced approximately 10-fold. This property makes suramin a valuable tool to study the ligand binding reaction for the catalytically impaired PTPase mutants. The active site Cys residue in PTPases acts as a nucleophile to attack the phosphorous atom on the substrate (40Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although replacing the Cys residue with a Ser residue abolishes the PTPase activity (27Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the mutant protein can still bind substrates, i.e. Tyr(P)-containing peptides/proteins (42Milarski K.L. Zhu G. Pearl C.G. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. MacLean D. Thieme-Sefler A. Zhang Z.-Y. Sawyer T. Decker S.J. Dixon J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Consistent with these observations, our work shows that PTP1B/C215S and Yersinia PTP/C403S retain similar affinity for suramin as the wild type enzymes. Elimination of the guanidinium side chain of Arg-409 in the YersiniaPTPase, a residue important for the binding of the phosphate group in a substrate, reduces the affinity of the PTPase for suramin by 20-fold, which is consistent with the conclusion that suramin binds to the PTPase active site. When the invariant catalytic Asp residue is changed to an Ala, the phosphatase activity of the general acid/base-deficient PTPases is reduced dramatically. Interestingly, the affinity of PTP1B/D181A and Yersinia PTP/D356A for substrate and suramin increases by 5–30-fold. This is consistent with the observation that the general acid-deficient mutant PTPase is a better “substrate-trapping” reagent than is the active site Cys to Ser mutant for the identification of physiological PTPase substratesin vivo (45Flint A.W. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar).Suramin is being evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. It is believed that the beneficial effects of suramin treatment derive from its ability to block the activity of a number of growth factors. The concentration of suramin required for maximal effect was within clinically achievable and tolerable plasma suramin levels (300 μg/ml) (12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). This concentration (200 μm) of suramin is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that required to shut down the in vitro activity of PTPases, which play important roles in regulating signal transduction processes initiated by growth factors. This large difference between the therapeutically effective serum suramin concentration and the concentration required to inhibit PTPasesin vitro may not be too surprising for the following reasons. It is known that suramin is highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin (46Collins J.M. Klecker R.W. Yarchoan R. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Redfield R.R. Broder S. Myers C.E. J. Clin. Pharm. 1986; 26: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 47Bos O.J. Vansterkenburg E.L.M. Boon J.P.C. Fischer M.J.E. Wilting J. Janssen L.H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1595-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which may reduce the effective free suramin concentration in circulation. Furthermore, because of its charge, suramin is membrane impermeable and has to be actively transported into cells (12Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of suramin inside the cell may well be much lower than the therapeutic suramin concentration in the serum. It is possible that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular proteins and some of the beneficial effects by suramin treatment may come from the inhibition of PTPases.In addition to the growth factors and PTPases, suramin also exerts pleiotropic effects on a variety of enzyme systems. For example, within the concentration range between 1 and 100 μm, suramin can inhibit the activity of protein kinase C (17Hensey C.E. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A.

Clearly, a detailed understanding of the effects of suramin in vivo and which of these effects are important for the antitumor activity requires further systematic structure-activity studies of suramin and its structural analogs.

Deletion of the N-terminal lectin-like domain and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains 1 and 2 had no effect on TAFI or protein C activation, whereas deletions including EGF-like domain 3 selectively abolished thrombomodulin cofactor activity for TAFI activation. Provided that thrombomodulin EGF-like domain 3 was present, TAFI competitively inhibited protein C activation catalyzed by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. A thrombomodulin construct lacking EGF-like domain 3 functioned normally as a cofactor for protein C activation but was insensitive to inhibition by TAFI. Thus, the anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic cofactor activities of thrombomodulin have distinct structural requirements: protein C binding to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex requires EGF-like domain 4, whereas TAFI binding also requires EGF-like domain 3. Thrombomodulin is a cofactor protein on vascular endothelial cells that inhibits the procoagulant functions of thrombin and enhances thrombin-catalyzed activation of anticoagulant protein C.

Thrombomodulin is an integral membrane glycoprotein on vascular endothelial cells. By binding to thrombin in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, thrombomodulin inhibits the procoagulant functions of thrombin and acts as a cofactor for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C. Activated protein C degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and thereby inhibits blood clotting. This cofactor activity of thrombomodulin initiates an essential physiological anticoagulant mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 1Sadler J.E. Lentz S.R. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Wu Q.

Recently, a new activity of thrombomodulin was discovered; it accelerates the proteolytic activation by thrombin of a plasma procarboxypeptidase named thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). TAFI is identical to the protein first named carboxypeptidase U (16Hendriks D. Scharpe S. van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated TAFI (TAFIa) cleaves C-terminal lysine and arginine residues from partially degraded fibrin. The removal of these positively charged residues suppresses the ability of fibrin to catalyze plasminogen activation and thereby delays clot lysis (19Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). A fragment consisting of the six EGF-like domains of thrombomodulin can promote TAFI activation (3Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), but the structural elements required for cofactor activity have not been localized more precisely. In the present study, we demonstrate that TAFI activation requires EGF-like domain 3 of thrombomodulin and is inhibited competitively by protein C. Pure human thrombin was provided by Dr. M. Wardell (Washington University). Recombinant human protein C was obtained from Dr. S. B. Yang (Eli Lilly, Co.). Human TAFI and rabbit lung thrombomodulin were from Hematologic Technologies (Burlington, VT). Human antithrombin, porcine intestinal heparin, hippuryl-arginine (Hip-R), and d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethane were from Sigma. S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) was purchased from Chromogenix. Recombinant thrombomodulin fragment TM356 (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. S. R. Lentz (University of Iowa). TM356 concentrations were determined by acid hydrolysis and total amino acid compositional analysis as described previously (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pTM456 that encodes a fragment of human thrombomodulin corresponding to EGF-like domains 4–6 (residues Asp349–Cys462) was described previously (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reduce sensitivity to oxidative damage, the mutation Met388 → Leu (21Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was engineered into pTM456 by a polymerase chain reaction-based method to generate plasmid pTM456M/L. The cDNA insert of pTM456M/L was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into baculovirus expression vector pAcGP67A (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) between the BamHI andNotI sites to yield expression plasmid pAcGP67TM456, which was transfected into insect SF9 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) with BaculoGold™ DNA to produce recombinant virus. Large scale production of recombinant protein TM456 was performed by infection of High Five cells (PharMingen). TM456 was purified from serum-free culture medium by a combination of affinity chromatography on α-thrombin-Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) and Mono-Q ion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, purified TM456 migrated as a single band with an apparent mass of 23 kDa. By automated Edman degradation the N-terminal sequence was Ala-Asp-Pro-Cys-Phe-Arg-Ala-Asn-Cys-Glu-. Residue Ala1 is derived from the expression vector, and the sequence beginning at Asp2 corresponds to that expected for thrombomodulin. TM456 concentrations were determined spectroscopically using the calculated (22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) extinction coefficient ε280 nm of 5595m−1 cm−1 andM r of 16,500. Five stably transfected CV-1 cell lines expressing human thrombomodulin mutants TMnc, NdL, NdE1, NdE2, and NdE3 were cultured as described previously (10Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Dittman W.A. Wen D. Scarpati E.M. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10602-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Confluent cells from six T75 flasks were scraped into 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline; 5 ml/flask), resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and disrupted by 10 strokes in a 7-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, and cell membranes were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × gfor 60 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored at −70 °C. The thrombomodulin concentration of each preparation was determined by protein C activation assay as described previously (10Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a rabbit lung thrombomodulin standard. Thrombomodulin cofactor activity for protein C activation by thrombin was measured by a modification of a two-stage assay described previously (23Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Dittman W.A. Wen D. Scarpati E.M. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10602-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the first stage, thrombomodulin was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, with the indicated concentrations of thrombin and protein C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 150 μg/ml antithrombin containing 150 units/ml heparin. Amidolytic activity of activated protein C was assayed in the second stage by adding 120 μl of 200 μm S-2366. Hydrolysis of the substrate S-2366 was measured as increasing absorbance at 405 nm in a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Thrombomodulin cofactor activity for TAFI activation by thrombin was measured by a two-stage assay. In the first stage, thrombomodulin was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, with the indicated concentrations of thrombin and TAFI, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 60 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethane. In the second stage, the carboxypeptidase activity of TAFIa was assayed by adding 150 μl of 30 mm Hip-R. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 nHCl. The hippuric acid product was extracted by vortexing the reaction mixture with 750 μl of ethyl acetate. A portion of the ethyl acetate layer (500 μl) was transferred into a new tube, evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac (Savant), and redissolved in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Absorbance at 254 nm was measured, and the concentration of hippuric acid was calculated using the experimentally determined extinction coefficient ε254 nm of 511 μm−1 cm−1. Control experiments confirmed that the Hip-R substrate contained minimal material absorbing at 254 nm that could be extracted into ethyl acetate and that liberated hippuric acid was extracted efficiently. 5.1 nm. Cofactor activity for TAFI activation was strikingly different (Fig. 1 C). N-terminal deletion through EGF-like domain 2 had no detrimental effect, and the EC50 of TMnc, NdL, NdE1, and NdE2 was 1.6–2.0 nm. However, deletion of EGF-like domain 3 reduced the rate of TAFI activation to that observed in the absence of thrombomodulin. The kinetics of TAFI activation were investigated for each thrombomodulin variant (Fig. 2). Preliminary studies indicated that the apparent K dof thrombin binding to full-length thrombomodulin (TMnc) was ≈0.3 nm (data not shown) and under the assay conditions (1 nm thrombomodulin, 5 nm thrombin) > 90% of thrombomodulin was bound to thrombin. Therefore in these experiments the concentration of thrombin-thrombomodulin complex was ≈1 nm. Four of the thrombomodulin species exhibited similar dependence on TAFI concentration (Fig. 2, A–D). As determined by nonlinear regression, the values forK m (TAFI, in μm) were 1.79 ± 0.12 for TMnc, 1.81 ± 0.24 for NdL, 2.13 ± 0.18 for NdE1, and 1.67 ± 0.03 for NdE2. The values fork cat also were similar, ranging from 0.41 to 0.45 s−1. In contrast, the rate of TAFI activation in the presence of thrombomodulin NdE3 (Fig. 2 E) was extremely slow and indistinguishable from that observed in the absence of thrombomodulin (Fig. 2 F). These data indicate that the N-terminal lectin domain and EGF-like domains 1 and 2 of thrombomodulin are dispensable for the acceleration of TAFI activation, whereas EGF-like domain 3 is required. In addition to EGF-like domain 3, EGF-like domains 5 and 6 of thrombomodulin are necessary for TAFI activation, because they are required for thrombin binding (9Kurosawa S. Stearns D.J. Jackson K.W. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF-like domain 4 is known to be essential for protein C activation (8Zushi M. Gomi K. Yamamoto S. Maruyama I. Hayashi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10351-10353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of EGF-like domain 4 in TAFI activation, two soluble thrombomodulin mutants were compared. Construct TM456 contains amino acid residues Asp349–Cys462 and corresponds to EGF-like domains 4–6. Construct TM356 is similar, but EGF-like domain 4 (residues Cys351–Cys386) is replaced by EGF-like domain 3 (Cys311–Cys344) (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both TM456 and TM356 bind thrombin with similar affinity (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously (20Lentz S.R. Chen Y. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15312-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein C was activated by thrombin in the presence of TM456, and replacement of EGF-like domain 4 with EGF-like domain 3 in TM356 resulted in complete loss of cofactor activity (Fig.3 A). TM456 was inactive when tested for the ability to promote TAFI activation (Fig. 3 B), and this result is consistent with the observation that membrane-associated thrombomodulin NdE3 has no cofactor activity for TAFI activation (Fig. 1 C). TM356 also did not support TAFI activation (Fig. 3 B). Thus, EGF-like domain 4 may be required for thrombomodulin-dependent activation of both protein C and TAFI. EGF-like domain 3 may contribute to TAFI activation by promoting either substrate binding or catalysis. These possibilities were addressed by determining whether TAFI could inhibit protein C activation in the presence of thrombomodulins TMnc, NdE2, and NdE3 (Fig.4). In the absence of TAFI, all three thrombomodulins had similar cofactor activity for protein C activation. In the presence of TAFI, protein C activation catalyzed by TMnc and NdE2 was inhibited ≈40%. Separate control experiments showed that neither TAFI nor TAFIa inhibits the amidolytic activity of activated protein C (data not shown). Furthermore, protein C activation in the presence of thrombomodulin lacking EGF-like domain 3 (NdE3) was resistant to inhibition by TAFI (Fig. 4). These results suggest that TAFI does not interact directly with protein C and thereby prevent protein C binding to thrombin-thrombomodulin. In addition, EGF-like domain 3 appears to be required for TAFI binding to thrombin-thrombomodulin. Activation of TAFI or protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex depends on distinct EGF-like domains, suggesting that these substrates might bind independently even though they are cleaved by the same protease active site. To characterize the relationship between protein C and TAFI binding, the kinetic interactions between them were investigated. As shown in Fig.5 A, TAFI inhibits protein C activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Lineweaver-Burk analysis (Fig. 5 A, inset) indicates that TAFI is a competitive inhibitor of protein C with aK i (TAFI) of 1.89 μm. This value is similar to the K m (TAFI) of 1.79 μmdetermined with TMnc (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the reciprocal experiment showed that protein C is a competitive inhibitor of TAFI activation with a K i of 2.98 μm (Fig.5 B, inset). This value for K iis similar to the value for K m (protein C) of 2.35 μm determined independently with the same thrombomodulin preparation (data not shown). For comparison, K mvalues for protein C have been reported with recombinant soluble human thrombomodulin variants of 1.4 μm (with glycosaminoglycan modification) to 2.3 μm (without glycosaminoglycan modification) (24Parkinson J.F. Grinnell B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated that TAFIa activity decays with a half-life of ≈10 min as reported previously (25Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), that neither protein C nor activated protein C affect the stability of TAFIa, and that the rate of TAFI activation by thrombin-TMnc was linear during the 10-min assay (data not shown). Thus, TAFI and protein C cannot bind simultaneously to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. The discovery that thrombomodulin promoted TAFI activation (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) immediately raised the question of whether this reaction might depend on structural features of thrombomodulin distinct from those required for protein C activation. Fragments of thrombomodulin that contain only EGF-like domains 4–6 have essentially normal cofactor activity for the promotion of protein C activation. The other domains of thrombomodulin are conserved among mammals, however, suggesting they may have important biological functions, possibly unrelated to the protein C anticoagulant pathway. As previously noted for protein C activation, TAFI activation did not require the thrombomodulin lectin domain (3Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or membrane association (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In a preliminary experiment, we found that a recombinant thrombomodulin fragment consisting of EGF-like domains 4–6 was unable to promote TAFI activation, even though it was fully functional in protein C activation; this observation focused attention on EGF-like domains 1–3. Further studies of deletion mutants have identified a domain of thrombomodulin that appears to be specifically required for TAFI activation (Figs. 1 and 2). Thrombomodulin NdE2 promoted the activation of both protein C and TAFI, whereas thrombomodulin NdE3 only supported the activation of protein C. The difference between these constructs encompasses thrombomodulin residues Asp309–Pro347. This segment includes EGF-like domain 3 (residues Cys311–Cys344) as well as two N-terminal (Asp-Asp) and three C-terminal (Val-Glu-Pro) flanking amino acids. Therefore, a 39-amino acid residue segment consisting mostly of EGF-like domain 3 is necessary for thrombomodulin-dependent TAFI activation. The properties of thrombomodulin fragments TM456 and TM356 (Fig. 3) suggest that EGF-like domain 3 cannot promote TAFI activation in the absence of EGF-like domain 4. Because we have no independent evidence that EGF-like domain 3 is correctly folded in TM356, this conclusion will require confirmation by other approaches. Because TAFI activation does not depend on sequences C-terminal to EGF-like domain 6 (3Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the smallest thrombomodulin fragment with full anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic cofactor activity may consist of EGF-like domains 3–6. The required features of EGF-like domain 3 and its flanking residues remain to be defined by additional mutagenesis and biochemical analysis. Additional features of the thrombomodulin cofactor mechanism were identified by the analysis of enzyme kinetics. TAFI and protein C bind competitively to thrombin-thrombomodulin (Fig. 5), even though activation of these substrates depends on different structural features of thrombomodulin. The binding sites for TAFI and protein C may therefore overlap or be linked conformationally. Interestingly, deletion of EGF-like domain 3 prevented TAFI from interfering with the activation of protein C (Fig. 4). Thus, EGF-like domain 4 interacts with protein C but may not interact with TAFI, and EGF-like domain 3 is required for TAFI binding but is dispensable for protein C binding. The inhibition data (Fig. 4) suggest that TAFI cannot even bind unproductively to a complex of thrombin-thrombomodulin that lacks EGF-like domain 3. In contrast to this result, TAFI clearly binds to free thrombin because thrombin cleaves TAFI with aK m of 2.1 μm, and TAFI inhibits thrombin cleavage of a chromogenic substrate with aK i of ≈1.2 μm (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a model in which thrombin and thrombin-thrombomodulin have different modes of binding to TAFI; in the absence of EGF-like domain 3, thrombin binding prevents TAFI binding to thrombomodulin. If EGF-like domain 3 is present, a TAFI binding site is created or restored in the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Although TAFI and protein C bind competitively to the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (Fig. 5), this competition probably cannot directly regulate the anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities of thrombomodulin in vivo. The plasma concentration of protein C is approximately 71 nm (26Stenflo J. Bertina R.M. Protein C and Related Proteins. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects. Churchill Livingstone, London1988: 21-54Google Scholar), and this is at least 20-fold lower than the K m values of 1.4–2.4 μm for cleavage of protein C by human thrombin-thrombomodulin (data not shown and Ref. 24Parkinson J.F. Grinnell B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the plasma concentration of TAFI is approximately 73 nm (15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) compared with its K m values of 0.5–2.1 μm (Fig. 2 and Refs. 15Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar and 25Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Consequently, changes in the concentration of one substrate would not significantly affect the activation of the other. However, decreases in the plasma concentration of protein C cause thrombosis (27Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin.

Until recently, the only known biological function of thrombomodulin was to bind thrombin and promote the activation of protein C, thus initiating an essential anticoagulant reaction pathway. The discovery of thrombomodulin-dependent TAFI activation showed that thrombomodulin also can initiate an antifibrinolytic reaction pathway. The present study characterizes a previously unknown function for EGF-like domain 3 in promoting TAFI activation, demonstrating that the anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities of thrombomodulin depend on distinct EGF-like domains. Further genetic and biochemical analysis will be required to determine whether additional structural domains of thrombomodulin have analogous independent functions.

Here we report that potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), a 39-amino acid protease inhibitor with three disulfide bridges, is an antagonist of human EGF. It competed with EGF for binding to EGFR and inhibited EGFR activation and cell proliferation induced by this growth factor.

Schofield P.N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 344-348Google Scholar). EGF, TGF-α, and their receptor, EGFR, seem to play a particularly prominent role in epithelial neoplasia (9Derynck R. Adv. Cancer.

In many tumors of epithelial origin (carcinomas), EGFR has been found to be overexpressed, and in some cases an autocrine loop involving TGF-α has been reported (2Aaronson S.

The increased levels of EGF, TGF-α, and EGFR produced by pancreatic tumors may provide tumor cells with a distinct growth advantage that contributes to the clinical aggressiveness of this malignancy.Given the importance of EGFR in carcinomas, disruption of the activation of EGFR appears to be an excellent target for cancer therapy (2Aaronson S. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Hynes N.E. Groner B. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 631-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cancer cells seem to have lost the normal redundancy in signal transduction pathways and so are preferentially vulnerable to signal interceptors. EGFR activation can be disrupted in several ways, including with EGF antagonists (19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and with antibodies directed against the EGFR (20Baselga J. Mendelsohn J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 127-154Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These three strategies have had various success ratios. Development of EGF/TGF-α antagonists by using short synthetic fragments of both growth factors has not been successful (19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the development of tumors in animal models but have toxic side effects (13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the use of antibodies seems to have some efficiency as antitumor treatment and it is being tested in clinical trials.In the study presented here, we show that potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), a proteinaceous protease inhibitor, is an antagonist of human EGF with antitumor properties. Some protease inhibitors have been reported to serve as cancer-chemopreventive agents, because they can substantially suppress radiation- and chemical-induced malignant transformation in vitro and have strong anticarcinogenic activity in vivo (21Billings P.C. Morrow A.R. Ryan C.A. Kennedy A.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy A.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1999-2005PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kennedy A. Beazer-Barclay Y. Kinzler K.W. Newberne P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 679-682PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for this activity are unknown.PCI is a 39-amino acid protein naturally occurring in potatoes that can form complexes with several metallo-carboxypeptidases, inhibiting them in a strong competitive way with a K i in the nanomolar range (24Hass J.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have developed a procedure to obtain the inhibitor in a recombinant form in Escherichia coli(25Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Molina M.A. Marino C. Oliva B. Avilés F.X. Querol E. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1994; 41: 632-637Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Its structure is known in aqueous solution (28Clore G.M. Groneborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and in crystal complex with carboxypeptidase A (29Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The 27-residue globular core of PCI is stabilized by three disulfide bridges. Residues 35–39 form a C-terminal tail that docks on the carboxypeptidase A active center. PCI contains a small cysteine-rich module, called a T-knot scaffold, that is shared by several different protein families, including the EGF family (30McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 31Sun P.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ling S.L. Nussinov R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).We report here that PCI is an antagonistic analogue of human EGF, the first one described. PCI bound to EGFR and inhibited its activation by EGF. The structural similarities of PCI with this and other growth factors probably account for its properties as EGF antagonist. In addition, PCI inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cell lines and tumors transplanted in nude mice. Our results indicate that these antitumor properties are probably a result of the EGF antagonistic activity of PCI.DISCUSSIONMuch effort is currently being devoted to finding new molecules that target signal transduction pathways (13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), including antagonists that bind to growth factor receptors without activating them (8Zumkeller W. Schofield P.N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 344-348Google Scholar, 19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,20Baselga J. Mendelsohn J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 127-154Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such antagonists are of both theoretical and clinical interest, because they can lead to a better understanding of the interactions responsible for the binding of growth factors to their receptors and can be used as new antitumor drugs.The EGFR is one of the most studied growth factor receptors due to its importance in the development and functionality of epidermal tissues as well as carcinomas, where it is frequently overexpressed. Both EGF and TGF-α bind to this receptor, whose activation initiates a cascade of biological processes (42Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and is required for proliferation in many cell types and cancer cells. Despite its importance, no antagonist for human EGF has been reported so far. An inhibitory ligand of theDrosophila homologue of the mammalian EGFR has been recently described (43Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibodies against human EGFR have been produced (44Wu X. Fan Z. Masui H. Rosen N. Mendelsohn J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). PCI is, however, the first reported antagonistic analogue of human EGF that is able to bind to EGFR without eliciting the activation of the receptor. In addition, PCI can suppress tumor cell growth, probably as a result of diminished EGFR activation.The results of the binding experiments presented here demonstrated that PCI competed with EGF for binding to EGFR. The affinity of the receptor for EGF was higher than for PCI, as was expected. The internalization of PCI by the cells observed by using fluorescent labeling was perhaps a consequence of the endocytosis of the EGFR once it was bound to PCI. Some indirect evidence supports this hypothesis. First, after internalization PCI was located around the nucleus, as is EGF (45Fish E.N. Ghislain J. Trogadis J. Stevens J.K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5148-5157PubMed Google Scholar). Second, PCI underwent several cycles of appearance and disappearance from the culture medium, which might have been produced by the recycling and lysosomal degradation of the receptor (7Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This reappearance in the culture medium of a dissociated recycled ligand has also been observed in the case of EGF (46French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Third, PCI was not altered by the cells, which rules out the possibility that PCI binds to a membrane metallo-carboxypeptidase, given that the last residue of the inhibitor is quickly cleaved when it binds to these kinds of enzymes (24Hass J.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar).PCI not only bound to EGFR, but it also inhibited the activation of the receptor induced by EGF. The experiments performed in serum-starved Capan-1 and A431 cells demonstrated that PCI binding did not significantly activate EGFR and that the inhibitor blocked the EGF-induced increase in the kinase activity of the receptor and the transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Fig. 7). In serum-starved cells, the level of EGFR activation was low, raising very significantly after addition of EGF. By contrast, in cells growing in presence of FBS, a significant level of EGFR activation was observed, probably as a result of the presence of growth factors in serum capable of activating the receptor. In these conditions, the addition of EGF did not have any effect on the level of EGFR activation. In contrast, PCI reduced the kinase activity of the receptor in a significant way, suggesting that it competed with the growth factors present in serum for binding to EGFR (Fig. 8 A). In all the previous experiments, the cells were incubated with PCI only for 10 min. When the inhibitor was maintained for 6 days in the culture medium of A431 cells growing with serum, the reduction in the kinase activity of the receptor was stronger, perhaps because of the PCI-induced down-regulation of EGFR (Fig. 8 B).Computer-based analysis showed that PCI had clear structural similarities to EGF that can explain its antagonistic activity. Both PCI and EGF are small proteins with three disulfide bridges arranged in a special scaffold called the T-knot. We developed a computer program to superimpose proteins by structural alignment of the disulfide bridges. When applied to PCI and growth factors such as EGF, TGF-α, and heregulin, it revealed that two loops of the inhibitor and part of its C-terminal tail superimposed onto the corresponding growth factor loops. It also revealed that some residues of EGF involved in receptor binding (19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) fit in the space with residues of PCI with similar physico-chemical properties (Fig. 4).The inhibitory effect of PCI on the growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines was demonstrated in a variety of conditions. In the case of Capan-1 cells growing in medium with serum, the effect of PCI was apparent after 7–10 days of culture (Fig. 1) and was only observed when the PCI concentration was higher than 10 μg/ml. These findings correlate with the results obtained from cell cycle analyses, which indicated that after 12 days of treatment with PCI, the percentage of apoptotic cells significantly increased over the control values. A small increase in the number of cells in the G0-G1 phase was also observed. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Wu et al. (44Wu X. Fan Z. Masui H. Rosen N. Mendelsohn J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody against EGFR that blocks EGF binding and inhibits the proliferation of many tumor cell lines. They found that in some lines this antibody induced G1 arrest or apoptosis. The effects of PCI on cell cycle traversal could explain the inhibition of cell growth induced by this protein.The results obtained in the proliferation experiments using serum-starved Capan-1 cells indicate that the antiproliferative effect of PCI is probably due to the fact that it is an EGF antagonist. When EGF was added to serum-starved Capan-1 cells, it stimulated cell proliferation, but this effect was abolished if PCI was administered simultaneously to the cells. This result is in perfect agreement with those obtained when studying EGFR activation. By contrast, the stimulatory effect of insulin on Capan-1 cell growth was not affected by the presence of PCI. The inhibitor is therefore capable of specifically suppressing the EGF proliferative effect on serum-starved Capan-1 cells. In cells growing in medium with FBS, PCI probably competes with the growth factors present in serum capable of binding to EGFR, as EGFR activation experiments indicate, and blocks their proliferative effect. This offers an explanation for the inhibitory effect of PCI on cells growing with serum.When Capan-1 cells were grown in presence of PCI for at least 3 weeks and then transferred into fresh medium, the growth rate of this cells even without PCI was significantly lower than that of control cells (Fig. 1 C). If protracted treatment with PCI can down-regulate EGFR, as some of our results seem to suggest (Fig.8 B), the lower amounts of EGFR could be responsible for the reduction in the growth rate of the treated cells.Some protease inhibitors have been reported to have anticarcinogenic properties (22Kennedy A.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1999-2005PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanisms responsible for these properties are unclear. We offer an explanation for the tumor growth suppressive activity of a protease inhibitor, PCI, showing that it acts as a growth factor antagonist. The effect of PCI on tumor growth seems attributable to its special topology and not to its protease-inhibitory activity. Several protease inhibitors with cancer-chemopreventive properties have a T-knot scaffold, and our work suggests that they may also act as growth factor antagonists.Several properties of PCI make it a good candidate for a therapeutic agent. First, it was able to inhibit the development of human adenocarcinoma tumors transplantated into nude mice without inducing any observable toxic side effects. This fact is particularly interesting because there are not effective treatments available for pancreatic cancer. Second, PCI is a small protein very resistant to denaturation and proteolytic degradation. And third, PCI had a long lasting inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines that was maintained even when it was removed from the culture medium. In addition, we have obtained a transgenic mice that develop insulinomas, and preliminary results indicate that PCI also reduces the growth of these tumors and increases the survival time of the animals. 3C. Blanco, M. A. Molina, M. L. Frazier, and R. de Llorens, manuscript in preparation.In summary, we have described the antitumor properties of PCI, a small protein with three disulfide bridges arranged in a T-knot, and we have demonstrated that it is the first antagonistic analogue of human EGF described. PCI is of both theoretical and clinical interest and opens the possibility of engineering PCI-like EGF antagonists with improved properties. At present, we are testing whether PCI can also inhibit the growth of other carcinoma cell lines expressing EGFR. That the most common cancers (lung, prostate, breast, and colon) are of epithelial origin gives an additional clinical interest to this approach.

Cancer cells seem to have lost the normal redundancy in signal transduction pathways and so are preferentially vulnerable to signal interceptors. EGFR activation can be disrupted in several ways, including with EGF antagonists (19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and with antibodies directed against the EGFR (20Baselga J. Mendelsohn J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 127-154Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These three strategies have had various success ratios. Development of EGF/TGF-α antagonists by using short synthetic fragments of both growth factors has not been successful (19Groenen L.C. Nice E. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the development of tumors in animal models but have toxic side effects (13Levitzki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the use of antibodies seems to have some efficiency as antitumor treatment and it is being tested in clinical trials. In the study presented here, we show that potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), a proteinaceous protease inhibitor, is an antagonist of human EGF with antitumor properties. Some protease inhibitors have been reported to serve as cancer-chemopreventive agents, because they can substantially suppress radiation- and chemical-induced malignant transformation in vitro and have strong anticarcinogenic activity in vivo (21Billings P.C. Morrow A.R. Ryan C.A. Kennedy A.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy A.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1999-2005PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kennedy A. Beazer-Barclay Y. Kinzler K.W. Newberne P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 679-682PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for this activity are unknown. PCI is a 39-amino acid protein naturally occurring in potatoes that can form complexes with several metallo-carboxypeptidases, inhibiting them in a strong competitive way with a K i in the nanomolar range (24Hass J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2012642649,"Sustained stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and other G protein-coupled receptors usually leads to a loss of receptor binding sites from the plasma membrane, referred to as receptor sequestration. Receptor sequestration can occur via endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane into the cell but may also be accomplished by other, as yet ill-defined, mechanisms. Previous work has indicated that the monomeric GTPase dynamin controls the endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors via clathrin-coated vesicles. To investigate whether mAChRs sequester in a receptor subtype-specific manner via dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated vesicles, we tested the effect of overexpressing the dominant-negative dynamin mutant K44A on m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 cells. The m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChRs sequestered rapidly in HEK-293 cells following agonist exposure but displayed dissimilar sequestration pathways. Overexpression of dynamin K44A mutant fully blocked m1 and m3 mAChR sequestration, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was not affected. Also, m4 mAChRs, which like m2 mAChRs preferentially couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, sequestered in a completely dynamin-dependent manner. Following agonist removal, sequestered m1 mAChRs fully reappeared on the cell surface, whereas sequestered m2 mAChRs did not. The distinct sequestration of m2 mAChRs was also apparent in COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. We conclude that the m2 mAChR displays unique subtype-specific sequestration that distinguishes this receptor from the m1, m3, and m4 subtypes. These results are the first to demonstrate that receptor sequestration represents a new type of receptor subtype-specific regulation within the family of mAChRs.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; NMS,N-methylscopolamine; QNB, quinuclidinylbenzilate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. belong to the superfamily of plasma membrane receptors that regulate a large number of signal transduction pathways via activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). The mAChR family consists of five subtypes of cloned mAChRs and can be subdivided into two functional groups: the m1, m3, and m5 subtypes, which preferentially couple to the Gq family of G proteins, and the m2 and m4 subtypes, which effectively activate the Gi family of G proteins. The m1, m2, m3, and m4 receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, whereas m5 receptors are present in only minute amounts in hippocampus and other areas of the brain (1Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure of mAChRs and other G protein-coupled receptors to agonists usually results in the attenuation of the cellular response. One molecular mechanism of attenuation involves the phosphorylation of the receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and increased binding of the inhibitory protein β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptors, thereby inhibiting the coupling with G proteins (2Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Another regulatory mechanism is the sequestration of receptors by which G protein-coupled receptors become inaccessible for hydrophilic membrane-impermeable ligands, including agonists. The sequestration of receptors may represent endocytosis of receptors via clathrin-coated vesicles (3Von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar), or may be associated with conformational changes of the receptor in the plasma membrane that make the receptor inaccessible to agonists (8Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Hadac E.M. Hellen E.H. Burghardt T.P. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For some G protein-coupled receptors like the β2-adrenergic receptors, sequestration is required to allow resensitization of desensitized receptors in a presumably subcellular compartment from which they can recycle back to the plasma membrane (9Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). For other G protein-coupled receptors, including mAChRs and secretin receptors, receptor sequestration is a desensitization mechanism (11Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bogatkewitsch G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23566-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, sequestration of m4 mAChRs in CHO cells delays receptor resensitization by more than 2 h, whereas nonsequestered receptors acquire full responsiveness within 10 min after agonist removal (12Bogatkewitsch G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar). A number of monomeric GTPases has been implicated as key regulators of various stages of endocytosis, including the 100-kDa GTPase dynamin. Dynamin is an essential, early acting component of the endocytic pathway that operates via clathrin-coated vesicles. This GTPase controls the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by regulating the constriction and budding of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane (14Van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. de Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant (dynamin K44A), which displays reduced GTP binding affinity and hydrolysis, potently inhibits the sequestration of several plasma membrane receptors, including receptors for transferrin and epidermal growth factor. Recently, Zhang et al. (16Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) showed that functional dynamin is required for the internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors in HEK-293 cells via clathrin-coated vesicles. In contrast, angiotensin II AT type 1A receptors, which are structurally and functionally distinct from β2-adrenergic receptors, sequester in a dynamin-independent manner (16Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, G protein-coupled receptors are able to sequester via dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent sequestration pathways. Previous radioligand binding studies have suggested that mAChRs may sequester in a receptor subtype-specific manner. For example, whereas both m1 and m2 mAChRs rapidly sequester in Y1 adrenal cells following agonist exposure, only m1 mAChRs sequester upon addition of phorbol ester (17Scherer N.M. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8475-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Likewise, in JEG-3 cells, agonist-treatment induces m2 but not m1 mAChR sequestration (18Goldman P.S. Schlador M.L. Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, immunocytochemical studies on the localization of α2-adrenergic receptor subtypes in HEK-293 cells have shown that following agonist binding, α2A-adrenergic receptors do not sequester, whereas α2B-adrenergic receptors are able to undergo agonist-induced sequestration (19Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, within a subfamily of structurally related G protein-coupled receptors, receptors can also differ in their capacity to sequester. The goal of the present work was to analyze the functional role of the GTPase dynamin in mAChR sequestration, and to investigate whether sequestration of the m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes is differentially regulated by dynamin. Here we demonstrate that whereas m1, m3, and m4 mAChR sequestration is regulated by dynamin, m2 mAChRs sequester in a dynamin-independent manner. These results provide strong evidence that receptor sequestration represents a novel type of receptor subtype-specific regulation of mAChRs.

CHO cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in α medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cell media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells on 150-mm plates were transfected with either 12.5 or 25 μg pCD-PS containing m1 or m2 mAChR DNA, respectively, together with either (unless indicated otherwise) 50 μg of pRK5 dynamin wild-type, pRK5 dynamin K44A, or empty pRK5, using the calcium phosphate method (25Van Koppen C.J. Sell A. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency of HEK-293 tsA201 cells was determined by in situstaining for β-galactosidase activity of the cells cotransfected with the constitutively active pSVβ-gal (Promega). Cells on 150-mm plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed by the addition of 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and boiled for 5 min. After 5 passages through a 25-gauge needle, samples were centrifuged for 5 min to remove insoluble material and diluted with lysis buffer to an equal amount of protein as measured by the BCA method (Pierce). 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to 100 μl of the diluted samples and boiled for another 5 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, protein was blotted onto nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose was then blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma). After washing three times for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, the blot was incubated with mouse anti-dynamin monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000; 0.25 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Following three washes for 5 min, the blot was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:5000; 0.16 μg/ml) at room temperature. After 1 h, the blot was washed again and immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots was performed using a Shimadzu CS-9000 dual wavelength spot scanner. Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells from 150-mm plates were replated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates and allow to reattach and grow for another 24 h. The cells were then incubated with or without carbachol for 0–60 min in 25 mm HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagles's/F-12 medium. For each manipulation, 6 wells of cells were taken. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 4 wells were incubated with 2 nm[3H]NMS in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 wells received atropine also (final concentration of 3 μm) to measure nonspecific binding amounting to maximally 10% of total binding. After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, scraped, and transferred into scintillation vials, which received 3.5 ml of scintillation fluid prior to radioactivity counting. Sequestration is expressed as (1 − quotient of cell surface receptors of carbachol-treated and untreated cells) × 100%. Total receptor number was determined in crude cell homogenates by binding of the membrane-permeable muscarinic radioligand [3H]QNB at 37 °C as described previously (25Van Koppen C.J. Sell A. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Untransfected HEK-293 tsA201, COS-7, and CHO cells do not express detectable levels of mAChR as determined by [3H]QNB binding to total cell homogenates. To determine whether mAChR sequestration is regulated in a receptor subtype-selective manner, we first examined the effect of overexpressing dynamin wild-type and K44A mutant on m1 and m2 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. Transfection of HEK-293 tsA201 cells with 50 μg of DNA encoding the dynamin wild-type and K44A mutant resulted in 15–30-fold overexpression of the corresponding protein over the endogenous dynamin expression level as measured by laser densitometry and corrected for an average transfection efficiency of 10–20% (Fig. 1 A). Stimulation of m1 mAChR-expressing HEK-293 tsA201 cells with a receptor-saturating concentration of 1 mm carbachol for a period of 60 min resulted in a 47 ± 5% loss in cell surface receptor number, as measured with the membrane-impermeable muscarinic antagonist [3H]NMS (Fig. 1 B). There was no detectable change in total mAChR number as measured by binding of the membrane-permeable muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB to homogenates prepared from transfected HEK-293 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of dynamin K44A inhibited m1 mAChR sequestration in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of cells with 5 μg of pRK5 dynamin K44A per 150-mm tissue culture plate inhibited m1 mAChR sequestration by about 60%, whereas sequestration was blocked by about 80 and 90% following transfection with 50 and 150 μg of pRK5 dynamin K44A DNA, respectively (Fig. 1 B). In subsequent experiments, cells were transfected with 50 μg of pRK5 dynamin wild-type or K44A mutant per 150-mm tissue culture plate. The inhibition of receptor sequestration was due to a decrease in the extent rather than the rate of mAChR sequestration (Fig.2 A). Sequestration in both control cells and cells overexpressing dynamin K44A was essentially complete within 10–30 min of exposure to 1 mm carbachol. Inhibition of m1 mAChR sequestration was apparent at low concentrations of carbachol as well (Fig. 2 B). Whereas incubation with 10−5m carbachol reduced cell surface number on control cells by 22 ± 3%, receptor sequestration in dynamin K44A-overexpressing cells was only 7 ± 3%. In contrast to dynamin K44A, overexpression of dynamin wild-type did not change the time course of m1 mAChR sequestration or the potency of carbachol to induce receptor sequestration, indicating that endogenous expression levels of dynamin are not rate-limiting (Fig. 2, A andB). Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that m1 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 tsA201 cells is regulated by dynamin.Figure 2Time course and carbachol concentration dependence of m1 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. The effect of overexpressing dynamin wild-type and dynamin K44A is shown. HEK-293 tsA201 cells transiently transfected with m1 mAChR in pCD-PS together with pRK5 dynamin wild-type (WT), K44A (K44A), or empty pRK5 (pRK5) were incubated in the absence and presence of 1 mm carbachol for 10, 30, or 60 min (A), or with 10−7, 10−5, or 10−3m carbachol for 60 min (B) at 37 °C. Sequestration was assessed by [3H]NMS binding to intact cells at 4 °C. Data are the mean ± S.E. of three sets of experiments each. Specific [3H]NMS binding to untreated cells transfected with pRK5, pRK5 dynamin wild-type, and pRK5 dynamin K44A was 220 ± 61, 183 ± 24, and 264 ± 73 fmol/mg protein, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether m2 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 cells is regulated by dynamin as well. As shown in Fig.3 A, m2 mAChRs rapidly sequestered, and cell surface receptor number was reduced by 60–80% within 10–30 min of incubation with 1 mm carbachol at 37 °C. The loss of cell surface receptor number took place without a measurable change in total receptor number as determined by [3H]QNB binding to cell homogenates (data not shown). Overexpression of dynamin wild-type or dynamin K44A did not alter m2 mAChR sequestration in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. In all three cell systems, m2 mAChRs sequestered with a similar time course, and the potency of carbachol in inducing receptor sequestration was indistinguishable (Fig. 3 B). These results strongly suggest that in HEK-293 tsA201 cells m2 mAChRs sequester by a dynamin-independent pathway. The dissimilar sequestration characteristics of m1 and m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 tsA201 cells prompted us to investigate whether m1 and m2 mAChRs also display different reappearance kinetics following agonist-induced receptor sequestration. For this, m1 and m2 mAChR-expressing cells were incubated with 1 mm carbachol for 60 min at 37 °C, and then washed to remove ligand. As shown in Fig. 4, cell surface mAChR numbers were reduced by 48 ± 5% and 62 ± 5% in carbachol-treated m1 and m2 mAChR-expressing cells. Within 1–3 h, almost all sequestered [3H]NMS binding sites on m1 mAChR-expressing HEK-293 cells reappeared. In contrast, reappearance of sequestered [3H]NMS binding sites on m2 mAChR-expressing cells was only very small. 3 h after carbachol removal, only 10–20% of initial binding had reappeared, and in the next 3 h, there was no further increase. These data are consistent with the observation that m1 and m2 mAChRs utilize distinct pathways of sequestration in HEK-293 cells. To test whether the alternative sequestration pathway of m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells is a property unique to m2 mAChRs, we investigated whether other members of the mAChR family share this ability. To do this, HEK-293 tsA201 cells were cotransfected with either m3 or m4 mAChR DNA along with dynamin K44A DNA. As shown in Table I, overexpression of dynamin K44A completely blocked the sequestration of m3 mAChRs in HEK-293 tsA201 cells, whereas sequestration of m4 mAChRs was inhibited by 80%. This suggests that the dynamin-independent sequestration of m2 mAChRs is not correlated with a preferential coupling profile to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. This finding was confirmed by sequestration studies of m2 and m4 mAChRs in COS-7 and CHO cells. In COS-7 cells, overexpression of dynamin K44A inhibited m2 mAChR sequestration by 55%, whereas m4 mAChR sequestration was completely abolished. Similarly, sequestration of m4 mAChRs in CHO cells was blocked by 80–90% by overexpression of dynamin K44A, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was not altered at all.Table ISequestration of mAChR subtypes in HEK-293 tsA201, COS-7, and CHO cells and the effect of dynamin K44ACell typeReceptor subtypeSequestrationpRK5K44A%HEK-293m151 ± 511 ± 5 (n = 7)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.m289 ± 583 ± 5 (n = 9)m336 ± 34 ± 4 (n = 4)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.m464 ± 613 ± 5 (n = 4)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.COS-7m231 ± 314 ± 4 (n = 9)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.m436 ± 43 ± 4 (n = 3)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.CHOm232 ± 444 ± 8 (n = 3)m455 ± 1010 ± 5 (n = 3)1-aSignificantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test.1-a Significantly different from cells transfected with control pRK5, p < 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test. Open table in a new tab In view of the pivotal role of dynamin in regulating clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis, we investigated whether dynamin is involved in mAChR sequestration, and in particular, whether the sequestration of the mAChR subtypes m1, m2, m3, and m4 is regulated differentially by this GTPase. Our study is the first systematic analysis of the regulation of receptor sequestration by dynamin within a particular family of G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas all four mAChR subtypes in HEK-293 cells sequestered rapidly and to a large extent, m2 mAChR sequestration was distinct from that of the other mAChR subtypes. Overexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin K44A mutant fully blocked m1, m3, and m4 mAChR sequestration, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was not affected. The distinct sequestration of m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells was underscored by the finding that m2 mAChR sequestration was hardly reversible following agonist removal, whereas sequestered m1 mAChRs reappeared almost completely within 1–3 h. The dissimilarity in sequestration between m1 and m2 mAChRs was not related to their differential coupling properties. Also, the m4 mAChR subtype, which like the m2 mAChR subtype preferentially couples to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, sequestered essentially in a dynamin-dependent manner in HEK-293 cells. The distinct sequestration of m2 mAChR was not confined to HEK-293 cells but also apparent in transiently transfected COS-7 and CHO cells. Overexpression of dynamin K44A in COS-7 cells blocked m4 mAChR sequestration completely, whereas m2 mAChR sequestration was inhibited by 55%. Similarly, while sequestration of m4 mAChRs in CHO cells could essentially be fully blocked by overexpressing dynamin K44A, m2 mAChR sequestration was completely dynamin-independent. During the processing of this manuscript, Hosey and co-workers (26Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) also showed that m2 mAChRs sequester in a dynamin-independent manner in HEK-293 cells. However, these investigators did not investigate the seminal question whether the other mAChR subtypes also utilize the dynamin-independent sequestration pathway. Of particular interest was the observation that although sequestration of m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells was fully dynamin-independent, m2 mAChR sequestration in COS-7 cells was accomplished via both dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent pathways. These findings may offer a molecular explanation for two contradictory studies on the regulation of m2 mAChR sequestration by GRK2 in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (27Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of GRK2 was found to block phosphorylation and sequestration by about 50%, whereas in HEK-293 cells, overexpression inhibited m2 mAChR phosphorylation but not mAChR sequestration. On the basis of our study, it is therefore possible that these findings are related to the dissimilar sequestration pathways of m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 and COS-7 cells. Benovic and co-workers (29Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) have recently proposed the following early steps in the sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors, which like m1 mAChRs sequester via dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated vesicles. Following agonist stimulation, receptors are phosphorylated by GRKs in an agonist-dependent manner and the subsequent binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor uncouples the receptor from its G protein. In turn, receptor-bound β-arrestin may function as a high affinity clathrin adaptor, and on encountering a coated pit, β-arrestin binds with high affinity to the assembled clathrin lattice, resulting in receptor internalization. Although this model is very attractive, it fails to explain why m2 mAChRs in HEK-293 cells do not sequester via dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated vesicles, yet are being phosphorylated by GRKs in HEK-293 cells (28Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and are able to bind β-arrestin efficiently (30Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies lead us to conclude that GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of m2 mAChRs does not dictate whether mAChRs sequester via either dynamin-dependent or dynamin-independent pathways. At present, the identity of the m2 mAChR sequestration pathway is unclear. A possible m2 mAChR sequestration pathway may be the endocytosis via caveolae. Caveolae are noncoated plasma membrane invaginations, which seem to have the ability to either internalize into the cell interior or to persist in the proximity of the plasma membrane (31Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous data have suggested that cholecystokinin receptors in CHO cells as well as β2-adrenergic receptors in A431 cells may sequester via caveolae (5Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 6Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Pinon D. Holicky E. Hadac E. Larkin J.M. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Very recently, Feronet al. (32Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) reported that m2 mAChRs in cardiac myocytes are targeted to caveolae following agonist binding. This observation led the authors to postulate that this receptor trafficking is required to cluster m2 mAChRs within the caveolae to initiate specific downstream signaling cascades, including activation of the resident caveolar isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Our study suggests that in the caveolae of cardiac myocytes, agonist-activated m2 mAChRs evidently also sequester and lose their ability to bind hydrophilic ligands. Further studies should be performed to test whether m2 mAChRs indeed sequester into caveolae in HEK-293 cells and cardiac myocytes. Our study is the first demonstration of a receptor subtype-specific sequestration pathway within the family of mAChRs. In this context, it is interesting to note that, since receptor sequestration and recycling regulate receptor function (9Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23566-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the m2 subtype-specific sequestration (and recycling) pathway may serve a regulatory mechanism of receptor responsiveness, distinct from that of the m1, m3, and m4 subtypes. At present, it is unknown whether activated m2 mAChRs are excluded from the dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated vesicle sequestration pathway, or are “specifically” recognized by a repertoire of as yet unidentified regulatory elements, which direct the activated m2 mAChRs into the dynamin-independent sequestration pathway. The observation that the m4 subtype, which has a striking homology in amino acid sequence and functional characteristics with the m2 subtype (1Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), as well as the less homologous m1 and m3 subtypes, sequester via the dynamin-dependent pathway, lends support to the latter possibility. The characterization of the molecular mechanisms that govern the distinct dynamin-independent m2 mAChR sequestration pathway in HEK-293 and other cells will provide new insights into the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors.

The present study underlines the importance of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and 2A in the regulation of the differential expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes and macrophages. Compounds (calyculin A, microcystin, okadaic acid, and cantharidin) that inhibit PP 1 and 2A were found to stimulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS and production of NO in rat primary astrocytes and C6 glial cells. However, these inhibitors inhibited the LPS- and cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS and production of NO in rat resident macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells. Similarly, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP 1/2A, stimulated the iNOS promoter-derived chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in astrocytes and inhibited the iNOS promoter-derived chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in macrophages, indicating that okadaic acid also differentially regulates the transcription of the iNOS gene in astrocytes and macrophages. The observed stimulation of the expression of iNOS in astrocytes and the inhibition of the expression of iNOS in macrophages with the inhibition of PP 1/2A activity clearly delineate a novel role of PP 1/2A in the differential regulation of iNOS in rat astrocytes and macrophages. Because the activation of NF-κB is necessary for the induction of iNOS and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α also depends on the activation of NF-κB, we examined the effect of okadaic acid on the LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB and production of TNF-α in rat primary astrocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, in both cell types, okadaic acid stimulated the LPS-mediated DNA binding as well as transcriptional activity of NF-κB and production of TNF-α. This study suggests that the stimulation of iNOS expression in astrocytes by inhibitors of PP 1/2A is possibly due to the stimulation of NF-κB activation; however, activation of NF-κB is not sufficient for the induction of iNOS in macrophages and that apart from NF-κB some other signaling pathway(s) sensitive to PP 1 and/or PP 2A is/are possibly involved in the regulation of iNOS in macrophages. This differential induction of iNOS as compared with similar activation of NF-κB by inhibitors of PP 1/2A indicates the involvement of different intracellular signaling events for the induction of iNOS in two cell types of the same animal species.

The NOS are basically divided into two forms. One constitutive form present in neurons and endothelial cells is calcium-dependent enzymes, whereas the inducible form present in macrophage and astrocytes is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to stimuli (e.g.cytokines/lipopolysaccharides) and does not require calcium for its activity (1Jaffrey S.R.

Although the NO produced by iNOS accounts for the bactericidal and tumoricidal properties of macrophages, it is also of particular importance in pathophysiologies of inflammatory diseases including demyelinating disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy, and X-adrenoleukodystrophy) and in ischemia and traumatic injuries associated with infiltrating macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (3Mitrovic B.

Recently we have observed that PD 98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK), the kinase responsible for the activation of MAP kinase, inhibits the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and the induction of iNOS in astrocytes, suggesting the possible involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the LPS- and proinflammatory cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS (18Pahan K.

MAP kinases exhibit dual specificity, regulating both Ser/Thr phosphorylation and Tyr autophosphorylation (19Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, MAP kinases themselves require concurrent Thr and Tyr phosphorylation for activation and are in turn substrates for MEK (19Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations suggest that cellular regulation of this signaling pathway may utilize Ser/Thr phosphatases to modulate the phosphorylation state of critical phosphoproteins associated with the activation of NF-κB and the induction of iNOS. Because PP 1 and PP 2A are the two most abundant Ser/Thr phosphatases in the cell, the present study was undertaken to investigate the cellular regulation of the induction of iNOS by PP 1 and PP 2A in rat primary astrocytes and macrophages. Our results clearly demonstrate that calyculin A, microcystin, cantharidin, and okadaic acid, inhibitors of PP 1 and PP 2A, stimulate the LPS- and cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS and production of NO in astrocytes and C6 glial cells, whereas the same inhibitors inhibit the LPS- and cytokine-mediated expression of iNOS and production of NO in macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells. This differential regulation of the induction of iNOS in astrocytes and macrophages by inhibitors of PP 1/2A suggests that different intracellular signaling events may be involved for the induction of iNOS in astrocytes and macrophages. However, despite this differential regulation of the induction of iNOS in astrocytes and macrophages, inhibitors of PP 1/2A stimulate the activation of NF-κB and the production of TNF-α in both astrocytes and macrophages. Recombinant rat IFN-γ, DMEM/F-12 medium, fetal bovine serum, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection kit were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human IL-1β was from Genzyme. Mouse recombinant TNF-α was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. LPS (Escherichia coli) was from Sigma.N G-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMA), okadaic acid, calyculin A, cantharidin, and antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS were obtained from Calbiochem.

Astrocytes were prepared from rat cerebral tissue as described by McCarthy and DeVellis (22McCarthy K. DeVellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 10 days of culture astrocytes were separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes by shaking for 24 h in an orbital shaker at 240 rpm. The shaking was repeated two more times after a gap of 1 or 2 weeks before subculturing to ensure the complete removal of all the oligodendrocytes and microglia. Cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and stimulated with LPS or different cytokines in serum-free DMEM/F-12. C6glial cells obtained from ATCC were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as above. Resident macrophages were obtained from rat by peritoneal lavage with sterile RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin as reported earlier (13Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 24: 39-48Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 at 4 °C. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air. Macrophages at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containingl-glutamine and gentamicin were added in volumes of 800 μl to a 35-mm plate. After 1 h, nonadherent cells were removed by washing, and 800 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with various stimuli were added to the adherent cells. After incubation in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C, culture supernatants were transferred to measure NO production. Synthesis of NO was determined by assay of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent (23Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture medium served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. The extraction and assay for PP 1/2A were performed as described (24Begum N. Ragolia L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31166-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Control and treated cells were scraped off the dishes with phosphatase extraction buffer containing 20 mm imidazole-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, pH 7.0, with protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were used for the assay of phosphatase activities using the protein phosphatase assay kit (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following 24 h of incubation in the presence or the absence of different stimuli, cells were scraped off, washed with Hank's buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A (11Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol.

Cells were taken out from culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond-Nylon Membrane (Amersham), and hybridized at 68 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probe using Express Hyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer, 5′-CTC CTT CAA AGA GGC AAA AAT A-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAC TTC CTC CAG GAT GTT GT-3′) (11Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Singh I. J. Biol.

After hybridization, filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). The same amount of RNA was hybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The relative mRNA content for iNOS (iNOS/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was measured after scanning the bands with a Bio-Rad (model GS-670) imaging densitometer. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the control of nitric-oxide synthase promoter (iNOS) was created by subcloning a 1.5-kilobase promoter from pGEM-NOS at SphI and SalI restriction site of pCAT-basic vector (Promega). Full-length promoter (26Eberhardt W. Kunz D. Hummel R. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was amplified by using two primers (forward, 5′-GAG AGT GTG CAA GTA TTT GTA GGA G-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAG GTG GCT GAG AAG TTT CA-3′) from rat genomic DNA and cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega) to produce pGEM-NOS. The clone was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid by using the lipotaxi (Stratagene) method, as has been described in manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 14 h and harvested. Radioisotopic method was used to assay CAT activity using a kit (Promega) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear extracts from stimulated or unstimulated astrocytes (1 × 107 cells) were prepared using the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol,1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were diluted with 20 μl of modified buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and stored at −70 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assay the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, cells were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (obtained from Stratagene), using the lipotaxi method. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 4 h. Total cell extracts were used to measure luciferase activity in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801) (28Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using an assay kit from Stratagene. Cytotoxic effects of all the inhibitors were determined by measuring the metabolic activity of cells with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Rat primary astrocytes were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F-12 in the presence of LPS and inhibitors of different protein phosphatases. The concentration of NO as nitrite (a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen) was measured in culture supernatants after 24 h. It is evident from TableI that the bacterial LPS at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml induced the production of NO as nitrite by about 9-fold. l-NMA, a competitive inhibitor of NOS activity, suppressed the LPS-mediated nitrite secretion, suggesting that LPS-induced nitrite release in rat primary astrocytes is dependent on NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (Table I). Inhibitors of PP 1/2A (calyculin A, microcystin, and okadaic acid) or PP 2B (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate) alone were neither stimulatory nor inhibitory to nitrite production in control astrocytes (data not shown). However, calyculin A, microcystin, and okadaic acid, when added with LPS, stimulated the LPS-mediated induction of nitrite production in astrocytes. In contrast, inhibitors of PP 2B (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate) had no effect on LPS-induced nitrite production in astrocytes. These observations suggest that stimulation of LPS-induced production of NO in astrocytes is specific for the inhibitors of PP 1/2A. To understand the mechanism of stimulatory effect of inhibitors of PP 1/2A on the LPS-mediated nitrite production in astrocytes, we examined the effect of these inhibitors on the protein and mRNA level of iNOS. Consistent with the production of nitrite (Fig. 1 A), Western blot analysis with antibodies against murine macrophage iNOS and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA of LPS-stimulated astrocytes clearly show that inhibitors of PP 1/2A (calyculin A, microcystin, and cantharidin) enhanced the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS protein (Fig.1 B) and mRNA (Fig. 1 C). Because the inhibitors of PP 1/2A stimulated the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS, we examined whether these inhibitors did in fact inhibit the activities of PP 1/2A in LPS-treated astrocytes under these conditions. The activities of PP 1/2A were measured in homogenates after 30 min of incubation. Fig. 2 shows that okadaic acid inhibited the activities of PP 1/2A and stimulated the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS protein and production of NO in astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner.Table IEffect of inhibitors of different protein phosphatases on LPS-induced production of NO in rat primary astrocytesStimuliNitritenmol/mg/24 hControl3.1 ± 0.3LPS only28.2 ± 3.1LPS + l-NMA (0.1 mm)5.2 ± 0.4LPS + cypermethrin (1 nm)27.6 ± 2.7LPS + deltamethrin (1 nm)26.8 ± 2.9LPS + fenvalerate (20 nm)27.1 ± 2.1LPS + calyculin A (2 nm)67.8 ± 7.3LPS + microcystin (2 nm)64.8 ± 7.2LPS + okadaic acid (10 nm)59.5 ± 7.1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Effect of okadaic acid on LPS-mediated induction of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1896-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unlike astrocytes, LPS or cytokines alone were not a sufficient inducer of NO production in rat C6 glial cells. A combination of LPS and cytokines was required to induce the production of NO in C6 glial cells (Refs. 13Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 24: 39-48Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J.

Calyculin A (2 nm) stimulated the expression of iNOS protein and the production of NO by more than 3-fold in LPS- and cytokine-treated C6 cells (Fig. 3). The observed up-regulation of cytokine-induced expression of iNOS and production of NO in both rat primary astrocytes and C6 glial cells by inhibitors of PP 1/2A indicate that PP 1/2A may function as a negative regulator in these intercellular signaling pathways. Because inhibitors of PP 1/2A stimulated the LPS- and cytokine-induced NO production in rat primary astrocytes and C6 glial cells, we examined the effect of these inhibitors on NO production and expression of iNOS in rat resident macrophages. Similar to astrocytes, inhibitors of PP 1/2A alone had no effect on the induction of NO production. However, in contr"
https://openalex.org/W2080924650,"The RecT protein of Escherichia coliis a DNA-pairing protein required for the RecA-independent recombination events promoted by the RecE pathway. The RecT protein was found to bind to both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the absence of Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+, RecT binding to dsDNA was inhibited drastically, whereas binding to ssDNA was inhibited only to a small extent. RecT promoted the transfer of a single-stranded oligonucleotide into a supercoiled homologous duplex to form a D (displacement)-loop. D-loop formation occurred in the absence of Mg2+ and at 1 mm Mg2+ but was inhibited by increasing concentrations of Mg2+ and did not require a high energy cofactor. Strand transfer was mediated by a RecT-ssDNA nucleoprotein complex reacting with a naked duplex DNA and was prevented by the formation of RecT-dsDNA nucleoprotein complexes. Finally, RecT mediated the formation of joint molecules between a supercoiled DNA and a linear dsDNA substrate with homologous 3′-single-stranded tails. Together these results indicate that RecT is not a helix-destabilizing protein promoting a reannealing reaction but rather is a novel type of pairing protein capable of promoting recombination by a DNA strand invasion mechanism. These results are consistent with the observation that RecE (exonuclease VIII) and RecT can promote RecA-independent double-strand break repair in E. coli.

These results are consistent with the observation that RecE (exonuclease VIII) and RecT can promote RecA-independent double-strand break repair in E. coli. In Escherichia coli, the major recombination pathway requires the function of the RecA and RecBCD proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Smith G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Smith G.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 807-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The recombination and repair deficiencies in recB recC mutants can be suppressed by two types of mutations calledsbcA and sbcB(sbcC) (3Barbour S.D. Nagaishi H. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Lloyd R.G. Buckman C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 836-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Templin A. Kushner S.R. Clark A.J.

The sbcAmutations map on the cryptic Rac prophage and induce the expression of the RecE and RecT proteins (for review, see Ref. 6Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recombination inrecB recC sbcA mutants occurs by what is called the RecE pathway (7Clark A.J. Genetics. 1974; 78: 259-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in many ways is similar to the bacteriophage λ Red pathway (6Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A distinctive property of the RecE pathway is that it promotes RecA-independent recombination of circular plasmids as well as intramolecular recombination of linearized plasmid DNAs (8Fishel R.A. James A.A. Kolodner R. Nature. 1981; 294: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Laban A. Cohen A. Mol. Gen.

(12Takahashi N.K. Kusano K. Yokochi T. Kitamura Y. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These types of recombination events have been shown to require functionalrecE and recT genes (13Clark A.J. Sharma V. Brenowitz S. Chu C.C. Sandler S. Satin L. Templin A. Berger I. Cohen A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7673-7682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kusano K. Takahashi N.K. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recE gene product is an ATP-independent exonuclease, also called exonuclease VIII (15Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Exonuclease VIII degrades preferentially linear duplex DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, yielding 5′-mononucleotides and also degrades single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at low rates (16Joseph J.W. Kolodner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10418-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recT gene product was found to bind to ssDNA and to promote the renaturation of complementary ssDNA in an ATP-independent fashion (17Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the RecT protein in combination with exonuclease VIII was shown to promote homologous pairing and strand exchange between a circular ssDNA and a linear duplex DNA. In this reaction, exonuclease VIII degraded the linear duplex to expose ssDNA that was then annealed by RecT to a complementary region on the ssDNA circle. Subsequently, RecT promoted heteroduplex extension and partial strand exchange (18Hall S.D. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This degradation/reannealing/strand exchange mechanism explains how the presence of RecE and RecT can render some types of recombination RecA-independent (6Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However,in vivo evidence indicates that the ends of a linear duplex DNA may not be involved directly in the initial pairing event, and it was suggested that internal duplex-duplex initiation events could be promoted by the RecE pathway (11Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi N.K. Sakagami K. Kusano K. Yamamoto K. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. Genetics. 1997; 146: 9-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it has been pointed out that DSBR, which clearly requires a pairing function, cannot occur simply by a degradation and reannealing mechanism (20Kobayashi I. Takahashi N. Genetics. 1988; 119: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that recombination promoted by the RecE pathway involves pairing events more complex than annealing of ssDNA, possibly similar to those promoted by RecA (6Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These pairing events could either involve additional unidentified protein factors or alternatively, they could be the result of a previously unrecognized RecT pairing activity. In this paper, we investigate further the pairing activities promoted by RecT in vitro. We found that RecT can promote the invasion of a supercoiled DNA by either a homologous ssDNA or homologous single-stranded ends of a linear duplex, a DNA substrate similar to that generated by the RecE exonuclease. The joint molecules contain D-loops (displacement loops), supporting the idea that RecT could be involved directly in the initiation of DSBR in the RecE pathway. Our biochemical analysis of the DNA binding properties of RecT and the requirements for strand transfer indicate that RecT belongs to a novel class of DNA-pairing proteins.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7673-7682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pUC18 and pUC19 are from the laboratory collection, and pHV2900OB is a pUC18 derivative carrying a 2.27-kilobase pair DNA fragment inserted into the polylinker (21Chedin F. Dervyn E. Dervyn R. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Ampicillin and kanamycin were added to final concentrations of 100 and 30 μg/ml, respectively. Transformations were carried out as described previously (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase Klenow fragment, and bovine serum albumin were from New England Biolabs. Bacteriophage T7 gene6 exonuclease and T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0) were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim. Synthesis of oligonucleotides was performed at the Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Primers used to amplify RecT were T1 (5′-cgggatccagaaggaatatgcaaatgactaagcaac) and T2 (5′-acgcgtcgacggtgcattacaccgccaggc); regions complementary to the recT region are underlined. Oligonucleotides used in DNA binding and D-loop assays were 50 nucleotides long. Oligonucleotide 26 (5′-caccgtcaccgacttgagccatttgggaattagagccagcaaaatcaccag) corresponds to positions 2629–2579 of bacteriophage M13 wild-type. Oligonucleotide 34 (5′-ctatgcggcatcagagcagattgtactgagagtgcaccatatgcggtgtg) corresponds to positions 146–195 of pUC18. Oligonucleotide 35 (5′-cacaccgcatatggtgcactctcagtacaatctgctctgatgccgcatag) is complementary to oligonucleotide 34. A 0.85-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the recT gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pRac31 with primers T1 and T2, and the polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI +SalI and inserted into pET24+ (Novagen) cleaved with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pRDK577, carried a wild-typerecT gene (verified by DNA sequencing) under the control of the T7 promoter. The RecT-overproducing strain, RDK3294, was obtained by transformation of pRDK577 into Novablue(DE3). RecT synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) to a log-phase culture of RDK3294 (OD650 = 0.8) and incubation for 4 h. RecT purification was performed as described previously (17Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A final step was added in the purification procedure to remove the KPO4 buffer from the RecT preparation obtained from the hydroxylapatite column. The RecT fraction (28 mg of protein) was loaded at 25 ml/h onto a PBE94 column (20 × 1 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% w/v glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl and eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient of buffer A containing 0.1–1 m NaCl. The fractions containing RecT were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 60% w/v glycerol and 100 mm NaCl, and stored at −20 °C. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining indicated that the final RecT fraction (25 mg of protein) was greater than 95% pure. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All DNA concentrations are expressed in nucleotide residues. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained by mixing complementary oligonucleotides in equimolar amounts (2 mm) and annealing them by incubation in a water bath at 95 °C for 5 min in buffer R (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) followed by slow cooling to room temperature over 12 h. The duplex oligonucleotide was purified from unannealed oligonucleotides by high performance liquid chromatography on a GEN-PAC FAX column (Waters, Milford, MA) using a NaCl gradient (25 ml) from 0.3 to 1 m, in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, run at 0.75 ml/min. Under these conditions, only duplex DNA bound to the column and eluted as a single peak at 0.67 m NaCl. Single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove unincorporated label. To generate a 5′-resected DNA duplex, pUC19 DNA was cleaved withNarI, and the linear form was purified by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Then, the 5′-ends were digested in the buffer recommended by the supplier with 8 units of T7 gene6 exonuclease/μg of DNA, for 90 s at 30 °C. Under these conditions, an average of 150 bases was removed from each 5′-end. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained32P-labeled ssDNA or dsDNA (0.83 and 1.66 μm, respectively) in buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The concentrations of NaCl, MgCl2, and RecT are indicated in the figure legends. The reaction mixtures were incubated 20 min at 37 °C and filtered by means of a double-filter system (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) through KOH-treated nitrocellulose (24McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and DEAE-cellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For stability analysis, the RecT-DNA complexes were preformed in 240-μl volumes containing 25 mm NaCl, as described above. A 75-fold molar excess of unlabeled ss- or dsDNA was added to the preformed complex, and aliquots (20 μl) were taken at various time points, filtered, and rinsed with 100 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C, as described (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Data were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 0.83 μm32P-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide, 25 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and RecT as indicated in figure legends. Mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and supercoiled DNA was added at the concentrations indicated in individual experiments. Mixtures were then incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% SDS, and 10 mg/ml proteinase K to the final concentrations of 50 mm, 0.2%, and 550 μg/ml, respectively. Incubation at 37 °C was continued for 20 min, and the mixtures were supplemented with 5 μl of tracking dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 60% glycerol) and loaded on a 0.9% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed for 150 min at 5 volts/cm at 25 °C. The gel was soaked in 300 ml of water containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 20 min, photographed, and soaked in 300 ml of 7% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, neutralized in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, for 20 min, and dried onto Whatman 3MM paper for 3 h at 60 °C. Radiolabeled DNA species were then quantified using a PhosphorImager. Conditions for the reactions using DNA substrates resected with T7 gene 6 exonuclease were the same except that 19 μm resected pUC19 DNA (0.11 pmol) and 40 μm supercoiled pHV2900OB (0.12 pmol) were used as substrates. Electrophoresis was carried out in a 0.7% agarose gel for 16 h at 1.6 volts/cm at 25 °C. To examine the DNA binding properties of RecT, nitrocellulose filter binding assays were carried out with single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides, in buffer T containing 25 mm NaCl and no MgCl2. RecT was capable of binding to ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig.1), and for both DNAs, binding was maximal after 5 min (data not shown). Surprisingly, RecT exhibited a greater affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA because half-maximum binding was observed at a protein/DNA ratio of 1 RecT monomer/3.3 base pairs and 1 RecT monomer/1.6 bases, respectively. To investigate the effect of Mg2+, binding reactions were repeated in the same buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1). RecT binding to dsDNA was reduced dramatically (half-maximum binding at 8 RecT monomers/base pair), whereas binding to ssDNA was much less affected (half-maximum binding at 1 RecT monomer/1.2 bases). The effect of salt concentration on RecT binding was also investigated. Binding isotherms for ssDNA and dsDNA were determined at NaCl concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mm (Fig.2). RecT-ssDNA complex formation was optimum between 0 and 25 mm NaCl, and binding was decreased at NaCl concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 mm. Interestingly, at RecT concentrations of less than 0.5 μm, RecT-dsDNA complex formation displayed a different salt sensitivity. As the NaCl concentration was increased, binding to dsDNA was found to be enhanced by the presence of 25 mmNaCl, but then binding was decreased at NaCl concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 mm. These results suggest that RecT could have different modes of binding to ssDNA and dsDNA. To gain more insight into the nature of the RecT-DNA complexes, RecT-ssDNA and RecT-dsDNA complexes were formed in buffer T containing 25 mm NaCl. These complexes were then challenged with a 75-fold molar excess of unlabeled ss- or dsDNA, and their decay was monitored over time (Fig. 3). Strikingly, both complexes exhibited a biphasic decay, indicating that they were composed of two types of complexes: an unstable complex with a half-life of less than 1 min and a very stable complex with a half-life of greater than 120 min. The RecT-dsDNA complex contained a greater proportion (45%) of the stable form compared with the RecT-ssDNA complex (22%). The results presented above revealed that RecT has a greater affinity and forms more stable complexes with dsDNA than with ssDNA. To test if RecT could promote a pairing reaction involving a fully duplex DNA, we monitored the invasion of a supercoiled DNA by a 32P-labeled ssDNA (50 nucleotides). The RecT-ssDNA complexes were preformed separately and then mixed with the supercoiled DNA substrate. The joint molecules, which are D-loops, were detected as the comigration of radioactivity with the supercoiled plasmid DNA. The kinetics of joint molecules formation is presented in Fig. 4. After about 30 min, the reaction reached a plateau corresponding to 33% of the supercoiled DNA being converted into D-loops. A slight increase in D-loop formation was observed reproducibly at 120 min (Fig.4 B), indicating that the reaction had not yet reached completion. Similar levels of D-loop formation were obtained with oligonucleotides homologous to several different loci in the supercoiled plasmid, indicating that D-loop formation is not specific for a particular DNA sequence (data not shown). The requirements for D-loop formation are summarized in Table I. D-loop formation was strictly dependent on the presence of RecT. D-loops were not detected when heterologous ssDNA was substituted for homologous ssDNA or when linear pUC18 DNA was substituted for supercoiled pUC18 DNA in the reaction. These results indicate that joint molecule formation requires homologous pairing and is stabilized by supercoiling, consistent with the known properties of D-loops (25Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). D-loop formation was optimum at 25 mm NaCl and decreased at salt concentrations higher than 50 mm. The presence of 3 mm EDTA did not affect D-loop formation, showing that Mg2+ ions are not required. D-loop formation occurred in the presence of 1 and 2.5 mmMgCl2 but was inhibited almost completely by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2. Interestingly, both RecT binding to dsDNA and joint molecule formation were inhibited by the presence of Mg2+ (see Fig. 1) and stimulated by the addition of 25 mm NaCl (see Fig. 2). This correlation between D-loop formation and RecT binding to dsDNA suggests a potential role for RecT-dsDNA complexes in the pairing reaction. Under the reaction conditions described above, D-loop formation occurs in the presence of two different types of RecT-ssDNA complexes, the stable and unstable complexes observed in Fig. 3. Although the role of these different complexes is not known, it is noteworthy that the amount of stable RecT-ssDNA complex formed under our experimental conditions (22%) corresponds to the level of RecT-ssDNA complex at which D-loop formation is optimal (20–26%, see below), suggesting that the stable form of RecT-ssDNA complexes could possibly be the active species involved in pairing. To test this hypothesis, RecT-ssDNA complexes were formed with amounts of RecT ranging from 0 to 1.0 μm, under the conditions used for the D-loop assay, and then incubated in the presence of a 64-fold excess of heterologous oligonucleotide for 40 min to compete away the majority of the unstable RecT-ssDNA complexes and only a small portion of the stable RecT-ssDNA complexes. The resulting complexes were then assayed for their activity in D-loop formation assays. The results showed that from 32 to 100% of the D-loop formation activity was retained under these conditions, depending on the initial amount of RecT present (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the stable RecT-ssDNA complexes are active in promoting D-loop formation, and, if the unstable complexes have any activity at all, it must be significantly less that that of the stable RecT-ssDNA complexes. In the experiments presented above, formation of joint molecules was obtained when ssDNA-RecT complexes were preformed before the addition of dsDNA, consistent with the idea that the RecT-ssDNA filament promoted pairing (26Thresher R.J. Makhov A.M. Hall S.D. Kolodner R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of the dsDNA-RecT complexes in joint molecule formation, dsDNA was preincubated with RecT, and the dsDNA-RecT complex was then mixed with uncoated ssDNA. Under these conditions, D-loops were not detected even after 60 min of incubation (data not shown). These results indicate that the RecT-dsDNA complex is incapable of promoting the pairing reaction. However, when RecT was added to a mixture of uncoated ss- and dsDNA substrates, weak but significant D-loop formation (1% of the dsDNA converted) was observed (data not shown). This suggests that RecT can promote pairing of ss- and dsDNA substrates but that the formation of RecT-dsDNA complex inhibits the pairing reaction. To test this possibility further, the effect of RecT concentration on D-loop formation was examined. Varying amounts of RecT were preincubated with the ssDNA, and the reaction was initiated by adding dsDNA to the mixture. The results are presented Fig.5. The amount of joint molecules formed increased with increasing concentrations of RecT and reached an optimum at between 0.3 and 0.43 μm RecT, corresponding to a ratio of about 1 RecT monomer/2.5 bases of ssDNA. This optimal pairing activity occurred at subsaturating concentrations of RecT, where 20–26% of the ssDNA is bound (see Fig. 1). At RecT concentrations exceeding 0.43 μm, D-loop formation diminished sharply, indicating that pairing was inhibited by an excess of RecT. One possible explanation for this inhibition is that in excess of the optimum concentration, enough RecT would be available to bind to the dsDNA substrate and inhibit the pairing reaction. To test directly whether RecT-dsDNA complexes inhibit the pairing reaction, preformed RecT-ssDNA filaments were mixed with RecT-dsDNA complexes that were made separately in the presence of different concentrations of RecT. In the same reaction, an uncoated dsDNA, pHV2900OB, which is also homologous to the ssDNA and distinguishable from pUC18 by size, was included. The quantities of D-loops formed with the RecT-coated dsDNA and the uncoated dsDNA substrates were compared. As shown in Fig. 6, the capacity to form joint molecules was decreased for the RecT-coated dsDNA but remained unaffected for the uncoated dsDNA present in the same reaction. This inhibition of the pairing reaction occurred at a ratio of 1 RecT monomer/67 base pairs, which is about 70 times below saturation level (from Fig. 1, saturation occurred at about 1 RecT monomer/base pair), suggesting that the inhibition is not caused by complete coating of the dsDNA. This experiment also confirms that RecT-dsDNA complexes are unable to pair with uncoated ssDNA (Fig. 6, lanes d,g, and j). We have shown that RecT has a higher affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA and that the RecT-dsDNA complexes inhibited pairing. Together, these findings raised the question of whether RecT-ssDNA complexes competent for strand transfer could be formed at the single-stranded ends of a duplex DNA that has been resected by an exonuclease. Such a resected duplex is assumed to be the DNA substrate to initiate recombination in the RecE pathway (6Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test this idea, pUC19 DNA was linearized by NarI and treated briefly with an exonuclease that degrades the 5′-strands. This linear duplex DNA with 3′-single-stranded tails (3′-ssDNA) was then preincubated with varying amounts of RecT, and supercoiled pHV2900OB was added to initiate the reaction. The formation of joint molecules (Fig.7) increased with the amount of RecT and reached an optimum at 0.67 μm RecT, where 8% of the supercoiled DNA was trapped in joint molecules. Increasing the RecT concentration further resulted in a decrease in joint molecule formation. The formation of joint molecules was not observed if the exonuclease treatment of the linear pUC19 DNA was omitted (data not shown), consistent with the known requirement of RecT for ssDNA ends (18Hall S.D. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a control, a DNA substrate having 29 base pairs of heterology at each single-stranded end was generated by cleaving pUC19 withXbaI, at the center of the polylinker region (which is not present in pHV2900OB (21Chedin F. Dervyn E. Dervyn R. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)), followed by limited degradation of the 5′-strands with T7 gene 6 exonuclease. No joint molecule formation was observed with this DNA substrate (data not shown), indicating that homologous single-stranded tails are required for the formation of D-loops. These results show that RecT can promote pairing of a supercoiled DNA with a DNA duplex having homologous single-stranded tails, indicating that RecT filaments can form on those single-stranded tails. Interestingly, strand transfer occurred at subsaturating concentrations of RecT (1 RecT monomer/14 base pairs), where one would predict that most of the RecT protein would be bound to dsDNA (see Fig. 1). To investigate the pairing reactions promoted by RecT, we examined the interactions between RecT and DNA, using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. We found that RecT bound to ssDNA as well as to dsDNA but with an apparent higher affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA. Binding to dsDNA was inhibited by the addition of Mg2+. Previous filter binding studies only revealed RecT binding to ssDNA, and previous electron microscopy studies revealed RecT-ssDNA helical nucleoprotein filaments but only sparse internal binding of RecT with dsDNA (17Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Thresher R.J. Makhov A.M. Hall S.D. Kolodner R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These differences can be explained by the fact that the previous binding studies were carried out in the presence of high salt and high Mg2+, conditions which strongly inhibited binding of RecT to dsDNA (see Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, RecT binding to dsDNA was enhanced by the addition of 25 mm NaCl, whereas binding to ssDNA was not. Analysis of the decay of RecT-ssDNA and RecT-dsDNA complexes revealed that RecT displayed at least two modes of binding to DNA. Each complex was composed of two forms, an unstable complex with a half-life < 1 min, and a very stable complex with a half-life > 120 min. Under our experimental conditions, more of the bound DNA was of the stable form with dsDNA (45%) than with ssDNA (22%). Although the role of these different complexes is not known, the results of competition experiments suggest that the stable form of the RecT-ssDNA complexes is the most active species involved in pairing and could possibly be the only active species. A striking feature of RecT binding to DNA is its sensitivity to Mg2+. The addition of 5 mm MgCl2 to the reaction drastically reduced the binding of RecT to dsDNA and, to a much smaller extent, its binding to ssDNA. This observation explains why previous binding studies, carried out in the presence of 13 mm MgCl2, did not detect RecT binding to dsDNA (17Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies revealed that in the presence of MgCl2, RecT monomers assemble into doughnut-shaped oligomers containing 7 or 8 monomers and rod-like structures but that in the absence of MgCl2, no oligomer was formed (26Thresher R.J. Makhov A.M. Hall S.D. Kolodner R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that optimum binding to DNA is achieved when RecT is only in a monomer form, suggesting in turn that RecT oligomers might not be proficient for binding, especially to dsDNA. The results presented in this study show that RecT protein can efficiently transfer a ssDNA into a homologous duplex DNA in vitro, leading to the formation of a joint molecule containing a D-loop. Strand transfer did not require any high energy cofactor; it occurred at 0, 1, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 and was inhibited completely by the presence of 5 mmMgCl2. Optimum strand transfer was achieved when RecT was preincubated with ssDNA at a ratio of 1 RecT monomer/2.5 bases of ssDNA and subsequently reacted with uncoated dsDNA, indicating that pairing is mediated by a RecT-ssDNA complex. RecT-dsDNA complexes were unable to participate in pairing with uncoated ssDNA or with RecT-ssDNA complexes. However, both strand transfer and RecT binding to dsDNA displayed the same sensitivity to salt and Mg2+concentrations, suggesting that the capacity of RecT to bind dsDNA likely plays some role in strand transfer. In contrast, RecT binding to dsDNA was not required for the annealing of complementary ssDNA because this reaction occurred efficiently in the presence of high MgCl2 concentrations (17Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Hall S.D. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2P. Noirot, unpublished results. Taken together, these results suggest that RecT promotes joint molecule formation by a mechanism that is different from annealing. Finally, RecT can mediate D-loop formation between a supercoiled dsDNA and a linear dsDNA having homologous 3′-single-stranded tails, indicating that, despite its higher affinity for dsDNA, RecT is able to polymerize on the single-stranded tails, making them invasive. Indeed, this type of binding was observed previously by electron microscopy under conditions in which RecT would not bind to dsDNA (26Thresher R.J. Makhov A.M. Hall S.D. Kolodner R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our understanding of homologous pairing reactions comes mostly from the extensive studies of the E. coli RecA protein (for a review, see Ref. 27Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and similar proteins such as the bacteriophage T4 UvsX protein (28Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 (29Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and human Rad51 (30Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). This class of homologous pairing proteins requires a high energy cofactor and Mg2+ to form a nucleoprotein filament on the ssDNA which then promotes synapsis with the homologous duplex partner. RecT protein also forms nucleoprotein filaments with ssDNA which then catalyze the strand transfer reaction. However, unlike RecA, RecT performs strand transfer without ATP and in the absence of Mg2+ as well as at low concentrations of Mg2+. Other ATP-independent DNA-pairing proteins have been shown to promote pairing and strand exchange in vitro, such as the bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5 protein (31Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), E. coli RecO protein (32Luisi-DeLuca C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and S. cerevisiae Sep1 protein (33Chen J. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1356-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in all cases, the addition of Mg2+ was required for the reaction. This feature of RecT, which could be related to its higher affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA, suggests that RecT differs from these other DNA strand transfer proteins. Alternately, the inhibition of strand transfer by high Mg2+ concentrations could be similar to the situation with RecA protein where presynaptic filament formation occurs more efficiently at low concentrations of Mg2+ compared with high concentrations of Mg2+, presumably because of the inhibitory effect of secondary structure in ssDNA at high Mg2+ concentrations (35Thresher R. Christiansen G. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It also suggests that the level of unbound Mg2+ in the cell could regulate the RecT-promoted strand transfer reactions. Unfortunately, no accurate measurement of free Mg2+ levels is currently available (36 and references therein), although they are generally thought to be at low levels in the range on 1 mm where RecT promotes D-loop formation. Genetic evidence indicates that RecT is required for DSBR inrecBC sbcA strains (14Kusano K. Takahashi N.K. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This RecT-promoted DSBR is independent of RecA function and occurs by a conservative mechanism (12Takahashi N.K. Kusano K. Yokochi T. Kitamura Y. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yokochi T. Kusano K. Kobayashi I. Genetics. 1995; 139: 5-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we provide in vitro evidence that RecT can promote the invasion of a DNA duplex by a ssDNA to form a D-loop, which is the predicted initiation step in DSBR models (38Resnick M.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 59: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 39Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results indicate that RecT can initiate recombination not only by promoting DNA-reannealing and heteroduplex exchange (18Hall S.D. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but also by a DNA strand invasion mechanism, thus providing an explanation for the RecA independence of DSBR in recBC sbcA strains. Double strand breaks have been shown to induce recombination-dependent DNA replication in recBC sbcA strains where the RecE pathway of recombination is activated (40Asai T. Bates D.B. Kogoma T. Cell. 1994; 78: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this background, recombination-dependent DNA replication was shown to depend on a functional RecE pathway and partially on RecA function. It was suggested that the residual recombination-dependent DNA replication activity observed in the absence of RecA could be attributed to the pairing activity of RecT (40Asai T. Bates D.B. Kogoma T. Cell. 1994; 78: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our finding that in vitro, RecT promotes efficient D-loop formation with DNA substrates similar to those that the RecE exonuclease would generate strongly supports this interpretation. Taken together, these results suggest that RecT can promote D-loop formation in vivo. The biological importance of this process is underlined by mounting evidence suggesting that D-loop formation can be used not only to repair double-strand breaks but also to generate active replication forks (for review, see Ref.41Kogoma T. Cell. 1996; 85: 625-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2018276318,"This study was designed to identify functionally important factor IX (FIX) residues. Using recombinant techniques and cell culture, we produced a mutant FIX with arginine at 338 changed to alanine (R338A-FIX). This molecule had approximately 3 times greater clotting activity than that of wild type FIX (wt-FIX) in the activated partial thromboplastin assay. R338A-FIX reacted normally with a panel of three FIX specific monoclonal antibodies and migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indistinguishably from wt-FIX. Using functional assays, we determined that R338A-FIXa'sK d for factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) was similar to that of wt-FIXa. Our kinetic analysis, using factor X as substrate, indicated that the mutation's major effects were a 3-fold increase ink cat and a 2-fold decrease inK m both manifested only in the presence of FVIIIa. R338A-FIXa's increased catalytic efficiency did not result from ablation of a thrombin sensitive site, reported to occur at arginine 338, since in our assays the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, had no effect on activity of either wt-FIXa or R338A-FIXa. R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXa had equal activity, with or without FVIIIa, toward the synthetic substrate, methylsulfonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide. Interestingly, R338A-FIXa had reduced affinity for heparin. Therefore, we propose that R338A-FIXa's increased activity is not due to an allosteric effect on the active site, but that the Arg-338 residue is part of an exosite that binds both factor X and the mucopolysaccharide, heparin.

R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXa had equal activity, with or without FVIIIa, toward the synthetic substrate, methylsulfonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide. Interestingly, R338A-FIXa had reduced affinity for heparin. Therefore, we propose that R338A-FIXa's increased activity is not due to an allosteric effect on the active site, but that the Arg-338 residue is part of an exosite that binds both factor X and the mucopolysaccharide, heparin.

Specific cleavages between Arg-145 and Ala-146 and between Arg-180 and Val-181 result in a light chain and heavy chain linked by a single disulfide bond between cysteine 132 and cysteine 289 (4Bajaj S.P.

The structural organization of factor IX is similar to that of the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting proteins FVII, FX, and protein C (2Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The approximately 45 amino acids of the amino terminus comprise the γ-carboxyglutamic acid, or Gla, domain. This is followed by two epidermal growth factor homology domains, an activation peptide and the catalytic “heavy chain,” which is a member of the serine protease family (3Vysotchin A. Medved L.V.

The major physiological function of factor IXa in the blood coagulation cascade is to convert FX to FXa in a process that requires the presence of phospholipid surface, calcium ions, and FIXa's protein cofactor, FVIIIa. FIXa alone is an extremely poor protease, but when bound to FVIIIa to form the “intrinsic FXase” complex it becomes a potent FX activator (7Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E.

Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, upon binding FVIIIa, FIXa may undergo a conformational change at or near the active site (9Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of FIX is exemplified by the fact that patients with defective FIX molecules suffer from hemophilia B, an X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that is clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia A in patients who have no FVIII function. Using recombinant techniques, we created mutant FIX molecules designed to locate the residues of FIXa that bind FVIIIa. We have found one mutation, R338A-FIX, whose clotting activity is 2.5–3 times that of wild type FIX. In an attempt to understand the causes contributing to the increased clotting activity of R338A-FIX, we have determined several functional parameters. Our results demonstrate that the increased clotting activity is FVIIIa-dependent and is due to an increased k cat and decreasedK m for FX, the substrate for the FIXa·FVIIIa complex. Oligonucleotides for in vitro mutagenesis were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. T7 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP DNA sequencing kits were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The anti-human FIX monoclonal antibodies used in this study were A-1, A-5, and A-7, a gift from Dr. Kenneth J. Smith. Purified normal human plasma FIX, FX, FXa, FXIa, and thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Coagulation control level 1, FIX-deficient plasma, FVIII-deficient plasma, aPTT reagent, and standarded heparin were obtained from Sigma. Purified normal human plasma FVIII was a gift from Roher Biotechnology Inc. (Springfield, VA). Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Spectrozyme-FIXa (methylsulfonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) and Spectrozyme-FXa (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) were obtained from American Diagonostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Hirudin was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). The entire cDNA sequence was determined to ensure that the mutation was correct and that no inadvertent mutations had been introduced. Human embryo kidney 293 cells were grown in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. FIX and its mutants, in the vector pCMV5, a derivative of pCMV mammalian expression vector (11Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were cotransfected into cells with pSV2 neo selection marker, using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (12Hamaguchi N.

G418-resistant cell clones were subcloned and expanded. The supernatants from each clone were collected and assayed for FIX expression using a radioimmunometric assay with FIX antibodies. Stable clones with high expression levels of FIX were transferred into 850-cm2 roller bottles for protein production in the serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml vitamin K, and 10 mg/liter insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite. The supernatants were collected every 24 h for 10 days and stored at −20 °C. For purification, the frozen supernatants were thawed and EDTA and benzamidine-HCl were added (final concentration of 4 mm and 5 mm, respectively). The supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 μmMillipore filter to remove cell debris and incubated at 4 °C with overnight shaking in Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin (2.5 ml of resin/liter of supernatant). The resin was pre-equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm benzamidine-HCl, pH 7.4 (equilibration buffer). The resin was then loaded in a column, washed with equilibration buffer containing 2 mm EDTA for 4 h, and washed for another 1 h with equilibration buffer without EDTA. FIX was eluted from the column with a 0–60 mm calcium gradient, concentrated in a Centriprep-30, and stored at −80 °C. Three monoclonal antibodies (A1, A5, and A7) were used in the assay. A5 was employed at 10 μg/ml in 50 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) to coat a 96-well microtiter plate. Samples were added to the antibody-coated wells. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the second antibody, A1 or A7, labeled with 125I by IODOBEADs according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) was added at about 1 × 105cpm/well. Unbound radioactive antibody was washed with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) after a 4-h incubation, and the bound radioactive content of each well was measured. The standard curve was obtained using plasma FIX. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). The total protein/well used on SDS-PAGE was about 1 μg. Following electrophoresis, the purified proteins were visualized by silver staining or Western blot analysis. The concentrations of purified FIXs were determined spectrophotometrically assuming an extinction coefficient ε1% of 13.3, and the FIXa concentrations were further determined by antithrombin III active site titration (14Lozier J.N. Monroe D.M. Sherry S.D. Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Roberts H.R. High K.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Gla content were kindly performed by Dr. Cindy Payne at Lilly Research Laboratories. One-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). For partial thromboplastin time (PTT) assays, the FIX proteins were activated prior to the clotting test and phospholipids were used instead of an activator. The ability of the sample to correct the clotting time of FIX-deficient plasma was compared with a standard curve utilizing purified plasma FIX in both assays. All experiments were repeated on at least three times. wt-FIX or R338A-FIX was incubated with FXIa at a molar ratio 100:1 in HEPES buffer (20 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with 5 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 2 h or at a molar ratio 2000:1 in the same buffer at 37 °C for 4 h. The process of activation was followed by removing aliquots at specific time points. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, after which the samples were immediately boiled for 5 min and run on SDS-PAGE. Completely activated samples, judged by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. FVIII (10–34 nm) was activated to FVIIIa in HEPES buffer containing 20–64 nm thrombin for 5 min at 25 °C. The thrombin activity was then inhibited by further incubation of FVIIIa-thrombin mixture with 100–300 nm hirudin, and 5 mmcalcium for an additional 5 min at 25 °C. The concentration of FVIII was estimated from its activity in a one-stage aPTT assay, assuming the concentration of FVIII in plasma to be 0.3 nm. Freshly prepared 0.4 nm FVIIIa (25 μl) containing 400 μm PSPC (15Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) (45% phosphatidylserine, 55% phosphatidylcholine) was incubated with 25 μl of FIXa varying from 0 to 20 nm for 5 min at 25 °C in HEPES buffer plus 5 mm calcium, to form FXase. 200 nm FX and 1 mm Spectrozyme-FXa in 50 μl were added, and the initial rate of FXa generation was determined on the microplate reader. wt-FIXa or mutant R338A-FIXa (50 μl, 50 nm) was incubated with 200 μm PSPC vesicles, 10 mm calcium, and 0.5 mm Spectrozyme-FXa in a microplate well for 5 min at 25 °C. Varying concentrations of FX (50 μl, between 0 and 400 nm) were added to this mixture, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured for 30 min on the microplate reader. The final concentrations were 25 nm FIXa, 100 μm PSPC, 0–200 nm FX, and 0.25 mm Spectrozyme FXa. The assay was performed by incubation of 25 μl of freshly prepared FVIIIa (0.4 or 1.6 nm) containing 400 μm PSPC with an equal volume of FIXa (1 nm) for 5 min at 25 °C in HEPES buffer plus 1.0 mg/ml albumin, 10 mm calcium, and 0.5 mm Spectrozyme FXa to give a volume of 50 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μl of varying concentrations of FX. The rate of generation of FXa was determined on a microplate reader. The final concentrations were 0.25 nm FIXa, 0.1 nm or 0.4 nm FVIIIa, 100 μm PSPC, 0–200 nm FX, and 0.25 mm Spectrozyme FXa. The experiments were performed as described for the assay of FIX binding to FVIIIa, except that in one group, 100 nm hirudin was added to completely inhibit thrombin activity; in another group, no hirudin was added. Purified plasma wt-FIXa (2000 nm), FVIIIa (0.15 nm), FXa (300 nm), and calcium (5 mm) were mixed and incubated at 25 °C. At different time points, samples were removed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then silver-stained. FIX was activated using FXIa at a molar ratio 2000:1 (FIX:FXIa) and the concentrations of activated proteins were confirmed using antithrombin III active site titration (14Lozier J.N. Monroe D.M. Sherry S.D. Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Roberts H.R. High K.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of FVIIIa, 50 μl of 100 nm wt-FIXa or R338A-FIXa in HEPES buffer plus 33% ethylene glycol and 5 mm calcium was added to a 96-well microplate. Substrate cleavage was initiated by the addition of another 50 μl of varying concentrations of Spectrozyme-FIXa (0–8 mm) diluted in the same buffer, and the plate was immediately assayed by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm. The final concentrations were 50 nm FIXa and 0–4 mmSpectrozyme-FIXa. In the presence of FVIIIa, 5 μl of 120 nm wt-FIXa or R338A-FIXa was mixed with 35 μl of about 17 nm FVIIIa containing 142 μm PSPC. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to form FXase. Then, 10 μl of varying concentration of substrate (0–20 mmSpectrozyme-FIXa) was added to start the reaction. The final concentrations were 12 nm FIXa, 12 nm FVIIIa, 5 mm calcium, 100 μm PSPC, and 0–4 mm Spectrozyme-FIXa. The absorbance values at 405 nm were converted into molar concentration of product, using an extinction coefficient of 9.65 × 103m−1 cm−1. Data were fit (nonlinear least squares) to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph published by Synergy Software (PCS Inc.). wt-FIXa (8 nm, 25 μl) or R338A-FIXa was mixed with 25 μl of 1.6 nm FVIIIa in HEPES buffer with 5 mm calcium and 200 μm PSPC and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min to form FXase. Varying concentrations (12–10,800 nm, 25 μl) of heparin (assuming that the molecular weight of standarded heparin is about 15,000) in the same buffer plus 5 mm calcium was added and incubated for another 5 min. The initial rate of FX activation was determined by addition of 25 μl of a mixture containing of 800 nm FX, 2 mm Spectrozyme-FXa, 5 mm calcium, and 1.0 mg/ml albumin. Absorbance of initial rate of FX activation mediated by FIXa was converted to nanomolar Xa/min by the following equation (16Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Briet E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L.

TheK d for FIXa binding to FVIIIa was determined using Equation 2, where it is assumed that the rate of FXa cleavage is directly proportional to the FIXa·FVIIIa complex concentration.[FIXa·FVIIIa]=([FIXa]t+[FVIIIa]t+Kd)2−([FIXa]t+[FVIIIa]t+Kd)2−4[FIXa]t[FVIIIa]t2Equation 2 The data from inhibition experiments were fit to Equation 3, described as partial noncompetitive inhibition by Segel (18Segel I.H.

The expression level of the carboxylated FIX varied from 500 to 1000 ng/106 cells/24 h. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that both purified R338A-FIX and recombinant wt-FIX migrated as a single band with the same molecular weight as plasma FIX (Fig. 1), and Gla analysis showed full carboxylation of both mutant R338A-FIX and recombinant wt-FIX (TableI), further indicating the high purity of the expressed proteins. In addition, both R338A-FIX and recombinant wt-FIX bound to three FIX-specific monoclonal antibodies with the same efficiency as did plasma-purified FIX or pooled normal plasma (TableI).Table IAntigenicity, γ-carboxyglutamic acid, and clotting activity of the mutant R338A and wild type factor IXsSampleAntigenicity A5 and A1GlaaPTTPTT%%%R338A-FIX102 ± 913260 ± 41282 ± 53Recombinant wt-FIX111 ± 211.1ND110 ± 16Plasma purified wt-FIX10013.5100100Pooled normal plasma100121-aThe expected number of Gla (γ-carboxyglutamic acid) residues per FIX molecule is 12.94 ± 18ND1-a The expected number of Gla (γ-carboxyglutamic acid) residues per FIX molecule is 12. Open table in a new tab The initial characterization of recombinant FIX was a one-stage aPTT assay. Purified plasma FIX and normal pooled plasma were employed as standards. The results, shown in Table I, indicate that R338A-FIX had 2.6-fold higher clotting activity than normal FIX. To rule out the possibility that the increased clotting activity was due to trace amounts of FIXa generated during protein purification, all the FIX were activated and then assayed in FIX-deficient plasma (PTT assay). As shown in Table I, the PTT clotting activity of activated R338A-FIX was 2.8-fold higher than activated plasma FIX. This result agrees well with results of the aPTT assay and suggests that the increased activity is not the result of activated FIXa contaminating the R338A-FIX preparation. We assumed that FXase activity is directly proportional to the concentration of FIXa·FVIIIa complex (17Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is a reasonable assumption because, in the conditions that we use, addition of FVIIIa to FIXa results in a 300–1000-fold increase in the FXase reaction rate. In the assay of FIXa binding to FVIIIa, binding affinity was monitored through a FXa generation mediated by FIXa·FVIIIa complex. The results of five experiments, each done in duplicate, are shown in Fig. 2. When all the data were fit to Equation 2, the apparent dissociation constant (K d) for binding of R338A-FIXa to FVIIIa was 0.75 ± 0.10 nm compared with 1.01 ± 0.24 nm for plasma FIXa. This is consistent with the published binding constants (17Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The maximum rate of FX cleavage achieved, however, was 2.7-fold greater for activated R338A-FIX than for wt-FIXa (3.56 ± 0.15 nm FXa/min and 1.30 ± 0.10 nm/min, respectively.) The kinetic parameters for cleavage of FX by R338A-FIXa, plasma FIXa (data not shown), or recombinant wt-FIXa were investigated in the absence or presence of their cofactor, FVIIIa. In the absence of FVIIIa, the k cat values for R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXa were 1.72 × 10−3/s and 1.70 × 10−3/s, respectively, while the K m for R338A-FIXa was about 2 fold higher compared with that of recombinant FIXa (Fig. 3 A, TableII). When FVIIIa at either 0.1 nm (Fig. 3 B) or 0.4 nm (Fig.3 C) was included in the reaction, thek cat of R338A-FIXa was 1.65 and 1.20/s, respectively, compared with 0.53 and 0.63/s for recombinant wt-FIX (Table II). Moreover, in contrast to the situation in the absence of FVIIIa, the K m of R338A-FIXa was about 2-fold lower compared with wt-FIXa (Table II).Table IIThe kinetic analysis of mutant R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXaK mV maxEnzymek cat2-ak cat =V max/[enzyme], in the presence of FVIIIa; the enzyme concentrations of FIXa · FVIIIa complex were calculated based on Equation 2 and observed K d values.k cat/K mnmnm FXa min −1nms −1mol −1 s −1Without FVIIIa wt-FIXa28.45 ± 3.562.55 ± 0.09251.70 × 10−35.98 × 104 R338A-FIXa53.50 ± 7.442.58 ± 0.13251.72 × 10−33.22 × 104With FVIIIa 0.1 nM wt-FIXa18.38 ± 3.370.63 ± 0.030.0200.532.88 × 107 R338A-FIXa7.72 ± 0.652.47 ± 0.040.0251.652.14 × 108With FVIIIa 0.4 nM wt-FIXa19.64 ± 1.792.46 ± 0.060.0650.633.21 × 107 R338A-FIXa12.23 ± 0.845.42 ± 0.080.0751.209.81 × 1072-a k cat =V max/[enzyme], in the presence of FVIIIa; the enzyme concentrations of FIXa · FVIIIa complex were calculated based on Equation 2 and observed K d values. Open table in a new tab One obvious possibility for the increased activity of R338A-FIX is that replacing the arginine by alanine eliminates a potential proteolytic cleavage site. It has been reported, for example, that thrombin can cleave FIX after residue 338 to render the FIX molecule inactive (19Enfield D.L. Thompson A.R. Blood. 1984; 64: 821-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kisiel W. Smith K.J. Mcmullen B.A. Blood. 1985; 66: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This did not seem likely because the experiments that demonstrated this phenomenon required a very large concentration of thrombin. Because hirudin is a potent inhibitor of thrombin we repeated our binding experiments in the presence and absence of hirudin. As shown in Fig.4, hirudin had no detectable effect on the maximum velocity achieved with recombinant wt-FIXa.V max was 1.27 ± 0.12 nmFXa/min in the absence of hirudin, and 1.35 ± 0.15 nmFXa/min in its presence. Thus, the cleavage of FIXa at Arg-338 by thrombin does not explain the increased catalytic activity of R338A-FIXa. Another potential source of proteolysis in our experimental system is the FXa generated during the reaction. To test the possibility that FXa might cleave the heavy chain of FIXa at arginine 338, we incubated purified plasma FIXa with FXa and FVIIIa. If FXa can cleave FIXa at arginine 338, which is responsible for the difference in activity between wt-FIXa and R338A-FIXa, it would be easily observed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5, no cleavage in the heavy chain of FIXa (M r 28,000) was observed when incubated for up to 120 min. Thus, reduced proteolysis of R338A-FIXa by FXa compared with wt-FIXa does not explain the increase in catalytic activity. Whether in the absence or presence of FVIIIa, the Kcat of both R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXa for synthetic peptidyl substrate, Spectrozyme-FIXa was similar (TableIII). Based on our experiments, theK d of FIXa for FVIIIa is about 1 nm. Thus, the concentration of FIXa·FVIIIa complex in these experiments was ∼9 nm (Equation 2), which was high enough to measure any differences caused by changes in the active site between R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXa. Although we used FIXa concentration (12 nm) as an enzyme concentration in calculating k cat(Table III), there was no obvious difference ink cat if the FIXa·FVIIIa complex concentration (9 nm) was used. Interestingly, we observed a small increase on K m for both enzymes in the presence of FVIIIa.Table IIIThe kinetic analysis for hydrolysis of spectrozyme-FIXa by R338A-FIXa and wt-FIXaK mV max/minV max/sEnzymek cat 3-ak cat =V max/[enzyme].

Open table in a new tab We measured the effect of heparin on FXase at fixed concentrations of FIXa, FVIIIa, FX, and phospholipids. The initial rate of FX activation is indicated as a function of varying concentrations of the inhibitor. The results shown in Fig. 6 represented means from three different experiments and, as expected, revealed that heparin inhibited FXa generation both by R338A-FXase and wt-FXase. However, we observed a 2-fold difference in K ivalues (26 ± 6.10 nm for R338A-FIXa and 12 ± 1.66 nm for wt-FIXa), and a 7-fold difference inV max(i) values (3.55 ± 0.41 nm FXa/min for R338A-FIXa and 0.49 ± 0.09 nm FXa/min for wt-FIXa) for the two enzymes. At saturating concentrations of heparin, the enzymes had residual activities of ∼5% for wt-FIXa and 17% for R338A-FIXa. This result is consistent with heparin's partial noncompetitive inhibition of FXase reported previously (21Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our original aim was to identify residues critical for the interaction between FIXa and FVIIIa. Instead we found a mutation, arginine 338 (C170) to alanine, that resulted in a FIX molecule with 3 times more coagulant activity than recombinant wild type or plasma FIX. In assays using various components of the intrinsic FXase complex, the increased activity was manifested only toward the macromolecular substrate FX and only in the presence of FVIIIa. This increase is the result of a 3-fold increase in k cat and a 2-fold decrease in K m relative to wild type. There are several possible explanations for our observations. First, changing arginine at 338 to alanine might increase the affinity of FIXa for FVIIIa so that at a given concentration of proteins, more FIXa would be complexed with FVIIIa, thus increasing the effective enzyme concentration. A chimeric factor IXa with factor VII's first epidermal growth factor-like domain had increased activity for this reason (22Chang J.Y. Monroe D.M. Stafford D.W. Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 1202Google Scholar). This could account for the increase in k cat, but not the decrease in K m. Inasmuch as we observe no significant difference for the K d between R338A-FIXa and FVIIIa relative to normal FIXa, this model seems unlikely to fit our results. Second, FVIIIa, through residue 338, may exert an allosteric effect on the active site of FIXa. Complex formation between FVIIIa and FIXa results in at least a 300-fold (Table II) and, in some conditions, much greater (8Van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) increase in k cat for FX activation. This has usually been interpreted in terms of a Michaelis complex formation preceded only by a bimolecular binding of substrate to enzyme. The k cat is proportional to the difference in free energy between the ground state (Michaelis complex) and the transition state. Therefore, one possibility is that FVIIIa binding alters the active site environment of FIXa and changes the energy required to reach the transition state. Mutation of R338A-FIXa could increase the k cat allosterically by affecting this process. There is some evidence, not only for factor IXa-factor VIIIa (9Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also for tissue factor-factor VIIa (23Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4834-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombin-thrombomodulin (24Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that cofactor binding alters the enzyme's active site configuration. On the other hand, one previous report stated that FVIIIa had no effect on FIXa's small substrate cleavage (25Castillo M.J. Kurachi K. Nishino N. Ohkubo I. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test this, we employed the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme-FIXa to probe the active site of R338A-FIXa. The results show that, for both wt-FIXa and R338A-FIXa, thek cat values were approximately the same (TableIII) in the presence or absence of FVIIIa. This indicates that the mutation itself does not alter the catalytic event at the active pocket of FIXa. In addition, R338A-FIXa's factor VIIIa-dependent increase in catalytic activity is not induced by an allosteric effect on the active site. This means that FVIIIa binding to FIXa does not cause a rearrangement of factor IXa's catalytic residues, nor does it cause a change in the rate of the catalytic event. Previous fluorescence studies with active site modified FIXa indicate that binding FVIIIa may cause a conformational change in the active site (9Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although our results show no effect onk cat, we do observe a smallK m increase for both enzymes with FVIIIa. This result is consistent with studies of FVa effect on FXa activity (26Neshiem M.E. Eid S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9874-9882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps our results and those of the fluorescence studies can be reconciled by hypothesizing that, upon factor VIIIa binding, there is a change in substrate binding site beyond the catalytic residues. This causes the slight increase in K m that we observe with the small substrate and the alteration in fluorescence intensity. Therefore, our results both with the small substrate and factor X are consistent with a model in which residue 338 is a part of an extended macromolecular binding site (exosite). This exosite may be made more accessible to FX when FIXa binds FVIIIa, thus causing the observed changes in catalytic constants. According to this model, when alanine replaces arginine at residue 338, the smaller neutral side chain of alanine would mitigate an unfavorable interaction during the initial binding of FX to intrinsic tenase. This view is supported by our observations that R338A-FIXa·FVIIIa's K m for its substrate FX decreased 7-fold compared with R338A-FIXa alone (53.50 nm versus 7.72 nm, Table II), whereas wt-FIXa's K m decreased only 1.5-fold with FVIIIa. It is well known that FVIIIa accelerates FX activation mainly by increasing k cat. Based on our results, cofactor binding has little effect on small substrate catalysis. Therefore, we think that cofactor binding affects the positioning of the substrate at the active site resulting in an increasedk cat in the presence of FVIIIa. This phenomenon is further enhanced in R338A-FIXa. This same realignment of substrate binding apparently has a different effect or no effect on the small substrate. That is because when FVIIIa binds FIXa, causing a rearrangement of the substrate binding site, part of this site is involved only in macromolecular substrate binding. This is where residue 338 is located. Our results indicate that Arg-338 is not only part of a FX binding site, but is also part of a heparin binding site. Heparin is a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of the intrinsic FXase complex (21Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial noncompetitive inhibitor and substrate can bind to the enzyme at the same time, and the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex has some activity (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 100-180Google Scholar). Well characterized exosites on thrombin are involved in a multiplicity of functions, including cofactor, substrate, and heparin binding (27Wu Q.Y. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The α-helix 330–338 (C162–C170) of FIX is close to part of the region designated exosite II in thrombin, which has been implicated in heparin binding (30Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of porcine FIXa also suggests that this α-helix might be a heparin binding site (6Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this prediction. The mutation of arginine to alanine not only decreases the affinity for heparin by about 2-fold, but also increases theV max(i) (Equation 3) by more than 7-fold. The small K i change may suggest that, as with thrombin, several residues are necessary for heparin binding on FIX molecule (29Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that Arg-338 is part of an exosite on FIXa that interacts both with substrate and heparin. Whether both functions are mediated by identical residues or only overlap remains to be shown."

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and a significant pathogen of immunocompromised patients, notably persons with AIDS (1Beaman M.H. McCabe R.E. Wong S-Y. Remington J.S. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 2455-2475Google Scholar). The parasite enters target cells by a process of active invasion and resides within a specialized parasitophorous vacuole, bounded by a specialized parasitophorous vacuole membrane (2Silverman J.A.

The PVM contains a non-selective pore (4Schwab J.C. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) that allows free transit of solutes ofM r < 1300, allowing parasite access to the contents of the host cytosol. The parasite modifies the vacuolar environment by the secretion of a large number of proteins; their function and how they contribute to the pathogenesis of the organism remains a mystery. One of the few vacuolar proteins with known enzymatic activity is theToxoplasma nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase; EC3.6.1.15) (5Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme functions as an apyrase and is capable of degrading ATP to ADP and ADP to AMP. Two isoforms, NTPase1 and NTPase3, are expressed in mouse-virulent strains of Toxoplasma, whereas the majority of mouse-avirulent strains express only the NTPase1 isoform (6Asai T. Miura S. Sibley L.D. Okabayaski H. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Nakaar V. Bermudes D Peck K.R. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). These isoforms vary in enzymatic specificity. NTPase3 shows a preference for ATP as a substrate, whereas NTPase1 is equally active against ATP and ADP. The NTPase is released from secretory organelles termed dense granules (7Sibley L.D. Niesman I.R. Asai T. Takeuchi T. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and accumulates as a soluble protein in the vacuolar space (8Bermudes D. Peck K.R.

Joiner, submitted for publication. The physiological function of the NTPase remains unknown. T. gondii is a purine auxotroph, and it is suggested that the enzyme may function in the purine salvage pathway by participating in the generation of the preferred purine salvage substrate, adenosine (9Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), according to the following scheme. Host cell ATP entering the vacuolar space via the PVM pore is degraded by the NTPase to ADP and AMP, with subsequent conversion to adenosine via 5′ nucleotidase and entry into the parasite via the Toxoplasma low affinity adenosine transporter (2Silverman J.A. Joiner K.A. Kaufmann S. Host Response to Intracellular Pathogens. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 313-338Google Scholar, 10Schwab J.C. Affifi M.A. Pizzorno G. Handshumacher R.E. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (Free adenosine is normally present in relatively low levels in the eukaryotic cytoplasm, below the K m of the transporter). Several factors, however, suggest that the physiological function of the NTPase may be more complex. The enzyme contains 15 cysteine residues, and in vitro, requires dithiols to be enzymatically active. Dithiothreitol (DTT) will activate the enzyme, whereas monothiols such as glutathione and cysteine are ineffective (5Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is reported to activate the protein (11Asai T. Kim T. Zbl. Bakt. Hyg. 1987; 264: 464-467PubMed Google Scholar); however, host cell thioredoxin is presumably excluded from the parasitophorous vacuole by the PVM, and it is not known whether Toxoplasmasecretes a physiologic dithiol. It is therefore unclear whether the secreted NTPase is actually active in the vacuolar space. Indeed, theoretical considerations suggest that it cannot be fully active. The NTPase constitutes 1–2% of total parasite protein (5Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); based onin vitro activity levels, we have calculated that the fully activated enzyme secreted by a single parasite could degrade the entire host ATP pool in a matter of minutes, assuming free access to ATP via the PVM pore. These considerations suggest that the enzymatic activity of the NTPase must be tightly regulated and raise the question of why the parasite might produce so much excess potential activity. We have undertaken a series of experiments designed to demonstrate the validity of our in vitro data with regard to the in vivo function and regulation of NTPase and to resolve apparent discrepancies between the two. Here, we demonstrate that the NTPase is oxidized within the T. gondii secretory pathway and that the vast majority remains oxidized after secretion into the presumably reducing environment of the vacuolar space. The addition of exogenous dithiols reduces and activates the remaining enzyme. Full-scale activation of the NTPase results in rapid depletion of host cell ATP levels and exit of parasites from the cell. Vero cells were grown at 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin (Vero medium). T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites were maintained by serial passage in the peritoneum of Swiss-Webster mice or in Vero cell monolayers as described previously (12Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M.

Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For preparation of stable lines, electroporated parasites were cultured in a Vero cell monolayer with gradually increasing amounts of pyrimethamine up to a final of concentration of 100 μg/ml, then cloned by limiting dilution, as described previously (13Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar).

Vero cell monolayers (five 10-cm dishes) were infected with 3.5 × 107 parasites/dish at 37 °C for 20–24 h. Monolayers were washed three times with prewarmed PBS, then 4.5 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential media was added to each dish. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for 1 h, then 0.5 ml of a mixture of 1 ml of Pro-mix [l]35Sin vivo cell labeling mix and 1.5 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential media was added to each plate (200 μCi/plate). All dishes were pulse-labeled for 15 min at 37 °C. For the zero chase time sample, labeling media was aspirated from one dish, the cells were washed three times at 4 °C with PBS, and cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM (PBS-NEM) was added for 10 min to alkylate free sulfhydryls. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and left on ice until the completion of the experiment. The four additional dishes were washed three times with prewarmed PBS, then incubated for either 15 min (2 dishes) or 75 min (2 dishes) at 37 °C with 5 ml of Vero medium containing 100 μg/ml unlabeledl-methionine and l-cysteine. Plates were then processed as described for the zero chase time sample. Labeled monolayers were collected by scraping, and parasites were liberated from infected cells by passage two times through a 27-gauge needle, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min, then washed two times in PBS-NEM. Pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100 plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmaprotinin, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μmpepstatin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min; supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing 70 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 8 μl of rabbit anti-NTPase and 70 μl of protein A beads were added to the supernatant, and incubation was continued for 2–3 h at 4 °C; beads were pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed three times in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. During the final wash, the suspension was divided equally between two fresh tubes, and 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 15% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, bromphenol blue) with or without 100 mm DTT was added for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were treated with 0.125m sodium salicylate in 30% methanol, dried, and developed by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat AR film. One 10-cm Vero cell dish was infected with 107RH parasites at 37 °C for 40 h, then washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm NEM to alkylate free sulfhydryls in NTPase. Monolayers were scraped into 1 ml of PBS-NEM, and 100-μl aliquots were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. DTT at either 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mm was added to each tube, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and NEM was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The reduction status of NTPase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. To 22.5-μl aliquots of NTPase-containing material (immunoprecipitates, detergent extracts, cell supernatants, or purified recombinant NTPase as indicated) was added 2.5 μl of a mix containing 100 mm ATP and 0.3 μCi of [3H]ATP (5 mCi/mmol). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, tubes were placed on ice, and 1 μl of each reaction was loaded onto polyethyleneimine F-cellulose TLC plates (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) that had been prespotted with 1 μl of a mix containing 10 mm each ATP, ADP, and AMP. The plate was developed in 0.4 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The ATP, ADP, and AMP spots were visualized under UV light and excised, and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation in Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Instruments, Meriden CT). For the time course assays described in Fig. 5, purified recombinant NTPase3 (1 μg) in HM (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm (CH3COO)2Mg) was pretreated with DTT (concentrations and time varied; see legend to Fig. 5 for details) before the addition of ATP to 10 mm and 0.3 μCi of [3H]ATP; alternatively, the preincubation buffer contained 10 mm ATP. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%; after incubation on ice for 15 min, samples were assayed by TLC as described above. Two polymerase chain reaction fragments were generated. Fragment 1 was generated with the following primers: forward, GTCCTCGGGCTTCGAATCCG; reverse, CGAGATAAGCTTCTGCTCCAGATTGTGAGAATATCC. This fragment spanned the region from bp 1547 to bp 2030 in NTP3 (GenBank accession number U14324), included 15 bp of the c-myc sequence at the 3′ end and contains a natural NheI site near the 5′ end. Fragment 2 was generated with the following primers: forward, GAGCAGAAGCTTATCTCGGAGGAGGATCTGTGAAATGTCGATTGATGG; reverse, GGCGCTTGCTCGCGGAAGAC. This fragment extended in the opposite direction from bp 2226 in the 3′-untranslated region to bp 2031 in NTP3 (containing the stop codon), included the 30-bp c-mycsequence at the 5′ end, and contains a natural BssHII site near the 3′ end. Fragment 1 was digested with NheI andHindIII, the latter of which cuts within the introduced c-myc sequence. Fragment 2 was digested with BssHII andHindIII. These fragments were then ligated in a triple ligation to NTP3 in pBKS (pBSNTP3) (8Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and digested withNheI and BssHII. The construct was sequenced to confirm that the junction area was correct. Vero cell monolayers were infected for 20–24 h with the RH or RH-NTP-c-myc strain of T. gondii (3 × 107 parasites/dish). Parasites were liberated from cells by passage two times through a 27-gauge needle and solubilized in NTPase buffer (HM plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5% Lubrol. To the supernatant, after a 14,000 × gspin, 3 μl of rabbit or mouse anti-NTPase-glutathioneS-transferase fusion (8Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-c-myc (Mab 9E10) ascites (kindly provided by R. Collins, New Haven, CT) was added to each tube, followed by 40 μl of protein A beads. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and beads were pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with NTPase buffer. After the last wash, the sample was split into three tubes (each containing approximately 107 parasite equivalents). Two tubes were used for measurement of NTPase enzymatic activity, and the sample in the third tube was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Vero cell monolayers were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105/well 24 h before infection with 3 × 105 RH strainToxoplasma/well. After 24 or 40 h of infection, monolayers were washed two times with PBS and one time with HM. DTT was added to the monolayers in HM (concentrations varied; see figure legends for details) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For preparation of detergent lysates, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and monolayers were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 50-μl aliquots were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min before 25 μl of the aliquot were assayed for NTPase activity as described above. Alternatively, 50 μl of DTT-treated cell supernatant was clarified and sampled without the addition of detergent. Vero cell monolayers in 24-well plates were infected as described above. Monolayers were washed two times with PBS and once with HM. DTT was added in HM (times and concentrations varied; see figure legends for details). ATP was extracted by the addition of an equal volume of 2% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were neutralized by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1n Tris, pH 9.0, before ATP determination using a luciferin/luciferase system (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vero cell monolayers were seeded in 24-well plates on 12-mm glass coverslips at 1 × 105/well 24 h before infection with 2 × 105 RH strain Toxoplasma/well. Monolayers were treated with DTT as described for the ATP depletion assay. After incubation with DTT, however, the supernatant was removed, and the monolayer was fixed and permeabilized with cold 100% methanol for 15 min at room temperature with no further washing. Detection was with mouse monoclonal antibody T6–2H11 against GRA3 (1:200) (17Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Sadak A. Fortier B. Leriche M.A. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Parasitology. 1991; 103: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal antisera against whole Toxoplasma (1:250) diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1: 500 in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 using earlier procedures (16Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Host and parasite nuclei were visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and observed with a Nikon Microphot FXA epifluorescence microscope. For quantitative assays, fields were chosen at random under 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole illumination and counted for host cells before parasites were counted under fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine illumination. The percentage of infected cells (number of vacuoles/number of cells) and the average parasites/vacuole (total parasites counted/total vacuoles) were calculated. Selected images were photographed using Kodak Elite II ASA 400 color slide film, digitized with Sprintscan 35, and processed using Adobe Photoshop. It has previously been reported (5Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a minute fraction (0.08–0.4%) of NTPase purified from host-free parasites is active in the absence of added DTT (DTT-independent). We sought to determine what fraction of NTPase in the vacuolar space is DTT-independent. We first assessed the oxidation-reduction status of the NTPase during transit through the T. gondii secretory pathway by immunoprecipitation of NTPase from host-free parasites. During the initial 15 min of the chase period, a diffuse band was observed, likely reflecting the presence of folding intermediates within the endoplasmic reticulum with incorrect or incomplete disulfide bond formation; at longer times the protein migrates as a single major band (Fig. 1 A). Examination of NTPase from the vacuolar space shows that it co-migrates with NTPase from extracellular parasites (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that although the reducing environment of the vacuolar space is likely to be the same as that of the host cell cytosol, the majority of the enzyme in the vacuolar space is still fully oxidized; this is consistent with the low percentage of total NTPase that is active (see below). The failure to detect significant reduced NTPase in the vacuolar space suggests that the secreted enzyme is largely inactive. To examine this directly, ATPase activity was measured in detergent lysates. As shown in Table I, no consistent increase in DTT-independent NTPase activity was observed in infected compared with uninfected cells (as previously demonstrated, uninfected cells have no detectable DTT-dependent ATPase activity). The occasional observation of increased activity (e.g. Table I, Exp. 2) may indicate that a portion of the NTPase is activated in vivo; alternatively, T. gondii infection may result in increased ATPase activity in the infected cell, or the activity may be due to other parasite proteins. The subcellular localization of the additional DTT-independent ATPase activity could distinguish among these possibilities. However, ATPase assays on subcellular fractions produced inconclusive and inconsistent results, precluding such an assignment (data not shown).Table ISecreted NTPase has minimal, if any, activity in the absence of dithiolsTrialLysate volumeNTPase activityUninfected −DTTUninfected +DTTInfected −DTTInfected +DTTμlnmol of ATP hydrolyzed1113.86.818.192.32.525.613.015.8201.32114.214.818.546.62.512.518.534.185.432.56.29.39.4104.9 Open table in a new tab Because subcellular localization was inconclusive, we developed an alternative method to determine what fraction of DTT-independent ATPase activity in infected cells was indeed due to the NTPase. NTPase from the vacuolar space was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against recombinant NTPase or a mouse polyclonal antisera against an NTPase-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (8Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzymatic activity was quantitated before and after treatment with DTT. As shown in Table II, approximately 30% of the total NTPase immunoprecipitated from the vacuolar space with murine anti-NTPase antiserum was active in the absence of added DTT. Although this might suggest that a substantial fraction of the NTPase in the vacuolar space was active, we have previously found that at least 25% of the total NTPase immunoprecipitated from extracellular parasites with mouse antiserum was DTT-independent (8Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that less than 1% of total parasite NTPase prepared by detergent lysate is DTT-independent. That result was confirmed in these experiments.Table IINTPase immunoprecipitated from the vacuolar space may be activated by antibodyExperimentAntibodyNTPase activity−DTT+DTTnmol of ATP hydrolyzed1Rabbit anti-NTPase1346Mouse anti-NTPase197606Mouse anti-c-myc55152Normal mouse serum17142Rabbit anti-NTPase3639Mouse anti-NTPase206587Mouse anti-c-myc92132Normal mouse serum3142 Open table in a new tab The surprisingly high DTT-independent NTPase activity in the immunoprecipitated material may have been due to selective interaction between the antibody and activated NTPase. We therefore immunopurified NTPase from the vacuolar space via a c-myc epitope fused in-frame to the C terminus of NTPase3. This construct was stably expressed in the parasite and found by immunofluorescence to co-localize with native NTPase (18Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Methods. 1997; 13: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, 35–60% of the total ATPase activity immunoprecipitated from the vacuolar space with anti-c-myc antibody was DTT-independent (Table II). These results are analogous to those reported above after immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-NTPase antiserum and suggest that the process of immunoprecipitation may activate the NTPase in the absence of exogenous dithiols (see “Discussion”). Therefore, it was not possible to determine by immunoprecipitation what fraction of NTPase, if any, was enzymatically active within the vacuolar space. Our data strongly suggest that the vast majority of NTPase in the vacuolar space is neither reduced nor active. We sought to determine whether the intravacuolar enzyme can be reduced by the addition of exogenous dithiols. In the presence of 1 mm NEM, treatment of infected cells with concentrations of DTT of 5 mm or greater resulted in a series of less rapidly migrating bands corresponding to reduced forms of the enzyme (Fig. 2). Increasing concentrations of DTT, through 50 mm, produced increasing amounts of reduced enzyme, although the extent of reduction was not been rigorously quantified. To demonstrate that the reduction seen in Fig.2 corresponded to activation of vacuolar enzyme, we measured NTPase activity recoverable from infected monolayers treated for 10 min with DTT. Initially, NTPase activity was measured after Triton X-100 solubilization of DTT-treated monolayers (the presence of 1% Triton did not inhibit the activity of purified recombinant NTPase). 3J. A. Silverman, H. Qi, A. Riehl, C. Beckers, V. Nakaar, and K. A. Joiner, unpublished observations. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the addition of DTT to infected, but not uninfected, cells results in significant levels of ATP-degrading activity. Because subsequent work demonstrated the lysis of host cells after DTT treatment (see below), we measured the NTPase activity present in the supernatants of monolayers after DTT addition but in the absence of detergent treatment (No Triton). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the level of ATP-degrading activity detected in supernatants was essentially equivalent to that in detergent lysates, consistent with release by host cell lysis of most of the activated NTPase. To ensure that the activity was truly DTT-dependent, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeant alkylating agent NEM could prevent activation, consistent with in vitro findings (Fig.3 B). We next determined the dose response to DTT treatment for in situ activation of the NTPase. Maximum levels of NTPase activity are detected at 1 mm DTT, with decreasing activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of the reducing agent (Fig.4). Based on dilutions of the 1 mm supernatant, we estimated the 50 mm sample to be 20-fold less active (data not shown). We obtained an identical result from detergent lysates of host-free parasites and for purified recombinant NTPase3 (data not shown), suggesting that the reverse dose response is an intrinsic property of the enzyme. These results are not affected by the inclusion of protease inhibitors nor did immunoblotting indicate any reduction (within 2-fold) in protein levels (data not shown), suggesting that the loss of activity is not due to degradation of the enzyme. This result is in direct contrast to the findings of Asai et al. (5Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported no significant change in NTPase activity between 1 and 50 mm DTT. We have determined that the discrepancy in these observations is the result of the longer time of exposure to DTT in our"

We report the novel finding of two types of MS ion channels in the cell membrane of the halophilic archaeonHaloferax volcanii, a member of the Archaeathat comprise the third phylogenetic domain. The two channels, MscA1 and MscA2, differed in their kinetic properties with MscA1 exhibiting more frequent open-closed transitions than MscA2. Both channels have large conductances that rectify between −40 mV and +40 mV where the conductance of MscA1 ranged from 380 to 680 picosiemens, whereas MscA2 ranged from 850 to 490 picosiemens. Both channels were blocked by submillimolar gadolinium. In addition, the channels of either membrane vesicles or detergent-solubilized membrane proteins remained functional upon reconstitution into artificial liposomes, a result that indicates that these channels are activated by mechanical force transmitted via the lipid bilayer alone. Subsequently a 37-kDa protein corresponding to the MscA1 channel activity was purified. With the possible functional similarity to bacterial MS channels, our finding of MS channels inArchaea emphasizes the ubiquity and importance of these channels in all domains of the evolutionary tree.

According to the recent revision the universal phylogenetic tree is composed of three domains: Eukarya,Eubacteria, and Archaea (formerly archaebacteria) (1Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). From this scheme archaebacteria, which are prokaryotes like eubacteria, constitute an intermediary domain between eubacteria and eukaryotes, and although prokaryotes, archaebacteria are neither phylogenetically closer to eubacteria or to eukaryotes (7Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As a distinct group of microorganisms Archaea comprise several different families of cells adapted to environments of certain habitats characterized by extreme temperatures such as in ocean hydrothermal vents, or high salt concentrations as occur in the Dead Sea (3Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Barinaga M. Science. 1994; 264: 1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The existence of ion channels in cell membranes of different organisms belonging to the eubacterial and eukaryotic phylogenetic domains has been well documented. In contrast, the existence of ion channels in cell membranes of Archaea was only recently documented with the discovery of porin-like channels in the archaebacteriumHaloferax volcanii (formerly Halobacterium volcanii) (9Besnard M.

The finding of this class of channels in the cell membrane of an archaeon demonstrates that MS channels, as well as porins, are present in organisms belonging to all domains of the evolutionary tree and indicates the importance of these types of membrane pores in the phylogeny of ion channels. Cells of H. volcanii were grown and membranes prepared as described previously (9Besnard M. Martinac B. Ghazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 992-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in nutrient rich media (in mm: 3350 NaCl, 170 MgCl2, 200 MgSO4, 6 CaCl2, 26 KCl, 6.6 NaHCO3, 5.4 NaBr, plus 5 g of yeast extract per liter) until the absorbanceA 600 was 1.0, washed three times by centrifugation with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet resuspended in 2 mm MgSO4, 5% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, DNase (20 μg/ml), 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.6, and passed twice through a French press at 8,000 psi (Aminco, SLM Instruments, Inc.). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 rpm for 20 min (Avanti J-25 I, Beckman) to eliminate cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged for 25 min at 90,000 rpm (Beckmann TL-100). The pellet containing the membrane vesicle fraction was then resuspended in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, and protein content was determined using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the suspension were stored at −20 °C for further use. Alternatively, cell membrane extract following French press was layered on top of a discontinous sucrose gradient (25 and 60%) and spun down for 16 h at 25,000 rpm (SW28 Beckman rotor). Two major membrane fractions were collected as a “pink band” at the 25%/60% interface and a “black pellet.” The protein content was measured as above. Aliquots (50 μl) were stored at −20 °C until required. Membrane fraction (pink band) was solubilized in 200 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, buffer containing 100 mmoctylglucoside and incubated for 30 min. Alternatively, membrane fractions after French press were washed by centrifugation in a high salt wash solution (700 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) followed by a low salt wash (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0). For the subsequent steps either octylglucoside or Triton X-100 were used. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 or 50 mm octylglucoside and cut with ammonium sulfate (at approximately 7% saturation in Triton X-100 or 17.5% in octylglucoside). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 90,000 rpm for 20 min (Beckman TL-100) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with either 0.5% Triton X-100 or 25 mm octylglucoside. The dialyzed fraction was concentrated on a Centricon 10 (Amicon), and the proteins were separated by preparative electrophoresis and electroelution in the presence of Triton X-100 or octylglucoside. The gel system consisted of a 4% stacking gel (pH 6.8) and a 9% resolving gel (pH 8.8) prepared as used in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, except that both gels contained 0.5% Triton X-100 or 25 mm octylglucoside. The protein fraction was mixed at a ratio of 2:1 with a buffer containing 10% glycerol, 65 mmTris, pH 8.8, and 0.003% bromphenol blue before loading onto the gel. The electrophoretic separation was carried out at a constant current of 60 mA for 8 h. The resolving gel was cut in three parts identical in size, and the proteins were eluted from each part of the gel including the stacking gel using the Electro Eluter (Model 422, Bio-Rad) with a buffer of 192 mm glycine, 25 mmTris containing 0.2% Triton X-100 or 25 mm octylglucoside. The electroeluted proteins were concentrated using Centricon 10 tubes (Amicon) and stored at 4 °C for further use. In addition we introduced another step of purification before the electroelution. The membrane fractions solubilized in 25 mm octylglucoside were cut with ammonium sulfate (20%) and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6 fast flow column (1.5 × 7 cm). The column was washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 25 mmoctylglucoside and 20% ammonium sulfate and then eluted by a linear ammonium sulfate gradient (20 to 0%). Active fractions were concentrated (Centricon 10, Amicon) and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel to extract the proteins by electroelution as described above. Proteoliposomes were made essentially according to the method used for reconstitution of the large MS ion channel (MscL) of Escherichia coli (19Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the solubilized protein fractions were incubated with azolectin liposomes (protein to lipid ratio of 1:100 or 1:30) for 30 min at room temperature and Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were added (400 mg of Bio-Beads per ml of protein solution for 1% Triton X-100 or 50 mmoctylglucoside) to remove the detergent. The suspension was rocked for 3–4 h at room temperature and then the Bio-Beads were allowed to settle. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 25 min at 90,000 rpm (TL-100, Beckman), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 20–50 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0. Aliquots of the liposomes were spotted onto glass slides and dehydrated/rehydrated as described to yield giant liposomes used for patch-clamp experiments. For each experiment, a 2-μl aliquot of proteoliposomes was placed in a 800-μl chamber containing recording solution (in mm: 200 KCl, 40 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH). Micropipettes of borosilicate glass (100 μl microcapillaries, Sigma) were standardized by routinely testing a sample pipette by submersion in absolute ethanol and measuring the pipette bubble number (20Corey D.P. Stevens C.F. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar), which was typically in the range 3.2–3.4. Pipettes were filled with recording solution. Membrane patches were obtained from unilamellar blisters from collapsing liposomes (21Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and in some cases a brief application of suction (<20 mm Hg) was applied to form seals with resistances in the range 10–50 GΩ. Negative pressure (suction) was applied by syringe to the back of the pipette to activate MS ion channels (12Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Pressure and current were recorded simultaneously using the pCLAMP6 program and Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). Mechanosensitive ion channel currents were recorded by applying continuous pipette voltage either as voltage steps or voltage ramps in the range of ±60 mV. The channel currents were observed once a threshold of applied pressure was achieved. Since the threshold activation pressure for bacterial MS channels reconstituted in liposomes is often reduced (but approaches a steady state) upon subsequent restretching of a particular patch, 2A. C. Le Dain, unpublished observation. only patches so “trained” were used in estimations of Boltzmann characteristics. Single channel currents were estimated either from amplitude histograms or using a cursor measurement following subtraction of the baseline. Threshold activation pressures were taken as the pressure at which the first channel opening to the full-level conductance was observed in a previously untested patch. Data are expressed as means and standard errors unless otherwise noted. Reconstitution of native membrane vesicles yielded several ion channel types, predominantly exhibiting porin-like channel behavior (9Besnard M. Martinac B. Ghazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 992-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With slight modification of this method of Besnard, Martinac, and Ghazi (9Besnard M. Martinac B. Ghazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 992-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the presence of porin-like channel activity was minimized. Isolated liposome patches were examined for the presence of MS ion channels of similar type to those characteristic of E. coli; namely activated by mechanical tension in the lipid bilayer alone. Two separate MS channel conductances (MscA1 and MscA2) were observed in liposomes incorporated with native membrane vesicles (Fig.1 A). As well as observation in separate patches, on occasion both channel types were observed in the same patch. It was also possible to observe multiple channels of a given type in a particular patch. Both archaeal MS channel conductances were activated by application of negative pressure (suction) with a threshold activation pressure in previously untested patches for MscA1 of −121 ± 11 mm Hg (n = 4) and MscA2 of −160 ± 13 mm Hg (n = 7). Comparing theleft panel with the right in Fig. 1 A, the channel kinetics of the two conductances were different. MscA1 exhibited relatively brief openings, whereas MscA2 exhibited much longer openings with sustained activity while the applied pressure remained greater than the threshold activation pressure. Detergent solubilization of the native membrane proteins by either octylglucoside or Triton X-100, followed by additional purification steps such as high salt wash of the membranes, ammonium sulfate cut, and protein electroelution from polyacrylamide gel, presented MS channel activity with similar electrophysiological characteristics (Fig. 1 B). However, the threshold of activation for solubilized archaeal MS channels was reduced, where for MscA1 the threshold was −87 ± 23 mm Hg (n = 5) and for MscA2 was −77 ± 7 mm Hg (n = 5). Similar to MS channels from other preparations, as the applied pressure increased, the channel activity as measured by the open probability also increased (Fig. 2 A). The relationship between channel open probability and applied pressure could be well described by a Boltzmann distribution (Fig. 2 B). The Boltzmann characteristics for both archaeal channels are summarized in Table I. For MscA2 the Boltzmann characteristics were also determined at +40 mV (P 0.5 = 29 ± 6 mm Hg, 1/s = 2.07 ± 0.54; n = 3) and −40 mV (P 0.5 = 43 ± 9 mm Hg, 1/s = 2.82 ± 0.95 mm Hg; n = 4).Table ISummary of the Boltzmann characteristics for MS channels of solubilized archaeal membranesVoltageMscA1MscA2P 0.51/sP 0.51/smVmm Hg−2035 ± 6 (3)1.79 ± 0.51 (3)45 ± 4 (3)1.62 ± 0.35 (3)+2032 ± 4 (4)2.85 ± 0.77 (4)41 ± 3 (3)1.35 ± 0.14 (3) Open table in a new tab The two archaeal MS channels differed in conductance examined either by voltage steps or ramps (Fig. 3), with both conductances exhibiting rectification. Although MscA1 exhibited a lower conductance at positive pipette potentials (at +40 mV, 380 ± 10 pS, n = 2) and a higher conductance at negative potentials (at −40 mV, 680 ± 40 pS, n = 3), MscA2 exhibited a higher conductance at the positive potentials (at +40 mV, 850 ± 40 pS, n = 5) than at negative potentials (at −40 mV, 490 ± 30 pS, n = 5). The reversal potential from a linear extrapolation between +10 and −10 mV in symmetrical solutions (in mm: 200 KCl, 40 MgCl2, 10 HEPES) for MscA1 was 0.1 ± 0.9 mV (n = 3) and for MscA2 was 0.1 ± 0.4 mV (n = 4). Since gadolinium is an inhibitor of MS channels (15Martinac B. CRC Thermodynamics of Membrane Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida1993Google Scholar, 22Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar), we tested sensitivity of the archaeal channels to this ion. Similar to the bacterial MS channels (23Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), both archaeal MS channels were blocked by submillimolar (0.2–0.5 mm) concentrations of gadolinium (data not shown). Toward the molecular identification of these MS channels we introduced another step of purification in our isolation protocol. Octylglucoside membrane extracts cut with ammonium sulfate were applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose column. MS channel activities were found at the end of the eluate made by a linear ammonium sulfate gradient. Fig.4 shows the protein pattern of one of the most active fractions (9 of 10 patches with activity) presenting both types of channels MscA1 and MscA2. This fraction contained two major protein bands that were electroeluted from the gel and reconstituted in liposomes. MS channel activity was only recovered from the electroeluted protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. The observed channels (5 of 10 patches active) corresponded to the MscA1 type (Fig. 4, right panel). In the present study we report the discovery of two novel types of MS channels in the cell membrane of the archaeon H. volcanii. In analogy to the bacterial MS channels (18Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 24Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Kung C. Methods in Enzymology, Ion Channels. Academic Press, San Diego, California1997Google Scholar) we named the archaeal channels MscA1 and MscA2 and have found that both channels have many properties in common with bacterial MS channels but exhibit certain differences. When compared with E. coli MS channels, MscS (12Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and MscL (19Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Sigurdson W.J. Sukharev S.I. Kung C. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 267Google Scholar), which have a pressure sensitivity of ≈5 mm Hg per e-fold change in open probability, MscA1 and MscA2 exhibited an increased sensitivity of 1.4–2.9 mm Hg per e-fold change in open probability. Second, unlike MscS, which is voltage-dependent (26Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the archaeal MS channels do not show such significant voltage dependence (Table I). However, both of the archaeal MS channels possess large conductances in the range of several hundreds of picosiemens and seem to have a very low or minimal selectivity for cations over anions (data not presented), properties in common with bacterial MS channels (16Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 18Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev.

J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, both archaeal channels were blocked by gadolinium at concentrations comparable to those reported to block bacterial MS channels (19Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Significantly, MscA1 and MscA2 can be solubilized by detergents and reconstituted in artificial liposomes whereupon they remained fully functional when examined by the patch-clamp technique. This channel property is identical to that of the MscL, which allowed this ion channel to be to date the only cloned MS channel whose mechanosensitivity has been unambiguously documented (17Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 28Garcı́a-Añovernos J. Corey D.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 567-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this functional property suggests that the archaeal channels belong to a family of MS channels that are activated by the mechanical force transmitted exclusively via the lipid bilayer (16Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,17Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the archaeal MS channels possess a unique characteristic in that their conductive properties alter in a nonlinear fashion with the pipette voltage, i.e. they rectify such that with the pipette voltage changing between −60 and +60 mV, the conductance of MscA1 decreases whereas that of MscA2 increases. At present the importance of this channel property for the physiology of the H. volcanii remains unclear. In our view, the significance of discovering MS channel activity in the cell membrane of an archaeal cell is manifold. First, from an evolutionary perspective, this finding documents the ubiquity and importance of MS channels in the three domains of the phylogenetic tree. This channel ubiquity raises the question of the physiological function of these channels in prokaryotes. In bacteria, MS channels have been proposed to play a role in osmoregulation and more explicitly in the release of osmolytes (23Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). When cultivated in high osmolarity media, bacteria are capable of accumulating high concentrations of osmolytes (or osmoprotectants) such as trehalose or glycine betaine, the role of which is to counterbalance the external osmolarity. Upon a sudden shift to lower osmolarity media, these organic compounds are excreted (29Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar, 30Glaasker E. Konings W.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10060-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Ruffert S. Lambert C. Peter H. Wendisch V.F. Kramer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the role of bacterial MS channels in osmolyte efflux is not proven, it is probable given the fast kinetics of this process (30Glaasker E. Konings W.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10060-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Ruffert S. Lambert C. Peter H. Wendisch V.F. Kramer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, a role of bacterial MS channels in the efflux of molecules of this size would be consistent with their apparently anomalous conductance; for example in the case of the MscL, molecules as large as polyamines readily pass through the pore (27Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The study of osmoregulation is less advanced in archaea but it is noteworthy that accumulation of osmoprotectants has been documented in methanogens (32Robertson D.E. Roberts M.F. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) and recently in haloalkaliphilic archaea (33Desmarais D. Jablonski P.E. Fedarko N.S. Roberts M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3146-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although excretion of these species upon osmotic downshock has yet to be documented, it is highly plausible that archaeal MS channels play a similar role to that postulated for bacterial channels. Second, the mechanism of gating the archaeal channels by the mechanical force transmitted by the lipid bilayer alone, supports the idea that mechanosensitivity may have evolved several times during evolution (28Garcı́a-Añovernos J. Corey D.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 567-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Taking into account the two recognized mechanisms of mechanosensitivity (34Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the present finding suggests that gating of MS channels according to the bilayer model (35Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 36Markin V.S. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1120-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Opsahl L.R. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 71-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) may represent a more general mechanism than that described by the tethered model (38Guharay F. Sachs F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 352: 685-701Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 39Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 258-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Howard J. Roberts W.M. Hudspeth A.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 41Hudspeth A.J. Gillespie P.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Finally, in view of a comparative analysis of Eukarya, Eubacteria and Archaea, our finding demonstrates thatArchaea, or at least their halophilic branch, harbor eubacterial-like rather than eukaryote-like MS channel-type proteins in their cellular membranes. The fact that archaeal MS channels appear electrophysiologically similar to their bacterial counterparts is consistent with the idea that the prokaryotic Archaeaproteins involved in transport are closer in function to those ofEubacteria rather than Eukarya (3Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Forterre P. Cell. 1996; 85: 789-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although at present it is not known if the protein structure will prove to be as related, it is unlikely since one of the identified proteins has a molecular weight at least twice that of the MscL monomer. Elucidation of the physiological role of MS channels in Archaea as well as their molecular relatedness to bacterial MS channels will be the focus of further study."

Both lectins have recently been shown to possess enhanced affinities and extended binding sites for the trisaccharide, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-mannose, which is present in the core region of all asparagine-linked carbohydrates (Gupta, D., Oscarson, S., Raju, S., Stanley, P. Toone, E. J. and Brewer, C. F. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem.242, 320–326). In the present study, the binding specificities of seven other lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe have been investigated by hemagglutination inhibition and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC). The lectins are from Canavalia brasiliensis, Canavalia bonariensis, Cratylia floribunda, Dioclea rostrata, Dioclea virgata, Dioclea violacea, and Dioclea guianensis. Hemagglutination inhibition and ITC experiments show that all seven lectins are Man/Glc-specific and have high affinities for the core trimannoside, like ConA and D. grandifloralectin. All seven lectins also exhibit the same pattern of binding to a series of monodeoxy analogs and a tetradeoxy analog of the trimannoside, similar to that of ConA and D. grandifloralectin. However, C. bonariensis, C. floribunda,D. rostrata, and D. violacea, like D. grandiflora, show substantially reduced affinities for a biantennary complex carbohydrate with terminal GlcNAc residues, whileC. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgata, like ConA, exhibit affinities for the oligosaccharide comparable with that of the trimannoside. Thermodynamic data obtained by ITC indicate different energetic mechanisms of binding of the above two groups of lectins to the complex carbohydrate. The ability of the lectins to induce histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells is shown to correlate with the relative affinities of the proteins for the biantennary carbohydrate.

Thermodynamic data obtained by ITC indicate different energetic mechanisms of binding of the above two groups of lectins to the complex carbohydrate. The ability of the lectins to induce histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells is shown to correlate with the relative affinities of the proteins for the biantennary carbohydrate. Phytohemagglutinins from the Leguminosae family comprise one of the largest group of homologous proteins with carbohydrate binding properties (see Ref. 1Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar). Despite similarities in their physicochemical properties and their relatively conserved primary sequences, Leguminosae lectins display considerable diversity in their carbohydrate binding properties (2Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This diversity is present not only in terms of recognizing different monosaccharides but also in lectins with the same nominal monosaccharide specificity. For example, Man-specific Leguminosae lectins have been isolated from the Diocleinae subtribe, which include the jack bean lectin concanavalin A (ConA) 1The abbreviations used are: ConA, concanavalin A, lectin from jack bean; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; MeαMan, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside; MeαGlc, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: ConA, concanavalin A, lectin from jack bean; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; MeαMan, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside; MeαGlc, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside. and seed lectin fromDioclea grandiflora, and from the Vicieae tribe, which includes the sweet pea, garden pea, lentil, and fava bean lectins. However, ConA and D. grandiflora lectin have recently been shown to possess substantially enhanced affinities for the “core” trimannoside, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-mannose, which is present in all asparagine-linked (N-linked) carbohydrates (3Chervenak M.C.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, recent hemagglutination inhibition studies have reported that ConA and D. grandiflora lectin have nearly the same pattern of binding to deoxy analogs2–11 of the trimannoside (Fig. 1) (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that two nominal Man/Glc-specific lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe (Scheme I), possess extended binding sites and high affinities for the trimannoside, unlike members of the Vicieae tribe (1Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar). In addition, the hemagglutination inhibition study showed that, while ConA possesses high affinity for a biantennary complex carbohydrate (14, Fig.1), D. grandifloralectin shows much lower affinity for the oligosaccharide (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Although the complete primary sequences of all of the Diocleinae lectins are not known, the high degree of sequence homologies of ConA, D. grandiflora, and C. brasiliensis suggests that other members of the Diocleinae subtribe possess relatively conserved sequences. Despite their phylogenetic proximity and apparently conserved sequences, the above Diocleinae lectins possess different biological activities such as histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (19Gomes J.C.

The present study reports hemagglutination inhibition and ITC studies of the binding of the above seven new Diocleinae lectins to a variety of mono- and oligosaccharides, trimannoside 1, deoxy analogs2–12, Man5 oligomannose carbohydrate 13, and biantennary complex carbohydrate 14 (Fig. 1). Together with results for ConA and D. grandiflora lectin, the present findings indicate that nine members of the Diocleinae subtribe of Leguminosae lectins possess conserved binding specificities toward1 but differential specificities for 14. Furthermore, the relative affinities of the lectins for 14correlate with their abilities to stimulate histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells.

The purity of the oligosaccharides was checked by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Seeds of all of the species were obtained from the States of Ceara and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Lectins were purified by affinity chromatography using Sephadex G-50, as described previously (see Ref. 26Agrawal B.B.L. Goldstein I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the lectins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and expressed in terms of monomer. The A1 cm1% at pH 7.2 and the subunit molecular mass of the lectins used are as follows: 10.47 and 26 kDa (C. brasiliensis) (9Moreira R.A. Cavada B.S. Biol. Plant.

A1 cm1% of C. floribunda, D. rostrata, and D. violaceawere reported above, whereas that of the remaining lectins were determined in the present study. The assay was performed at room temperature using a 2-fold serial dilution technique (27Osawa T. Matsumoto I. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28B: 323-327Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and 3% (v/v) rabbit erythrocytes in HEPES buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.2). The minimum concentration of saccharide required for complete inhibition of four hemagglutination doses was determined by visual inspection. ITC experiments were performed using an OMEGA Microcalorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate were added from the computer-controlled 250-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the lectin solution (cell volume = 1.3424 ml) dissolved in the same buffer as the saccharide, while stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 3 for binding of1 to D. violacea at 27 °C. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell containing buffer with no protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH(enthalpy change in kcal mol−1), K a(association constant in m−1), andn (number of binding sites/monomer), as adjustable parameters. The quantity c = K a M t(0), where M t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with cvalues 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cytidine 2′-monophosphate supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation,ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RT lnKaEquation 1 where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding.T is the absolute temperature, and r = 1.98 cal mol−1 K−1. The monosaccharide binding properties of ConA (29Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar) and D. grandiflora lectin (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J.

Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) are well defined, with both lectins showing preferential binding to the α-pyranosides of Man and Glc. The seven other Diocleinae lectins in Table I generally show similar preferential binding to the α-pyranosides of Man and Glc, and not to Gal, Fuc, lactose, melibiose, or sialic acid. The C-2 hydroxyl group of Man is not essential for binding to the Diocleinae lectins, since methyl 2-deoxy-α-d-mannopyranoside is as potent as MeαMan. Methyl 2-deoxy-α-d-mannopyranoside was previously reported not to inhibit D. grandiflora lectin (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, a reinvestigation shows that it does inhibit the lectin (Table I). 2-d-Glc inhibits C. floribunda,D. rostrata, and D. guianensis more poorly than Glc. GlcNAc at a relatively high concentration (150 mm) shows some inhibition of C. brasiliensis, C. bonariensis, and D. virgata but did not inhibit the other four lectins. 3-deoxymannose, 4-deoxymannose, and 6-deoxymannose show no inhibitory activity, suggesting that Diocleinae lectins recognize the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of Man, as observed for ConA (29Goldstein I.J.

Open table in a new tab Inhibitory potencies of most of the disaccharides for the seven Diocleinae lectins were comparable with that of ConA and D. grandiflora lectin (Table I). None of the lectins were inhibited by lactose and melibiose, as expected. It has previously been shown that the affinity of ConA for Manα(1–2)Man, a disaccharide moiety found in N-linked oligomannose carbohydrates, is 5-fold greater than MeαMan, as compared with weaker binding of D. grandiflora lectin to the disaccharide relative to the monosaccharide (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The seven new Diocleinae lectins display a range of relative affinities for Manα(1–2)Man. D. virgata shows 16-fold greater affinity for the disaccharide relative to MeαMan, whereas D. guianensis and D. violacea show enhanced affinities for the disaccharide comparable with that of ConA. The remaining four lectins show lower relative affinities for the disaccharide. Large differences in the binding specificity of ConA and D. grandiflora lectin toward GlcNAc(β1–2)Man, a disaccharide moiety found in a variety of N-linked carbohydrates, have been reported (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). While ConA binds to the disaccharide, no binding was detected for D. grandiflora lectin. This is consistent with the difference in relative affinities of ConA and D. grandiflora lectin for biantennary complex carbohydrate14 (Fig. 1) (Table II), with ConA showing high affinity for the pentasaccharide but D. grandiflora lectin showing low affinity (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The other Diocleinae lectins exhibit distinct patterns of binding to GlcNAc(β1–2)Man. While C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, andD. virgata bind the disaccharide, the remaining lectins show little or no affinity for it, similar to D. grandifloralectin. This observation is significant in light of the results for binding of the lectins to biantennary carbohydrate 14, discussed below.Table IIInhibitory potencies of trimannoside 1 and its deoxy analogues for Diocleinae lectin-mediated hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytesSaccharideMinimum concentration required for inhibition2-aDefined under “Materials and Methods.”Cbr2-bC. brasiliensis.Cbon2-cC. bonariensis.Cflo2-dC. floribunda.Dros2-eD. rostrata.Dgui2-fD. guianensis.Dviol2-gD. violacea.Dvir2-hD. virgata.ConA2-iData from Ref. 4.Dgr2-iData from Ref. 4.,2-jD. grandiflora.μm 1Trimannoside27 (1)9 (1)20 (1)27 (1)40 (1)13 (1)27 (1)28 (1)7 (1) 2α(1–3)2-deoxy24 (1.1)8 (1.1)16 (1.2)20 (1.3)35 (1.1)8 (1.6)19 (1.4)25 (1.1)6 (1.1) 3 α(1–3)3-deoxy156 (0.17)120 (0.07)250 (0.08)250 (0.1)312 (0.12)108 (0.12)108 (0.25)290 (0.09)140 (0.05) 4 α(1–3)4-deoxy45 (0.6)29 (0.31)45 (0.4)53 (0.5)75 (0.5)38 (0.34)41 (0.65)26 (1.0)9 (0.7) 5α(1–3)6-deoxy20 (1.3)7 (1.2)19 (1.05)25 (1.08)38 (1.05)16 (0.8)29 (0.9)32 (0.78)6 (1.1) 6 α(1–6)2-deoxy30 (0.9)12 (0.75)30 (0.6)30 (0.9)30 (1.3)10 (1.3)30 (0.9)36 (0.7)36 (0.2) 7α(1–6)3-deoxy900 (0.03)1025 (0.008)1500 (0.01)3000 (0.009)NI2-kNot inhibitory at 4.1 mm.900 (0.01)3000 (0.009)200 (0.14)400 (0.01) 8 α(1–6)4-deoxy580 (0.04)580 (0.01)900 (0.02)1250 (0.02)NI2-lNot inhibitory at 2.5 mm.620 (0.02)1250 (0.02)230 (0.12)830 (0.008) 9α(1–6)6-deoxy580 (0.04)620 (0.01)900 (0.02)1250 (0.02)NI2-mNot inhibitory at 2.5 mm.620 (0.02)900 (0.03)240 (0.1)580 (0.01)10“Core” 2-deoxy45 (0.6)45 (0.2)62 (0.3)125 (0.21)180 (0.2)45 (0.28)90 (0.3)59 (0.4)59 (0.11)11 “Core” 4-deoxy125 (0.21)62 (0.14)125 (0.16)125 (0.21)250 (0.16)62 (0.2)90 (0.3)120 (0.2)61 (0.11)12 Tetradeoxy1500 (0.018)2000 (0.004)3200 (0.006)4300 (0.006)4600 (0.009)2400 (0.005)5800 (0.005)2200 (0.012)1500 (0.004)13 Man-52-nMan-5 oligomannose carbohydrate.17 (1.5)6 (1.5)11 (1.8)17 (1.5)34 (1.1)9 (1.4)22 (1.2)27 (0.9)6 (2)14GN2Man32-oBiantennary complex pentasaccharide.13 (2.07)790 (0.01)790 (0.02)790 (0.03)20 (2)790 (0.01)25 (1.08)6 (4.2)400 (0.03)2-a Defined under “Materials and Methods.”2-b C. brasiliensis.2-c C. bonariensis.2-d C. floribunda.2-e D. rostrata.2-f D. guianensis.2-g D. violacea.2-h D. virgata.2-i Data from Ref. 4Gupta D.

Open table in a new tab ConA is known to possess high affinity for the trisaccharide, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-mannose, which is present in the core region of all asparagine-linked carbohydrates (31Brewer C.F. Bhattacharyya L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7306-7310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ITC data established that ConA binds to the trimannoside and its methyl α-anomer (1) with a nearly −6 kcal mol−1 greater −ΔH and a 60-fold greaterK a than MeαMan (5Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These results suggested extended site binding of ConA to the trimannoside, which was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of the trimannoside-ConA complex (Fig.3) (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). ITC studies of ConA binding to deoxy analogs 2–11established the binding energetics of the various hydroxyl groups of trimannoside 1 to ConA (7Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The results also demonstrated that the solution complex of the trimannoside involves binding of the same hydroxyl groups of 1 observed in the x-ray crystal complex. Thus, ConA binds to 1 via the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyls on the α(1–6)-Man residue, the 2- and 4-hydroxyls of the central Man residue, and the 3- and 4-hydroxyls of the α(1–3)-Man residue (Fig. 2). Chervenak and Toone (3Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported similar enhanced −ΔH andK a values for D. grandiflora lectin binding to 1 relative to MeαMan, which were confirmed in the present study (Table III). In addition, hemagglutination inhibition experiments with deoxy analogs2–11 established that the pattern of binding of the hydroxyl groups of 1 to D. grandiflora lectin is similar to that for ConA (Table II for comparison) (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These findings suggest similar extended sites for both lectins to the trimannoside. Hemagglutination inhibition data in the present study (Table II) show that the seven new Diocleinae lectins exhibit similar enhanced affinities for 1 relative to MeαMan, as observed for ConA and D. grandiflora lectin. ITC data shown in Table IIIindicate that all seven new Diocleinae lectins show enhancedK a and −ΔH values for 1relative to MeαMan. The enhanced K a values of the lectins for 1 relative to MeαMan are shown in Fig.4. The −ΔH values for all seven lectins binding to 1 are −5 to −7 kcal mol−1 greater than that for MeαMan, similar to the differences observed for ConA and D. grandiflora lectin (Table III). These data strongly suggest similar extended binding sites for all nine Diocleinae lectins. In order to determine which hydroxyl groups of 1 are involved in binding to the Diocleinae lectins, hemagglutination inhibition experiments were performed using monodeoxy analogs2–11 and tetradeoxy analog 12 (Table II). As an example, hemagglutination inhibition data for the C. floribunda lectin are shown in Fig.5. The results indicate the involvements of the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyls of the α(1–6)-Man, the 3- and 4-hydroxyls of the α(1–3)-Man, and the 2- and 4-hydroxyls of the central Man of trimannoside 1 in binding. There is also an indication of possible participation of the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–6)-arm, as observed for a few of the lectins in Table II. As expected, tetradeoxy analog 12 shows very little inhibition potency relative to 1 and is comparable with that of MeαMan. The data in Table II show a similar pattern of inhibition by the analogs for the seven new Diocleinae lectins as observed for ConA and D. grandiflora lectin (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results indicate highly conserved binding sites for 1 in all nine Diocleinae lectins. Hemagglutination inhibition data in Table II show that the Diocleinae lectins bind Man5 oligosaccharide 13 with almost the same inhibitory potency as 1. This indicates that the trimannoside moiety on the α(1–6)-arm is the primary epitope for interaction, as observed for ConA and D. grandiflora lectin (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The affinities of D. grandiflora lectin for biantennary complex oligosaccharide 14 and the longer chain analog with terminal Gal residues have been reported to be weak compared with that of ConA (4). These results are related to the lack of D. grandiflora lectin binding to the disaccharide GlcNAcβ1–2Man, which is present in 14 (TableI) (4Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of the Diocleinae lectins tested showed distinct correlated binding affinities toward this disaccharide and 14. Hemagglutination inhibition data in Table II indicates that14 has much higher inhibition potencies with C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgataas compared with the other new lectins. Longer chain analogs of14 also show a similar pattern (data not shown). This parallels the binding activities of the lectins toward GlcNAcβ1–2Man (Table I). In addition, ITC data in Table III show an order of magnitude greater K a values of C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgatafor 14 relative to the other four lectins. Among the nine Diocleinae lectins, ConA shows the highest K a value for 14, with D. grandiflora lectin showing a relatively low K a. The relativeK a values for all nine lectins binding to14 (along with 1) with respect to MeαMan are shown in Fig. 4. Table III also shows that C. brasiliensis,D. guianensis, and D. virgata possess greater −ΔH values for 14 of the seven new lectins, and that ConA possesses the greatest −ΔH value of the nine lectins. Importantly, an enthalpy-entropy compensation plot (−ΔH versus −TΔS) of the data in Table III for14 shows different slopes for the above two groups of the Diocleinae lectins (Fig. 6 B). The lectins from C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis,D. virgata, and ConA fall on a line with a slope of 1.44 (correlation coefficient 0.85), while the lectins from C. bonariensis, C. floribunda, D. rostrata,D. violacea, and D. grandiflora fall on a line with a slope of 0.85 (correlation coefficient 0.98). Although theD. grandiflora data point appears to intersect both plots, it is associated with the latter group of lectins because of its relatively low affinity and −ΔH values for 14. By comparison, a similar plot of the lectins binding to 1shows a single line with a slope of 1.21 (correlation coefficient 0.97) (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate different energetic mechanisms of binding of the four relatively high affinity lectins to14, as compared with the five lower affinity lectins. Thus, although all nine Diocleinae lectins show conserved high affinities binding for 1, four of the lectins show relatively high affinities for 14, with the other five lectins showing relatively low affinities. Therefore, binding discrimination among this group of lectins occurs toward biantennary complex carbohydrates. The structural basis for this discrimination is currently under investigation. ConA has long been known for its ability to induce histamine release from cells (see Refs. 32Sugiyama K. Sasaki J. Yamasaki H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1975; 25: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and 33Sullivan T.J. Greene W.C. Parker C.W. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 278-282PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gomes and co-workers (19Gomes J.C. Rossi R.R. Cavada B.S. Moreira R.A. Oliveira J.T.A. Agents Actions. 1994; 41: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) investigated the histamine release properties from rat peritoneal mast cells of several other lectins from the same subtribe. At the level of 10 μg/ml lectin concentration, ConA, C. brasiliensis,D. guianensis, and D. virgata induced a higher level of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, whereasD. grandiflora, C. bonariensis, C. floribunda, D. rostrata, and D. violaceadisplayed lower abilities for induction. A significant correlation between the histamine releasing properties of these lectins and their affinity constants for 14 is apparent from the present study. Fig. 7 shows that theK a values of the Diocleinae lectins for14 and the amount of histamine released by the lectins at 10 μg/ml are correlated. The strong histamine-inducing lectins ConA,C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgata exhibit relatively high affinities (K a) for 14. On the other hand, the remaining relatively inactive lectins possess lower affinities for the complex carbohydrate. It appears, therefore, that induction of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells by ConA, C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgatainvolves binding of the lectins to a biantennary complex carbohydrate and/or structurally homologous epitope present on the cell surface. The present study demonstrates that nine lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe are Man/Glc-binding proteins with conserved binding specificities for the core trimannoside ofN-linked carbohydrates. Using deoxy analogs of the trimannoside, all nine lectins were shown to possess conserved binding sites that recognize the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups on the α(1–6)-Man, the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups on the α(1–3)-Man, and the 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the central Man of the trimannoside. While the binding specificities of the lectins are conserved for the trimannoside, their specificities are different for biantennary complex carbohydrate 14 and longer chain analogs. Thermodynamic data from ITC experiments indicate different energetic mechanisms of binding of the Diocleinae lectins to 14. The relative affinities of the lectins for 14 correlate with their induced histamine release activities from rat peritoneal mast cells, suggesting that the lectin receptors on the cells involve a carbohydrate(s) structure similar to 14."

In mammalian metabolism the reaction catalyzed by TRH precedes α-decarboxylation and is believed to be the initial and rate-limiting process in the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Although TRH has been studied since the early 70s, enzymological characterization has been impeded by the limited quantity of active enzyme available from native or heterologous sources, the exceedingly low specific activity of the isolated enzyme, and the quite rapid decrease in activity observed during purification or storage (1Nakata H.

A. 1994; 91: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TRH is a member of the small family of pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases that includes tyrosine hydroxylase (TYH) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Each of these enzymes catalyzes the addition of an oxygen atom to the ring of an aromatic amino acid substrate. The bulk of what is currently known of the reaction mechanism of these enzymes has come from studies of the latter two (10Hufton S.E. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Both PAH and TYH require ferrous iron for activity (11Wallick D.E. Bloom L.M. Gaffney B.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); however, the exact role for the iron in catalysis is undefined. The primary structures of these enzymes are known from a variety of organisms. Sequence comparisons and deletion mutageneses have identified three functional regions: an amino-terminal regulatory domain, a catalytic domain, and a carboxyl-terminal interface (13Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Daubner S.C. Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F.

Hillas P.J. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11574-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The regulatory domains of the three hydroxylases show no similarities, whereas the catalytic domains are homologous, with sequence identities of 32–75%. Enzymes lacking the regulatory domain are catalytically active (13Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Daubner S.C. Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F.

The carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids of TYH form a long helix demonstrated to be responsible for the tetrameric structure of the enzyme (13Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); this helix is presumed to have a corresponding function in TRH and PAH. We report here the purification and preliminary characterization of a mutant protein containing only the catalytic core of TRH. The rationale for the truncations was to increase the heterologous expression and/or stability of the enzyme by removing both the regulatory and interface domains. This doubly truncated form of the enzyme serves as the first viable model enzyme for detailed mechanistic studies of the catalytic reaction mechanism of TRH. The high specific activity of this enzyme has allowed the analysis of several fundamental properties of this important enzyme, including catalytic specificity and metal dependence. Tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and β-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Sigma. 6-Methyltetrahydropterin was synthesized according to Fitzpatrick (19Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16058-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin was purchased from Calbiochem. MES and dithiothreitol were purchased from Research Organics, Inc. Catalase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Ceramic hydroxyapatite was from Bio-Rad, and Q-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside was from United States Biochemical Corp. Cuprous chloride, cupric sulfate, ferric sulfate, and ferrous ammonium sulfate were from Sigma. Cobalt chloride was purchased from Mallinkrodt. Agarose (SeaKem) was from FMC. [3,5-3H]Tyrosine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ultma polymerase and deoxynucleotides for polymerase chain reaction were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Plasmid pET3d andEscherichia coli BL21 (DE) were obtained from Novagen. E. coli CJ236 was from Invitrogen. Plasmid pTZ-18R was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 380B synthesizer. Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen midi-prep plasmid preparation kit. The construct for expression of wild type TRH was made by polymerase chain reaction subcloning from the rabbit cDNA-derived plasmid prbTRH479 (20Grenett H.E. Ledley F.D. Reed L.L. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5530-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). NcoI andBamHI restriction sites were incorporated at the 3′ and 5′ ends of the gene, respectively, via non-complementary oligonucleotide tails. The 1.33-kilobase pair product was then digested and subcloned into pET3d and pTZ18R to form the wild type TRH constructs pEWOH2 and pWH1 for expression and mutagenesis, respectively. In pEWOH2 the start codon for the TRH gene is 6 bases from its ribosome binding site and 55 bases from the T7 promoter. Deletion of the amino-terminal 101 amino acids of TRH was achieved using the Bio-Rad adaptation of the methods of Kunkel et al.(21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) with single-stranded uracil-containing DNA derived from pWH1. The oligonucleotide 5′ ATGAAGGAAGAAGCCATGGAGAGTGTTCCTTGGTTTCCA 3′ was used to incorporate an NcoI restriction site (in bold) into the TRH gene adjacent to position 101. The resulting plasmid was digested withNcoI and BamHI and ligated into pET3d to obtain pEWOHΔ101. The start codon/ribosome binding site/promoter relationship of pEWOHΔ101 was unchanged from that in pEWOH2. Exclusion of the carboxyl-terminal interface helix from translation was achieved using a variation of the Stratagene quick change mutagenesis method. pEWOHΔ101 was used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction reaction in which two complementary oligonucleotides (5′ GCCAAAAGCTAAACGAATGCCTAAAACGAGCTGC 3′ and 5′ GCAGCTCGTTTTAGGCATTCGTTTAGCTTTTGGC 3′) were used to mutate codons Ile417 and Met421 to stop codons (in bold). The resulting transformed BL21 (DE) cells were screened for expression of the doubly truncated protein using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire gene of a plasmid from a cell line that expressed active TRH102–416; this was designated pEWOHΔ101ΔH. Aliquots from frozen cell stocks were plated (240 μl/liter of culture) on LB agar (100 μg/ml carbenicillin). After 9 h at 37 °C, the cells from two plates were resuspended in 10 ml of LB broth and used to inoculate 1 liter of LB broth (100 μg/ml ampicillin). The culture was grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C for 2 h or until the cell density had reached an A 600 of 0.5. The culture flask was then transferred to a second shaker at 20 °C and permitted to grow for a further 30 min or until their cell density had reached anA 600 of 1.0. At this point isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 7.5 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min and used immediately for protein purification. Unless otherwise stated all subsequent purification procedures were undertaken at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended using 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0, per liter of culture and lysed with 6 bursts of sonication for 40 s using a Branson sonicator fitted with a blunt tungsten tip. The temperature of the solution was monitored to ensure that it did not exceed 10 °C. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 11,200 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.01%, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 10 min and then centrifuged at 11,200 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded directly onto a Q-Sepharose column (22 cm3 liter−1 of culture) in the above buffer. The initial fractions eluting from the Q-Sepharose column that contained protein were combined. These were brought to 35% (NH4)2SO4 saturation over a period of 20 min and centrifuged at 7,800 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was then brought to 45% (NH4)2SO4 saturation over a period of 20 min and centrifuged at 7,800 × g for 20 min. The 45% supernatant was brought to 55% (NH4)2SO4 saturation over a period of 20 min and again centrifuged. The pellet obtained from this step was redissolved in 50 mm MES, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, using 25 ml per liter of initial culture. The redissolved enzyme was applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (11 cm3 per liter of initial culture) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with approximately 2 column volumes of 50 mm MES, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (18 column volumes) from this buffer to 300 mm sodium phosphate, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5. TRH102–416 typically eluted between 150 and 200 mm phosphate. Fractions containing TRH102–416were pooled. Contaminating nucleic acids were removed by the further addition of polyethyleneimine to 0.01% and stirring for 20 min. After centrifugation at 11,200 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was concentrated by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 65% saturation over a period of 20 min. This sample was then centrifuged at 7,800 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The white protein pellet was redissolved in a minimum of 50 mm MES, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, and stored as small aliquots (typically 200 μl of 200 μm enzyme) at −70 °C. When the enzyme was to be used for kinetic studies, the storage buffer also contained 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate. A typical yield from 1 liter of cells was 10 mg with a specific activity of 0.6 μmol of hydroxytryptophan produced per min/mg. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses were carried out at 10 °C in a Beckman model XL-A ultracentrifuge. Concentrated TRH102–416 was diluted to 5, 10, or 15 μm in 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 100 mm MES, pH 7.2. The system was assessed as having attained equilibrium when scans at 280 nm taken at 2-h intervals were identical. The data used for analysis were averages of 20 successive scans. The absorbance values as a function of radial position were fit using Kaleidagraph software to either Equation 1, which describes the equilibrium sedimentation of a monomer, or Equation 2, which describes the sedimentation of a self-associating species. The terms used in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 are as follows: N, the stoichiometry of association; M, the molecular mass of an enzyme monomer;A o, the absorbance at the reference radiusr o; K a, the association constant; C, the base-line offset; v̄, the partial specific volume (calculated to be 0.723 from the amino acid content of TRH102–416); ρ, the buffer density; and ω, the angular velocity in radians/s. The concentration of protein was determined using an ε280 value of 35.2 mm−1 cm−1 calculated by the method of Pace et al. (22Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar).Ar=exp(lnA0+HM(r2−r02))+CEquation 1 Ar=exp(lnA0+HM(r2−r02))+exp(lnA0N+ln(Ka)HNM(r2−r02))+CEquation 2 H=(1−v¯ρ)ω22RTEquation 3 An HPLC-based assay for enzyme activity was used for samples during purification. The 500-μl reaction mixture contained enzyme, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 200 μm tryptophan, 200 μm 6-MePH4, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm MES, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of tetrahydropterin after equilibrating all other substituents at 37 °C for 1 min. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at times between 0 and 30 s and quenched into 10 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. These samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and loaded onto a Rainin microsorb MV reverse phase C18 HPLC column (50 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) using a 10-μl injection loop. The mobile phase was 40 mm sodium acetate, 5% acetonitrile, pH 3.5, at flow rate of 1 ml/min. 5-Hydroxytryptophan and tryptophan were detected using a Waters 470 fluorescence detector with an excitation λ of 290 nm and an emission λ of 340 nm. Under these conditions 5-hydroxytryptophan and tryptophan had retention times of 1.7 and 3.9 min, respectively. When phenylalanine was used as a substrate, tyrosine was detected with an excitation λ of 275 nm and an emission λ of 310 nm, using 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, as the mobile phase. Similarly, the product of tyrosine hydroxylation, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, could be detected with an excitation λ of 280 nm and an emission λ of 310 nm in the same mobile phase. Steady state kinetic measurements with tryptophan as substrate were made using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus operating in the fluorescence mode. TRH102–416 (typically 2–10 μm) in air-saturated 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 100 mm MES, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 25 μg/ml catalase, pH 7.0, was rapidly mixed with aerobic solutions containing varied concentrations of tetrahydropterin and tryptophan in 10 mmHCl and 12 mm dithiothreitol at 15 °C. The excitation wavelength was 300 nm; all emitted light which passed a 320-nm wavelength cut-off filter perpendicular to the light source was collected. Under such conditions, the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan could be monitored independently of the substrate or the formation of the fluorescent 7,8-dihydropterin. The amount of 5-hydroxytryptophan generated was quantified by comparing the fluorescence yield to that of 5-hydroxytryptophan standards measured on the same instrument in the presence of comparable quantities of other substrates. The concentration dependence data were fit to Equations 4 and 5. Equation 5was used when substrate inhibition was observed; K aiis the inhibition constant for the substrate.v=VAKm+AEquation 4 v=VAKm+A+A2KaiEquation 5 The metal requirement of TRH102–416 was determined using sequential stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The apoenzyme (10 μm, 2.5 μm final concentration) in 100 mm MES, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, pH 7.0, was first mixed with 6-MePH4 (400 μm, 100 μmfinal concentration) and tryptophan (200 μm, 50 μm final concentration). After 1 s this was mixed with another solution containing 100 μm metal ion (50 μm final concentration). The second mixing step initiated data collection. A modified version of the assay of Shiman et al. (23Shiman R. Jones S.H. Gray D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11633-11642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to measure tyrosine formation from phenylalanine. Enzyme (typically 2–10 μm) in air-saturated 100 mmMES, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 25 μg/ml catalase, pH 7.0, was mixed with aerobic solutions containing varied concentrations of tetrahydropterin and phenylalanine in 10 mm HCl and 12 mm dithiothreitol at 15 °C. A variation of the method of Fitzpatrick (12Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used to assay tyrosine hydroxylation. The conditions were 100 mm MES, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 25 μg/ml catalase, pH 7.0, with varied concentrations of 3,5-[3H]tyrosine and tetrahydropterin. The reaction was carried out for 1 min at 15 °C. Enzyme (10 μm final) was mixed with tryptophan (200 μm), phenylalanine (200 μm), or tyrosine (650 μm) in 100 mm MES, pH 7.2, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, at 15 °C, in a 4-mm path length quartz cuvette. After recording a base line with this solution, the reaction was initiated by the addition of either 6-MePH4 or BH4 to 100 μm, and spectra were recorded every 5 s for 400 s. The amount of hydroxylated amino acid produced was then determined by HPLC. The spectra generated during the reaction were analyzed globally using the program Specfit (Spectrum Software Associates) to determine the spectra of the pterin products. The iron content of the enzyme was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, using a slight variation of the method of Ramsey et al. (24Ramsey A.J. Hillas P.J. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24395-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were dialyzed into 100 mm MES, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, pH 7.0, and then diluted 5-fold in 2.5 m nitric acid. After 30 min on ice the samples were diluted 10-fold with water and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed for iron using a Perkin-Elmer model 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a graphite furnace. The T7 polymerase-based pET expression system of Studier (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was used to express wild type TRH and two truncated mutant proteins. The wild type TRH was expressed as less than 1% of the total cell protein. This level of expression was unaffected by temperature over the range 20–37 °C (data not shown). At 20 °C, the TRH activity reached a maximum level of approximately 4 nmol/min/ml culture 7 h after induction (Fig.1 A). All of the wild type TRH was soluble. In contrast, the protein lacking the amino-terminal regulatory domain, TRH102–444, was expressed at much higher levels. Based upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell lysates after induction, TRH102–444 was expressed as 30–35% of the total cell protein under all conditions tested. However, when cells were grown at 37 °C, 95% of the TRH102–416 was found in inclusion bodies. The fraction of soluble TRH102–444 could be increased by decreasing the growth temperature to 17 °C, but the greatest activity found under any condition with this protein was only 40% that observed with the wild type protein (see Fig. 1 A). Moreover, during attempts to purify TRH102–444, the enzyme showed a pronounced tendency to lose activity and precipitate. Although the absolute levels of expression seen with TRH102–444 were sufficient, the insolubility of the protein and the low activity suggested that it was not folding properly. TRH is believed to be held together as tetramer by hydrophobic helices at the carboxyl termini of each monomer (6D'Sa C.M. Arthur R.E. States J.C. Kuhn D.M. J.

Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Given the tetrameric nature of TRH, it was considered possible that the presence of even a single unfolded subunit within the tetramer would be sufficient to render the entire tetramer unstable. Since the interface helix is not required for activity in these hydroxylases (13Lohse D.L. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Dickson P.W. Jennings I.G. Cotton R.G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20369-20375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mockus S.M. Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a mutant protein lacking both the regulatory domain and the carboxyl-terminal helix was examined. This form of TRH, TRH102–416, was expressed at a level similar to that observed with TRH102–444. However, based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and enzyme activity, 80% of the protein was soluble, so that the active, soluble TRH102–416 was 25–30% of the total cell protein. The amount of enzyme activity produced as TRH102–416 was approximately 10 times that observed with the wild type enzyme and 25 times that obtained with TRH102–444 (Fig.1 A). Consequently, TRH102–416 was selected for further characterization. TRH102–416 could be purified in three steps, a Q-Sepharose column, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and a hydroxyapatite column (Fig. 1 B). TRH102–416showed marked instability at low ionic strength. Maintaining the enzyme in a minimum of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4 during purification greatly enhanced recovery from each chromatographic step. The enzyme stability was further enhanced by ferrous iron and dithiothreitol. The enzyme could be stored at −70 °C indefinitely without loss of activity. Because of the improved stability which resulted, the enzyme was typically stored in the presence of 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate. If ferrous ammonium sulfate was omitted from purification buffers, the resulting enzyme contained no detectable iron (<0.05 atom/monomer). Since TRH102–416 no longer contains the helix that is proposed to be necessary for oligomerization, the mutant protein should be a monomer. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation was used to analyze its quaternary structure. Data were collected using initial protein concentrations of 5–15 μm and rotor speeds of 16,000, 19,000, and 22,000 rpm. When the data were analyzed assuming that a single monomeric species was present, the average molecular weight over all conditions was 42,400 ± 4381, compared with a molecular weight of 36,319 calculated from the DNA sequence. These results suggested that species larger than a monomer were present. To examine this possibility, the data were fit to models describing monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, monomer-tetramer, monomer-hexamer, and monomer-octamer equilibria. In each case the molecular weight was fixed at 36,319. The data were best fit using a monomer-tetramer model (TableI). No improvements in the quality of the fits were seen if species larger than a tetramer were considered. The average K a value obtained by fitting each data set to a model describing a monomer-tetramer equilibrium was 1.33 × 1013m−3. Fig.2 shows representative fits to this model of data obtained at three enzyme concentrations using the averageK a value and a monomer molecular weight of 36,319. Based on this association constant, TRH102–416 is 50% monomer at a protein concentration of 42 μm.Table IUltracentrifugation analyses of the quaternary structure of TRH102–416Speed[TRH102–416]1-aInitial concentration of protein.χ2MonomerMonomer-dimerMonomer-tetramerMonomer-hexamerMonomer-octomerrpmμm16,00050.00771-bχ2 values for fits of the data to Equation 1, which assumes a single species.0.00661-cχ2 values for fits of the data to Equation 2, which describes an equilibrium between the indicated oligomeric states.0.00490.00430.004216,000100.0850.0780.0650.0620.06316,000150.0770.0690.0600.0600.06419,00050.0120.0110.00970.00850.007919,000100.140.120.0950.0940.09919,000150.100.0850.0680.0730.08122,00050.0130.0140.0130.0120.01122,000100.100.0880.0790.0810.08822,000150.0680.06040.0590.0640.0691-a Initial concentration of protein.1-b χ2 values for fits of the data to Equation 1, which assumes a single species.1-c χ2 values for fits of the data to Equation 2, which describes an equilibrium between the indicated oligomeric states. Open table in a new tab With tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylalanine hydroxylase, the initial pterin product of catalysis is a 4a-hydroxypterin (28Lazarus R.A. DeBrosse C.W. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem.

Although it is assumed that this is also a product with tryptophan hydroxylase, as shown in Scheme FS1, formation of a hydroxypterin by tryptophan hydroxylase has not been demonstrated directly. Although hydroxypterins are not stable in solution for extended periods, they can be observed spectrally if the enzyme concentration is high enough to rapidly generate micromolar levels prior to hydrolysis. Consequently, high concentrations of TRH102–416 (10 μm) were used to consume 100 μmtetrahydrobiopterin in the presence of excess tryptophan or phenylalanine. Near ultraviolet absorbance spectra of the reaction were collected every 5 s using a diode array spectrophotometer. The formation of the hydroxypterin was clearly detectable at 246 nm, where its absorbance is maximal, when either tryptophan or phenylalanine was the amino acid substrate (Fig. 3). After the spectral changes were complete, the amount of hydroxylated amino acid produced was determined by HPLC. With tryptophan as substrate 103 nmol of hydroxytryptophan were produced after complete oxidation of 100 nmol of tetrahydrobiopterin. Similarly, oxidation of 100 nmol of tetrahydrobiopterin in the presence of phenylalanine produced 99 nmol of"

The substitutions were made in the allosteric M<sub>2</sub> isozyme by the corresponding residues of the nonallosteric M<sub>1</sub> isozyme to identify the residue involved in the allosteric effects. The replacement of Cys-423 by Leu led to substantial loss of both homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effects while the substitutions at Phe-389, Arg-398, Ala-401, Pro-402, Thr-408, and Ile-427 did not. The altered kinetic properties of the Cys-423-substituted mutant resulted from the shift of the allosteric transition toward the active R-state since the mutant exhibits the allosteric properties in the presence of an allosteric inhibitor, l-phenylalanine. The inverse correlation between the hydrophobicity of residue 423 and the extent of stabilization of the R-state was found by analysis of mutants with un-ionizable amino acids at position 423. Furthermore, the modification of Cys-423 with methyl methanethiosulfonate led to a shift of the allosteric transition toward the R-state, probably the result of increased hydrophobicity of the residue. These results suggest that Cys-423 is involved in the allosteric regulation of the enzyme through hydrophobic interactions."

Zhou C. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany1996: 415-432Google Scholar). In addition to hydrolytic activity, PLD enzymes also catalyze a transphosphatidylation reaction in the presence of a high concentration of primary alcohol (2Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,3Eibl A. Kovatchev S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 197: 493-499Google Scholar). This reaction, which is consistent with a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate (4Holbrook P. Pannell L.K. Daly J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), has been used to monitor the presence of PLD in a variety of cells. PLD activities, observed in both membrane and cytosolic fractions of mammalian cells, play key roles in membrane trafficking and regulation of mitosis as well as signal transduction (5Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The lipophilic product of PLD cleavage, PA, and its PLA2 degradation product, lyso-PA, are second messengers and have activation roles in a wide variety of cells (6Salmon D.M. Honeyman T.W. Nature. 1980; 284: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5522-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jalink K. van Corven E.J.

Biophys. 1992; 297: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lyso-PA appears to be the more potent lipid mediator (10Moolenaar W.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 213-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); concentrations in the nm range elicit diverse biological actions,e.g. activation of DNA synthesis. PA can also be converted to a nonsignaling lipid via the PLD transferase activity and DAG to produce bis-PA (11Van Blitterswijk W.J. Hilkmann H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2655-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Van Blitterswijk W.J. Hilkmann H. de Widt J. van der Bend R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10337-10343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, basal PLD activity is low, although it can be activated very rapidly. Given its physiological importance, determining the factors that activate or inhibit PLD is of considerable interest. PLD enzymes are also present in plants and various microorganisms. Many of these enzymes have been purified and well characterized kinetically. Plant and bacterial PLD enzymes share a number of kinetic characteristics with the recently purified mammalian PLD isozymes and so may be reasonable models for the latter enzymes. PLD fromStreptomyces chromofuscus is a water-soluble enzyme purified from the culture supernatant (13Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It can mimic the effect of endogenous PLD when added to a variety of mammalian cells. For example, the addition of exogenous S. chromofuscus PLD induces an activity similar to that of endogenous PLD in ovarian granulosa cell culture (14Liscovitch M. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11762-11767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of bacterial PLD to the medium of vascular smooth muscle cells induces DNA synthesis along with formation of choline and PA (15Kondo T. Inui H. Konishi F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23609-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this in mind, we have examined the effect of the lipophilic PLD product PA on PLD from S. chromofuscus. The inclusion of PA in a phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayer, rather than inhibiting the enzyme (as might be expected for simple product inhibition), activates the enzyme allosterically and enhances activity significantly. This type of interaction may be relevant to signal transduction because phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) (and presumably phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)) can also activate the enzyme. Phospholipids including POPC, dimyristoyl-PC, diC4PC, POPA, LPA, PMe, PI, and oleic acid were purchased from Avanti in chloroform solutions and used without further purification. Triton X-100 and β-octyl glucoside were obtained from Sigma. Pyrene-labeled phospholipids (C16pyr-COOH, C16C6pyr-PC, and C16C6pyr-PMe) were purchased from Molecular Probes. PLD from S. chromofuscus, obtained form Sigma, gave rise to three major bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The enzyme was purified further with the following steps. The commercially available enzyme was dissolved in 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a Hitrap HIC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then eluted with a (NH4)2SO4gradient in phosphate buffer. Two protein fractions with PLD activity were obtained. PLD1 (the first protein eluted) showed one single band with a subunit molecular mass of 57 kDa. This appears to be the same as the PLD enzyme reported previously (13Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The second protein fraction containing PLD activity (termed PLD2) showed two bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, at 42 and 19.7 kDa. Although both PLD1 and PLD2 showed PLD activities, only PLD1 was used in extensive kinetic studies of the effect of PA because its subunit molecular mass corresponded to that reported previously for PLD from this organism (13Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Commercially available PLD from cabbage (obtained from Sigma) was used without further purification. Enzyme concentrations were measured by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 mmdiC4PC dissolved in 50 mm ammonium formate containing 0.5 mm Ca2+, pH 7.5, was incubated overnight at room temperature with 100 μg of PLD from S. chromofuscus. DiC4PA was purified from unreacted PC by elution from a QAE-Sephadex A-25 column using 1 m ammonium formate. C16C6pyr-PA was generated similarly byS. chromofuscus PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of C16C6pyr-PC (solubilized in an ether/water/borate buffer emulsion with 0.5 mmCa2+ at pH 7.5). The hydrolysis product, C16C6pyr-PA, was isolated by extraction of the aqueous reaction mixture several times with a chloroform/methanol (100:10) solution. The purity of C16C6pyr-PA and diC4PA was confirmed by 1H and31P NMR spectroscopy. Lipid solutions in chloroform were dried under argon, lyophilized, and then suspended in 50 mmimidazole-D2O buffer, pH 7.2 (meter reading). For preparation of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), the aqueous lipid suspensions were sonicated in 3-min intervals (using a Branson W-350 sonicator) until maximum optical clarity was achieved. LUVs were prepared by extrusion using a LiposoFast Basic extruder with a 100-nm pore filter. The diameter of 6 mm PC LUVs prepared in this fashion was 80 ± 27 nm (17MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 297-303Crossref Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra, monitoring choline production, were acquired with a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer using an indirect probe and temperature of 30 °C. The following parameters were used in acquiring spectra: 1.2-s acquisition time, 1.0-s relaxation delay, and 6.2-μs pulse width (90°). Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual water resonance (before presaturation) at 4.75 ppm. The total volume of each assay sample was 400 μl. An initial spectrum was acquired before adding the enzyme and calcium solutions; this served as the zero time control. After the addition of PLD, an arrayed experiment was carried out for about 1 h. Initial rates were obtained from the progress curve for 10–20% PC hydrolysis as monitored by the increase in choline N(CH3)3 intensity. Errors in determining rates with this method were typically ≤15%. For kinetic studies involving diC4PC, a radiometer pH-stat model VIT90 was used to monitor generation of the soluble PA. The pK a2 for short chain PA (both monomer and micelle) is 6.8 (18Garigapati V. Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1995; 169: 486-492Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), so that with an end point of 8.0 essentially all of the product can be titrated. PLD activity at each PC concentration was measured in duplicate or triplicate using 4 mm NaOH as the titrant. Steady-state fluorescence measurements of vesicle mixing were carried out on a Shimadzu RF5000V spectrofluorometer at 30 °C (19Soltys C.E. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11608-11617Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pyrene-labeled lipids were excited at 350 nm with both excitation and emission slit widths set at 1.5 nm. The emission spectrum was monitored from 360 to 550 nm; almost all of the fluorescence information for both monomer and excimer bands was included in this range. The final concentration of labeled probe was 20 μm, the volume of sample was 400 μl, and total lipid concentration after dilution was 10 mm. These conditions mimic the reaction conditions used in the NMR experiments. PLD enzymes, including the crude enzyme from S. chromofuscus, have an absolute requirement for Ca2+because enzyme activity was abolished in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. DiC4PC is a soluble phospholipid with a very high CMC. More critical for kinetics where PA is the product, diC4PA does not form a precipitate with mmCa2+. With this soluble substrate/soluble product assay system, the K D for Ca2+ was found to be 0.075 mm. There was no PLD activity without Ca2+ (e.g. in the presence of EDTA). Neither Zn2+ nor Ba2+ could substitute for the Ca2+ requirement. However, low PLD activity was observed in the absence of Ca2+ but with 1 mmMg2+ added. The PLD specific activity with Mg2+was about half of the activity of PLD without the addition of any metal ions (but without added EDTA). Enzyme activity did not increase with increasing Mg2+, suggesting that the observed activity was from the low level of contaminating Ca2+ in the assay solution and that the Mg2+ did not compete well for the Ca2+ site on the enzyme. PLD activity toward monomeric PC increased with increasing PC acyl chain length: for diC4PC,V max = 29.0 ± 1.2 μmol min−1 mg−1 and K m = 0.36 ± 0.06 mm; for monomeric diC6PC,V max = 61.5 ± 4.7 μmol min−1 mg−1 and K m = 0.05 ± 0.04 mm. The PLD specific activity showed no dependence on micellization of a monomeric substrate. PLD specific activity was constant, 61.4 ± 1.8 μmol min−1mg−1, for five concentrations of diC6PC ranging from 2 to 30 mm. This phospholipid has a CMC of 14 mm; therefore, this bacterial PLD exhibits no interfacial activation. The two-dimensional concentration of the substrate in the interface was also not an important parameter for this phospholipase. With Triton X-100/POPC mixed micelles as the substrate, no decrease in activity was observed when the Triton concentration was increased 3-fold at a fixed PC concentration. The lack of a surface dilution effect as well as interfacial activation under these conditions indicated that this bacterial PLD behaved more like an esterase than a typical lipase. The absolute requirement of PLD for calcium complicates kinetics because Ca2+ forms a precipitate with PA, the PLD hydrolysis product. The Ca2+·PA complexes also cause massive particle growth in short chain (except for diC4PC) micelle systems when PA is generated. The relatively large size of vesicles (so that substrate depletion is not a significant problem for <20% hydrolysis) and tolerance of higher Ca2+ concentrations before precipitation or fusion occur make POPC/POPA vesicles ideal for examining the effects of product on PLD catalysis. However, the high pK a2 of PA in vesicles (pK a2 = 7.6 in predominantly PC bilayers (20Swairjo M. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) makes pH-stat assays of PLD action problematic because at an end point of 8.0 only part of the PA is titratable. Furthermore, the PA pK a2 increases as more of the bilayer surface is occupied by PA (20Swairjo M. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor PLD activity by measuring the intensity of the water-soluble choline N-methyl resonance. The N-methyl region of the SUVs of POPC exhibits resonances for inner and outer leaflet PC at 3.15 and 3.18 ppm. The water-soluble choline N-methyl resonance is observed as a sharp resonance at 3.09 ppm, upfield of the inner PC (Fig.1). The integral of the choline resonance as a function of time provides a sensitive measure of PLD activity. Calcium was added with enzyme to avoid any vesicle fusion before PLD generation of PA. There is a small lag in the reaction progress curve (typically around 5 min) under these conditions (Fig.2 A, filled circles). The lag is independent of the POPC concentration. This is reminiscent of the lag phase toward vesicle substrates observed for 14-kDa PLA2 enzymes acting on PC bilayer substrate (21Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For PLA2, the binding affinity of enzyme to the PC vesicle surface was low and represented a slow step in the enzyme reaction. Any factor that can facilitate enzyme surface binding abolished the lag and increased the observable enzyme activity (22Ghomashchi F. Yu B. Berg O. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The dependence of PLD activity (measured after the lag phase) toward POPC vesicles on calcium concentration was hyperbolic with a K D for Ca2+ of 3.9 mm, considerably higher than the value for short chain PC monomers. Ca2+ induces fusion in SUVs containing negatively charge phospholipids. Therefore, to optimize PLD activity and minimize fusion when PA (or other negatively charged lipids) was included in vesicles, 5 mm calcium was used in the assays unless otherwise noted. As shown in Fig.3, the dependence of PLD specific activity on POPC concentration was hyperbolic with an apparentK m = 6.5 ± 1.7 mm andV max = 13.5 ± 1.5 μmol min−1 mg−1. Although PLD does not exhibit interfacial activation or surface dilution in micelle systems, perturbations of the bilayer could alter the observed specific activity of PLD in a vesicle system. Incorporation of 5–10 mol % DAG, a lipid that destabilizes bilayers to fusion, into POPC SUVs had little effect on the PLD specific activity. Furthermore, the presence of the DAG had no effect on the lag phase (e.g. see Fig. 2 B, where the 5-min lag is still observed).Figure 2Reaction progress curve for hydrolysis of different POPC SUVs. The amount of hydrolysis product choline was calculated from the 1H integrated intensity of the choline resonance compared with an internal standard. SUVs were composed of (panel A) 10 mm POPC (•) and 9 mmPOPC with 1 mm LPA (○); (panel B) 9 mm POPC with 1 mm DAG (⋄) or 1 mmPI (▿); (panel C) 9 mm POPC with 1 mm PMe (♦) or 1 mm oleic acid (▵).

Reaction conditions are the same as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) POPA was deliberately incorporated into POPC SUVs to determine if the product of PLD had any effect on the initial rates of reaction. The addition of 0.5–5 mm Ca2+ caused no massive aggregation or precipitation of POPC/POPA vesicles as long as the PA content was <30%. In studies of PLA2 activity toward PC vesicles, it was found that incorporation into the bilayer of a threshold level of product or other anionic lipids diminished the lag phase and increased the enzyme activities (23Jain M.K. Cordes E.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1973; 14: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). With that phospholipase, negatively charged lipids facilitate the binding of enzyme to the bilayer interface (24Jain M.K. Berg O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Products also alter the polarity in the interface region, and this facilitates PLA2 action (25Sheffield M.J. Baker B.L. Owen N.L. Baker M.L. Bell J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If POPA promotes binding of PLD to the vesicle surfaces, there might be an increase in PLD specific activity as well as the disappearance of the lag phase. On the other hand, PA is a PLD product and might give rise to product inhibition. PLD activity toward POPC/POPA SUVs was examined as a function of calcium concentration and mole fraction POPA. The relative activities of PLD toward POPC and POPC/POPA SUVs with various Ca2+concentrations are shown in Table I. The incorporation of POPA in PC SUVs increased the enzyme specific activity about 5–8-fold. The presence of POPA also diminished the lag phase, presumably because it facilitated binding of the PLD to the vesicle. The activation of PLD by PA was calcium-dependent. At low Ca2+ (0.5 mm), incorporation of POPA in the vesicles inhibited PLD; at higher Ca2+ concentrations, the same concentration of POPA activated PLD. The inhibition at low calcium concentrations may be caused by the competition of Ca2+preferential binding to PA instead of PLD. At 5 mmCa2+, the apparent V max of PLD toward POPC vesicles with 10 mol % POPA in the bilayer was 96.0 ± 8.9 μmol min−1 mg−1, and the apparentK m was 4.8 ± 1.4 mm. The 7-fold increase in V max could reflect an increase in PLD adsorption to the vesicle surface as well as an increase ink cat. The slight reduction in the apparentK m for substrate (from 6.5 to 4.8 mm) was within the error of K m determination. At a fixed total phospholipid concentration (10 mm) and 5 mm Ca2+, the mol % of POPA incorporated into the vesicles was also varied. As seen in Fig.4, PLD activity increased with the mol % of POPA to a maximum ∼20 mol % PA. At greater than 30 mol % PA, the presence of the Ca2+ caused vesicle aggregation and fusion; PLD activity also decreased somewhat. However, under these conditions (PC + PA = 10 mm), it is also possible that the substrate (PC) concentration decreased to a level near the apparentK m, leading to the decrease in observed activity.Table IRelative activity of S. chromofuscus PLD toward small unilamellar vesicles of POPC and POPC/POPACa2+Relative PLD activity1-aSpecific activities are divided by the value of 3.1 μmol min−1 mg−1 for PLD acting on 10 mmPOPC vesicles in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+.

Open table in a new tab PA is dianionic, and the negative charges of PA may play a major role in the binding of enzyme to the vesicle surface and thus activating PLD. Other lipids and amphiphiles with negative charges, PMe, oleic acid, PI, LPA, and PIP, were incorporated into POPC vesicles to see if they could activate PLD. The relative PLD activities toward POPC vesicles with 10 mol % anionic lipids are shown in TableII. Most of the negatively charged lipids did not activate PLD, nor did they reduce the lag phase (Fig. 2,B and C). PMe had almost no effect, whereas the incorporation of oleate and PI inhibited the enzyme activity. Along with the inhibited PLD activity was an increased lag time (compare Fig.2, B and C, where the presence of 10 mol % PI and oleate leads to an increased lag phase). However, both PIP and lyso-PA activated PLD. The lyso-PA activation was comparable to that of PA, whereas the PIP activation was 3-fold less. Again, when PLD activation was observed, the lag phase was reduced or abolished (e.g. see Fig. 2 A, open circles, for the effect LPA). Activating lipids all have phosphate monoester groups, suggesting that the activation was specific for a membrane-localized phosphate moiety.Table IIRelative activity of S. chromofuscus PLD toward POPC/X (9 mm:1 mm) vesiclesXRelative activity2-aSpecific activities are divided by the value of 11.5 μmol min−1 mg−1 for PLD acting on 10 mmPOPC vesicles in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+.

Open table in a new tab Vesicle fusion is always a concern in enzymatic reactions involving vesicles containing anionic lipids and Ca2+. Enzyme can be transferred from one vesicle to another through the fusion, potentially complicating kinetics. High concentrations of Ca2+ enhance fusion of vesicles with negatively charged amphiphiles such as PA and fatty acid (26Yamamoto I. Konto A. Handa T. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Blackwood R.A. Smolen J.E. Transue A. Hessler R.J. Harsh D.M. Brower R.C. French S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether PA activation of PLD was caused by calcium-related vesicle fusion, the effect of other divalent cations on the PLD hydrolysis of POPC/POPA vesicles was investigated. TableIII shows the effect of Mg2+and Ba2+ on PA activation. Because there is no activity if Ca2+ is absent, 0.5 or 1 mm Ca2+was used with 4.5 and 4 mm Mg2+ or Ba2+ added. The addition of the other two metal ions had small effects on PLD activity toward POPC vesicles, with Mg2+ more effective in replacing the excess Ca2+ than Ba2+. A more significant activation was seen with PA-containing vesicles. Neither Mg2+ nor Ba2+ led to amounts of activation comparable to Ca2+, although the addition of Mg2+ enhanced PLD activity to roughly half of that produced by Ca2+ at a comparable concentration. The added Mg2+ caused some precipitation in the POPC/POPA vesicle solution (even without the addition of PLD). In contrast, the POPC/POPA vesicle solution was opalescent with 5 mm Ba2+ and 1 mmCa2+. POPC/POPA (9:1) vesicle solutions appeared opalescent for several hours after the addition of up to 10 mmCa2+, indicating that they were reasonably stable in the absence of PLD under these conditions. Thus, an excess of divalent ion along with a minimum amount of Ca2+ for catalysis is critical for optimal PLD activity.Table IIIEffect of divalent metal ions on the specific activity of S. chromofuscus PLD toward POPC and POPC/POPA vesiclesM2+Specific activity3-aTypical errors in measuring PLD specific activity by1H NMR methods are less than 15%.Ca2+Mg2+Ba2+POPC (10 mm)POPC/POPA (9 mm:1 mm)POPC/POPA (7 mm:3 mm)μmol min −1 mg −10.53.11.513.98.7511.563.160.4147.435.630.20.54.53.43.0143.622.325.53-a Typical errors in measuring PLD specific activity by1H NMR methods are less than 15%. Open table in a new tab The effect of PA on the specific activity of PLD from cabbage was also examined. Vesicles with 1 mm POPA and 9 mm POPC (with 5 mmCa2+) exhibited a 26-fold enhanced PLD specific activity compared with pure POPC (10 mm) vesicles. Cabbage PLD is different from the bacterial enzyme in that it appears to show some interfacial activation (28Lewis, K. (1992) Short-chain Phospholipids as Probes of Phospholipase Activity. Ph.D. dissertation, Boston College.Google Scholar) using short chain PCs as substrates. That PA activates the enzyme might suggest that PA activation is a property for many PLD enzymes. The incorporation of dianionic POPA into SUVs stabilizes the curvature of the small vesicles. PLD may bind more effectively to a curved surface than to a flat surface. The effect of vesicle curvature on enzyme activity can be assessed by comparing specific activities toward large and small unilamellar POPC and POPC/POPA vesicles (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W1991937669,"Synaptotagmins I and II are essential for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from neurons, probably serving as Ca2+ sensors. This Ca2+-sensing function is thought to be disrupted by binding of an inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I or II (Fukuda, M., Moreira, J. E., Lewis, F. M. T., Sugimori, M., Niinobe, M., Mikoshiba, K., and Llinás, R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.92, 10708–10712). Recently, several synaptotagmin isoforms, expressed outside the nervous system, have been identified in rats and proposed to be involved in constitutive vesicle traffic. To test whether the inositol high polyphosphates also regulate constitutive vesicle traffic by binding to the non-neuronal synaptotagmins, we examined the IP4 binding properties of the recombinant C2 domains of both neuronal (III, V, X, and XI) and non-neuronal (VI–VIII and IX) synaptotagmins. The C2B domains of synaptotagmins VII–IX and XI had strong IP4 binding activity, but the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VI showed very weak IP4 binding activity. In contrast, there was no significant IP4 binding activity of the C2B domains of synaptotagmins III, V, and X or any of the C2A domains. A phylogenetic tree of the C2 domains of 11 isoforms revealed that synaptotagmins III, V, VI, and X (IP4-insensitive or very weak IP4-binding isoforms) belong to the same branch. Based on the sequence comparison between the IP4-sensitive and -insensitive isoforms, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of synaptotagmin III and identified several amino acid substitutions that abolish IP4 binding activity. Our data suggest that the inositol high polyphosphates might also regulate constitutive vesicle traffic via binding to the IP4-sensitive non-neuronal synaptotagmins.

Synaptotagmins are a family of vesicle membrane proteins characterized by a short intravesicular amino terminus, a single transmembrane region, and two copies of highly conserved repeats homologous to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C (named the C2A and C2B domains) in the cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).

Based on their expression patterns in tissues, synaptotagmins I–V, X, and XI are classified as neuronal types (expressed abundantly in neurons), and others (synaptotagmins VI–IX) are expressed in a wide variety of tissues other than brain (so-called ubiquitous types). Most of the proteins involved in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in neurons (e.g.synaptobrevin or syntaxin) have been reported to have homologues involved in constitutive membrane trafficking; and therefore, it has been suggested that the same protein family governs both constitutive and regulated vesicle traffic (11Bennett M.K.

Based on this idea, the ubiquitous isoforms of synaptotagmin are also thought to be involved in constitutive vesicle trafficking because synaptotagmin I (the best characterized neuronal type) is essential for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in neurons and some endocrine cells (probably functioning as a Ca2+ sensor) (reviewed in Ref. 1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, the exact localization and functions of the ubiquitous synaptotagmins remain unknown. Recently, we demonstrated the distinct roles of two C2 domains of synaptotagmin I (or II) in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in the squid giant presynapse (14Mikoshiba K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E.

The C2A domain is crucial for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis and is directly involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This fusion step was strongly inhibited by binding of an inositol high polyphosphate (inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), 1The abbreviations used are: IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Syt, synaptotagmin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)) to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I (or II) (15Fukuda M.

In chromaffin cells particularly, IP5 is suggested to function as a fusion clamp for exocytosis because IP5 is rapidly accumulated after depolarizing stimulation (17Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fukuda M.

These observations raised the possibility that inositol high polyphosphates may also regulate other types of vesicle traffic (e.g. constitutive) via binding to ubiquitous members of the synaptotagmin family (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To address this question, we examined the inositol high polyphosphate binding properties of the C2 domains of all synaptotagmin isoforms identified to date (synaptotagmins I–XI) as an indicator of IP4 binding activity. In this study, we show that the C2B domains, but not the C2A domains, of non-neuronal synaptotagmin isoforms (VII–IX) also have strong IP4 binding activities. In addition, we newly identified a subclass of synaptotagmins deficient in IP4 binding activity, despite having a putative IP4-binding sequence as determined previously (20Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Interestingly, this class of synaptotagmins (III, V, VI, and X) is structurally related and distinguished from other isoforms by phylogenetic trees of the C2 domains. We further determined the conserved amino acid substitutions that abolish IP4 binding activity by site-directed mutagenesis. On the basis of these results, we discuss the functional difference between IP4-sensitive and -insensitive synaptotagmins in vesicular trafficking. cDNAs encoding two C2 domains of synaptotagmin isoforms (V–VII, X, and XI) were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from mouse cerebellum cDNAs using the following primers designed on the basis of rat sequences (8Li C.

Reactions were carried out for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. After digestion with BamHI, BglII, orFbaI and EcoRI or MunI, the PCR products were purified on an agarose gel, extracted with a Geneclean II kit (BIO 101, Inc.), and then inserted into theBamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Only the nucleotide sequences coding for two C2 domains were sequenced in both directions using a BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit (Takara Shuzo). As compared with rat sequences, several amino acid substitutions were found in mouse SytVI (Ser at position 471 was altered to Asn, S471N), SytVII (I218V), SytX (S263F and M362I), and SytXI (G188D and I357V). These changes are probably not due to PCR-induced errors because they were also found in two independent PCR products of each synaptotagmin. Using primers based on the mouse nucleotide sequences obtained above and the data base for mouse SytVIII, fragments encoding the C2A or C2B domains of synaptotagmin isoforms (SytV-, SytVII-, SytVIII-, SytX-, and SytXI-C2A or -C2B and SytVI- and SytIX-C2B) were amplified by PCR.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the C2A and C2B domains of mouse synaptotagmin isoforms (GST-STI–XI-C2A and -C2B, where STI–XI is synaptotagmins I–XI) were expressed inEscherichia coli JM109 and then purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography according to the manufacturer's recommendations. GST-STI-C2A and -C2B encoded amino acids 138–266 and 268–392, respectively, of mouse synaptotagmin I. Similarly, the following fusion proteins were prepared: GST-STII-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC, corresponding to amino acids 139–267, 267–393, and 267–346 of mouse synaptotagmin II, respectively; GST-STIII-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC, corresponding to amino acids 290–421, 425–549, and 425–501 of mouse synaptotagmin III, respectively; GST-STIV-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 151–281 and 281–408 of mouse synaptotagmin IV, respectively; GST-STV-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC, corresponding to amino acids 5–135, 135–261, and 135–213 of mouse synaptotagmin V, respectively; GST-STVI-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 227–357 and 357–483 of mouse synaptotagmin VI, respectively; GST-STVII-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 132–261 and 261–387 of mouse synaptotagmin VII, respectively; GST-STVIII-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 70–195 and 195–318 of mouse synaptotagmin VIII, respectively; GST-STIX-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 105–234 and 233–360 of mouse synaptotagmin IX, respectively; GST-STX-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC, corresponding to amino acids 228–358, 358–484, and 358–436 of mouse synaptotagmin X, respectively; and GST-STXI-C2A and -C2B, corresponding to amino acids 153–284 and 284–413 of mouse synaptotagmin XI, respectively.

The protein concentrations of the purified recombinant proteins were initially determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin used as a reference. Purified proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The purity of each recombinant protein was estimated by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by densitometry with BioImage (Millipore Corp.), and the concentration of each GST fusion protein was then determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard. cDNAs encoding two C2 domains of SrgI and SytB/K were also amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse cerebellum cDNAs using the following primers designed on the basis of rat sequences (26Thompson C.C.

Reaction conditions were the same as described above. After digestion with BamHI orBglII and EcoRI or MunI, the PCR products were purified on an agarose gel and extracted with a Geneclean II kit and then inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T vector. Only the nucleotide sequences coding for two C2 domains were sequenced in both directions using a BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit. As compared with rat sequences, three amino acid substitutions were found in mouse SrgI (D315E, T317S, and A393V). These changes are probably not due to PCR-induced errors because they were also found in two independent PCR products. Using primers based on the mouse nucleotide sequences obtained above, fragments encoding the C2A or C2B domains of SrgI and SytB/K were amplified by PCR.

GST-Srg-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC contained amino acids 149–278, 278–404, and 278–356, respectively, of mouse SrgI; and GST-STB/K-C2A, -C2B, and -C2BΔC contained amino acids 180–315, 315–443, and 315–394, respectively, of mouse SytB/K. Site-directed mutagenesis of GST-STIII-C2Bα-(P505F,E509Q,N510K) and GST-STIII-C2Bβ7-(H525K,V531K,C532I,R533F) was carried out by means of two-step PCR as follows (22Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In GST-STIII-C2Bα-(P505F,E509Q,N510K), for example, the right and left halves of the C2B domain were separately amplified with two pairs of oligonucleotides (primer A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAAAGGCAGATCTTGGGGA-3′) and mutagenic primer B (5′-GCGACGTCGAACACCAGGGCCT-3′) (left half); mutagenic primer C (5′-TCGACGTCGCTTTCGAGAGCGTGCAGAAAGTGGGTCTCAG-3′) and primer D (5′-GGAATTCATCTCTGCCCAGTGTTCTC-3′) (right half)). The two resulting PCR fragments were digested with AatII (underlined), ligated to each other, and reamplified with primers A and D. The obtained PCR fragment encoding the mutant C2B domain of synaptotagmin III (P505F,E509Q,N510K) was subcloned into theBamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-2T and verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of GST-STIII-C2Bloopβ7–8-(E537N,A539T,D540G,G543L) was achieved by PCR using primer A and a mutagenic primer (primer E, 5′-GGAATTCATCTCTGCCCAGTGTTCTCTGAGGTGTGGGCCGGTAGCGTTTGGGCCCACG-3′). The obtained PCR fragment encoding the mutant C2B domain of synaptotagmin III (E537N,A539T,D540G,G543L) was subcloned into theBamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T vector and verified by DNA sequencing. Other plasmids encoding the mutant C2B domain of synaptotagmin were similarly constructed by means of PCR using mutagenic primers. Measurement of IP4 binding was performed as described previously (20Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the buffer system was changed from 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) because GST-STII-C2B showed stronger IP4 binding activity in the latter buffer. GST fusion proteins (1–2.5 μg) were incubated with 9.6 nm [3H]IP4 (specific radioactivity of 777 GBq/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in 49 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) for 10 min at 4 °C. The sample was then mixed with 1 μl of 50 mg/ml γ-globulins and 50 μl of a solution containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 and 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and placed on ice for 5 min. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 5 min was solubilized in 500 μl of Solvable (Packard Instrument Co.), and radioactivity was measured in Aquasol 2 (Packard Instrument Co.) with a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm nonradioactive IP4 Multiple sequence alignment of the C2 domains of synaptotagmin isoforms was performed using the PILEUP program of the GCG program (Version 8.1). Calculation of genetic distance and suitable depiction of the phylogenetic tree using the neighbor joining method were performed with the SINCA program (Fujitsu). Putative IP4-binding sites were aligned referring to the multiple alignment results. Statistical analysis and curve fitting were done using the GraphPad PRISM computer program (Version 2.0). The C2 domain, originally identified as a sequence motif of protein kinase C, is a conserved protein module of ∼120 amino acids found in many proteins (28Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Among them, synaptotagmins are apparently distinguished from other proteins in that they have a single transmembrane region and tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B domains) with a short spacer. In our previous studies, we showed that neuronal synaptotagmins I, II, and IV, but not synaptotagmin III, are IP4- or inositol high polyphosphate-binding proteins (20Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

To further examine whether other neuronal and non-neuronal isoforms of synaptotagmins are also regulated by inositol high polyphosphates like synaptotagmin I, we prepared GST fusion proteins of C2 domains of synaptotagmins V–XI and tested for their IP4 binding activity (Fig. 1 and TableI). GST-STVII, -STVIII, -STIX, and -STXI-C2B had strong IP4 binding activity like synaptotagmin II, but GST-STVI-C2B showed weak IP4 binding activity (<20% of that of GST-STII-C2B). In contrast, GST-STV and -STX and all the GST-ST-C2A fusion proteins showed no significant IP4 binding activity under our experimental conditions.Table IComparison of IP4 binding properties of tandem C2 domains of synaptotagmins, SrgI, synaptotagmin B/K, rabphilin 3A, and Doc2NameC2AC2BRef.SytI −1-a−, no significant IP4 binding activity; +++, 75–100% of the IP4 binding activity of GST-STII-C2B (see Fig.1); ++, 50–75% of the IP4 binding activity of GST-STII-C2B; +, 5–25% of the IP4 binding activity of GST-STII-C2B.+++20Fukuda M.

Open table in a new tab To understand the relationship between the molecular evolution of the C2 domains of synaptotagmins and IP4binding capacity, a phylogenetic tree of the C2 domains of synaptotagmin isoforms was constructed using the neighbor joining method (Fig. 2). In this phylogenetic tree, the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I is expressed as the most primitive or original form of the C2B domain because this domain of invertebrate synaptotagmins has been identified inDrosophila (31Perin M.S.

According to this phylogenetic tree, the C2 domains of synaptotagmin isoforms are classified into two distinct groups, C2A and C2B, and the C2 domain from the same isoform is located at very similar positions in the two groups, suggesting that mammalian synaptotagmin isoforms were separated after the tandem C2 domains had been produced. When synaptotagmins that bind IP4 strongly or weakly are solid-boxed orbroken-boxed, respectively, it is apparent that the C2B domains of synaptotagmins III, V, VI, and X (IP4-insensitive or weak binding isoforms) form a small but distinct branch (Fig. 2). To further examine whether these synaptotagmins (III, V, VI, and X) have a common sequence responsible for the lack of IP4 binding at the amino acid level, we compared the putative IP4-binding sites of all synaptotagmin isoforms as determined previously (20Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

However, in this region, no apparent differences were observed between IP4-sensitive and -insensitive synaptotagmin isoforms. Within the putative IP4-binding domain, three positively charged amino acids responsible for high affinity IP4binding activity (Lys at positions 327, 328, and 332 of synaptotagmin II (22Fukuda M.

Mikoshiba K. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since SytVIII-C2B lacks one of the important Lys residues (Ser at position 252, Ser-252), its IP4 binding activity was weaker than that of synaptotagmin II (Fig. 3), which is consistent with our previous mutational analysis (22"
https://openalex.org/W1996955964,"In order to identify agonist- and antagonist-binding epitopes in the human B1 and B2 bradykinin (BK) receptors, we exploited the ability of these receptors to discriminate between peptide ligands that differ only by the absence (B1) and presence (B2) of a C-terminal Arg. This was done by constructing chimeric proteins in which specific domains were exchanged between these receptors as recently described by us (Leeb, T., Mathis, S. A., and Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 311–317). The constructs were then expressed in HEK293 and A10 cells and assayed by radioligand binding and by agonist-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Substitution of the third transmembrane domain (TM-III) of the B1 receptor in the B2 receptor (B2(B1III)) dramatically reduced the affinities of B2-selective peptide ligands including both the agonist BK and the antagonist NPC17731. High affinity binding of both ligands to B2(B1III) was fully regained when one residue, Lys111, in TM-III of this chimera was replaced with the corresponding wild-type (WT) B2 receptor residue, Ser (B2(B1IIIS111)). Replacement of Ser111 with Lys in the WT B2 receptor decreased the affinities of BK and NPC17731 and increased the affinity of the B1-selective des-Arg10 analog of NPC17731, NPC18565. The results show that the C-terminal residue of peptide agonists and antagonists when bound to the B2 receptor is adjacent to Ser111 in the receptor. A Lys at this position, as is the case in the WT B1 receptor, provides a positive charge that repels the C-terminal Arg in B2-selective peptides and attracts the negative charge of the C terminus of B1-selective peptides, which lack the C-terminal Arg. Therefore, the residues at this one single position are crucial in determining the peptide selectivity of B1 and B2 BK receptors.

These receptors bind ligands of widely diverse origins, and are unsurpassed as therapeutic targets. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to mapping of the binding sites for agonist and antagonist ligands in these receptors (1Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar,2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev.

Even though peptides are the most common class of ligands for GPCR, few peptide GPCR have been investigated thus far, and in most of those cases the identity of the peptide-binding epitopes remains elusive. Receptors for kinins, pro-inflammatory peptides 8–10 amino acids in length, have been classified into two subtypes, termed B1 and B2 (3Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and are members of the GPCR superfamily (4Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These receptor subtypes, although only 36% identical, discriminate between peptide agonists that differ only in their C-terminal residue; BK binds to the B2 receptor, whereas the C-terminally truncated carboxypeptidase fragments des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg10-Lys-BK, or des-Arg10-KD, bind to the B1 receptor.

We recently developed a novel, potentially more effective strategy for mapping the binding sites in kinin receptors, which is based on the identification of receptor epitopes that enable these receptors to discriminate between ligands (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This strategy involves the exchange of individual TMs between the B1 and B2 receptor subtypes and the subsequent exchange of non-conserved residues that are possible candidates for discriminatory action. This approach is intrinsically more reliable than alanine-scanning mutagenesis as it yields in sequence both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. In an initial study, we used this strategy to identify specific residues in TM-VI of the human WT B1 and B2 receptors that are partially responsible for enabling these receptor subtypes to discriminate between peptide agonists (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the role of TM-III in peptide ligand discrimination. Our results show that TM-III enables BK receptors to discriminate between both peptide agonists and antagonists, and the discrimination involves specifically the C-terminal amino acid of the peptides, the hallmark for BK receptor subtype selectivity.

NPC17731 and NPC18565 were generous gifts from Donald J. Kyle, Scios, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA. Kallidin was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA), and des-Arg10-kallidin was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). LipofectAMINE, DMEM, Leibovitz's L-15 medium, and Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for calcium phosphate transfections were purchased from 5Prime → 3Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Sera and all other peptides and chemicals were from Sigma. The original human WT B1 and B2 receptor clones in vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were kindly provided by J. Fred Hess, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA. Fusions between the B1 and the B2 receptor cDNA clones were made using a modified PCR-ligation-PCR protocol (16Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). The B2 clone was modified by introducing a XhoI site at the 3′ end of the insert. Appropriate B1 and B2 clone fragments were amplified in 100-μl PCR reactions containing 10 ng of template DNA, 200 μm dNTPs, 100 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units ofPfu polymerase, and the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). T7 and SP6 were chosen as flanking primers, and internal primers were designed according to the desired fusion point in the chimeric construct. Appropriate gene fragments were amplified for 20 cycles and purified using 1% agarose gels and the QiaExII kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The isolated PCR products were combined, phosphorylated, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. In a second PCR, the fusion product was amplified for 25 cycles. Amplification products were purified as described above, cut with HindIII and XhoI, and ligated into the pcDNA3 vector. The identity of the chimeric insert was confirmed by cycle sequencing. Pure plasmid DNA for transfections into mammalian cells was isolated with the Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were used for analysis of radioligand binding and agonist-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2. At 24 h before transient transfections, the cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes or six-well plates at 60–80% confluence. The cells were then transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitate method with overnight incubation in the presence of 15 μg of cDNA/dish. The cells were then further incubated for an additional 72–96 h after transfection. Transiently transfected A10 cells were used for analysis of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2. At 24 h before transfection, the cells were seeded at ∼ 80% confluence in six-well plates containing 25-mm glass coverslips, which had been pretreated by incubation in growth medium. Cells were transfected by incubation for 6 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE and 2 μg of cDNA per well. The cells were allowed to recover for about 48 h before loading with fura-2. Transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mm TES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and homogenized using an Ultra-turrax at 20,500 rpm for 10 s. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were then resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.014% bacitracin (binding buffer). Membranes were diluted in binding buffer to give a signal of 1,000–4,000 dpm/assay of specific radioligand binding. Binding assays were performed in a total volume of 0.5 ml with either [3H]BK, [3H]NPC17731, or [3H]des-Arg10-KD with or without varying concentrations of non-radioactive kinin peptides. After incubation for 60–90 min at room temperature, assays were terminated by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS, 0.3% BSA, and rapid vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters previously soaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. The trapped membranes were then washed with an additional 2 × 4 ml of ice-cold PBS, 0.3% BSA. The filters were then counted for radioactivity in a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. Binding constants were calculated using Radlig (Biosoft). We have shown previously that the above radioligands do not detect any endogenous B1 or B2 receptor in either naive or mock-transfected cells (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using a previously described protocol (17Mathis S.A. Criscimagna N.L. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-139PubMed Google Scholar), A10 smooth muscle cells transfected with various cDNAs were incubated in modified Leibovitz's L-15 medium at room temperature with 4 μm fura-2/AM. The fura-2-loaded cells were equilibrated to 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and stimulated by the addition of BK as noted in Fig. 4. The cytosolic free Ca2+ signal from individual cells was acquired and processed by an integrated digital imaging fluorescence microscopy system. Fura-2 was alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm, and the emissions were collected at 510 nm. The signals are presented in the figure as the ratio of bound/free Ca2+,F 340/F 380. We have shown previously that kinin agonists fail to elicit an intracellular Ca2+ signal in naive and mock-transfected A10 cells (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed essentially as described (18Tropea M.M. Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells grown in six-well dishes were incubated with 5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in DMEM, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C for 24 h in 10% CO2. Prior to experimentation, the cells were washed four times with 1 ml of Leibovitz's L-15 medium at room temperature and incubated in Leibovitz's L-15 medium, 50 mm LiCl for 30 min. Following replacement with 2 ml of the same medium, the cells were incubated with or without BK at 37 °C for 20 min. Inositol phosphates were then extracted and isolated using anion exchange chromatography. As shown in the diagrams in Fig.1 (A and B), TM-III of the human B1 and B2 BK receptor subtypes exhibit relatively low sequence homology (36%). Following the proposed numbering of residues in GPCR helices (1Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), an alignment of B1 and B2 receptor residues in a helical wheel diagram reveals that most of the conserved residues between B1 and B2 TM-III reside on the side facing the putative ligand binding pocket in these receptors, whereas the non-conserved residues face the membrane (Fig. 1 B). In order to test this orientation and to probe for residues in TM-III that contribute to agonist and antagonist binding in B1 and B2 receptors, we created a chimeric receptor construct in which a region of the B1 receptor encompassing TM-III and IC-II was substituted in the B2 receptor. The nomenclature used for this construct was B2(B1III). This construct was further modified by replacement of the single non-conserved residue in TM-III of B2(B1III) facing the putative ligand binding pocket, Lys111, with the corresponding WT B2 receptor residue, Ser111 (B2(B1IIIS111)). In the proposed helical wheel projection (1Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), these residues occupy position 9, approximately two turns into the helix of the B1 and B2 receptors (Fig.1B). Based on results from a previous study (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we also co-substituted B1 TM-VI, in which Tyr259 and Ala263 were replaced with the corresponding WT B2 receptor residues, Phe259 and Thr263, and B1 TM-III, in which Lys111 was replaced with Ser111, to make B2(B1IIIS111;VIF259,T263). As shown in Fig. 1 B, Phe(Tyr) and Thr(Ala) face the binding pocket approximately two turns and one turn into the TM-VI helix, respectively. The pharmacological and functional profiles of the WT and chimeric receptor constructs were determined by radioligand binding and by agonist-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in transfected HEK293 and A10 cells using a variety of subtype-selective kinin peptide agonists and antagonists (Table I).Table IAmino acid sequences of B1 and B2 bradykinin receptor ligandsLigandSequence1-aOic is l-[octahydroindol-2-yl-carbonyl];X = d-Hype(trans-propyl).Agonists BK Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg Des-Arg9-BK Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe Des-Arg10-KDLys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe KDLys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-ArgAntagonists NPC17731d-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-X -Oic-Arg NPC18565d-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-X -Oic1-a Oic is l-[octahydroindol-2-yl-carbonyl];X = d-Hype(trans-propyl). Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig.2, Scatchard analysis of saturation binding isotherms reveals that the human WT B2 receptor expressed in HEK293 cells was recognized with high affinity by B2-selective peptide ligands, including both the agonist [3H]BK and the antagonist [3H]NPC17731. The expressed receptor exhibited a pharmacological profile typical of a B2 receptor (TableII). Furthermore, the receptor was functionally active, as revealed by the high potency of BK to stimulate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in these cells (Fig.3). The human WT B2 receptor is also capable of mediating BK-stimulated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ as previously shown by us using transiently transfected A10 cells (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A.

UB, undetectable binding. Substitution of B1 TM-III/IC-II in the B2 receptor to make B2(B1III) resulted in a chimera that was not detected in radioligand binding assays by either [3H]BK or [3H]NPC17731 (Table II); nor did this substitution introduce a high affinity binding site for the B1-selective peptide agonist [3H]des-Arg10-KD. To evaluate if B2(B1III) could be expressed and properly folded in mammalian cells, the transfected HEK293 cells were assayed by BK-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 3, B2(B1III) was capable of mediating a BK response. However, the potency of BK to stimulate a response through this chimera was significantly less than that through the WT B2 receptor (Fig. 3). B2(B1III) transiently transfected into A10 cells also responded to a high concentration of BK (0.1 μm) with a large increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4). Mock-transfected cells did not respond to this agonist (Fig. 4). We conclude from these results that B2(B1III) is expressed and properly folded in mammalian cells and that substitution of B1 TM-III/IC-II in the B2 receptor reduces the affinities of both BK and NPC17731 below the level detectable by radioligand binding. Substitution of B1 TM-III/IC-II in the B2 receptor results in only one non-conserved change, Ser111 → Lys, among the residues in TM-III presumed to face the ligand binding pocket (Fig. 1 B). These residues are located at position 9, approximately two helical turns into TM-III. To assess if this change was responsible for the decrease in the affinities of the B2-selective ligands, we replaced Lys111 in B2(B1III) with the corresponding WT B2 receptor residue, Ser. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, this construct, B2(B1IIIS111), differing in only one amino acid from the B2(B1III) chimera, bound both BK and NPC17731 with affinities virtually identical to those for the WT B2 receptor. The gain of function of the chimera following this replacement was also observed in the increased potency of BK to stimulate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (Fig. 3). As the binding profile of a chimera in which B1 TM-III without B1 IC-II was substituted in the B2 receptor was identical to that of B2(B1III) containing B1 IC-II (data not shown), we have shown that B1 and B2 TM-III, although structurally only 36% identical, are distinguished pharmacologically by only a single residue. In addition to the single position in B1 TM-III, B2-selective peptide agonists are also discriminated against by two residues in B1 TM-VI (11Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 311-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, B1 TM-VI, which is also only 36% identical to its B2 receptor counterpart, becomes pharmacologically compatible with B2 TM-VI following the replacement of two residues in this domain in B2(B1VI), Tyr259 and Ala263, with those in the WT B2 receptor, which are Phe259 and Thr263. To verify the positions of these residues and their contributions to peptide selectivity, a double chimera (B2(B1IIIS111;VIF259,T263)) was made in which appropriately modified B1 TM-III and TM-VI were both substituted in the B2 receptor. This chimera retained the pharmacological profile of a WT B2 receptor (Fig. 2, Table II). Given the low level of sequence homology between human B1 and B2 receptors, these results also illustrate the structural compatibility of GPCR domains. The low affinities of B2-selective ligands for B2(B1III) may be caused either by the absence of the Ser or by the presence of the Lys at position 9. The importance of the hydroxyl group of Ser111 for high affinity BK and NPC17731 binding was evaluated by substituting Ala at this position (B2(B1IIIA111)). Table II shows that B2(B1IIIA111) retained high affinity binding of both BK and NPC17731. We conclude from the results using B2(B1IIIS111) and B2(B1IIIA111) that Ser111 in the WT B2 receptor probably does not directly interact with either class of B2-selective ligand and that a Lys at this position interferes with the binding of these ligands. Several other residues were substituted in position 9 in the B2(B1III) chimera to determine if Lys interfered with the binding of B2-selective ligands because of its size or because of its positive charge. The importance of the size of Lys was evaluated by substituting with two other residues of no or less charge but of comparable size, Met and His. B2(B1IIIM111) and B2(B1IIIH111) retained high affinity binding of both BK and NPC17731 (Table II). Thus, Lys is probably not interfering with BK and NPC17731 binding by size-exclusion. An Arg was substituted in this position (B2(B1IIIR111) to partially mimic the positive charge of Lys. Interestingly, the affinities of BK and NPC17731 for B2(B1IIIR111) were 6- and 12-fold lower, respectively, than those for B2(B1IIIS111) (Table II). Fig. 4 shows that B2(B1IIIR111) retained functional activity as determined by single cell Ca2+ imaging. These results indicate that the charge of Lys is responsible for the reduced affinities of BK and NPC17731 for B2(B1III). The relatively smaller inhibitory effect of Arg compared with Lys is most likely due to the partial aromatic character of the guanidinium group of the Arg side chain, which reduces the effect of the positive charge of this residue. Indeed, several studies have also shown that, in other receptors in which ligand binding is affected by the charge of Lys, Arg only partially mimics the effect of Lys (20Minami M. Nakagawa T. Seki T. Onogi T. Aoki Y. Katao Y. Katsumata S. Satoh M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee J.A. Brinkmann J.A. Longton E.D. Peishoff C.E. Lago M.A. Leber J.D. Cousins R.D. Gao A. Stadel J.M. Kumar C.S. Ohlstein E.H. Gleason J.G. Elliot J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14543-14549Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The above results indicate that position 9 in TM-III is oriented toward the binding pocket of these chimeras. In order to show that this orientation is not an artifact of the chimera, a Lys was also substituted in this position in the WT B2 receptor (B2K111). The affinity of NPC17731 for B2K111was 10-fold lower than that for the WT B2 receptor (Table II). In contrast, the affinity of this ligand for B2A111, in which an Ala was substituted at this position, was not significantly different from that of the WT B2 receptor (Table II). Lys substitution also interfered with BK binding, as observed by the 37-fold decrease in the affinity of this ligand (Table II). These results confirm the inward orientation of position 9 in the B2 receptor and the inhibitory effect on the binding of B2-selective ligands when this position is occupied by a positively charged residue such as Lys, as it is in the WT B1 receptor. B2-selective peptides contain two candidate residues that may be repelle"

Escherichia coli has two transporters for glucose (1Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1392-1406Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar,2Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They act by a mechanism that couples translocation with phosphorylation of the substrate. Both transporters are components of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69); IIAGlc, hydrophilic subunit of the glucose transporter; IICBGlc, transmembrane subunit of the glucose transporter; IIABMan, IICMan, IIDMan, subunits of the mannose transporter of the PTS; IICBAMtl, mannitol transporter of E. coli; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; αMG, α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69); IIAGlc, hydrophilic subunit of the glucose transporter; IICBGlc, transmembrane subunit of the glucose transporter; IIABMan, IICMan, IIDMan, subunits of the mannose transporter of the PTS; IICBAMtl, mannitol transporter of E. coli; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; αMG, α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside. The IIAGlc-IICBGlc complex is specific for glucose, the IIABMan-IICMan-IIDMan complex has a broad substrate specificity for Glc, Man, GlcNAc, and other derivatives of Glc altered at the C2 carbon. The PTS comprises two cytosolic proteins, enzyme I and HPr, which sequentially transfer phosphoryl groups from PEP to the different carbohydrate-specific transporters (enzymes II).

Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glucose transporter consists of two subunits IIAGlc and IICBGlc. IIAGlc is a 18-kDa hydrophilic protein that is phosphorylated at His-90 (14Dorschug M. Frank R. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 51-kDa IICBGlc subunit consists of two domains (15Erni B. Zanolari B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16398-16403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic domain (IIC, residues 1–∼380) spans the membrane eight times and contains the glucose binding site (16Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophilic domain (IIB, residues ∼380–477) is phosphorylated at Cys-421 (17Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoryl groups are transferred from HPr via His-90 of IIAGlc to Cys-421 and hence to glucose (18Erni B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The IIC and IIB domain are connected by an heptapeptide sequence that is highly conserved in those two- and three-domain transporters of the glucose family that have the domain order CB(A). A chimeric protein consisting of the IICGlc domain of the glucose transporter and the IIBAGlcNAc domain of the GlcNAc transporter is active and glucose-specific (19Hummel U. Nuoffer C. Zanolari B. Erni B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The IIC and IIB domains of IICBGlccan be expressed as separate polypeptides. The purified subclonal domains retain 2% of wild-type phosphotransferase activity when they are combined in vitro (20Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of the IIBGlc domain, its interaction with the IIAGlc subunit and the structural consequences of its phosphorylation at Cys-421 have been analyzed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A model of the transmembrane topology of the IIC domain has been derived from protein fusion studies and further confirmed by linker insertion mutagenesis (16Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2R. Beutler and B. Erni, unpublished results.2R. Beutler and B. Erni, unpublished results. Point mutants of IICBGlc have been selected that facilitate Glc transport uncoupled of phosphorylation (23Ruijter G.J. van Meurs G. Verwey M.A. Postma P.W. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2843-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and that retain glucose phosphorylation activity but have a strongly reduced translocation activity (24Buhr A. Daniels G.A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3847-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these mutations are located in the IIC domain, and none was found so far in the IIB domain.When the amino acid sequences of the transporters belonging to the glucose family are compared, several regions of strong amino acid similarity can be discerned (Fig. 1). One includes the active site Cys-421 which is phosphorylated by IIAGlc and donates the phosphoryl group to the transported glucose. Besides Cys-421, Arg-424, and Arg-426 are also invariant. They are the only invariant arginines in the transporters of the glucose family. Arginines are frequently found in phosphate-binding and phosphate-catalytic sites where they can stabilize phosphate through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with their guanidino group (25Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Here we characterize by Arg to Lys substitutions the functions of the two invariant arginines in the IIB domain. Surprisingly, the KTPGRED motif, the putative linker between the IIB and IIC domain, is also invariant. Although interdomain regions, linkers and hinges are enriched for residues such as alanines and prolines, glycines or glutamines (26Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27Wootton J.C. Drummond M.H. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar) their amino acid sequence is usually not conserved. Here we address the question of how important the residues of this heptapeptide are for the function of IICBGlc. A third conserved region surrounds the invariant His-212, which has once been proposed to be a potential phosphorylation site (28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar). Although it has been shown convincingly that a cysteine of the B domain and not the C domain is phosphorylated (17Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Pas H.H. Meyer G.H. Kruizinga W.H. Tamminga K.S. van Weeghel R.P. Robillard G.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5835-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the possible function of the highly conserved His-212 in the enzyme II components of the glucose family has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that this residue is essential for transport but not for phosphorylation activity.DISCUSSIONPoint mutations in three strongly conserved regions of the IICBGlc subunit of the glucose transporter were characterized with respect to their effect on protein phosphorylation, nonvectorial glucose phosphorylation, and transport activity. The first region of interest is the KTPGRED linker between the IIC and the IIB domains, which is predicted to assume a loop structure (38Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). The T383A and G385A substitutions reduced the activity to less than 10% of the control. Thr and Gly favor β-turn structures, whereas Ala favors α-helices. Substitution of these β-turn residues at the center of the hinge by Ala could lead to a stiffening of the linker with concomitant reduced domain mobility. The G385A mutation is less active than the two domains expressed as completely separated subunits (20Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the transposition of the B domain from the carboxyl-terminal to the amino-terminal end of the IIC domain. IIBCGlc with circularly permuted domains has 40–70% activity provided the two domains are linked via a flexible Ala Pro rich hinge peptide. 3R. Gutknecht and B. Erni, unpublished results. Pro is another residue that strongly favors β-turn structure. The P384G substitution reduced activity to 40%. Pro-384 could not be substituted by Ala for unknown reasons. It is likely that the KTPGRED linker acts as a hinge of precise but restricted mobility. In this respect it differs from the Ala Pro rich linkers, which serve as universal joints in many unrelated multidomain proteins including PTS proteins (26Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar, 40Wu L.F. Tomich J.M. Saier M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 687-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The KTPGRED sequence is highly conserved only in the two domain proteins with the domain order CB but is missing in the two-subunit complexes of the glucose family and in the transporters that have the circularly permuted domain order BC.His-211 and His-212 are conserved residues in the IIC domain, and Arg-424 and Arg-426 are two invariant residues immediately adjacent to the phosphorylation site of the IIB domain (Fig.6). His-211 is not essential for any of the known IICBGlc functions. In contrast His-212, Arg-424, and Arg-426 are essential for vectorial transport of glucose. Phosphoryl transfer from Cys-421 to glucose is completely blocked in the arginine mutants and slow in the H212Q mutant. A mutant with a similar phenotype as R424K and R426K was also found in the IIB domain of the IIABMan subunit of the structurally unrelated mannose transporter (41Gutknecht R. Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar). IIABMan R172Q can be phosphorlyated at His-175 but cannot donate the phosphoryl group to glucose. It is not clear what function Arg-424 and Arg-426 serve. In view of their proximity to the active site cysteine (Fig. 6) they could stabilize the phosphate in the bonded ground state or in the transition state during transfer from Cys-421 to Glc. Phosphotyrosine phosphatases, the second group of proteins that form phosphocysteine intermediates, provide strong evidence for such an interaction (42Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Their active sites contain a cysteine and an arginine, separated by five residues. X-ray structures of these proteins indicate that the invariant arginine stabilizes the transition state with three hydrogen bonds between the guanidino group and two phosphate oxygens (43Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, since neither the IIB domains of the mannitol transporter nor the IIB domain of the cellobiose transporter have invariant arginines near the active site cysteine (44Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), alternative functions like stabilization of the interaction between the IIB and IIC domains during transport and phosphorylation of glucose should also be considered. In this case it is likely that second site suppressor mutations in the IIC domain can be found. The tight phenotype of the two arginine mutations will facilitate the selection of these mutants.Figure 6Structure of the IIBGlcdomain. Stereoview of the backbone (N, Cα, C′ of residues 401–477) of 11 superimposed NMR structures with the side chain atoms of the active site Cys-421, Arg-424, and Arg-426 (Protein Data Base identification code 1IBA). The IIB domain consists of an antiparallel sheet with strand order β1β2β4β3 and three α-helices packed against one side of the β-sheet. The sequence of the secondary structure elements is α1β1β2α2β3β4α3. The active site is at the turn between β1 and β2 and the solvent-exposed face of β2.

This indicates that IICBGlc subunits cooperate in phosphoryltransfer from Cys-421 of one subunit to glucose bound to an intact IIC domain of the second subunit. Since IICBGlc is a dimer (18Erni B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) this phosphoryl transfer most likely occurs between domains on different subunits within the dimer. However, interdimer phosphoryl transfer cannot be excluded, because molecular subunit exchange between purified dimers has not been demonstrated for IICBGlc. Indeed, as determined by fluorescence energy transfer, 4B. Erni, unpublished observations. intersubunit exchange is very slow in the IIABMan dimer of the mannose transporter where the subunits are interwined through a swap of strands between the β-sheets of each subunit (45Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).His-195 and Gly-196 are two invariant residues in the members of the mannitol family of PTS transporters. Like His-212 of IICBGlc, His-195 of IICBAMtl was once considered as a potential phosphorylation site (46Saier Jr., M.H. Yamada M. Erni B. Suda K. Lengeler J. Ebner R. Argos P. Rak B. Schnetz K. Lee C.A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). His-212 and His-195 are located in the putative large cytoplasmic loop of their IIC domains (16Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). His-195 and Gly-196 of IICBAMtl have been mutagenized and characterized (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 49Boer H. Ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Weng Q.P. Elder J. Jacobson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like H212Q of IICBGlc, H195A and H195R of IICBAMtl were inactive but surprisingly could not be complemented with a C384S mutant (equivalent of the C421S mutant of IICBGlc) (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The H195N mutant on the other hand was active (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This indicates that His-195 of IICBAMtl and His-212 of IICBGlc are functionally nonequivalent despite their apparently similar position in the primary structure. In contrast, the G196D mutant, which had less than 0.1% of wild-type activity, could be complemented with the C384S mutation, indicating that the IIB domain can transfer its phosphoryl group to mannitol bound to the IIC domain (49Boer H. Ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Complementation between IIC and IIB as well as between IIB and IIA domains therefore appears to be a general property of the dimeric PTS transporters. Although complementation between sites on different domains is most probable (51Saraceni-Richards C.A. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5171-5177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), noncomplementation between sites on different domains (36Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as complementation between sites on the same domain have both also been observed (36Stolz B. Huber M.

The three-dimensional structure of the IIBGlc domain, its interaction with the IIAGlc subunit and the structural consequences of its phosphorylation at Cys-421 have been analyzed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A model of the transmembrane topology of the IIC domain has been derived from protein fusion studies and further confirmed by linker insertion mutagenesis (16Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2R. Beutler and B. Erni, unpublished results.2R. Beutler and B. Erni, unpublished results. Point mutants of IICBGlc have been selected that facilitate Glc transport uncoupled of phosphorylation (23Ruijter G.J. van Meurs G. Verwey M.A. Postma P.W. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2843-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and that retain glucose phosphorylation activity but have a strongly reduced translocation activity (24Buhr A. Daniels G.A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3847-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these mutations are located in the IIC domain, and none was found so far in the IIB domain. When the amino acid sequences of the transporters belonging to the glucose family are compared, several regions of strong amino acid similarity can be discerned (Fig. 1). One includes the active site Cys-421 which is phosphorylated by IIAGlc and donates the phosphoryl group to the transported glucose. Besides Cys-421, Arg-424, and Arg-426 are also invariant. They are the only invariant arginines in the transporters of the glucose family. Arginines are frequently found in phosphate-binding and phosphate-catalytic sites where they can stabilize phosphate through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with their guanidino group (25Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Here we characterize by Arg to Lys substitutions the functions of the two invariant arginines in the IIB domain. Surprisingly, the KTPGRED motif, the putative linker between the IIB and IIC domain, is also invariant. Although interdomain regions, linkers and hinges are enriched for residues such as alanines and prolines, glycines or glutamines (26Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27Wootton J.C. Drummond M.H. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar) their amino acid sequence is usually not conserved. Here we address the question of how important the residues of this heptapeptide are for the function of IICBGlc. A third conserved region surrounds the invariant His-212, which has once been proposed to be a potential phosphorylation site (28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar). Although it has been shown convincingly that a cysteine of the B domain and not the C domain is phosphorylated (17Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Pas H.H. Meyer G.H. Kruizinga W.H. Tamminga K.S. van Weeghel R.P. Robillard G.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5835-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the possible function of the highly conserved His-212 in the enzyme II components of the glucose family has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that this residue is essential for transport but not for phosphorylation activity. DISCUSSIONPoint mutations in three strongly conserved regions of the IICBGlc subunit of the glucose transporter were characterized with respect to their effect on protein phosphorylation, nonvectorial glucose phosphorylation, and transport activity. The first region of interest is the KTPGRED linker between the IIC and the IIB domains, which is predicted to assume a loop structure (38Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). The T383A and G385A substitutions reduced the activity to less than 10% of the control. Thr and Gly favor β-turn structures, whereas Ala favors α-helices. Substitution of these β-turn residues at the center of the hinge by Ala could lead to a stiffening of the linker with concomitant reduced domain mobility. The G385A mutation is less active than the two domains expressed as completely separated subunits (20Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the transposition of the B domain from the carboxyl-terminal to the amino-terminal end of the IIC domain. IIBCGlc with circularly permuted domains has 40–70% activity provided the two domains are linked via a flexible Ala Pro rich hinge peptide. 3R. Gutknecht and B. Erni, unpublished results. Pro is another residue that strongly favors β-turn structure. The P384G substitution reduced activity to 40%. Pro-384 could not be substituted by Ala for unknown reasons. It is likely that the KTPGRED linker acts as a hinge of precise but restricted mobility. In this respect it differs from the Ala Pro rich linkers, which serve as universal joints in many unrelated multidomain proteins including PTS proteins (26Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 28Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar, 40Wu L.F. Tomich J.M. Saier M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 687-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The KTPGRED sequence is highly conserved only in the two domain proteins with the domain order CB but is missing in the two-subunit complexes of the glucose family and in the transporters that have the circularly permuted domain order BC.His-211 and His-212 are conserved residues in the IIC domain, and Arg-424 and Arg-426 are two invariant residues immediately adjacent to the phosphorylation site of the IIB domain (Fig.6). His-211 is not essential for any of the known IICBGlc functions. In contrast His-212, Arg-424, and Arg-426 are essential for vectorial transport of glucose. Phosphoryl transfer from Cys-421 to glucose is completely blocked in the arginine mutants and slow in the H212Q mutant. A mutant with a similar phenotype as R424K and R426K was also found in the IIB domain of the IIABMan subunit of the structurally unrelated mannose transporter (41Gutknecht R. Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar). IIABMan R172Q can be phosphorlyated at His-175 but cannot donate the phosphoryl group to glucose. It is not clear what function Arg-424 and Arg-426 serve. In view of their proximity to the active site cysteine (Fig. 6) they could stabilize the phosphate in the bonded ground state or in the transition state during transfer from Cys-421 to Glc. Phosphotyrosine phosphatases, the second group of proteins that form phosphocysteine intermediates, provide strong evidence for such an interaction (42Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Their active sites contain a cysteine and an arginine, separated by five residues. X-ray structures of these proteins indicate that the invariant arginine stabilizes the transition state with three hydrogen bonds between the guanidino group and two phosphate oxygens (43Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, since neither the IIB domains of the mannitol transporter nor the IIB domain of the cellobiose transporter have invariant arginines near the active site cysteine (44Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), alternative functions like stabilization of the interaction between the IIB and IIC domains during transport and phosphorylation of glucose should also be considered. In this case it is likely that second site suppressor mutations in the IIC domain can be found. The tight phenotype of the two arginine mutations will facilitate the selection of these mutants.Transport activity is partially restored when H212Q and C421S are expressed together, and phosphotransferase activity is restored when purified H212Q is mixed with either R424K or R426K. This indicates that IICBGlc subunits cooperate in phosphoryltransfer from Cys-421 of one subunit to glucose bound to an intact IIC domain of the second subunit. Since IICBGlc is a dimer (18Erni B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) this phosphoryl transfer most likely occurs between domains on different subunits within the dimer. However, interdimer phosphoryl transfer cannot be excluded, because molecular subunit exchange between purified dimers has not been demonstrated for IICBGlc. Indeed, as determined by fluorescence energy transfer, 4B. Erni, unpublished observations. intersubunit exchange is very slow in the IIABMan dimer of the mannose transporter where the subunits are interwined through a swap of strands between the β-sheets of each subunit (45Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).His-195 and Gly-196 are two invariant residues in the members of the mannitol family of PTS transporters. Like His-212 of IICBGlc, His-195 of IICBAMtl was once considered as a potential phosphorylation site (46Saier Jr., M.H. Yamada M. Erni B. Suda K. Lengeler J. Ebner R. Argos P. Rak B. Schnetz K. Lee C.A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). His-212 and His-195 are located in the putative large cytoplasmic loop of their IIC domains (16Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). His-195 and Gly-196 of IICBAMtl have been mutagenized and characterized (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 49Boer H. Ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T.

Like H212Q of IICBGlc, H195A and H195R of IICBAMtl were inactive but surprisingly could not be complemented with a C384S mutant (equivalent of the C421S mutant of IICBGlc) (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The H195N mutant on the other hand was active (48Weng Q.P. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This indicates that His-195 of IICBAMtl and His-212 of IICBGlc are functionally nonequivalent despite their apparently similar position in the primary structure. In contrast, the G196D mutant, which had less than 0.1% of wild-type activity, could be complemented with the C384S mutation, indicating that the IIB domain can transfer its phosphoryl group to mannitol bound to the IIC domain (49Boer H. Ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Complementation between IIC and IIB as well as between IIB and IIA domains therefore appears to be a general property of the dimeric PTS transporters. Although complementation between sites on different domains is most probable (51Saraceni-Richards C.A. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5171-5177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), noncomplementation between sites on different domains (36Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2046513791,"A number of cytokines have been shown to alter the function of pancreatic β-cells and thus might be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. Interferon-β (IFN-β) expression is induced in epithelial cells by several viruses, and it has been detected in islets of type 1 diabetic patients. Here we show that treatment of isolated mouse islets with this cytokine was able to alter insulin secretion in vitro. To study whether IFN-β alters β-cell function in vivo and leads to diabetes, we have developed transgenic mice (C57BL6/SJL) expressing IFN-β in β-cells. These mice showed functional alterations in islets and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transgenic animals presented mild hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and altered glucose tolerance test, all features of a prediabetic state. However, they developed overt diabetes, with lymphocytic infiltration of the islets, when treated with low doses of streptozotocin, which did not induce diabetes in control mice. In addition, about 9% of the transgenic mice obtained from the N3 back-cross to outbred albino CD-1 mice spontaneously developed severe hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia and showed mononuclear infiltration of the islets. These results suggest that IFN-β may be involved in the onset of type 1 diabetes when combined with either an additional factor or a susceptible genetic background.

These results suggest that IFN-β may be involved in the onset of type 1 diabetes when combined with either an additional factor or a susceptible genetic background. Despite an immense research effort, the etiology of type 1 diabetes has not been elucidated. It has been proposed that type 1 diabetes is caused by nongenetic factors, probably environmental, operating in a genetically susceptible host to initiate a β-cell-destructive immune process (1Tisch R. McDevitt H. Cell. 1996; 85: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2Castano L. Eisenbarth G.S. Annu. Rev.

These environmental factors, such as viral infections, may operate over a limited period to induce the immune process (4David R. Leslie G. Elliot R.B. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 843-850PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, there is a long prodrome before the onset of clinical diabetes during which clinical, immunulogic, and metabolic changes can be detected in the β-cells (4David R. Leslie G. Elliot R.B. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 843-850PubMed Google Scholar). During the prediabetic period, a decline in the insulin secretion as well as impaired glucose tolerance can be detected several years before the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes (5Srikanta S. Ganda O.P. Jackson R.A. Gleeson R.E. Kaldany A. Garovoy M.R. Milford E.L. Carpenter C.B. Soeldner J.S. Eisenbarth G.S. Ann. Intern. Med. 1983; 99: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beer S.F.

Thus, alterations in β-cell function might be a previous step to the development of diabetes mellitus. Cytokines are hormone-like peptides mainly used by immune system cells to control local and systemic events of immune and inflammatory responses (7Bernton E.W. Beach J.E. Holaday J.W. Smallridge R.C.

Studies in vitro have demonstrated that certain cytokines, such as IL-1, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; RIP-I, rat insulin I promoter; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); RT-PCR; reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RIA, radioimmunoassay; MLDS, multiple low doses of streptozotocin.1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; RIP-I, rat insulin I promoter; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); RT-PCR; reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RIA, radioimmunoassay; MLDS, multiple low doses of streptozotocin. tumor necrosis factor-α, or IFN-γ (10Eizirik D.L.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 2325-2329PubMed Google Scholar), can be cytotoxic to pancreatic β-cells, inhibiting insulin secretion. Furthermore, when combined, these cytokines can destroy β-cells (12Campbell I.L. Iscaro A. Harrison L.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2325-2329PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these cytokines have been found in the pancreatic insulitis lesion of NOD mice (13Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W. Sorensen O. Bleackley R.C. Power R.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4874-4882PubMed Google Scholar) and BB rats (14Jiang Z. Woda B.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2990-2994PubMed Google Scholar), and they may thus be considered mediators of β-cell damage in type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing IFN-γ in pancreatic β-cells show lymphocytic infiltration of the islets by mononuclear cells, β-cell destruction, and diabetes (15Sarvetnick N. Liggitt D. Pitts S.L. Hansen S.E. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar,16Sarvetnick N. Shizuru J. Liggitt D. Martin L. McIntyre B. Gregory A. Parslow T. Stewart T. Nature. 1990; 346: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, of all the cytokines that may be involved in the development of the diabetic process, only a few can be produced by normal epithelial cells, such as pancreatic β-cells. Type I interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines involved in host defenses against viral infections that can be produced by most cell types in response to a virus (17Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are three families of type I IFNs, α, β, and ω, that are closely related structurally. These IFNs also bind to a common receptor and have potent antiviral activities (17Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated IFN-α in the development of type 1 diabetes. This cytokine can be detected in the islets of newly diagnosed patients of type 1 diabetes (19Somoza N. Vargas F. Roura-Mir C. Vives-Pi M. Fernandez- Figueras M.T. Ariza A. Gomis R. Bragado R. Martı́ M. Jaraquemada D. Pujol-Borrell R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1360-1377PubMed Google Scholar, 20Foulis A.K. Farquharson M.A. Meager A. Lancet. 1987; 2: 1423-1427Abstract PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, IFN-α can induce the expression of MHC class I antigens in pancreatic β-cells (21Pujol-Borrell R. Todd I. Doshi M. Gray D. Feldman M. Bottazzo G.F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1986; 65: 128-139PubMed Google Scholar), and it can lead to diabetes when expressed in islets of transgenic mice (22Stewart T.A. Hultgren B. Huang X. Pitts-Meek S. Hully J. MacLachlan N.J. Science. 1993; 260: 1942-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Similar to IFN-α, IFN-β has immunomodulatory properties, it induces MHC class I antigen expression (23Witt P.L. Storer B.E. Bryan G.T. Brown R.R. Flashner M. Larocca A.T. Colby C.B. Borden E.C. J. Immunother. 1993; 13: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Offermann M.K. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and it has also been detected in newly diagnosed patients of type 1 diabetes (19Somoza N. Vargas F. Roura-Mir C. Vives-Pi M. Fernandez- Figueras M.T. Ariza A. Gomis R. Bragado R. Martı́ M. Jaraquemada D. Pujol-Borrell R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1360-1377PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of IFN-β in the development of type 1 diabetes. Here we studied whether IFN-β may lead to type 1 diabetes. To this end, we developed transgenic mice expressing IFN-β in β-cells. These mice presented impaired β-cell function, hypoinsulinemia, and altered glucose tolerance test, but they did not develop overt type 1 diabetes. However, transgenic mice treated with multiple low doses of streptozotocin or back-crossed to a CD-1 strain developed overt diabetes, with marked hyperglycemia and lymphocytic infiltration of the islets. To obtain the RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene aSacI-BamHI fragment (−570 bp to +3 bp) of the rat insulin I promoter (RIP-I) (25Dandoy-Dron F. Monthioux E. Jami J. Buchinni D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was linked to aTaqI-TaqI fragment (+302 bp to +1140 bp) of the human IFN-β gene, which contains the entire coding sequence and the polyadenylation signal (26Zinn K. Mellon P. Ptashne M. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The construction of the RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene was initiated by subcloning theSacI-BamHI fragment of the RIP-I at the same sites of the BluescriptR polylinker. Afterward, theTaqI-TaqI fragment of the IFN-β was introduced at the ClaI site of the polylinker. A 1.3-kbSacI-XhoI fragment, containing the entire RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene, was microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs from a C57Bl6/SJL background. The general procedures used for microinjection of the RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene were as described elsewhere (27Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 497Google Scholar). At 3 weeks of age, the animals were tested for the presence of the transgene by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (10 μg) digested with BglII. The RIP-I/IFN-β construct contains a unique BglII site at the end of the IFN-β gene. Blots were hybridized with the 1.3-kb SacI- XhoI fragment containing the entire RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene, radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP ((3000 Ci/mmol), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random oligopriming (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). A 1.3-kb fragment was produced by the restriction ofBglII at the site of an RIP-I/IFN-β molecule and at the site of a second molecule of the chimeric gene, inserted in the genome in a head-to-tail manner (data not shown). In the experiments described below, heterozygous male mice aged 2 to 3 months were used. However, similar results were obtained in animals more than 6 months old. Transgenic mice expressing the chimeric gene RIP/IFN-β with a C57Bl6/SJL genetic background were also back-crossed to CD-1 mice (Charles River), and N1 to N3 generations were analyzed. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard diet (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and kept under a light-dark cycle of 12 h (lights on at 8 a.m.). When stated, mice were fed high carbohydrate diet (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Cleveland, OH) and waterad libitum for 1 week. This diet contained 80.5% sucrose, 10.2% casein, 0.3% dl-methionine, 4% cottonseed oil, 2% brewers' yeast, and 2% AIN mineral mix plus 1% AIN vitamin mix. Animals were killed and samples were taken between 9 and 10 a.m. When stated, transgenic mice of both C57Bl6/SJL and CD-1 genetic background were given, on 5 consecutive days, an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg), dissolved in 0.1 mcitrate buffer (pH 4.5) immediately before administration. Control mice were injected only with the citrate buffer. Diabetes was assessed by measuring blood glucose levels. Islets were isolated from the pancreas of control or transgenic mice fed a standard or a high carbohydrate diet. Islets were released from pancreatic acinar tissues by digestion with collagenase P (Boehringer Mannheim) (28Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Islets were collected by handpicking under a dissection microscope. For in vitro studies, islets from control mice were cultured free-floating in groups of 150–200 in plastic Petri dishes containing RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Experiments were initiated 24 h after culture, by placing islets in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum in the absence or in the presence of either murine (103 units/ml) or human (106 units/ml) IFN-β. After 3 days of treatment with the cytokines, insulin secretion by these islets was determined. To study the expression of the transgene, total RNA was obtained from pancreas by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (29Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar), and RNA samples (30 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. Northern blot was hybridized to a 32P-labeled 0.8-kbEcoRI-XhoI fragment of the IFN-β gene. The β-actin probe corresponded to a 1.3-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of the rabbit cDNA. To analyze the expression of the β2-microglobulin, RNA was obtained from islets cultured in the presence of IFN-β or from islets of transgenic mice using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform procedure (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA samples were treated with DNase for 30 min at 37 °C, extracted with a phenol/chloroform mixture, and precipitated with ethanol. cDNA synthesis was carried out using 50 ng of total RNA at 42 °C for 60 min in a reaction volume of 20 μl. The cDNA was then used for PCR co-amplification of β2-microglobulin and β-actin with the following temperature program: 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 40 cycles. The primer pair used for β2-microglobulin (sense, 5′-GTATACTCACGGATCCCACCGGAGA-3′, and antisense 5′-CATGTCTCGATCCCAGTAGACGG-3′) yielded a 272-bp PCR product. The primer pair used for β-actin (sense 5′-CATCGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCAC-3′, and antisense 5′-CCGGCCAGCCAGGTCCAGACGC-3′) yielded a 451-bp PCR product. The co-amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized following staining with ethidium bromide. Western blot analysis was performed by standard procedures (31Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 8.10.1-8.10.5Google Scholar) from total cellular lysates of islets. Islets were disrupted in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 80 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by sonication. Twenty μg of protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect IFN-β a rabbit antiserum to human IFN-β (Biogenesis, Bournemouth, UK), diluted at 1:1000, was used. For immunohistochemical detection of IFN-β and insulin, sections of pancreas from control and transgenic mice were fixed for 12 to 24 h in Carnoy's reagent, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were then incubated with a rabbit anti-human IFN-β antibody (Biogenesis), diluted at 1:100, or with a guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), at 1:100 dilution, overnight at 4 °C. As secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin G coupled to peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used. The 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate chromogen. Sections were counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin. For histologic analysis, sections of pancreas were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Batches of six islets were incubated in a shaking water bath for 90 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of bicarbonate-buffered salt solution containing bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml, fraction V, Sigma) supplemented with 2.8 or 16.7 mmglucose, with 2.8 mm glucose together with either 10 mm leucine plus 10 mm glutamine or 10 mm arginine, or with 16.7 mm glucose plus 5 μm forskolin. At the beginning of the treatments, vials were gassed with O2:CO2 (95:5%) for 10 min. At the end of the incubation period supernatants were stored at −20 °C until the insulin was assayed by RIA (CIS, Biointernational, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). The method allows the determination of 2.5 milliunits of insulin/ml, with a coefficient of variation within and between assays of 6 and 8%, respectively. For cAMP measurements, islets were incubated in groups of 30 for 15 min at 37 °C in Hanks' medium (136 mm NaCl, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.35 mm Na2HPO4, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, and 4.2 mmNaHCO3) containing 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose plus 5 μm forskolin. The incubation was stopped by adding 6% trichloroacetic acid, and islets were frozen and stored at −80 °C, pending analysis. The samples were thawed by sonication on ice and centrifuged at 2000 ×g (4 °C) for 15 min. The pellet was re-sonicated in 200 μl of water and used to measure islet cell DNA content. The supernatant was washed 4 times in 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether. The aqueous extract was freeze-dried, and the cAMP content was measured by RIA (using 125I-cAMP) as described by the manufacturer of the assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, samples were acetylated. Insulin levels in serum samples were determined by RIA (CIS, Biointernational, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Serum glucose concentration was measured enzymatically (GlucoquantR, Boehringer Mannheim). Glucose levels were also determined in blood by using a GlucometerR analyzer (Bayer, Germany). Serum triglycerides were determined enzymatically (GPO-PAP, Boehringer Mannheim). The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed between 10 and 11 a.m. in fed control and transgenic mice. After anesthetizing the mice with avertin, a blood sample was obtained from the tail vein to measure the basal level of glucose. Mice were subsequently given an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of glucose per g of body weight. Blood samples (5 μl) were obtained at different times from the same animals, and the levels of glucose were determined. All values are expressed as the mean ± 1 S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student-Newmann-Keuls test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. In this study we examined the role of IFN-β in the diabetic process. Since alteration in β-cell function might precede the development of type 1 diabetes, we first analyzed the effect of this cytokine in vitro. Mouse islets were cultured in the presence of either mouse (103units/ml) or human (106 units/ml) IFN-β to determine the effect of these cytokines on insulin secretion. The concentration of the human IFN-β used was 1000 times that of the mouse to overcome the species specificity (32Chen X.Z. Yun J.S. Wagner T.E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither mouse nor human IFN-β caused morphologic changes in the islets at the concentrations used (data not shown). To determine the biologic activity of IFN-β in the pancreatic islets, the expression of β2-microglobulin was analyzed by RT-PCR in islets treated with either mouse or human IFN-β. The β2-microglobulin and MHC class I heavy chains complex at the cell surface to form the intact MHC class I antigen (33Hood L. Steinmetz M. Malissen B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1983; 1: 529-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and their expression is often coordinately regulated (34Lonergan M. Dey A. Becker K.G. Drew P.D. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6629-6639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mouse and human IFN-β induced the expression of β2-microglobulin after 3 days of culture, while islets cultured in the absence of IFNs showed very low levels of β2-microglobulin mRNA (Fig.1), suggesting an up-regulation of MHC class I antigen by IFN-β. The effect of the islet exposure to IFN-β on glucose-induced insulin secretion was next studied. Islets cultured for 3 days in the presence of either mouse or human cytokine were incubated for 90 min in the presence of 2.8 or 16.7 mmglucose. At low glucose concentration, insulin levels in the incubation medium of islets treated with IFN-β were lower than those of non-treated islets (Table I). When control islets were incubated in the presence of 16.7 mmglucose, a 3-fold increase in insulin secretion was noted. Although islets treated with either mouse or human IFN-β showed an increase in insulin secretion at high glucose, a marked reduction (about 50 and 40%, respectively) of the insulin concentration in the incubation medium of these islets compared with non-treated islets was detected (Table I). When islets were incubated in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose plus 5 μm forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, non-cytokine-treated islets showed a 4-fold increase in the insulin release over control islets incubated with glucose alone (Table I). In contrast, when incubated with glucose plus forskolin the level of insulin in the incubation medium of IFN-β-treated islets was 60% lower than that of control islets (Table I). Thus, these results indicated that IFN-β was able to alter β-cell function in vitro.Table IEffect of IFN-β in pancreatic islets insulin secretionCulture treatmentInsulin released (ng/islet/90 min)2.8 mm glucose16.7 mm glucose16.7 mm glucose + 5 μm forskolinNo treatment1.4 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.517.4 ± 1.4mIFN-β0.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 versus nontreated islets.2.1 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 versus nontreated islets.7.1 ± 1.0bp < 0.01 versus nontreated islets.hIFN-β1.0 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 versus nontreated islets.2.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 versus nontreated islets.7.1 ± 0.8bp < 0.01 versus nontreated islets.a p < 0.05 versus nontreated islets.b p < 0.01 versus nontreated islets. Open table in a new tab To study the potential role of IFN-β in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, we developed a transgenic animal model that expresses IFN-β specifically in pancreatic β-cells. IFNs are species-specific. However, to avoid the male sterility observed in mice expressing high levels of mouse IFN-β (35Iwakura Y. Asano M. Nishimune Y. Kawade Y. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3757-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the use of the human IFN-β gene was considered to be more appropriate in transgenic mice. Human IFN-β is active in mouse cells (36Derynck R. Remaut E. Saman E. Stanssens P. DeClercq E. Content J. Fiers W. Nature. 1980; 287: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Gillespie G. Carter W.A. Tex. Rep. Biol. Med. 1981; 41: 37-42PubMed Google Scholar, 38McCallagh K.G. Davis J.A. Sim I.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), although its efficacy was about 1000 times lower than that of mouse IFN-β. Furthermore, here we showed that human IFN-β exerted a clear biologic effect in mouse islets, suggesting that it might be used instead of mouse cytokine. Thus, transgenic animals that expressed human IFN-β in β-cells, under control of the rat insulin-I promoter (RIP-I/IFN-β), were developed to examine the effect of IFN-β in vivo. The RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene was microinjected into fertilized eggs, and four transgenic mice were obtained. In this study, we used F1 and F2 heterozygote mice from the transgenic lines RIP-I/IFN-β28 (TgIFN-β-28) and RIP-I/IFN-β56 (TgIFN-β-56). TgIFN-β-28 and TgIFN-β-56 carried about 5 and 20 intact copies, respectively, of the RIP-I/IFN-β chimeric gene when analyzed by Southern blot (data not shown). We used littermates as controls for the transgenic animals. A transcript that hybridized with the IFN-β probe was detected when total RNA obtained from the pancreas of transgenic mice was analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 2 A). Although these lines of transgenic mice had integrated different number of copies of the transgene, similar levels of IFN-β mRNA were noted in the pancreas of both TgIFN-β-28 and TgIFN-β-56, probably as a result of the site of integration in the genome. Nevertheless, no IFN-β mRNA was detected in the pancreas from control animals (Fig. 2 A). No expression of the transgene was detected in other tissues examined, like liver and kidney (data not shown). Mice were fed a high carbohydrate diet for 1 week, to induce the expression of the transgene, and afterward islets were obtained and IFN-β protein was analyzed by Western blot. The expression of IFN-β was parallel to the presence of IFN-β protein in islets from transgenic mice, whereas no immunodetectable IFN-β was noted in control islets (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, after immunohistochemical analysis human IFN-β was also detected in insulin-producing cells of islets from transgenic mice fed a standard diet (Fig.3 B). However, the expression of IFN-β protein was variegated, probably resulting from differences in the level of expression of the transgene in the various β-cells within the islet. Similar results were obtained in both TgIFN-β-28 and TgIFN-β-56 mice. No IFN-β immunostaining was observed in islets from control mice (Fig. 3 A). Islets from both control and transgenic mice showed similar insulin immunoreactivity (Fig. 3,C and D). All these results indicate that high levels of IFN-β were produced in the β-cells of transgenic mice. The expression of the transgene did not cause islet lesions, even in older mice (data not shown).Figure 3Immunohistochemical analysis of IFN-β and insulin expression in islets from control and transgenic mice.

The levels of β2-microglobulin mRNA in islets from control mice were very low. However, islets from both TgIFN-β-28 and TgIFN-β-56 showed a high induction (about 5-fold) in the expression of β2-microglobulin mRNA (Fig. 1). These results suggested that human IFN-β produced by the β-cells might induce MHC class I antigen in islets of transgenic mice. The results described below were obtained from the TgIFN-β-28 line. However, a similar phenotype was observed in the TgIFN-β-56 animals. To discern whether the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells from the transgenic mice was altered, islets from control and transgenic mice were isolated, and the insulin release in response to 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose was measured (Fig.4 A). Although at both glucose concentrations islets from transgenic mice secreted less insulin than islets from non-transgenic animals, the reduction was higher (about 60%) at 16.7 mm glucose. The concentration of insulin in the medium of islets from transgenic animals incubated with 16.7 mm glucose was similar to that released by islets from control animals incubated with 2.8 mm glucose (Fig.4 A). When amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion was studied no decrease was detected in islets from transgenic mice compared with control mice. Isolated islets cultured in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose together with 10 mm leucine plus 10 mm glutamine or with 10 mm arginine, released more insulin (about 50 and 25% increase, respectively) than islets from control animals (Fig. 4 B). Thus, stimulation with leucine plus glutamine and with arginine counteracted the IFN-β-induced reduction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. When insulin secretion was studied in islets incubated in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose plus 5 μm forskolin, islets from control mice showed a 3-fold increase in the insulin release compared with control islets incubated only in the presence of glucose (Fig. 4 A). A similar induction in insulin secretion (about 3-fold) was also observed when transgenic islets were incubated with forskolin and 16.7 mm glucose. H"
https://openalex.org/W2020093222,"A combined isotopic steady state and in vivo isotopic non-steady state analysis was used to calculate tricarboxylic acid cycle flux in livers of anesthetized rats infused with ethanol. In vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy was used to non-invasively observe label turnover of [4-13C]glutamate, [4-13C]glutamine, and [2-13C]glutamate/glutamine in liver following a bolus intravenous infusion of [2-13C]ethanol. The isotopic steady state analysis of [2-13C], [3-13C], and [4-13C]glutamate isotopomers (Malloy, C. R., Sherry, A. D., and Jeffrey, F. M. H. (1988)J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6964–6971) in liver extracts was used to indirectly calculate the anaplerotic flux (0.90 ± 0.07 × citrate synthase flux) and [2-13C]acetyl-CoA fractional enrichment (51.4 ± 3.4%). The [4-13C]glutamate, [4-13C]glutamine, and [2-13C]glutamate fractional enrichments determined in liver extracts were 23.0 ± 1.1, 17.2 ± 1.5, and 7.7 ± 0.5%, respectively. These data in addition to blood [2-13C]acetate and [4-13C]glutamine enrichment time course data were used in conjunction with a metabolic steady state mathematical analysis designed to account for liver glutamate and glutamine label dilution as a consequence of glutamine exchange with blood to calculate the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle flux (V tca = 0.33 ± 0.09 μmol/g wet weight/min) in liver.In summary, It is possible to detect 13C labeling of glutamate and glutamine in liver via non-invasive 13C NMR. Additionally, the in vivo 13C labeling kinetics of glutamate and glutamine in liver and glutamine in blood may be used to calculate the liver tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. A combined isotopic steady state and in vivo isotopic non-steady state analysis was used to calculate tricarboxylic acid cycle flux in livers of anesthetized rats infused with ethanol. In vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy was used to non-invasively observe label turnover of [4-13C]glutamate, [4-13C]glutamine, and [2-13C]glutamate/glutamine in liver following a bolus intravenous infusion of [2-13C]ethanol. The isotopic steady state analysis of [2-13C], [3-13C], and [4-13C]glutamate isotopomers (Malloy, C. R., Sherry, A. D., and Jeffrey, F. M. H. (1988)J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6964–6971) in liver extracts was used to indirectly calculate the anaplerotic flux (0.90 ± 0.07 × citrate synthase flux) and [2-13C]acetyl-CoA fractional enrichment (51.4 ± 3.4%). The [4-13C]glutamate, [4-13C]glutamine, and [2-13C]glutamate fractional enrichments determined in liver extracts were 23.0 ± 1.1, 17.2 ± 1.5, and 7.7 ± 0.5%, respectively. These data in addition to blood [2-13C]acetate and [4-13C]glutamine enrichment time course data were used in conjunction with a metabolic steady state mathematical analysis designed to account for liver glutamate and glutamine label dilution as a consequence of glutamine exchange with blood to calculate the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle flux (V tca = 0.33 ± 0.09 μmol/g wet weight/min) in liver. In summary, It is possible to detect 13C labeling of glutamate and glutamine in liver via non-invasive 13C NMR. Additionally, the in vivo 13C labeling kinetics of glutamate and glutamine in liver and glutamine in blood may be used to calculate the liver tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. In liver, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not only coupled to mitochondrial energy production but also provides substrates for gluconeogenesis and other metabolic pathways. Therefore, in order to quantify the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux from the labeling kinetics of glutamate and glutamine in vivo, the influx/efflux of labeled substrates coupled to the tricarboxylic acid cycle must be included in the mathematical analysis. Tricarboxylic acid cycle flux measurements in hepatocyte preparations have previously been made using a variety of substrates (1Rabkin M. Blum J.J. Biochem J. 1984; 225: 761-786Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and more recently measurements of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in perfused liver have been made using an isotopomer steady state analysis (2Beylot M.

Although thesein vivo methods provide relative flux information on a number of metabolic pathways in liver, they lack the ability to calculate absolute fluxes unless the absolute flux of one pathway is known. This is possible in perfused systems but may be difficult in the whole body. In vivo kinetic measurements of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity have been made non-invasively in brain (5Fitzpatrick S.M. Hetherington H.P. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7999-8008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using a variety of mathematical models. In kinetic experiments of glutamate isotope labeling in brain, label dilution of the brain glutamate/glutamine pool via exchange with the blood glutamate/glutamine pool is limited by the blood-brain barrier (14Bradbury M.W. Exp. Physiol. 1993; 78: 453-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux has been calculated from the brain [4-13C]glutamate/glutamine turnover data using a linear metabolic pathway analysis (5Fitzpatrick S.M. Hetherington H.P. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 13Mason G.F. Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) in which to a first approximation the exchange with blood metabolite pools is neglected. However in liver, glutamine is in active exchange with blood causing label dilution of the liver glutamate and glutamine pool (15Katz J. Wals P. Lee W-N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25509-25521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus in order to calculate the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux in the liver usingin vivo NMR measurements of 13C label turnover in glutamate and glutamine, the mathematical analysis must incorporate labeled liver glutamine exchange with blood. [2-13C]Ethanol was used as the labeled precursor in this study, because its metabolism is localized in the liver, and the decreased redox state (NAD+/NADH) associated with ethanol metabolism significantly reduces FFA 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; Glu, glutamate; GlnB, blood glutamine; Gln, glutamine; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA, Lac, lactate; Pyr, pyruvate; Acet, acetate; Asp, aspartate; Oaa, oxaloacetate; Cit, citrate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; FE, fractional enrichment; EtOH, ethanol; RF, radio frequency. oxidation in the liver thereby limiting label dilution of the [2-13C]acetyl-CoA pool (Fig. 1). The present study demonstrates that in vivo 13C NMR detection of glutamate and glutamine turnover in the liver can be achieved non-invasively and that a quantitative metabolic steady state analysis used to calculate the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux in liver must incorporate glutamine exchange with blood. Additional flux measurements associated with liver such as citrate lyase, α-ketoglutarate ⇄ glutamate exchange, glutamine synthetase/glutaminase, and glutamine influx/efflux may be calculated as well. Applications of this method to study liver metabolism using different labeled precursors may be possible. Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston) weighing 280–380 g were fasted 16–24 h before the experiment. They were anesthetized intraperitoneally with Inactin (Byk-Guiden Pharmazeutika, Germany) (80 mg/kg). Once anesthetized, an intramuscular injections of xylazine (15 mg/kg) and atropine sulfate (81 μg/kg) were given. Tracheostomies were performed, and rats were ventilated with a mixture of room air and oxygen. Both carotid artery and jugular vein were catheterized. An arterial blood sample was initially taken to measure blood gases and pH on an ABL-30 physiological monitor (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Oxygen flow and ventilator volume were adjusted to provide a physiological pO2 (75–100 mm Hg),pCO2 (35–45 mm Hg), and pH (7.1–7.4). A non-magnetic blood pressure transducer (Viggo-Spectramed, Oxnard, CA) was attached to the arterial catheter using a 3-way stopcock to monitor blood pressure. Rats were placed prone on a Lucite platform with the liver positioned over the NMR surface RF coils. After the base-line spectrum, rats were infused with [2-13C]ethanol (99% enriched, 1 g/kg) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA) diluted to a 33% v/v solution in 0.9% NaCl over a 4-min period. A 4-min infusion period was necessary to minimize blood pressure loss during this period. Arterial blood samples were drawn at 0, 5, 10, 15 min, and every 15 min thereafter for blood metabolite measurements. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged for 5 min in heparinized tubes at 10,000 rpm. Plasma was removed and refrigerated at −20 °C until further use. Livers were in situ freeze-clamped and removed at the end of the experiment. Rats were euthanized by administering sodium pentobarbital intravenously. In vivo NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Biospec 7.0T system (horizontal/22 cm diameter magnet). The magnet was equipped with actively shielded gradients (Bruker, Oxford, UK). Dual concentric surface RF coils were used. The outer 1H (30 mm) was tuned to 300.81 MHz, and the inner13C coil (18 mm) was tuned to 75.65 MHz. The RF isolation between the two coils was 43 dB. Global 1H shimming of water was performed to obtain reasonable line widths for imaging. Axial multislice spin-echo scout images (8 interleaved slices, 2 mm thickness, repetition time = 1000 ms, echo time = 24 ms) were taken to ensure placement of the liver in the magnet isocenter. Respiratory gating of the NMR pulse sequence was triggered using a 2-way switch on the respirator responding to each piston stroke. This reduced motion artifacts by limiting signal acquisition to the same period in the respiratory cycle. Additional localized shimming was performed with a respiratory gated STEAM sequence (16Frahm J. Merboldt K.D. Hänicke W. J. Magn. Res. 1987; 72: 502-508Google Scholar) over a 2 × 2 × 1-cm volume of the liver. Water line widths of 35–60 Hz were obtained. 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectroscopy was used during the experiment. Localized carbon spectroscopy was necessary to eliminate strong superficial lipid and abdominal muscle signals. One-dimensional localized spectroscopy was performed by using a modified ISIS sequence (17Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. Science. 1991; 254: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The ISIS excitation slice was generated using a 10-ms hyperbolic secant pulse (18Silver M.S. Joseph R.I. Chen C.N. Sank V.J. Hoult D.I. Nature. 1984; 310: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) during a −6 G/cm gradient pulse orthogonal to the coil plane. The slice placement, parallel to the surface coil, was calculated for each rat from its scout image. Due to the large chemical shift artifact associated with 13C ISIS, the lipid suppression from ISIS was optimized to the aliphatic region only (23–34 ppm). Additional surface signal suppression was provided by a magnetic field surface spoiler coil which was placed in plane between the surface coils and the rat abdomen. The magnetic field spoiler coil was driven by a DC voltage output (5 V, 200 mA) turned on during the initial 2 ms of the signal acquisition period. A 10-min base-line spectrum was acquired (repetition time = 0.5 s, scan number = 1200, 4K data) with broadband WALTZ-16 decoupling turned on during the acquisition. Subsequent spectra were accumulated in 10-min acquisition periods over 60–75 min. All spectra were Lorentzian-filtered, Fourier-transformed, and base-line subtracted to eliminate residual lipid signals. Chemical shifts were referenced to C-2 ethanol at 17.9 ppm. The average signal to noise (root mean square) for the C-4 glutamate and C-4 glutamine peaks at the last time point were 16.5 ± 1.3 and 15.0 ± 1.4, respectively. Proton-observed carbon-enhanced 1H spectroscopy was performed on liver and plasma extracts for fractional enrichment (FE) as described previously (19Jucker B.M. Rennings A.J.M. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10464-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fractional enrichments (given as atom % excess) of [4-13C]glutamate (2.34 ppm), [4-13C]glutamine (2.44 ppm), [2-13C]acetate (1.93 ppm), [3-13C]lactate (1.32 ppm), and [3-13C]alanine (1.48 ppm) were calculated. 13C NMR analysis of liver tissue extracts was performed on a Bruker AM 500 spectrometer system to obtain C-2,3,4 glutamate relative enrichments and isotopomer data from their respective carbon multiplets. Spectra were acquired with repetition time = 0.5 s, scan number = 10,000, 16K data, and Waltz-16 broadband proton decoupling. Peak intensities were corrected for saturation and nuclear Overhauser effect contributions (with respect to C-4 Glu, 1.24 × C-2 Glu and 0.98 × C-3 Glu; with respect to C-4 Gln, 1.08 × C-2 Gln and 0.81 × C-3 Gln). The ethanol infusion protocol described above for the in vivo NMR experiments was performed on a group of rats to obtain intermediate time point data with regard to liver glutamate and glutamine pool size as well as their respective enrichments. Liver and gastrocnemius muscle were freeze-clamped at 0 (n = 2), 10 (n = 2), 25 (n = 2), and 40 min (n = 2). Blood plasma extracts were prepared for NMR analysis by adding 100 μl of plasma to 100 μl of 1.2n perchloric acid in D2O. Additionally, 10 μl of 1.6 m sodium formate in D2O was added as an internal concentration standard. After mixing and centrifugation at 8800 × g for 10 min, 200 μl of the supernatant was pipetted into a 5-mm micro-NMR tube. Liver extracts were prepared by homogenizing a 0.50 g sample of liver with a variable high speed electric homogenizer in a vortex tube filled with 0.9% perchloric acid (3 v/w) and 100 μl of 1n sodium formate. The homogenization was performed over ice to keep the sample cold. After homogenization, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min (3400 rpm). KOH (4 n, 0.675 v/w) was added to the supernatant to precipitate excess perchlorate ions. The sample was centrifuged once more at 4 °C for 5 min (3400 rpm). The supernatant was neutralized and eluted over a Chelex 100 column (100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) with 2 ml of distilled H2O to remove divalent ions. The sample was dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) overnight, and 1 ml of D2O was added to the dried residue before placing in a 5-mm NMR tube. Glutamate and glutamine concentrations in liver extracts were calculated using an NMR assay as follows: a fully relaxed 1H NMR spectrum (repetition time = 30 s) of the liver extract was acquired, and the C-4 Glu, C-4 Gln, and C-3 Lac peak areas were integrated. Lactate concentrations in the extracts were measured using a 2300 STAT PLUS lactate analyzer (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH), and the glutamate and glutamine concentrations were calculated using the ratios of peak areas and the known lactate concentration. Steady state isotopomer analysis was performed on the glutamate 13C multiplet data obtained from liver extracts as described previously by Malloy et al. (20Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6964-6971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis was used to indirectly obtain the [2-13C]acetyl-CoA FE. The individual glutamate C-2, C-3, and C-4 multiplet peak areas were integrated with respect to their respective homonuclear coupling patterns (i.e. singlet, doublet, triplet, and quartet). The isotopomer analysis allowed for the steady state analysis of all 13C labeling permutation of glutamate described by Malloy et al. (20Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6964-6971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With simplifications (using [2-13C]ethanol which provides only [2-13C]acetyl-CoA, and using only C-2, C-3, C-4 Glu to avoid T 1 differences), the following EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 were used to calculate the C-2 acetyl-CoA FE.C2S=[2(y+1)2−2Fc2(y+1)−Fc2+(Fc2)2]/(2(y+1)2)Equation 1 C2D23=Fc2(2+2y−Fc2)/(2(y+1)2)Equation 2 C3S=Fc0(Fc0+y)/(y+1)Equation 3 C3T=(Fc2)2/(y+1)Equation 4 C4D34=(yFa1+Fc2)/(2y+1)Equation 5 where C2S indicates C-2 Glu singlet; C2D23 indicates C-2 Glu doublet (C-2, C-3 coupled); C3S indicates C-3 Glu singlet; C3T indicates C-3 triplet (C-3, C-2, C-4 coupled); and C4D34 indicates C-4 Glu doublet (C-4, C-3 coupled). F c0 indicates fraction of acetyl-CoA that is unlabeled; F c2indicates fraction of acetyl-CoA that is C-2-labeled;F a1 indicates fraction of labeled anaplerotic substrate that will yield either C-2 or C-3 oxaloacetate in the first span of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; and y indicates ratio of anaplerotic versus citrate synthase flux. Metabolic steady state equations may be derived for mass flow into the tricarboxylic acid cycle as described previously for brain (13Mason G.F. Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and heart (10Yu X. White L.T. Doumen C. Damico L.A. LaNoue K.F. Alpert N.M. Lewandowski E.D. Biophys.

V pdhindicates pyruvate dehydrogenase flux; V acetindicates acetate thiokinase flux; V cs indicates citrate synthase flux; V ffa indicates fatty acid synthase flux; V ket indicates acetoacetate synthesis flux; V tca indicates tricarboxylic acid cycle flux; V lyase indicates citrate lyase flux; V glu andV glu−1 indicate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase flux; V gln andV gln−1 indicate glutamine synthetase and glutaminase flux, respectively;V out and V in indicate glutamine efflux and influx, respectively; V aspindicates aspartate aminotransferase flux;V pepck indicates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase flux; V pc indicates pyruvate carboxylase flux. Both glutamate and glutamine pool concentrations were measured, and acetyl-CoA, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate pool concentrations in liver during ethanol metabolism were obtained from literature and converted to μmol/g wet weight (21Williamson J.R. Scholz R. Browning E.T. Thurman R.G. Fukami M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5044-5054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pyruvate dehydrogenase flux (V pdh) was set equal to 0 as this flux is very low in liver (2Beylot M. Soloviev M.V. David F. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3DiDonato L. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. David F. Garneau M. Brunengraber H. J. Biol.

A. 1979; 76: 4808-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The acetate thiokinase flux (V acet) as a minimum estimate was set equal to citrate synthase flux (V cs). VaryingV ffa and V ketindiscriminately had no effect on C-2 AcCoA turnover, because of the small AcCoA pool size. The α-KG ⇄ Glu exchange via glutamate dehydrogenase and/or aminotransferase reaction (V glu andV glu−1) is rapid with respect toV tca in the brain (13Mason G.F. Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but has been shown to be significantly slower in heart (10Yu X. White L.T. Doumen C. Damico L.A. LaNoue K.F. Alpert N.M. Lewandowski E.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2090-2102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Chatham J.C. Forder J.R. Glickson J.D. Chance E.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1243: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to include both C-4 and C-2 Glu turnover data in the mathematical analysis to discriminate between V tca andV glu. C-2 Glu time points were extrapolated from the in vivo turnover of the C-2 Glu/Gln peak (not resolved at 55.5 ppm) and ratio of C-4 Glu to C-4 Gln at their respective time points. C-2 GlnB was extrapolated from C-4 GlnBand the ratio of C-2 Glu to C-4 Glu at their respective time points. No labeling of aspartate was detected in vivo, and minimal C-3 Asp was detected in liver extracts, so the aspartate aminotransferase flux (V asp) was set to 0. Lactate and pyruvate are believed to be in fast exchange in the liver (15Katz J. Wals P. Lee W-N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25509-25521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the C-3 Pyr turnover was set equal to the C-3 Lac turnover which was determined from liver extracts at intermediate time points. Pyruvate carboxylase flux (V pc) was set equal to the measured anaplerotic flux. Malic enzyme flux (V malic) was set to 0, because it was shown to be low following a fast (23Drake R.L. Parks W.C. Thompson E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6008-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mathcad (MathSoft Inc., Cambridge, MA) software was used to simultaneously solve the differential equations described above. The computer-generated Glu and Gln turnover curves determined from the series of equations were fit to the NMR data via a non-linear least squares best fit analysis (modified Levenberg-Marquardt process). Random errors determined from S/N measurements were included with each data point in the fit. All fits had a correlation valueR 2 ≥0.90. Intra-rat data were used to calculate each V tca. The error in the calculated fluxes represent the mean ± S.D. reflecting the accuracy of the measurement resulting from each curve fit. Student's t test analysis was performed on data to determine significance at a p ≤ 0.05 threshold. A localized 13C NMR pulse sequence was used to suppress the strong superficial lipid signals that overlapped the peaks of interest. Fig. 2 Arepresents a non-localized carbon spectrum from the liver, abdominal muscle, and superficial lipid (large lipid signals present at 23–34 ppm) in rat postmortem. These peaks obscure the C-4 resonances of glutamate and glutamine at 34.4 and 31.3 ppm, respectively. The modified one-dimensional ISIS localized pulse sequence was used to produce the spectrum in Fig. 2 B. Additional lipid suppression was provided using the combined magnetic field spoiler coil/one-dimensional ISIS localization sequence as shown in Fig.2 C. No decrease in the C-2 EtOH peak at 17.9 ppm in Fig. 2,B and C, indicates that there was excellent signal localization to the liver. A series of base-line subtracted 10 min acquired spectra is shown in Fig. 3. The times indicated are the median time of acquisition. All experiments showed an immediate increase in the 13C NMR signal at 17.9 ppm as a result of the ethanol bolus. In subsequent spectra, the ethanol signal decreased indicating ethanol clearance. C-4 Glu and C-4 Gln signals appeared at 34.4 and 31.3 ppm, respectively, in the first spectrum and increased until steady state signal intensities were achieved. Labeling of C-4 Glu and C-4 Gln was the result of [2-13C]acetyl-CoA condensing with oxaloacetate to produce [4-13C]citrate which in turn labeled α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutamine at the C-4 position (Fig. 1). C-2 Glu and C-2 Gln at 55.5 and 55.0 ppm, respectively (unresolved), began to appear at 5–15 min and increased at a slower rate than C-4 Glu and C-4 Gln. These peaks appeared during subsequent turns of the tricarboxylic acid cycle which results in scrambling the C-4 label of Glu and Gln to C-2 and C-3 Glu and Gln. The peaks of C-3 Glu and Gln at 27.9 and 27.0 ppm, respectively, and C-2 acetate at 24.2 ppm were difficult to observe, because these frequencies are in the area where the ISIS suppression was optimized. The ISIS suppression was optimized by placing the downfield edge of the frequency selective inversion pulse at the C-2 fatty acyl chain peak (∼34.2 ppm) of the triglycerides. Therefore, using a magnetic field gradient of −6 G/cm during the frequency selective pulse, signal suppression at 27.9 and 27.0 ppm was 0.46 and 0.52 cm deep into the liver, respectively, if the ISIS suppression was optimized at the liver/abdominal muscle interface. The C-4 Glu, C-4 Gln, and C-2 Glu/Gln peaks of all the base-line subtracted spectra were integrated, and the time point enrichments of C-4 Glu, C-4 Gln, and C-2 Glu extrapolated from tissue extract enrichment and in vivo label turnover data are shown in Fig. 4 A.Figure 4Extrapolated substrate enrichment time courses in liver and blood. A, the C-4 glutamate (▵) and C-4 glutamine (□) time points were extrapolated from their respective integrated peak areas, and final substrate fractional enrichments (APE) were measured in the liver extracts. The C-2 glutamate (○) time points were extrapolated from the integrated C-2 Glu/Gln peak (not resolved, Fig. 3) and ratio of C-4 Glu to C-4 Gln at their respective time points.

It has therefore been assumed that this entire domain lies on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. The purpose of the present study was to determine the membrane orientation of the COOH-terminal 131 amino acids of Na+-H+exchanger isoform NHE3 by use of three monoclonal antibodies that recognize at least two distinct epitopes within this region. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies demonstrated binding of these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to intact right-side-out renal brush border membrane vesicles in the absence of detergent. Moreover, when coupled to an affinity matrix to isolate membrane vesicles, the anti-NHE3 mAbs bound structures that were morphologically identical to intact microvilli. To confirm the identity of the exoplasmic antigen bound by the antibodies, immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Intact right-side-out brush border membrane vesicles were incubated with the mAbs in the absence of detergent. The membranes were pelleted, supernatant with unbound antibody was removed, the pellet was solubilized, and then immunoprecipitation with secondary antibody was performed. Immunoblot analysis indicated that NHE3 was precipitated after binding of the mAbs to intact membranes. Finally, the localization of the mAb epitopes was determined using high resolution immunocytochemistry. Ultrathin cryosections of rat kidney were labeled with the mAbs and bound antibody detected with the colloidal gold technique. Labeling was restricted to the exoplasmic surface of microvilli of the proximal tubule. Taken together, these findings indicate that epitopes within the carboxyl terminus of the Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3 are exposed to the outside of the plasma membrane.

Na+-H+ exchangers mediate the electroneutral, amiloride-sensitive exchange of Na+ and H+ across plasma membranes (1Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies of the Na+-H+ exchanger gene family reveal proteins with similar structure sharing between 45 and 70% overall identity at the amino acid level (2Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A.

The amino terminus is very hydrophobic and is predicted to have 10–12 α-helices that are long enough to span the lipid bilayer. In contrast, the carboxyl terminus is relatively hydrophilic and has no predicted membrane-spanning α-helical segments. Functional studies have indicated that ion transport is mediated via the amino-terminal hydrophobic domain and that this activity is regulated through the interaction of cytosolic proteins with the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain (5Borgese F.

Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To test this assumption directly, we used three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; BBMV, brush border membrane vesicles; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PLP, paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate.1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; BBMV, brush border membrane vesicles; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PLP, paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate. to determine the membrane orientation of the COOH-terminal 131 amino acids of Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3. Our findings indicate that epitopes within this COOH-terminal domain of NHE3 are located on the exoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. A preliminary account of this work has been published previously as an abstract (11Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1276-1277Google Scholar). In a previous paper, we described in detail the development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to a restricted region of the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs 2B9, 4F5, and 19F5 were raised to a fusion protein (fpNHE3-702-832), which reproduced the carboxyl-terminal 131 amino acids of rabbit Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3 (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting studies using Na+-H+exchanger-deficient LAP cells transfected with NHE1, NHE2, NHE3, or NHE4 indicated that each of these mAbs was specific for the 80-kDa NHE3 polypeptide and did not cross-react with other NHE isoforms (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By immunocytochemistry, all mAbs stained the brush border of proximal tubule cells in both the rabbit and rat kidney (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs were used as purified IgG from hybridoma supernatants. A polyclonal antibody raised in a guinera pig to the same fusion protein (fpNHE3702-832) was also used (13Rutherford P.A. Pizzonia J.H. Biemesderfer D. Abu-Alfa A. Reilly R. Aronson P.S. Exp. Nephrol. 1997; 5: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar). Although this antibody is not useful for immunocytochemistry, it exhibits the same isoform specificity for NHE3 in immunoblotting experiments as do the mAbs. This antibody was used as serum for immunoblotting NHE3 following immunoprecipitation with the mAbs (see Fig. 5). An mAb (mouse IgG) to the COOH-terminal headpiece region of villin was purchased from AMAC, Inc. (Westbrook, ME). This mAb was raised to purified pig villin and has been characterized in detail (14Dudouet B. Robine S. Huet C. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Blair L. Cordrier E. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An mAb (26C) to rat dipeptidyl peptidase IV was a gift from Dr. Marilyn Farquhar (University of California, San Diego). mAb 26C has been characterized previously (15Miettinen A. Dekan G. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 929-944PubMed Google Scholar,16Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). mAb C62.4 was raised to purified dog kidney Na,K-ATPase and has been shown to be specific for the α-subunit (17Kashgarian M. Biemesderfer D. Caplan M. Forbush B. Kidney Int. 1985; 28: 899-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Male New Zealand White rabbits (2–3 kg) (Gabrielle Farms, Woodstock, CT) were sacrificed by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital. BBMV were prepared from renal cortex using the Mg2+precipitation method described previously (18Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Haase W. Schafer A. Murer H. Kinne R. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Murer H. Hopfer U. Kinne R. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors pepstatin A, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and antipain at 2 mm each were included in the preparation. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BBMV were purified 12–15-fold compared with homogenate based on enrichment in specific activity of the luminal membrane marker γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (18Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NHE3 truncated at amino acid 756 (Δ756 NHE3) and stably transfected into PS120 fibroblasts was a gift from Dr. Mark Donowitz (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore). The construction and expression of this mutant has been described previously (9Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were solubilized in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Immobilon-P) at 300 mA for 6–10 h at 4 °C with a Transphor transfer electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) and stained with Ponceau S in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblotting was performed as follows. Strips of polyvinylidene difluoride were incubated first in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) for 1–3 h to block nonspecific binding of antibody, followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody diluted 1:2,000 in Blotto. The strips were then washed in Blotto and incubated for 1 h with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, gamma chain-specific or rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG; Zymed, San Francisco). Bound antibody was detected with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) according to manufacturer's protocols. In some experiments (Fig. 1), polyvinylidene difluoride blots were reprobed with a second primary antibody after stripping away the first antibody by incubation in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris (pH 6.9) for 60 min at 70 °C. ELISAs were performed in a manner similar to that described previously (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BBMV (protein concentration, 30 mg/ml) were diluted 1:1000 in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.4); then, 100-μl aliquots of this antigen were applied to each well of a 96-well microtitre plate (Costar), and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the plates were washed four times in PBS (pH 7.4) and once in PBS with 1% BSA (PBS/BSA) to block nonspecific antibody binding. Primary antibodies were diluted either in PBS/BSA or in PBS/BSA with 0.01% Triton X-100, and then 100-μl aliquots were applied to wells of the 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed four times in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS/TX100) and once in PBS/BSA/TX100. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (gamma chain-specific, Zymed) diluted 1:2000 in PBS/BSA/TX100. The plates were washed five times in PBS/TX100, and horseradish peroxidase was detected with o-phenylenediamine. The OD was measured at 492 μm using a Titertek Multiskan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Immunoisolation of rabbit renal microvilli was performed using Dynabeads M-500 Subcellular (Dynal A.S, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Beads that had been previously coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG were in turn coated with either anti-NHE3 mAb or with a control mAb (anti-villin). The antibody-coated beads were suspended in 1 ml of PBS with 0.1% BSA, and then 50 μl of rabbit BBMV (30 mg/ml) were added. After incubating for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times in PBS with 0.1% BSA. The beads and bound membrane were fixed with Karnovsky's fixative (5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4). The samples were then processed for electron microscopy (16Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously found that by immunocytochemistry the anti-NHE3 mAbs stained brush borders more strongly in paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (PLP) fixed kidney tissue of rat as compared with rabbit (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, high resolution localization of mAb epitopes by electron microscopy was performed in rat kidney. Rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital injected intravenously, and the kidneys were perfusion-fixed as described previously (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J.

Briefly, a cannula was inserted into the descending aorta distal to the renal arteries, and the kidneys were perfused retrograde first with PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C to remove blood, followed by PLP fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 75 mm lysine, and 10 mm sodium periodate in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (24McClean W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 22: 1077-1083Crossref Scopus (3173) Google Scholar). Ultrathin cryosections were cut from PLP-fixed rat kidney as described by Tokuyasu (25Tokuyasu K.T. J. Microsc. 1986; 143: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Sections were labeled with mAb followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L) 10-nm gold conjugate (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ). The labeled sections were post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 0.002% lead citrate in 2.2% polyvinyl alcohol (26Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1991; 21: 163-171Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Sections were examined and photographed using either a Zeiss EM10B or 910 electron microscope. Rabbit brush border membrane vesicles (250 μg) were suspended in 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.4). To expose the mAbs to only the extracellular domain of microvilli, antibodies were added to the suspended BBMV in the absence of detergent and allowed to incubate on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then diluted with 20 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant containing unbound antibody was removed, and the membrane pellet was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation for 10 min at top speed in a table top centrifuge. The immune complexes were then collected using protein G-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Parallel immunoprecipitations were carried out in which mAbs were exposed to all microvillar epitopes by first solubilizing BBMV in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min before addition of antibodies. We had previously generated three mAbs against a fusion protein representing the carboxyl-terminal 131 amino acids (amino acids 702–832) of NHE3 (12Biemesderfer D. Ruthreford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether these antibodies were directed at identical or different epitopes within this segment of NHE3. Immunoblotting experiments were carried out using rabbit renal brush border membranes expressing native (full-length) NHE3 or cells transfected with rabbit NHE3 truncated at amino acid 756 (NHE3Δ). As shown in Fig. 1, both mAb 2B9 and mAb 4F5 labeled the native 80-kDa NHE3 polypeptide expressed in rabbit kidney. However, only mAb 2B9 stained NHE3Δ in transfected fibroblasts. Results with mAb 19F5 were identical to those observed for 4F5 (not shown). We conclude that mAb 2B9 is directed at an epitope that lies between amino acids 702 and 756 of NHE3, whereas the epitope(s) for 4F5 and 19F5 must be COOH-terminal to amino acid 756. Our first method to examine the topology of the mAb epitopes (inside or outside) was to test the ability of the antibodies to bind to intact BBMV. We took advantage of the fact that BBMV isolated from renal cortex by divalent cation precipitation are predominantly sealed and right-side-out (19Haase W. Schafer A. Murer H. Kinne R. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Venien C. Aubry M. Crine P. Le Grimellec C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the results of ELISA in which anti-NHE3 mAbs were allowed to bind to BBMV in the presence or absence of 0.01% Triton X-100 as a permeabilizing agent. For all three anti-NHE3 monoclonal antibodies, binding to BBMV was nearly as great in the absence as in the presence of detergent. In contrast, binding of an mAb specific for the microvillar core protein villin was markedly impaired in the absence of detergent, confirming that the BBMV were predominantly sealed and right-side-out. Thus, these data strongly suggest that the anti-NHE3 mAb epitopes are located on the exoplasmic face of the microvillar membrane. Although the brush border membrane vesicles that were used in these antibody binding experiments (Fig. 2) were enriched 10–15-fold in microvillar membrane markers, some contaminating membranes were also present. To verify that the antibody binding described in Fig. 2 was actually to microvillar rather than to contaminating membranes, we tested the ability of the antibodies to affinity isolate microvillar vesicles. For these studies, the mAbs were coupled to the surface of magnetic beads. After mixing the antibody-coated beads with BBMV, we examined the morphology of the specifically bound membranes by electron microscopy. As seen in Fig.3 A, very little membrane bound to beads coated with a control (anti-villin) mAb. In contrast, shown in Fig. 3 B, beads coated with the anti-NHE3 mAb 4F5 isolated large numbers of membranous structures, the majority of which had microvillar architecture (Fig. 3 B, inset). This experiment confirms that the anti-NHE3 mAbs are capable of binding to epitopes on the outside of the microvillar membrane. Another set of experiments was designed to directly localize bound mAb in brush borders using immunoelectron microscopy. Ultrathin (50–100 nm) cryosections of PLP-fixed rat kidney were incubated with the mAbs, and then bound antibody was visualized in the electron microscope by use of a colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig.4). This approach has two distinct advantages for mapping epitopes of membrane proteins. First, the ultrathin cryosections allow equal antibody access to all regions of the cell including both surfaces of the lipid bilayer. Second, the colloidal gold particles appear as discrete electron-dense spheres of uniform size (in these studies 10 nm) and permit the localization of epitopes to within several nanometers. To test the method and to ensure that we could reliably distinguish between cytoplasmic and exoplasmic labeling of membrane proteins, we used control antibodies to other known renal proteins. We used an mAb to the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase as a control for labeling of a cytoplasmic epitope of a transport protein (Fig. 4 A). We used an anti-villin mAb to label a cytosolic epitope in microvilli (Fig. 4 B). Finally, as a control for labeling an exoplasmic epitope of microvilli, we used a mAb to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (Fig.4 C). Shown in Fig. 4, the topology of the epitope relative to the plasma membrane was easily seen for each of these control antibodies. The epitope of the Na,K-ATPase recognized by mAb C62.4 was localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the basolateral plasma membrane (Fig.4 A). Staining for villin, as predicted, showed the protein to be located exclusively in the microvillar core (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, staining for dipeptidyl peptidase IV was clearly on the outside or exoplasmic surface of the microvillar membrane (Fig.4 C). These data confirm that immunoelectron microscopy using the colloidal gold/ultrathin cryosectioning technique can distinguish cytoplasmic and exoplasmic epitopes of membrane proteins. When the anti-NHE3 mAb 4F5 was used in these studies, gold label was observed almost exclusively on the exoplasmic surface of the microvillar membrane (Fig. 4 D), a pattern similar to that seen for the exoplasmic control dipeptidyl peptidase IV. The same staining pattern was found with all three anti-NHE3 mAbs (not shown). These findings clearly demonstrate that the epitopes recognized by the anti-NHE3 mAbs are exposed to the exoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. Having shown by three different methods that the anti-NHE3 mAbs bind to the external surface of the microvillar membrane, we conducted a final set of studies to confirm that the exoplasmic binding of the mAbs was actually to NHE3. In these experiments the anti-NHE3 mAbs were incubated with intact BBMV. The membranes were then washed to remove unbound antibody, and the membranes were solubilized. Immune complexes were then collected using protein G-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. An anti-NHE3 guinea pig antiserum was used to detect NHE3 in the immunoprecipitates. For comparison, and to detect total NHE3, parallel samples were run in which immunoprecipitation was performed directly from Triton X-100-solubilized brush border membrane vesicles. Shown in Fig. 5, each of the three anti-NHE3 mAbs immunoprecipitated almost as much NHE3 when incubated with intact BBMV as when incubated with solubilized protein. As a control for BBMV integrity in these studies, a similar immunoprecipitation experiment was conducted with an anti-villin mAb. As also shown in Fig. 5, immunoprecipitation of villin was greatly reduced when the anti-villin mAb was incubated with intact BBMV as compared with solubilized membranes, confirming that the cytoplasmic space of intact BBMV is not accessible to antibodies in the absence of detergent. The finding that anti-NHE3 mAbs can immunoprecipitate NHE3 after exposure to intact BBMV confirms that a COOH-terminal region of NHE3 must be exposed on the exoplasmic surface of microvilli. Using mAbs to at least two distinct epitopes of the Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3, we have demonstrated that regions of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain are exposed on the exoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. The topology of the mAb epitopes was shown by four independent methods: 1) antibody binding to intact brush border membrane vesicles as detected by ELISA, 2) affinity isolation of right-side-out microvillar vesicles by immobilized antibody, 3) localization of antibody binding by immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections of PLP-fixed kidney examined by electron microscopy, and 4) immunoprecipitation of NHE3 after antibody exposure to intact brush border vesicles with removal of unbound antibody prior to solubilization. These findings indicate that the antibody epitopes, one between amino acids 702 and 756 and the other(s) between amino acid 756 and the COOH terminus, must be exposed on the external surface of the plasma membrane. Algorithms that predict hydrophobicity have been applied to cloned Na+-H+ exchangers (NHE1–4) and have provided the same general model (2Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

In brief, the amino-terminal 60% of the protein is very hydrophobic and is predicted to have multiple (10Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

The remaining carboxyl-terminal portion is relatively hydrophilic and has no hydrophobic stretches that are of sufficient length (15–20 residues) to constitute membrane-spanning α-helices. The COOH-terminal hydrophilic domains of NHE proteins contain sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases (6Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,8Kurashima K. Yu F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody studies indicate that at least a portion of the COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain of NHE1 is cytoplasmic (3Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Given the absence of predicted membrane-spanning α-helical segments in this region, it has been assumed that the entire COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain of NHE proteins must be cytoplasmic (3Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Our findings clearly indicate that this assumption is not correct, at least for the case of NHE3. Studies of NHE proteins have indicated that the portion of the COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain just after the hydrophobic domain (approximately from amino acids 550–690) is most critical for regulation of NHE activity in response to intracellular signaling mechanisms. For example, amino acids 636–656 represent the high affinity calmodulin binding region of NHE1 (10Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13710-13715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A critical region including amino acids 559–661 is essential for protein kinase A activation of a NHE1 homologue in trout red cells (5Borgese F. Malapert M. Fievet B. Pouyssegur J. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Likewise, a region encompassing amino acids 579–684 is essential for mediating protein kinase A inhibition of NHE3 activity (6Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data predict that there must be a least one membrane-spanning segment between the protein kinase A regulatory site and the more distal exoplasmic epitopes identified by our mAbs. It should also be noted that Levine and co-workers (9Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have shown that truncating NHE3 at amino acid 756 eliminates the effects of calmodulin on this isoform. However, it is unclear if the calmodulin binding site is located in the COOH terminus (amino acids 756–832) or if the truncation results in allosteric inhibition of binding in other more proximal regions of the protein. If the calmodulin binding site of NHE3 is located between amino acids 756–832, then the data predict a second membrane-spanning segment between the exoplasmic epitope of mAb 2B9 and the presumably internal calmodulin binding site. Although membrane-spanning α-helical structure in the C-terminal hydrophylic region of the NHEs is not predicted by hydropathy analysis (29Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar), it is important to note that β-structures, which are not readily identified by such methods, can also span lipid bilayers. In bacteria, some pore-forming proteins such as maltoporin have membrane-spanning domains that consist largely of anti-parallel β-barrels (30Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang T-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). β-Structures may also be important in forming membrane-spanning domains in eukaryotic proteins. For example, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the electroplaque membranes ofTorpedo is the best characterized member of a large family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Hydrophobicity analysis predicts each of the five subunits to consist of four membrane-spanning α-helices (31Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Kikyotani S. Hirose T. Asai M. Takashima H. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1983; 301: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, circular dichroism studies predict insufficient α-helical structure to account for the predicted number of membrane-spanning domains (32Mielke D.L. Wallace B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, structural analysis by electron crystallography has suggested that the membrane-spanning regions of the acetylcholine receptor consist of both α-helices and β-sheets (33Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been suggested that the NHE proteins may contain membrane-spanning β-sheet structures (34Radding W. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 150: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which might include one or more membrane-spanning segments in the distal regions of the COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain of NHE3. We thank Dr. Donald Engelman for helpful discussions."

The cell surface location of apoE in adrenocortical cells suggests that apoE may facilitate the uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol by either the endocytic or the selective uptake pathways, or both. To examine these possibilities, the human apoE gene was expressed in murine Y1 adrenocortical cells under control of an inducible tetracycline-regulated promoter. The results show that induction of apoE yielded a 2–2.5-fold increase in the uptake of low density lipoprotein-cholesteryl ester (LDL-CE) but had little effect on high density lipoprotein-CE uptake. Analysis of lipoprotein uptake pathways showed that apoE increased LDL-CE uptake by both endocytic and selective uptake pathways. In terms of cholesterol delivery to the adrenal cell, the apoE-mediated enhancement of LDL-CE selective uptake was quantitatively more important. Furthermore, the predominant effect of apoE expression was on the low affinity component of LDL-CE selective uptake. LDL particles incubated with apoE-expressing cells contained 0.92 ± 0.11 apoE molecules/apoB after gel filtration chromatography, indicating stable complex formation between apoE and LDL. ApoE expression by Y1 cells was necessary for enhanced LDL-CE selective uptake. This result may indicate an interaction between apoE-containing LDL and cell surface apoE.

Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1611-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that apoE is an abundant protein product of adrenal cells. ApoE mRNA is expressed in adrenocortical zona fasciculata and zona reticularis cells, the sites of steroid production and cholesteryl ester storage in rat adrenal gland (17Nicosia M. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The high expression of apoE in adrenocortical cells and its pattern of regulation suggest that locally derived apoE may facilitate the acquisition of lipoprotein cholesterol, alter cellular cholesteryl ester (CE) storage, or modulate the availability of cholesterol for steroidogenesis (7Blue M.-L.

Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1611-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adrenal gland apoE expression is regulated in direct proportion to CE stores and inversely to the level of steroid production (16Prack M.M. Nicosia M. Williams D.L. Gwynne J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1611-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicosia M. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A potential role for locally produced apoE in adrenocortical cholesterol metabolism is supported by results showing that constitutive expression of human apoE in murine Y1 adrenocortical cells leads to enhanced accumulation of CE (18Prack M.M. Rothblat G.H. Erickson S.K. Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (5055): 5094Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies in rat adrenocortical cells show apoE intracellularly within multivesicular bodies of the endocytic pathway and on cell surface microvillar channels (19Williams D.L. Wong J.S. Wissig S.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 745-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microvillar channels retain LDL and HDL particles and have been proposed to be the site at which the selective uptake of lipoprotein-CE occurs (20Reaven E. Spicher M. Azhar S. J.

In contrast to lipoprotein uptake by endocytosis, the selective uptake pathway brings lipoprotein-CE into the cell without the uptake and lysosomal degradation of the lipoprotein particle (22Pittman R.C.

Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 869-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was later studied in human fibroblasts (29Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the Y1-BS1 subclone of murine Y1 adrenocortical cells (29Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in human hepatoma cells (30Brissette L. Charest M.-C. Falstrault L. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In ovarian tissue (28Azhar S. Cooper A. Tsai L. Maffe W. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 869-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in Y1-BS1 cells (29Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most of the LDL-CE delivered to the cells occurs via the selective as opposed to the endocytic pathway. The presence of apoE within multivesicular bodies of adrenocortical cells and in microvillar channels may indicate that locally synthesized apoE acts to facilitate the uptake of HDL- and/or LDL-CE by either the endocytic or selective uptake pathways, or both (19Williams D.L. Wong J.S. Wissig S.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 745-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined these possibilities by expressing human apoE in murine Y1 adrenocortical cells under control of an inducible tetracycline (tet)-regulated promoter. The results show that apoE expression yielded a 2–2.5-fold increase in the uptake of LDL-CE but had little influence on HDL-CE uptake. Analysis of lipoprotein uptake pathways showed that apoE increased LDL-CE uptake by both endocytic and selective uptake pathways. These data suggest that apoE produced locally by steroidogenic cells facilitates cholesterol acquisition from LDL particles by two distinct pathways. Murine Y1 adrenal cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in a 37 °C humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 12.5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Y1 cell lines inducible for apoE expression were prepared with the tet-regulated promoter system described by Gossen and Bujard (31Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) using the plasmid vectors pUHD15-1, pUHD10-3, and pUHD13-3 kindly provided by H. Bujard. The expression vector pUHD/apoE was made as follows. The 4.2-kilobase pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the vector pFE (32Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which encodes the human apoE ε4 genomic sequence from −8 to +4200, was ligated to aBamHI/EcoRI adapter sequence. This fragment was then cloned into BamHI-linearized pUHD10-3, which places it under control of the tet-regulated promoter. Cell lines were constructed in two steps. First, Y1 cells were co-transfected with pUHD15-1, which encodes the tet transactivator (tTA) protein, and pSV2neo, which encodes resistance to G418 sulfate, at a ratio of 9:1, by calcium phosphate-mediated gene transfer essentially as described (32Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cell clones were selected in complete media containing 200 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and screened for expression of the tTA protein by transient transfection of pUHD13-3, which encodes a luciferase reporter gene expressed from a tTA-responsive promoter. One clone, Y1UHD/7, which expressed high levels of the tTA protein was secondarily transfected with pUHD/apoE, together with pCMV hygromycin (Calbiochem) at a ratio of 9:1. To make control cell lines, Y1UHD/7 cells were transfected with the empty pUHD10-3 vector together with pCMV hygromycin. Hygromycin-resistant clones (Y1/E/tet or Y1/con/tet cells) were selected in complete medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) and 200 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Tetracycline (2 μg/ml) was included during selection to suppress expression of apoE. Following selection, cell lines were maintained in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2 μg/ml tet. Individual Y1/E/tet cell lines were identified by Western blotting of medium following removal of tet. Two cell lines (Y1/E/tet/2/3 and Y1/E/tet/2/5) that showed strong induction of apoE and two control cell lines (Y1/con/tet/1/2 and Y1/con/tet/1/6) were used for subsequent experiments. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 7% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20. The blocked membrane was incubated with polyclonal goat anti-human apoE antibody (Calbiochem) (1/1000 dilution) overnight at room temperature in TBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.2% Tween 20. The membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Sigma)(1/10,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). ApoE concentration in conditioned medium was determined by ELISA using an affinity-purified goat anti-human apoE antibody (Biodesign) as described (33DeMattos R.B. Curtiss L.K. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4206-4212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed in triplicate using human apoE (PanVera) as standard. Human (h) HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ < 1.210 g/ml) and human LDL (1.019 g/ml < ρ < 1.063 g/ml) were doubly labeled with [125I]dilactitol tyramine and [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether as described (34Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the [125I,3H]hHDL ranged from 46 to 70 dpm/ng protein for 125I and from 6 to 28 dpm/ng protein for 3H. The specific activity of the [125I,3H]hLDL ranged from 25 to 75 dpm/ng of protein for 125I and from 3 to 30 dpm/ng of protein for3H. For all experiments, six-well plates (Costar) were seeded with Y1/E/tet or Y1/con/tet cells at 0.8 × 106 cells/well in complete medium in the presence or absence of tet. At day 1 and day 3, medium was changed and, at day 4, medium was changed to the above medium lacking serum, plus or minus tet, containing 2 mm dibutyryl cAMP. After 24 h, half of the medium was removed and double-labeled [125I,3H]hHDL at 50 μg/ml (protein) or [125I,3H]hLDL at 50 μg/ml (protein) (except where indicated) was added, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; one time with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; and lysed with 1.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. The lysate was processed to determine trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble 125I radioactivity and organic solvent-extractable 3H radioactivity as described (34Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys.

Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 125I radioactivity represents cell-associated apolipoprotein, which is the sum of cell surface-bound apolipoprotein and endocytosed apolipoprotein that is not yet degraded. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity represents endocytosed and degraded apolipoprotein that is trapped in lysosomes due to the dilactitol tyramine label. The sum of the 125I-degraded and 125I-cell-associated undegraded apolipoprotein expressed as CE equivalents was subtracted from the CE measured as extractable 3H radioactivity to get the selective uptake of LDL-CE and HDL-CE (34Azhar S.

The LDL concentration dependence for each of these parameters was modeled by a simple binding isotherm composed of a high affinity saturable process and a low affinity nonsaturable process, P total= {([P max] [LDL])/(K HA+ [LDL])} + C[LDL], whereP total is the measured parameter, [P max] is the high affinity parameter at saturating levels of LDL, K HA is the apparent high affinity K m, and C is the slope of the low affinity nonsaturable process. For each parameter,P total was resolved into high affinity and low affinity components by determining C and subtractingC[LDL] from P total to generate the curve for high affinity LDL concentration dependence (37Temel R.E.

Pooled fractions were concentrated in a Centriprep-30 (Amicon) concentrator and resolved by nondenaturing 2–16% gradient PAGE in Tris borate, pH 8.3, for 2300 V-h at 4 °C as described (38Marzetta C.A. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. In some experiments, medium from cells incubated with or without LDL was resolved by chromatography on Bio-Gel A-15m as above, and the fractions were assayed for apoE by ELISA and for LDL by monitoring 125I radioactivity. In order to examine the effects of apoE on lipoprotein uptake, we prepared Y1 cell lines in which apoE expression is inducible. This approach permits the influence of apoE to be tested within a clonal cell line and eliminates the variables inherent in selecting and comparing lipoprotein uptake in different clones that do or do not express apoE. With the tet-regulated system of Gossen and Bujard (31Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar), apoE expression is suppressed in the presence of tet and induced following tet removal from the medium. Table Ishows the apoE concentration in culture medium at 24 h after changing to serum-free medium when cells were withdrawn from tet 4 days previously. The Y1/E/tet cell lines showed a 20-fold induction of apoE accumulation following tet removal and produced a medium apoE concentration of 2–2.5 μg/ml. Secreted apoE was very low but detectable in the presence of tet, but was not detected in the Y1/con/tet cell lines in the presence or absence of tet. Note that the endogenous mouse apoE gene is not expressed in the Y1 cell line (32Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that, following a medium change at 4 days after tet removal, secreted apoE accumulated to a steady state by 24 h (Fig. 1, panel A(−tet) and B). When tet was not removed, a faint apoE band was detected by Western blotting by 36–48 h after the medium change (Fig. 1, panel A (+tet)), confirming the conclusion from the ELISA (Table I) of low level apoE expression in the presence of tet. The time necessary to induce maximal apoE expression upon tet removal was determined by Western blotting of medium samples collected in 24-h intervals over a 15-day period. As shown in Fig. 1(panel C), apoE accumulation per 24 h was maximal by day 4 and remained stable for up to day 15. In subsequent lipoprotein uptake studies, Y1 cells were withdrawn from tet for 4 days to induce maximal apoE expression, switched to serum-free medium at day 4 to permit secreted apoE to accumulate, and experiments were initiated by addition of labeled lipoprotein to the medium on day 5.Table IAccumulation of apoE secreted by Y1 cell linesCell linetetapoEμg/ml/24 hY1/con/tet/1/2+ND1-aND, not detected.Y1/con/tet/1/2−NDY1/con/tet/1/6+NDY1/con/tet/1/6−NDY1/E/tet/2/5+0.16 ± 0.02Y1/E/tet/2/5−2.5 ± 0.07Y1/E/tet/2/3+0.11 ± 0.02Y1/E/tet/2/3−2.1 ± 0.081-a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The results in TableII illustrate the effects of tet withdrawal and apoE expression on LDL-CE uptake. With Y1/con/tet/1/6 control cells not expressing apoE, tet withdrawal had little or no effect on cell association, selective uptake, or endocytic uptake of LDL-CE. In contrast, with Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells that do express apoE, tet withdrawal led to a 2–3-fold increase in LDL-CE selective and endocytic uptake and a 1.4-fold increase in cell association of LDL particles. These results indicate that the enhanced LDL-CE uptake and cell association reflect the expression of apoE and not the influence of tet. Similar results were obtained with Y1/con/tet1/2 and Y1/E/tet/2/5 cell lines (data not shown).Table IIEffect of apoE and tetracycline on hLDL binding and uptake in Y1 cellsCell linetetCell association2-aValues represent mean ± S.E.

The results in Table III show that in contrast to the marked apoE-mediated enhancement of LDL-CE cell association and uptake, apoE expression had only a modest effect on HDL-CE uptake. When data from seven experiments were analyzed, HDL-CE selective uptake was 30% greater in apoE-expressing cells, but this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.5, data not shown). This result indicates that the effect of apoE expression is primarily on LDL-CE uptake.Table IIIEffect of apoE on hLDL and hHDL binding and uptake in Y1 cellsLipoproteintetCell association3-aValues represent mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab The concentration dependence for LDL-CE uptake in the presence and absence of apoE expression is shown in Fig.2. These data indicate that, in the presence or absence of apoE, most LDL-CE uptake at all LDL concentrations tested occurred via selective uptake as opposed to endocytic uptake. ApoE expression enhanced LDL-CE uptake by both endocytic and selective pathways, with the -fold enhancement of endocytic uptake being somewhat greater (2.33 ± 0.13-fold,n = 29) as compared with selective uptake (2.04 ± 0.10-fold, n = 29) when data in numerous experiments were averaged. However, in terms of total LDL-CE delivery to the cell, the major effect of apoE was on the selective uptake pathway. For example, at 50 μg/ml LDL, apoE expression increased LDL-CE uptake by the selective uptake pathway by about 2000 ng of CE/mg of cell protein, whereas the enhancement by the endocytic pathway was about 225 ng of CE/mg of cell protein (Fig. 2). The LDL concentration dependence for selective CE uptake and for endocytic CE uptake was indicative of both high and low affinity components. This point is illustrated in Fig.3, which shows the LDL concentration dependence for selective (panel A) and endocytic (panel B) uptake for apoE-expressing Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells resolved into high and low affinity components. These data show that, at LDL concentrations greater than 50 μg/ml, most of the LDL-CE selective uptake (panel A) was due to the low affinity component; this component increased further at higher LDL concentrations, whereas the high affinity component was saturated above 20 μg/ml LDL. A similar result was seen with endocytic uptake of LDL-CE (panel B), except that the contribution of the low affinity component was less at lower LDL concentrations; in this case, the low affinity and high affinity components were equivalent at about 150 μg/ml LDL. The cell association of LDL-CE, most of which is believed to reflect cell surface bound LDL particles, showed a similar LDL concentration dependence and a similar enhancement by apoE expression throughout the LDL concentration range as was seen for LDL-CE selective and endocytic uptake (Tables II and III and data not shown). Size heterogeneity within the LDL particle population potentially could bias the selective uptake measurements if the LDL contained a significant fraction of large CE-rich particles that were taken up in preference to the bulk of the LDL. To address this point, LDL was fractionated by chromatography on Bio-Gel A-15m. The profile contained no particles larger than LDL (data not shown), and, within the LDL region of the chromatogram, the particles eluted in a near normal distribution (Fig. 4, panel A). The LDL profile was divided into three fractions (A, B, and C) corresponding to the leading edge, the peak, and the trailing edge, respectively, which were analyzed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. As shown in panel B, the LDL contained two major species with the larger and smaller species recovered preferentially in fractions A and C, respectively, and similar amounts of both species recovered in fraction B. Equal amounts of LDL from each fraction (20 μg/ml protein) were compared for LDL-CE uptake with Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells with and without apoE induction. The results in Fig.5 show that the fractions differed little in selective (panel A) or endocytic (panel B) uptake, with the peak fraction of the LDL profile, fraction B, being 25–50% more active than either the leading or trailing fractions of LDL. The apoE-mediated enhancement of LDL-CE selective or endocytic uptake was similar among the LDL fractions. Similar results were seen with two independent preparations of LDL that were analyzed. These data indicate that LDL-CE selective uptake by murine Y1 adrenocortical cells and the enhancement by apoE are properties of the bulk LDL population and not due to a small fraction of large CE-enriched particles.Figure 5Selective and endocytic uptake of cholesteryl ester from subfractions of [125I,3H]hLDL. Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells were cultured in complete medium in the presence or absence of tet for 4 days. At day 4, medium was changed to serum-free medium containing 2 mm Bt2-cAMP plus or minus tet. After 24 h, [125I,3H]hLDL was added to 20 μg/ml (protein). After 4 h, cells were processed to determine LDL-CE selective uptake (panel A) and endocytic uptake (panel B) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are the mean ± S.E.

We have therefore determined the crystal structures of HIV-1 protease in complex with six cyclic urea inhibitors: XK216, XK263, DMP323, DMP450, XV638, and SD146, in an attempt to identify 1) the key interactions responsible for their high potency and 2) new interactions that might improve their therapeutic benefit. The structures reveal that the preorganized, C2 symmetric scaffolds of the inhibitors are anchored in the active site of the protease by six hydrogen bonds and that their P1 and P2 substituents participate in extensive van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. Because all of our inhibitors possess benzyl groups at P1 and P1′, their relative binding affinities are modulated by the extent of their P2 interactions, e.g.XK216, the least potent inhibitor (K i (inhibition constant) = 4.70 nm), possesses the smallest P2 and the lowest number of P2-S2 interactions; whereas SD146, the most potent inhibitor (K i = 0.02 nm), contains a benzimidazolylbenzamide at P2 and participates in fourteen hydrogen bonds and ∼200 van der Waals interactions. This analysis identifies the strongest interactions between the protease and the inhibitors, suggests ways to improve potency by building into the S2 subsite, and reveals how conformational changes and unique features of the viral protease increase the binding affinity of HIV protease inhibitors.

Virol. 1989; 63: 111-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that a viral-encoded protease is responsible for processing these precursors, and that its inactivation produces immature, noninfectious viral particles, elicited an intense search for synthetic inhibitors. The first competitive inhibitors of HIV protease (PR) were transition-state analogs (peptidomimetics) in which the scissile bonds were replaced with nonhydrolyzable isosteres such as a reduced amide, phosphinate, hydroxyethylene, dihydroxyethylene, statine, and hydroxyethylamine (3Fitzgerald P.M.D. Springer J.P.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of four peptidomimetic protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) to treat HIV infection. Although these compounds are potent inhibitors of the wild-type protease, their therapeutic benefit is, in most cases, short-lived because they select for variants of HIV that have a reduced sensitivity toward inhibitors, as a result of mutations within the HIV protease sequence (6Ho D.D Toyoshima T.

In an attempt to delay the onset of drug resistance, the FDA approved the use of combination therapy, i.e. a mixture of protease and reverse transcriptase antiretroviral agents. Although multidrug therapy has reduced the plasma viral load of some HIV-infected individuals to undetectable levels (11Gulick R.M. Mellors J.W. Havlir D. Eron J.J. Gonzalez C. McMahon D.

Med. 1997; 337: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar), the daunting ability of the virus to rapidly mutate suggests an ongoing need for new antiretroviral drugs. In order to design new and more potent inhibitors of HIV protease, we must improve our understanding of the principles of molecular recognition for the protease. So far researchers have identified two unique features of the viral protease that distinguish it from the human aspartic proteases pepsin and renin: 1) the active form of the viral enzyme is a homodimer, in which each monomer contributes equally to the active site and 2) the presence of a structural water molecular that bridges linear inhibitors to the flap of the protein via hydrogen bonds. Although hydroxyethylene isosteres and phosphinates were among the first C2 symmetric molecules reported to bind HIV PR (12Erickson J. Neidhart D.J. VanDrie J. Kempf D.J. Wang X.C. Norbeck D.W.

The cyclic urea (CU) scaffold is therefore well suited to interact with the viral protease and to discriminate against human proteases.

Diffraction data were collected at room temperature with a R-AXIS II imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV/100 mA (CuKα radiation), equipped with a 0.3-mm cathode and a graphite crystal monochromator. Full data sets were obtained from a single crystal by collecting 30–50 oscillation images, at 2° intervals for 60 min.

Open table in a new tab The energetic contributions of the vdw interactions and hydrogen bonds to the binding energies of CU inhibitors were calculated using the X-PLOR program: the vdw energy was approximated by the Lennard-Jones potential energy function and the hydrogen bond energy was calculated based on the donor-acceptor distance and the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.851: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Although the two energy terms, by themselves, do not provide an estimate of the total binding energy, we believe they can help us gain some insights into the relative binding energies of the inhibitors. Because the inhibitors presented in this report have very similar structures (only differing by their P2 substituents) and bound conformations, variations in their P2 vdw interactions and hydrogen bonds to the protease must be in part responsible for the differences in their K i values. In addition, we believe these two terms can be used to help identify which moieties of our inhibitors interact favorably with the protease. To study the interactions between CU inhibitors and HIV-1 PR, we have solved the crystal structures of the protease in complex with six inhibitors: XK216, XK263, DMP323, DMP450, XV638, and SD146. These CUs are symmetric molecules that possess a common central structural unit: a seven-membered heterocyclic ring, a urea moiety, and diols; and their P1(P1′) and P2(P2′) substituents are attached to C3(C6) (atoms adjacent to the diols) and the urea nitrogen atoms of the ring, respectively (Table II).Table IIProperties of P2 analogs of cyclic urea inhibitorsa Interaction energy associated with vdw contacts between the inhibitor and the protein was calculated using X-PLOR.b Interaction energy associated with hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the protein (excluding the catalytic aspartates) was calculated using X-PLOR (27Brünger A.T.

X-PLOR Version 3.851: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Several design features of CUs were confirmed by determining the small molecule crystal structures of XK263 and DMP323. For example, the seven-membered ring adopts a twisted chair conformation, the urea group is planar, and the configurations of the chiral ring atoms C3, C4, C5, and C6 areR, S, S, and R, respectively. Furthermore, the C2 symmetry of these inhibitors was confirmed by the presence of a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis that passes through the urea carbonyl bond and bisects the bond between the hydroxyl-bearing carbon atoms, C4 and C5. The only deviations from C2 symmetry were caused by the different crystal packing environments around P2 and P2′, e.g. the torsion angles of the P2 and P2′ groups of XK263 differ by 25°, and those of the P2 and P2′ hydroxyls of DMP323 differ by 145° (Fig.1). When XK263 and DMP323 are complexed to the protease, the conformations of their scaffolds and P1, P1′, and P2′ groups are very similar to their uncomplexed states; only P2 reorganizes to alleviate steric strain, e.g. the P2 naphthyl of XK263 rotates 20° toward the flap to avoid steric interactions with Ala28, Asp29, and Asp30; and the hydroxymethylbenzyl and P2-hydroxyl of DMP323 rotate 20 and 85°, respectively, away from Ile84 (Fig. 1). Overall, the similarities between the bound and unbound structures of the CUs indicate that the inhibitors are preorganized for binding. The structures also confirm that the size and C2 symmetry of the scaffold and the stereochemical arrangement of the chiral ring atoms are responsible for placing the urea oxygen near the flaps of the protease, the diols between the catalytic aspartates, and correctly projecting the substituents into the subsites. Finally, the 2-fold axis of each inhibitor coincides with that of the homodimer (Fig. 2), which means that CUs interact with symmetry related residues, e.g.the P2 and P2′ hydroxyls of DMP323 hydrogen bond to the amides of Asp29 and Asp30 and their symmetry-related residues (Fig. 1 and TableIII).Table IIIHydrogen bonds between HIV-1 PR and cyclic urea inhibitorsH-bonding groupsDistance between atomsHIV-1 PRCUXK216XK263DMP323DMP450XV638SD146ÅI50/50′-NO13.3 /3.03.4 /3.43.3 /3.23.3 /3.43.4 /3.03.0 /3.2D25/25′-ODO43.0 /3.02.8 /2.82.9 /3.12.9 /3.12.8 /3.02.9 /2.8D25/25′-ODO53.1 /3.22.9 /3.23.1 /3.12.7 /3.22.8 /3.02.9 /3.1D29/29′-NO26/O26′3.2 /3.2D30/30′-NO26/O26′2.9 /2.9D29/29′-NN-Aniline3.5 /3.6D30/30′-ODN-Aniline2.9 /2.8D30/30′-NO25/O25′3.2 /3.13.1 /3.0G48/48′-ON25/N25′3.1 /3.13.2 /3.1G48/48′-NN28/N28′3.0 /3.13.1 /3.2D30/30′-ODN27/N27′2.9 /2.9Total no. of H bonds6610101214 Open table in a new tab All CUs induce very similar conformational changes in the protease; the r.m.s. (root mean square) deviations between the Cα atoms of any two complexes is less than 0.40 Å. The most notable change induced by CU binding is the well documented 7-Å shift in the position of the flap, which closes over the active site in the complexes (28Miller M. Schneider J. Sathyanarayana B.K. Toth M.V. Marshall G.R. Clawson L. Selk L. Kent S.B.H. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 246: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Although cyclic ureas induce flap closure by directly interacting with the backbone atoms of the flaps, peptidomimetics induce closure with the aid of a bridging water molecule (Fig.3). A superposition of CU and linear inhibitor complexes confirms that the urea oxygen displaces the structural water, as the distances between O1 of XK216 and the structural water molecules in HIV PR-P9941, 2P.

Other conformational changes are more subtle and unique for each inhibitor. For example, Asp29, Asp30, and the C-terminal helix move out of the active site by ∼0.5 Å to accommodate the P2-hydroxyl of DMP323 (29Ala P.J. Huston E.E. Klabe R.M. McCabe D.D. Duke J.L. Rizzo C.J.

Although these structural shifts are relatively small compared with flap closure, they appear to have a significant impact on the binding affinity of the protease. For example, the shift at Asp30reduces steric contacts to DMP323 and permits the formation of a hydrogen bond between Asp30 (NH) and O26 of the inhibitor, and the shift at Gly48 strengthens the hydrogen bonds between Gly48 (CO and NH) and SD146 (NH25 and N28), respectively, by reducing the donor-acceptor distance by ∼0.5 Å.Figure 4CU-induced changes in the protease.Overlay of the Cα atoms of HIV PR-DMP323 (red) and HIV PR-SD146 (blue). Note the contraction of the active site at Asp30 and Gly48 by ∼0.5 Å when complexed with SD146 (green); dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds to Asp30(30′) and Gly48(48′). DMP323 was omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, CU binding reduces the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry of the uncomplexed enzyme to pseudo symmetry; the r.m.s. deviations for the backbone atoms of the symmetry-related monomers in the XK216, DMP450, XV638, XK263, SD146, and DMP323 complexes are 0.45, 0.36, 0.30, 0.28, 0.26, and 0.23 Å, respectively, and only 0.16 Å for the core (excluding the surface loops) Cα atoms of HIV PR-DMP323. Unfortunately, the induced asymmetry cannot be directly linked to inhibitor binding, because the observed structural deviations from C2 symmetry are located in regions involved in crystal packing, i.e. the flap, C and N termini, and surface loops. The interactions between CUs and the protease can be divided into two groups: those that anchor the scaffold in the active site and those that fix the substituents in their target subsites. The most important interactions in the first group are 1) two hydrogen bonds between the urea oxygen and the amides of Ile50 and Ile50′, which contribute a total of 2.3–3.2 kcal/mol to binding, and 2) four hydrogen bonds between the diols and the carboxylates of the catalytic aspartates (Fig. 3). Although we did not attempt to estimate the energetic contributions of the later interactions because the catalytic aspartates are protonated and probably form several nearly isoenergetic hydrogen bonding networks with the diols (30Nicholson L.K. Yazamaki T. Torchia D.A. Grezesiek S. Bax S. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Wingfield P.T. Lam P.Y.S. Jadhav P.K. Hodge C.N. Domaille P.J. Chang C.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we believe the existence of alternate networks should provide even greater stability. The scaffold is therefore firmly held in place by ∼six hydrogen bonds, as evidenced by the lack of lateral movement in the active site when CUs with different P2 substituents are superimposed (Fig. 2). The most important P2-S2 interactions are vdw contacts and hydrogen bonds. XK216 is the least potent inhibitor (K i = 4.7 nm) in this series and its P2(P2′) allyls participate in only 10 vdw interactions. The fact that XK216 possesses the lowest number of P2-S2 vdw contacts and no P2 hydrogen bonds is consistent with its K i rank-order in this series (Tables II andIII). By building larger P2 groups such as hydroxymethylbenzyl, aniline, and naphthyl, the K i values decreased by 15-fold. The higher relative affinities for DMP323 and DMP450 are consistent with the formation of 35 new vdw contacts, which increaseE vdw (energy associated with vdw interactions) by ∼10 kcal/mol, and to a lesser extent, four additional hydrogen bonds, the strongest of which are between the backbone amides of Asp30(Asp30′) and O26(O26′) of DMP323 and between the carboxylates of Asp30(Asp30′) and N-anilines of DMP450, contributing a total of ∼0.5 and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The 15-fold decrease for XK263, however, appears to be in part due to a greater increase in vdw interactions (Table II). The K i values for SD146 and XV638 are 0.03 and 0.02 nm, respectively, which correspond to approximately a 200-fold decrease compared with XK216 and a 10-fold reduction relative to DMP323 and DMP450. The greater potency of these CUs was achieved by further increasing the number of P2 hydrogen bonds and vdw interactions (Tables II and III). Not only do the latter inhibitors have the highestE vdw (50 and 55 kcal/mol, respectively), they participate in 12 and 14 hydrogen bonds, respectively. In both inhibitor complexes, the strongest hydrogen bonds are between Gly48(48′) (CO) and NH25(25′), contributing a total of 3.6 kcal/mol to binding. The number of interactions is so extensive that all of the inhibitors' electronegative atoms (except for the sulfur atom in XV638) are hydrogen-bonded, and the only accessible protein atoms that are not hydrogen-bonded to the inhibitors are Gly27 (CO), Asp29 (OD and NH), Asp30 (CO), and the guanidino group of Arg8, but these functional groups interact with other protein residues,e.g. Asp29′ forms a salt bridge with Arg8. Therefore, XV638 and SD146 are the most potent inhibitors in this series due in part to the following factors: 1) a large buried surface area, in which no unpaired polar/charged atoms (protein or inhibitor) are trapped in a hydrophobic environment, 2) strong P2 hydrogen bonds, and 3) extensive vdw interactions. CUs are nanomolar competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 PR (Table II). Their high potency can be attributed primarily to the design of their scaffold and the high degree of complementary surfaces between their P1 and P2 substituents and the corresponding S1 and S2 subsites. The CU scaffold evolved from a methoxyphenyl ring in which the methoxy group was first replaced with a ketone and then with a urea moiety to improve the hydrogen bonding character of the carbonyl oxygen, and the ring was enlarged to seven members to position diols between the catalytic aspartates (14Lam P.Y.S. Jadhav P.K. Eyermann C.J Hodge C.N. Ru Y. Bacheler L.T. Meek J.L. Otto M.J. Rayner M.M. Wong Y.N. Chang C.-H. Weber P.C. Jackson D.A. Sharpe T.R. Erickson-Viitanen S. Science. 1994; 263: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). These modifications created two hydrogen bonds to the flaps and four to the catalytic aspartates, interactions needed to anchor the ring in the active site (Fig. 3 and Table III). A cyclic scaffold was also chosen in an attempt to reduce the entropy penalty associated with complex formation of flexible ligands. Fortunately, the CU scaffold exists predominantly in a single pseudo chair conformation, whether it is bound to the protease or not, because of steric strain between its P1 and P2 substituents (19Lam P.Y.S. Ru Y. Jadhav P.K. Aldrich P.E. DeLucca G.V. Eyermann C.J. Chang C.-H. Emmett G. Holler E.R. Daneker W.F. Li L. Confalone P.N. McHugh R.J. Han Q. Li R. Markwalder J.A. Seitz S.P. Sharpe T.R.

An important consequence of the ring's lack of flexibility is the requirement for RR, derived from d-phenylalanines, and SSconfigurations of the chiral ring atoms C3 C6 and C4 C5, respectively, to optimally project the substituents into the subsites. The P1 and P2 substituents of CUs interact extensively with the protease through a combination of vdw contacts and hydrogen bonds. While the S1 subsite clearly prefers hydrophobic substituents, the specificity of S2 is much broader, accommodating the naphthyl group of XK263 and the electronegative atoms of XV638 and SD146. Because the scaffolds and P1(P1′) benzyls participate in a similar number of interactions (∼30 vdw contacts) in every complex, the observedK i values for the different CUs are in part modulated by the extent of P2 interactions (Table II). TheK i values for DMP323 (DMP450) and SD146 (XV638), for example, are 15- and 200-fold lower than that for XK216, which is consistent with the fact that an allyl group is too small to fill the S2 subsite (E vdw is only −29 kcal/mol). The most potent inhibitor, SD146 (K i = 0.02 nm), participates in ∼200 vdw interactions and 14 hydrogen bonds, which are evenly distributed around the binding pocket: six to the flaps, four to the catalytic aspartates, and four more to the base of the pocket. Hydrogen bonds, however, are not always required for high potency. For example, XK263, which does not hydrogen bond to the S2 subsite, is just as potent as DMP323 and DMP450 because it has a larger E dvw (−47 kcal/mol) (TableII). Another important feature of CUs is the displacement of the intervening water molecule by the urea oxygen atom. In the XK263 complex, the urea oxygen (O1) clearly occupies the same site as the structural water found in the linear inhibitor complex HIV PR-P9941 (Fig. 3). An independent NMR study also concludes that DMP323 displaces the long-lived water molecule (31Grzesiek S. Bax A. Nicholson L.K. Yamazaki T. Wingfield P. Stahl S.J. Eyermann C.J. Torchia D.A.

Displacing a conformationally restrained water increases the entropy of the system, and direct interaction with the flaps may help to stabilize the closed state of the protease. Many other cyclic compounds now displace the structural water (15De Lucca G.V. Erickson-Viitanen S. Lam P.Y.S. Drug Discovery Today. 1997; 2: 6-18Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Sham H.L.

A. 1995; 92: 2484-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), whereas CUs are cyclic, C2 symmetric diols. Because both classes of compounds are potent inhibitors of the wild-type protease, it is not evident which features are more desirable. Further studies are needed to quantitate the gain in binding energy associated with the rigid CU scaffold; the use of diols, which form a network of hydrogen bonds with the catalytic aspartates, and C2 symmetry, which allows CUs to interact symmetrically with both monomers. The benefit of displacing the structural water molecule, however, is more evident, because human proteases do not use an intervening water to bind substrates or inhibitors, i.e. their flaps interact directly with ligands. This different binding requirement allows CUs to easily discriminate between human and viral proteases. For example, the large CU scaffold can only fit in pepsin's active site if the flap opens by ∼2.0 Å, such a displacement would enlarge the binding pocket and reduce the overall number of interactions to the inhibitor (Fig.5). This is consistent with the fact that a concentration of DMP323 that inhibits HIV-1 PR by 50% only inhibits pepsin by 1% (23Erickson-Viitanen S. Klabe R.M. Cawood P.G. O'Neal P.L. Meek J.L. Antiviral Chem. & Chemother. 1994; 38: 1628-1634Google Scholar). The templates of linear inhibitors, on the other hand, are more flexible and can probably more easily reorganize to fit into the active sites of several different proteases. Therefore, in practice, most linear inhibitors discriminate against human proteases based only on their P1-S1 and P2-S2 interactions, whereas CUs discriminate with their substituents as well as their scaffolds. The rigid CU scaffold therefore not only reduces the entropy penalty associated with complex formation but also plays an important role in discriminating against human proteases. The design of effective antiretroviral agents requires a detailed understanding of the target, for inhibitors that do not interact directly with residues involved in substrate binding or catalytic activity will likely select for drug-resistant variants. The CU scaffold addresses this issue by displacing the structural water molecule and interacting with the catalytic aspartates. These are important design elements, for mutants that displace the structural water with a large side chain will not bind substrates as efficiently, and those that replace the catalytic aspartates with any other residue will be inactive (35Loeb D.D. Swanstrom R. Everitt L. Manchester M. Stamper S.E. Hutchison III, C.A. Nature. 1989; 340: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The CU scaffold is therefore well suited to inhibit mutant proteases. To investigate the structure-activity relationships of the P2 substituents, we built various P2-substituted inhibitors (Table II). In general, the small allyl group of XK216 simply does not interact sufficiently with the subsite to achieve a subnanomolarK i value. A significant improvement was only observed when we increased the size and the hydrogen bonding character of the substituent, e.g. XK263, DMP323, and DMP450. Further attempts at increasing E HBOND (energy associated with hydrogen bonds) generated XV638, one of the first CUs to hydrogen bond to Gly48 of the flap. The thiazole ring of XV638 was later replaced with a benzimidazole to pick up an extra hydrogen bond to Asp30 (OD) (Table III). Apparently, the S2 subsite can accommodate a large variety of substituents, which rely in part on vdw interactions and hydrogen bonds for tight binding. Unfortunately, our most potent inhibitor (20 pm), SD146, is not a development candidate because it is too lipophilic. Based on our structures, however, we might be able to improve the solubility of SD146 by replacing the benzyl moiety of the benzimidazole with a hydrophilic group or simply removing it altogether; either modification should not significantly affect its potency because the benzyl is partially exposed to the solvent and thus does not interact extensively with the protease. Finally, further attempts to increase CU potency might include building off the P1 benzyl to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly27 and the guanidino group of Arg8′, and off P2, to interact with Asp29 (NH and COO).

https://openalex.org/W1972163715,"Thymic shared antigen-1 (TSA-1)/stem cell Ag-2 (Sca-2) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored antigen expressed on lymphocytes. We have previously demonstrated that a signal via TSA-1/Sca-2 inhibits T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T cell activation and apoptosis. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for TSA-1-mediated modulation of the TCR-signaling pathway, we examined whether TSA-1 is physically coupled to the TCR in the present study. TSA-1 was clearly associated with CD3ζ chains in T cell hybridomas, activated T cells, and COS-7 cells transfected with TSA-1 and CD3ζ cDNA. The physical association was confirmed on the surface of T cells in immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. The analysis using stable and transient transfectants expressing a transmembrane form of TSA-1 revealed that the association of CD3ζ did not require the GPI anchor of TSA-1. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ chains was induced after stimulation with anti-TSA-1, suggesting that a functional association between these two molecules also exists. These results imply that the physical association to CD3ζ underlies a regulatory role of TSA-1/Sca-2 in the TCR-signaling pathway. Thymic shared antigen-1 (TSA-1)/stem cell Ag-2 (Sca-2) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored antigen expressed on lymphocytes. We have previously demonstrated that a signal via TSA-1/Sca-2 inhibits T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T cell activation and apoptosis. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for TSA-1-mediated modulation of the TCR-signaling pathway, we examined whether TSA-1 is physically coupled to the TCR in the present study. TSA-1 was clearly associated with CD3ζ chains in T cell hybridomas, activated T cells, and COS-7 cells transfected with TSA-1 and CD3ζ cDNA. The physical association was confirmed on the surface of T cells in immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. The analysis using stable and transient transfectants expressing a transmembrane form of TSA-1 revealed that the association of CD3ζ did not require the GPI anchor of TSA-1. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ chains was induced after stimulation with anti-TSA-1, suggesting that a functional association between these two molecules also exists. These results imply that the physical association to CD3ζ underlies a regulatory role of TSA-1/Sca-2 in the TCR-signaling pathway.

Ching E.P. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 969-973PubMed Google Scholar). Although TSA-1/Sca-2 is a useful marker in early T cell development and T cell activation and seems to play a regulatory role in thymocyte differentiation (6Kosugi A. Saitoh S.-I. Narumiya S. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Wu L. Antica M. Johnson G.R. Scollay R. Shortman K. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 6027-6035PubMed Google Scholar), functions of TSA-1/Sca-2 remain largely obscure.In a previous study, we have analyzed a role of TSA-1 in mature T cells and demonstrated that it functions as a modulator of T cell receptor (TCR)-signaling pathway (6Kosugi A. Saitoh S.-I. Narumiya S. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Saitoh S.-I. Kosugi A. Noda S. Yamamoto N. Ogata M. Minami Y. Miyake K.

Anti-TSA-1 mAb inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ chains and IL-2 production induced by anti-CD3 stimulation in T cell hybridomas (9Saitoh S.-I. Kosugi A. Noda S. Yamamoto N. Ogata M. Minami Y. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5574-5581PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a signal via TSA-1 regulates early and late events in TCR signaling. The findings observed in this in vitro study were further strengthened by the fact that in vivo injection of anti-TSA-1 mAb completely blocked anti-TCR/CD3-mediated apoptosis of thymocytes (10Noda S. Kosugi A. Saitoh S.-I. Narumiya S. Hamaoka T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2355-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, TSA-1/Sca-2 seems to be an important cell surface molecule regulating T cell differentiation and activation by virtue of its ability for modulating TCR-mediated signal transduction. However, since TSA-1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein and thus does not have its transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, it is not known how TSA-1 transmit signals into the cytoplasm of the cell.In the present study, we addressed the above question by analyzing the molecular interaction between TSA-1 and the TCR. The data clearly demonstrated that TSA-1 is physically and functionally associated with CD3ζ chains of the TCR complex, and strongly suggested that the regulatory role of TSA-1 on TCR signaling is based on this intermolecular association.DISCUSSIONMany rodent and human GPI-anchored proteins have been implicated in regulation of T cell activation, since mAbs against these GPI-anchored proteins induce T cell activation as monitored by interleukin-2 production and proliferation. T cell activation induced by a signal through GPI-anchored proteins is dependent upon expression of the TCR; anti-Thy-1 and anti-Ly-6 mAbs fail to stimulate a TCR− variant cell line, and the defect was able to be restored by TCR expression in these variant cell lines (22Gunter K.C. Germain R.N. Kroczek R.A. Saito T. Yokoyama W.M. Chan C. Weiss A. Shevach E.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Sussman J.J. Saito T. Shevach E.M. Germain R.N. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2520-2526PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the positive regulation by GPI-anchored proteins in T cell activation, some GPI-anchored proteins transduce a negative signal that inhibits anti-CD3-mediated TCR signaling (24Codias E.K. Rutter J.E. Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1407-1414PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that a signal via TSA-1/Sca-2 inhibits TCR/CD3-mediated activation and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (6Kosugi A. Saitoh S.-I. Narumiya S. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Saitoh S.-I. Kosugi A. Noda S. Yamamoto N. Ogata M. Minami Y. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. J.

Thus, the TCR seems to be an essential molecule in signaling pathway of GPI-anchored proteins at least in T cells.A number of studies have indirectly suggested that there is a physical and/or functional association between some GPI-anchored proteins and the TCR. By using chemical cross-linkers, it was reported that CD45 is mutually associated with Thy-1 and the TCR, indicating that Thy-1 can physically interact with the TCR through CD45 (25Volarevic S. Burns C.M. Sussman J.J. Ashwell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7085-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In another study, a T cell clone was stably transfected with antisense Ly-6A RNA (26Lee S.-K. Su B. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of Ly-6A was markedly suppressed in this transfectant, but surprisingly surface expression of the TCR was greatly inhibited as well because of the reduction of TCR-β mRNA. The Ly-6A antisense transfectant was then transfected with TCR-β cDNA, and surface TCR expression was reconstituted without the expression of Ly-6A. However, TCR signaling was still impaired in this transfectant due to the absence of Ly-6A.Despite these observations, it seems to be very difficult to demonstrate a direct association of the TCR to Thy-1, Ly-6, or other GPI-anchored proteins in immunoprecipitation analysis. Nonetheless, we are able to provide evidence that TSA-1/Sca-2 is physically associated with TCR in the present study. When TSA-1/Sca-2 expressed on the cell surface was stimulated with anti-TSA-1 mAbs, CD3ζ in the TCR complex was induced to be phosphorylated in its tyrosine residues (Fig. 9). This result indicates that a functional association also exists between these two molecules, and argues against the possibility that the interaction between TSA-1 and CD3ζ occurs merely during the process of solubilization and immunoprecipitation.We do not know why we can successfully detect the physical association of the TCR to TSA-1 among many GPI-anchored proteins. Since none of mAbs against Thy-1, Ly-6A/E, and Ly-6C co-precipitated CD3ζ in an experiment in which both mAbs, PRST1 and GR12, against TSA-1 clearly co-precipitated CD3ζ (Fig. 2), the association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ is considered to be specific. Given that TSA-1 is a GPI-anchored protein and CD3ζ has a very short extracellular portion, the interaction between TSA-1 and CD3ζ could be mediated by an as yet undefined membrane protein, which could serve as a linker between these two proteins (27Brown D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This “linker” protein presumably functions not only in T cells but in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, the association between TSA-1 and the “linker” protein could not be dependent on the GPI anchor, but on primary sequence motifs of TSA-1. An effort should be made to identify the “linker” protein in biochemical analysis.Alternatively, another possibility may account for the mechanism underlying the physical association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ. GPI-anchored proteins are known to be localized to caveolae, glycosphingolipid-rich areas in the cell membrane (28Bamezai A. Goldmacher V. Reiser H. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3107-3116PubMed Google Scholar, 29Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Caveolae are also enriched in signal-transducing molecules, such as GTP-binding proteins, small G proteins, and nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinases (31Anderson R.G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolae could represent a specialized signaling compartment at the cell surface (32Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Although lymphocytes do not have caveolae due to the lack of caveolin, there is the same membrane microdomain that are enriched in glycosphingolipids in lymphocytes (33Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the TCR complex or the CD3ζ may reside in this microdomain, GPI-anchored proteins could be associated with CD3ζ by lipid-protein interactions, thereby forming a signaling compartment at the surface of T cells. Stimulation of GPI-anchored proteins with mAbs results in the delivery of a signal through this signaling compartment. If this possibility is correct, TSA-1 is not special among other GPI-anchored proteins, but our mAbs against TSA-1 could be special among other mAbs against GPI-anchored proteins. Although we can not thus far explain whether and how a transmembrane TSA-1 could be localized in this signaling compartment, the above hypothesis is very attractive, given that most of GPI-anchored proteins have a signal-transducing ability when cross-linked with mAbs.Although the mechanism is not fully understood, our previous finding that a signal through TSA-1 down-modulates the TCR signaling pathway could be explained by the physical association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ. Cross-linking of TSA-1 with the mAb induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD3ζ chains (Fig. 9) through the activation of the Src family tyrosine kinases, which may subsequently cause recruitment of another protein tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70 (34Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Thus, intracellular signal-transducing molecules could be sequestered from TCR-signaling pathways to the TSA-1/CD3ζ complex, resulting in down-modulation of TCR signaling. Studies are in progress to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the TSA-1-signaling pathway.

A number of studies have indirectly suggested that there is a physical and/or functional association between some GPI-anchored proteins and the TCR. By using chemical cross-linkers, it was reported that CD45 is mutually associated with Thy-1 and the TCR, indicating that Thy-1 can physically interact with the TCR through CD45 (25Volarevic S. Burns C.M. Sussman J.J. Ashwell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7085-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In another study, a T cell clone was stably transfected with antisense Ly-6A RNA (26Lee S.-K. Su B. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of Ly-6A was markedly suppressed in this transfectant, but surprisingly surface expression of the TCR was greatly inhibited as well because of the reduction of TCR-β mRNA. The Ly-6A antisense transfectant was then transfected with TCR-β cDNA, and surface TCR expression was reconstituted without the expression of Ly-6A. However, TCR signaling was still impaired in this transfectant due to the absence of Ly-6A. Despite these observations, it seems to be very difficult to demonstrate a direct association of the TCR to Thy-1, Ly-6, or other GPI-anchored proteins in immunoprecipitation analysis. Nonetheless, we are able to provide evidence that TSA-1/Sca-2 is physically associated with TCR in the present study. When TSA-1/Sca-2 expressed on the cell surface was stimulated with anti-TSA-1 mAbs, CD3ζ in the TCR complex was induced to be phosphorylated in its tyrosine residues (Fig. 9). This result indicates that a functional association also exists between these two molecules, and argues against the possibility that the interaction between TSA-1 and CD3ζ occurs merely during the process of solubilization and immunoprecipitation. We do not know why we can successfully detect the physical association of the TCR to TSA-1 among many GPI-anchored proteins. Since none of mAbs against Thy-1, Ly-6A/E, and Ly-6C co-precipitated CD3ζ in an experiment in which both mAbs, PRST1 and GR12, against TSA-1 clearly co-precipitated CD3ζ (Fig. 2), the association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ is considered to be specific. Given that TSA-1 is a GPI-anchored protein and CD3ζ has a very short extracellular portion, the interaction between TSA-1 and CD3ζ could be mediated by an as yet undefined membrane protein, which could serve as a linker between these two proteins (27Brown D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This “linker” protein presumably functions not only in T cells but in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, the association between TSA-1 and the “linker” protein could not be dependent on the GPI anchor, but on primary sequence motifs of TSA-1. An effort should be made to identify the “linker” protein in biochemical analysis. Alternatively, another possibility may account for the mechanism underlying the physical association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ. GPI-anchored proteins are known to be localized to caveolae, glycosphingolipid-rich areas in the cell membrane (28Bamezai A. Goldmacher V. Reiser H. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3107-3116PubMed Google Scholar, 29Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Caveolae are also enriched in signal-transducing molecules, such as GTP-binding proteins, small G proteins, and nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinases (31Anderson R.G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolae could represent a specialized signaling compartment at the cell surface (32Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Although lymphocytes do not have caveolae due to the lack of caveolin, there is the same membrane microdomain that are enriched in glycosphingolipids in lymphocytes (33Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the TCR complex or the CD3ζ may reside in this microdomain, GPI-anchored proteins could be associated with CD3ζ by lipid-protein interactions, thereby forming a signaling compartment at the surface of T cells. Stimulation of GPI-anchored proteins with mAbs results in the delivery of a signal through this signaling compartment. If this possibility is correct, TSA-1 is not special among other GPI-anchored proteins, but our mAbs against TSA-1 could be special among other mAbs against GPI-anchored proteins. Although we can not thus far explain whether and how a transmembrane TSA-1 could be localized in this signaling compartment, the above hypothesis is very attractive, given that most of GPI-anchored proteins have a signal-transducing ability when cross-linked with mAbs. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, our previous finding that a signal through TSA-1 down-modulates the TCR signaling pathway could be explained by the physical association between TSA-1 and CD3ζ. Cross-linking of TSA-1 with the mAb induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD3ζ chains (Fig. 9) through the activation of the Src family tyrosine kinases, which may subsequently cause recruitment of another protein tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70 (34Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Thus, intracellular signal-transducing molecules could be sequestered from TCR-signaling pathways to the TSA-1/CD3ζ complex, resulting in down-modulation of TCR signaling. Studies are in progress to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the TSA-1-signaling pathway. We are grateful to Dr. Yasuhiro Minami for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2020251645,"It has been reported that the polypeptide of thymidine kinase type 1 (TK1) from human and mouse cells can be modified by phosphorylation. Our laboratory has further shown that the level of human TK phosphorylation increases during mitotic arrest in different cell types (Chang, Z.-F., Huang, D.-Y., and Hsue, N.-C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:21249–21254). In the present study, we demonstrated that a mutation converting Ser13 to Ala abolished the mitotic phosphorylation of native TK1 expressed in Ltk− cells. Furthermore, we expressed recombinant proteins of wild-type and mutated human TK1 with fused FLAG epitope in HeLa cells, and confirmed the occurrence of mitotic phosphorylation on Ser13 of hTK1. By using anin vitro phosphorylation assay, it was shown that wild-type hTK1, but not mutant TK1Ala13, could serve as a good substrate for Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase. Coexpression of p21 waf1/cip1, which is a universal inhibitor of Cdk kinases, in Ltk− fibroblasts also suppressed mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1 expressed in this cell line. Thus, Cdc2 or related kinase(s) is probably involved in mitotic phosphorylation on Ser13 of the hTK1 polypeptide. We also found that mutation on Ser13did not affect the functional activity of hTK1. As the sequences around Ser13 are highly conserved in vertebrate TK1s, we speculate that phosphorylation of Ser13 may play a role in the regulation of TK1 expression in the cell cycle. It has been reported that the polypeptide of thymidine kinase type 1 (TK1) from human and mouse cells can be modified by phosphorylation.

In eukaryotic cells, there are two TK isoenzymes: TK1 and TK2, also called cytosolic and mitochondrial TK, respectively. The amount of cytosolic TK1 is increased significantly in cells during transition from G1 to S phase (1Bello L.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 89: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Johnson L.F. Rao L.G. Muench A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 138: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the expression level of TK2 is low and is controlled in a cell cycle-independent manner (3Alder R. McAuslan B.R.

TK1 is highly expressed in dividing or malignant cells, but is absent in quiescent cells (5Kit S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1976; 11: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Gross M.K.

Studies on TK1 regulation have provided a good model for understanding the molecular events that coordinate progression through the cell cycle. It is well documented that the transcriptional and translational activation of TK1 gene expression leads to elevation of its activity in the G1/S phase (11Stuart P. Ito M. Stewart C. Conrad S.E. Mol.

In addition, other lines of evidence have shown that the C-terminal region of the TK1 polypeptide may determine its stability in cells in different growth states, indicating that cell cycle-dependent degradation is also involved in the regulation of TK1 expression (19Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Kauffman M.G. Rose P.A. Kelly T.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1427-1435PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sutterluety H. Bartl S Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that multiple levels of control regulate TK1 expression in eukaryotic cells. Our laboratory has previously reported that TK1 can be phosphorylated in human promyeloleukemia cells in response to growth stimulation (22Chang Z-F. Huang D-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of TK1 was also detetected by isoelectric focusing gel analysis of TK1 purified from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (23He Q. Skog S. Wu C. Johansson A. Tribukait B. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The regulation of TK1 phosphorylation was investigated further during the cell cycle. When cells were M phase-arrested by treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, TK1 became hyperphosphorylated in HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D-Y. Hsue N-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21249-21254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoaminoacid analysis of immunoprecipitated human TK1 polypeptide indicated that serine is the residue involved in mitotic phosphorylation (22Chang Z-F. Huang D-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chang Z.-F. Huang D-Y. Hsue N-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21249-21254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that several potential phosphorylation sites exist for a variety of serine/threonine protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase at serine 194, cyclin-dependent kinase(s) at serine 13 and serine 231, and protein kinase C at serine 30. In this study, we examined the specific phosphorylated site for human TK1 in mitotically arrested TK-deficient mouse Ltk− fibroblasts and human carcinoma HeLa cells, and we identified the kinase responsible for the mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1. The physiologic role of the mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1 was also investigated. TK-deficient mouse Ltk− connective fibroblasts and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For M-phase arrest, nocodazole (NOC) was added to subconfluent Ltk− cells at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for 17 h. TheScaI-BamHI restriction fragment containing cDNA of the human TK1 (hTK1) gene (25Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was treated with Klenow enzyme and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene), yielding pBsTK. pBsTK was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis as described by Deng and Nickoloff (26Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The following primers were synthesized: primer 1, CTGCCCGGCGCCCCCAGCAAGACCCGGGGG; and primer 2, CAAGAAGGCACCAGGCCAGCC. The primers were designed with the underlined nucleotides being changed to convert Ser13 to Ala and Ser194 to Pro, respectively. One primer (5′-TAGAACTAATGGAACCCCCG-3′) that contains a mutation in the BamHI site unique to pBluescript SK(−) was also synthesized and was included in the process of site-directed mutagenesis for the selection of the mutated plasmids. The DNA sequence of each mutated plasmid used for this study was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. For transient transfection of expression plasmids into Ltk− mouse fibroblasts, cDNAs encoding hTK1 and some of its mutants were cloned into the XhoI site of an expression vector, pCDM8, in a sense orientation. These hTK1 expression plasmids were constructed by inserting the EcoRI/ClaI restriction fragment containing cDNA of the hTK1 from pBsTK without or with a desired site-specific mutation downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. For stable expression in HeLa cells, human TK1 cDNA and its mutant, TK1Ala13, were each cloned into the pCMV-2 expression plasmid (Eastman Kodak Co.) at a blunt-endedXbaI/SmaI site, resulting in fusion of a sequence encoding FLAG epitope (MDTKDDDDK) plus 40 residues from the polylinker to the 5′end of the hTK1 coding sequence, by which pFLAG-TK1 and pFLAG-TK1Ala13 were generated. Ltk− cells (2 × 105) were seeded and transfected with a mixture of 18 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 3 μg of plasmid DNA per 6-cm dish. On the day after transfection, cells were washed and then treated with or without NOC for 17 h. Next, cells were then pulse-labeled for 2 h at 37 °C with [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml, Amersham Corp.) in phosphate-free medium. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Two microliters of each lysate was precipitated by 10% trichloracetic acid, and the amount of radioactivity present in the trichloracetic acid-insoluble portion was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. Lysates containing equal trichloracetic acid-insoluble counts were then incubated with antiserum against GST-TK1 for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and washed five times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% deoxycholate and 0.2% SDS. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) for autoradiography, followed by immunodetection using the antiserum against GST-TK1. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) Cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of the expression plasmid, pFLAG-TK1 or pFLAG-TK1Ala13, with 0.25 μg of pRSVneo by the LipofectAMINE method. Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated in the medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418. The medium was replaced every 4 days. G418-resistant clones were selected after approximately 14 days and analyzed for the expression of FLAG-TK of a molecular size of 30 kDa by Western blotting with M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak), which is specific against the FLAG epitope. For mitotic arrest of stably transfected cell lines, 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish were treated with thymidine (2 mm) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 20 h, then released for 8 h, and followed by addition of 2 mm thymidine for another 20 h. After this double thymidine block, cells were washed and treated with NOC (50 ng/ml) for 16 h. For release from mitotic arrest, after NOC treatment cells were washed with PBS twice and refreshed with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Immediately after harvesting, cells were frozen in 70% ethanol and stored at −20 °C until analysis. At this time, the cells were thawed and stained with propidium iodide as described elsewhere (27Geido E. Giaretti W. Nusse M. Methods Cell Biol. 1992; 33: 149-156Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Flow analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer, and the data were interpreted by use of the ModiFit cell cycle analysis program (version 2.0). At least 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. Twenty micrograms of cytosolic protein were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membrane (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% powdered milk, the membrane was incubated with antiserum against GST-TK1 (1:1500) for 2 h, and treated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega) or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham). The alkaline phosphatase color development or ECL detection for the horseradish peroxidase reaction was performed according to the vendor's instructions. Antibodies against p21 waf1/cip1, Cdc2, and Cdk2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Corp. and diluted at 1:2000 for immunodetection of p21 waf1/cip1, Cdc2, and Cdk2, respectively. The construction of pGex-hTK1 and preparation of GST-TK1 fusion protein were described previously (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D-Y. Hsue N-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21249-21254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pET-TK1 was constructed by ligation of a 1.5-kilobase pair EcoRI/BamHI fragment from pGexTK1 into pET-28c (Invitrogen). pET-TK1 expresses hTK containing an N-terminal 44 residues of His-tagged/T7 tag fusion, producing a 30-kDa protein. pET-TKAla13 was generated by subcloning of anEcoRI/SalI fragment, liberated from pBsTKAla13, into the SalI site of pET-28c. His-tagged TK1 and His-tagged TK1Ala13 were produced inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by binding to a Ni-NTA (QIAGEN) column. The His-tagged protein was eluted by a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm PMSF. The proteins were then dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol. The proteins were stored in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin for enzymatic activity assay and storage. TheK m values of His-tagged TK1 and His-tagged TK1Ala13 were approximately 4.8 and 4 μm of thymidine, respectively. V max was 40 pmol/min/μg for His-tagged TK1 and 60 pmol/min/μg for His-tagged TK1Ala13. We carried out the kinetic analysis by using 10 ng of purified His-tagged TK1 or His-tagged TK1Ala13 in each TK assay reaction. GST-TK1 and GST bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) were washed three times in the kinase buffer. HeLa cells without or with NOC overnight treatment were lysed and extracted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin (10 μg/ml each), and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatant at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was used for the kinase reaction. Each reaction contained 100 μg of protein from cell extracts, 0.2 μg of GST-TK1 or GST that was coupled to glutathione-agarose, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 50 μm of ATP in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, GST-TK1 or GST on glutathione-agarose beads was washed several times in lysis buffer and eluted by addition of 20 μl of 10 mm reduced gluathione. The eluted protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Mouse TK-deficient Ltk− cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding human wild-type or mutant types of TK1. Two mutants each contain a single amino acid substitution (Ser13 → Ala or Ser194 → Pro) that generates catalytically active TK1 with similar levels of TK activity when expressed in proliferating Ltk− cells. After transfection, cells were either maintained in the proliferating state or treated overnight with NOC for mitotic blocking. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for immunoprecipitation by hTK1 antiserum (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D-Y. Hsue N-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21249-21254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In proliferating Ltk− cells, phosphorylation of ectopically expressed TK1 was weakly detectable for the wild type as well as the two mutants (Fig.1 A). In NOC-treated Ltk− cells, the phosphorylation level of wild-type hTK1 was greatly enhanced (Fig. 1 B). However, the intensity of phosphorylation for ectopically expressed mutant hTK1 (Ser13 → Ala) was reduced significantly, even though a greater amount of hTK1 was immunoprecipitated in this cell lysate (Fig.1 B). The phosphorylation intensity of another mutant hTK1 (Ser194 → Pro) in NOC-treated L-cells was essentially similar to that of the wild-type hTK1. Thus, serine 13 appears to be an important site contributing to an increased phosphorylation level of hTK1 expressed in NOC-treated Ltk− cells. To learn whether mitotic phosphorylation on Ser13 of hTK1 also occurs in human cells, we established HeLa cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type TK1 or mutated TK1Ala13. For this purpose, HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCMV-FLAG-TK1 or pCMV-FLAG-TK1Ala13, separately, with pRSV-neo as a selection marker. FT and FN cell lines, which stably expressed FLAG-TK1 and FLAG-TK1Ala13, respectively, were established by G418 selection. The expression of FLAG-TK1 in proliferating and mitotically arrested FT cells was measured by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody M2 against the FLAG epitope, followed by Western blotting with antiserum against hTK1. Isoforms of FLAG-TK1, displaying a mobility shift, were detected in mitotically arrested cells (Fig.2 A). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitated FLAG-TK1 from the cell lysate of mitotically arrested HeLa (FT) cells abolished the up-shifted band, indicating that phosphorylation of FLAG-TK1 decreases its electrophoretic mobility during separation on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A). Clearly, alterations in the phosphorylation state of FLAG-TK1 were detectable by immunoblot analysis with antibody to TK1. Because hTK1 can be present as homodimer or homotetramer (29Sherley J.L. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in FT cells endogenous TK1 of a molecular size of 24 kDa could also be detected by hTK1 antiserum in the FLAG-TK1 immunoprecitates recognized by the M2 antibody. We noted that detection of a mobility shift of endogenous TK1 during mitotic arrest was rather unclear. The presence of mobility shift for FLAG-TK1, but not TK1, expressed in mitotically blocked cells might be due to the introduction of several negative charges of residues in the FLAG and fusion region, which somehow allowed a clear separation of the phosphorylated isoform of FLAG-TK1 in SDS-PAGE. Distinct from parental HeLa cells, FT and FN stable cell lines, expressing FLAG-TK1 and FLAG-TK1Ala13, respectively, required a double thymidine block followed by NOC treatment for mitotic arrest. To compare the expression patterns of FLAG-TK1 and FLAG-TK1Ala13 in different phases of the cell cycle, we harvested FT and FN cells in proliferating, mitotic arrest, and recovering from mitotic arrest states for fluorescein-activated cell sorting analysis to assure that the two cell lines had a similar cell cycle distribution for each treatment condition. The parallel cell lysates obtained under these conditions were subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). It appeared that the steady-state level of FLAG-TK1 was relatively low in the proliferating FT cells and increased in G2/M arrested cells. After release from mitotic blocking, the intensity of the up-shifted band of FLAG-TK1 detected in mitotically blocked cells decreased. In contrast, the steady-state levels of FLAG-TK1Ala13 expressed in FN cells remained rather constantly elevated, without the detection of an up-shifted band in different phases of the cell cycle. This result not only confirmed the presence of mitotic phosphorylation on Ser13, but also indicated that conversion of Ser13 to Ala affects the fluctuation of hTK1 expression in different phases of the cell cycle. For a better understanding of the biochemical nature of the mitotic phosphorylation of human TK1, we performed phosphorylation reactionsin vitro. Both GST and GST-TK1 produced in E. coli and isolated on glutathione-agarose were used as substrates for the phosphorylation reaction carried out with the cell extracts. The GST-TK1 fusion protein was intensively phosphorylated in the reaction performed in the extracts prepared from mitotically arrested HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, phosphorylation of GST-TK1 was not detected in the reaction carried out with the proliferating extract. Because GST was not well phosphorylated in either cell extract, the TK1 moiety of GST-TK1 was specifically phosphorylated in the mitotic extract. The phosphoaminoacid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated GST-TK1 revealed that serine is the only residue that is phosphorylated by the mitotic extract (Fig. 3 A). For the phosphorylation reaction of GST-TK1 in the mitotic extract, we also observed a prominent phosphorylated band at a molecular size of 26 kDa. Because this phosphorylated band did not appear in other reactions shown in Fig. 3,A and B, we speculated that a molecule present in the mitotic extract formed complex with GST-TK1 on glutathione-agarose and became phosphorylated in the reaction. Our previous results of in vivo labeling experiments showed that mitotic phosphorylation of TK1 in HeLa cells is reduced significantly by staurosporine treatment at a concentration of 50 nm (24Chang Z.-F. Huang D-Y. Hsue N-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21249-21254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the dosage range for Cdc2 kinase inhibition (31Gadbois D.M. Hamaguchi J.R. Swank R.A. Bradbury E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Staurosporine at a 50 nm concentration could also abolish in vitro phosphorylation of GST-TK1 by extracts of NOC-treated HeLa cells (data not shown). Moreover, the sequence around Ser13 of hTK1 is compatible with a Cdc2 kinase consensus site. These facts prompted us to examine whether hTK polypeptide is a direct substrate for Cdc2 kinase. It has been demonstrated that p13 suc1, a fission yeast protein, can bind avidly to active forms of Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases (32Labbe J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadore J.C. Derancourt J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Doree M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 33Pondaven P. Meijer L. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases can be specifically immobilized by p13-agarose from the cell extracts of the mitotically blocked HeLa. The p13-agarose after incubation with the mitotic extract of HeLa cells was used for the in vitro kinase reaction of GST-TK1. Sepharose CL-4B was mixed with the same cell extract and used as a control. Both p13-agarose and Sepharose CL-4B were analyzed by Western blotting and detected by monoclonal antibodies against Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase to show that both kinases were specifically adsorbed on p13-agarose beads (Fig.3 B). The in vitro kinase reactions of GST-TK1 were carried out in the mixtures containing treated p13-agarose or Sepharose CL-4B beads (Fig. 3 B). Clearly, the TK1 moiety is phosphorylated in vitro by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase that is specifically bound to p13-agarose. We further tested whether the presence of the GST moiety influences the property of GST-TK1 protein as a substrate for phosphorylation. His-tagged TK1 was expressed inE. coli and purified for this in vitrophosphorylation system. Consistently, His-tagged TK1 could also serve as a good substrate for Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase (Fig.4). In contrast, the mutant His-tagged TK1Ala13 could not be phosphorylated by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase. These results clearly suggested that Ser13 is efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase in vitro. From our in vitro data, it appeared that hTK1 can be a substrate for Cdc2 or a related kinase in vitro. In order to determine whether hTK1 polypeptide was also phosphorylated by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase in intact cells, we examined the mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1 in vivo in the presence of overexpression of p21 waf1/cip1, which is a universal inhibitor for cyclin-dependent kinases (35Gu Y. Turck X.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 36Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 37Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3171) Google Scholar). We performed in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling in NOC-arrested L-fibroblasts that had been transfected with pCMV-TK1 in the presence of a control vector or pCMV-p21 waf1/cip1 . As shown in Fig.5, the phosphorylation level of hTK1 was clearly reduced in the cells cotransfected with pCMV-p21 waf1/cip1 . Thus, cyclin-dependent kinase(s) is indeed involved in mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1. Phosphorylation has been considered to play a central role in regulating the biochemical events that coordinate progression through the cell cycle. In the present study, we investigated the mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1. The data presented here illustrate that a mutation converting Ser13 to Ala decreases the extent of mitotic phosphorylation of both native TK1 and recombinant FLAG-TK1 expressed in Ltk− fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively. We designed an in vitro system to show that M-phase kinase was responsible for TK phosphorylation on serine residue(s). We further demonstrated that Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase could carry out this in vitro phosphorylation of wild-type TK1, but not mutant TK1Ala13. Because coexpression of p21 waf1/cip1 in Ltk− fibroblasts could also suppress the mitotic phosphorylation of hTK1 expressed in this cell line in a cotransfection experiment, our data suggest that cdc2 or related kinase(s) is involved in mitotic phosphorylation at Ser13 of the hTK1 polypeptide. We have previously demonstrated that TK1 expressed a 10-fold higher affinity for thymidine in proliferating HeLa cells than in mitotically blocked cells. Because hyperphosphorylation of TK1 in mitotically blocked HeLa cells is accompanied by a decrease in its affinity for its substrate, thymidine, we have proposed that the physiologic function of specific TK1 phosphorylation by M-phase kinase(s) is to decrease its catalytic efficiency to prevent unnecessary synthesis of dTTP in mitotic cells. However, in this study we did not find any significant difference in the kinetic properties of purified his-tagged TK1 and phosphorylated his-tagged TK1 by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase (data not shown). Since we did not rule out the possibility that the extent of TK phosphorylation in vitro was different from that in vivo, the functional significance of phosphorylation of hTK1 during mitotic arrest remains to be established. Nevertheless, we found that mutation of Ser13 rendered a constitutively elevated expression of FLAG-TK1Ala13, independent of the growth state of the cells. These results raise the possibility that phosphorylation of Ser13 by Cdc2 or Cdk2 kinase influences the level of TK1 expression during the cell cycle. The expression of FLAG-TK1, but not FLAG-TK1Ala13, in HeLa cells was increased significantly after double thymidine block and NOC treatment. Recently, it has been demonstrated that thymidine treatment can inhibit the growth arrest-specific degradation of TK1 protein in transfected Ltk− cells (38Sutterluety H. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on this line of evidence, it is possible that the stability of FLAG-TK1Ala13 expressed in HeLa cells was relatively unaffected by the treatment of double thymidine block. Given that the expression of FLAG-TK1 and that of FLAG-TK1Ala13 both are controlled by the CMV promoter, it is logical to assume that the difference of their expressed amounts may result from the effect of Ser13 mutation at the regulatory level of translational efficiency or degradation. Analysis of phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 kinase substrates reveals a consensus that requires a minimum of a serine or threonine followed by proline. A search of the hTK1 sequence for the presence of this consensus showed only two potential sites: the serines at positions 13 and 231. We have also carried out a point mutation on Ser231 located at the C terminus to obtain TK1Ala231 for an in vivo phosphorylation experiment. Our results showed that the phosphorylation levels of TK1Ala231 in mitotically blocked Ltk− cells were not reduced significantly as compared with that of wild-type TK1 (data not shown). We also found that a mobility up-shift was detectable for FLAG-TK1Ala231, but not for FLAG-TK1Ala13,Ala231, in stable cell lines after mitotic arrest (data not shown). However, we cannot be certain whether Ser231 is definitely excluded from phosphorylation. According to these results, we concluded that the mitotic phosphorylation site of hTK1 is primarily on Ser13 by cyclin-dependent kinase(s) during mitotic arrest. What role phosphorylation on Ser13 of hTK might play during the G2/M transition is still unclear. Previously, it has been reported that deletion of the C-terminal 40 amino acids of hTK1 can result in a dramatic stabilization of TK1 polypeptide in HeLa cells that have been released from mitotic blocking (19Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Kauffman M.G. Rose P.A. Kelly T.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1427-1435PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 30 residues of murine TK1 have also been found to be responsible for triggering TK1 degradation during serum deprivation in an L-cell line that stably expresses murine TK1. As the vaccinia virus and related viral TK proteins are highly homologous to hTK1, but lack 16 N-terminal and 42 C-terminal amino acids (39Bockamp O. Blasco R. Vinuela E. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 100: 9-14Google Scholar), it has been suggested that viral TKs have not retained the C-terminal region of the protein because cell cycle regulation is not necessary for virus multiplication (19Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By comparing the amino acid sequence of TK from different species, it was also noted that the sequences around Ser13 are highly conserved in vertebrate TK1s. It has been shown that the truncated form of hTK1 with deletion of the C-terminal 40 amino acids still retains its functional activity (19Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We found that Ser13 is also not required for hTK1 activity. Here, we speculate that both the N and C termini of TK1 have evolved to serve as regulatory domains. At present, it is of interest to determine how phosphorylation on Ser13 and the C-terminal region interact to regulate the fluctuation of TK1 expression during the cell cycle.

We present evidence that human mesangial cells (HMC) bind directly to COL-IV, its major triple helical domain, and the main non-collagenous, NC1 domain. A synthetic peptide, HEP-III, and its triple helical counterpart (THP-III), previously reported to be a heparin-binding domain, also promoted ≈15% adhesion of HMC. HMC bound to solid-phase-immobilized, intact COL-IV (≈75%), isolated NC1 domain (≈15%), and a pepsin-derived triple helical fragment,which lacks Hep-III (≈65%). We further examined inhibition of HMC adhesion to COL-IV and its domains by using anti-integrin antibodies. Blocking monoclonal antibodies against the α2 integrin resulted in 70% inhibition of adhesion to COL-IV and 80% inhibition to HEP-III. Moderate inhibition was observed on the NC1 and triple helical fragments. Anti-α1 antibodies inhibited the binding of HMC to COL-IV, the NC1, and triple helical domains, but not to peptide HEP-III. Anti-β1 antibodies inhibited almost completely (>95%) the adhesion to COL-IV, the NC1, and triple helical fragments; inhibition on HEP-III was ≈30%.

This glycoprotein is composed of three chains ((α1)2α2), but several additional isoform chains also exist), each consisting of a pepsin-resistant, discontinuous triple helical domain and a major non-collagenous NC1 domain at the carboxyl-terminal end. COL-IV contains interruptions in Gly-X-Y repeats of the collagenous domain; 21 of these occur in α1(IV) and 23 in the α2(IV) chain. One interruption located at 100 nm from the amino end of the α1(IV) has been made synthetically (peptide Hep-III) and was described by our group to mediate heparin and cell binding (5Koliakos G.G.

The major collagen receptors have been demonstrated to belong to the β1 subgroup of the integrin family (12Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. J.

In COL-IV, using isolated integrins and fragments of COL-IV, α1β1 and α2β1integrin binding sites have been mapped to the CnBr fragment CB3[IV] (a 150-amino acid segment of COL-IV that is located 100 nm from the amino-terminal end) (14Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill L. Mann K. Kuhn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Further digestion of the CB3[IV] fragment by trypsin yields shorter triple helical fragments. Kern and co-workers (15Kern A. Eble J., R. Goblik J. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), using solid-phase and inhibition assays demonstrated that α1β1 and α2β1use two distinct binding sites located on two neighboring segments of COL-IV. The α2β1 receptor was observed to have more than one site of binding, one of which includes an interrupt in the triple helix located about 100 nm from the amino terminus of the molecule. Also, an α2 integrin binding site has been localized to the CB3 fragment of the α1(I) collagen chain (16Staatz W.D. Walsh J.J. Pexton T. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined integrin-mediated interactions between human mesangial cells (HMC) and COL-IV, because COL-IV is the predominant molecule in the matrix surrounding these cells (17Kim Y. Kleppel M.M. Butkowski R. Mauer S.M. Weislander J. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar). We have used primary cell cultures and EHS-derived COL-IV. EHS-derived COL-IV has the same chain composition as the COL-IV surrounding mesangial cells in the glomerulus (17Kim Y. Kleppel M.M. Butkowski R. Mauer S.M. Weislander J. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, various studies have localized the β1 family of integrins to the kidney (18Hemler M.E. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and to mesangial cells (19Cosio F.G. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1992; 20: 294-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cell surface receptors α1β1 and α2β1specifically mediate adhesion of cells to COL-IV (14Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill L. Mann K. Kuhn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against integrins that perturb ligand-mediated cell adhesion have been used to identify integrin molecules responsible for various interactions with matrix molecules or other cells. We have used the former approach to map the sites of interaction of human mesangial cells to COL-IV. The β1 family of integrins was originally termed VLA or very late antigens and consists of at least six different members (18Hemler M.E. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The β1 integrins are important mediators of cell adhesion and migration; these receptors also influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and developmental processes (20Hynes R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 21Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 22Menko A.S. Boettiger D.

A. 1988; 85: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Additionally, integrins have a central role in extracellular matrix assembly (23MacKrell A.J. Blumberg B. Haynes S.R. Fessler J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24McDonald J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cells may bind more than one matrix molecule and vice versa. Many cells utilize different integrins to attach to different macromolecules; often integrins are induced on the cell surface after exposure of a cell to a matrix molecule (25Roman J. LaChance R.M. Broekelmann T.J. Kennedy C.J.R. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2529-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Also, the same cell may simultaneously use different integrins to interact with the same matrix component (26von der Mark K. von der Mark H. Goodman S. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 632-640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This redundancy is important for understanding the mechanism of ligand binding as well as the functional and signaling specificity of the various receptors (27Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. Tuckwell D.S. Bioassays. 1993; 15: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We report here that a sequence contained in a synthetic peptide, HEP-III, positioned ≈100 nm from the amino-terminal end of the α1(IV) contains a major α2β1integrin binding site of COL-IV. Monoclonal antibodies against the α2 and β1 chains of the integrin family of receptors significantly inhibit mesangial cell attachment to this site in COL-IV, indicating that integrin α2β1 of HMC binds specifically to this sequence in COL-IV. Other well characterized COL-IV fragments, including the triple helix and the NC1 domain, were observed to sustain cell adhesion via a combination of α1β1 and α2β1integrins. HMC were isolated from the kidneys of 19–22-week-old fetuses and characterized as described previously (28Striker G.E. Striker L. J. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 15 mmHEPES, 25 mm glucose, and antibiotics amphotericin (0.25 μg/ml), penicillin G (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were used through passage 5–9, grown in T-75 flasks till 75–80% confluence, and then metabolically labeled for 18 h with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine per T-75 flask. [35S]Methionine was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. COL-IV was isolated from (EHS) as described previously (29Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2467-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The major triple helix-rich domain, which lacks the NC1 and 7 S domains, was obtained by a light digestion of EHS-derived COL-IV with pepsin (Cooper Biomedical Inc.) as described by Yurchenco and Furthmayr (30Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The size of this fragment is ≈400 nm (30Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This fragment also lacks some pepsin-sensitive interruptions in the triple helical domain, including the sequence contained in peptide Hep-III (31Timpl R. Bruckner P. Fietzek P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The major non-collagenous domain or NC1 of COL-IV was obtained by digestion of EHS-derived COL-IV with collagenase (CLSPA Cooper Biomedical Inc.) as described previously (29Tsilibary E.C.

The Peptides. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1980: 1-284Google Scholar) on a solid-phase support as described previously (5Koliakos G.G. Kouzi-Koliakos K. Furcht L.T. Reger L.A. Tsilibary E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264): 2313-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a solid-phase methodology was used for the synthesis of the triple helical polypeptide THP-III incorporating native sequences from the α1(IV) chain (34Fields C.G. Lovdahl C.M. Miles A.J. Matthias Hagen V.L. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 1993; 33: 1685-1707Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Anti-NC1 antibodies were produced as described previously (29Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2467-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated NC1 in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected subcutaneously in female New Zealand rabbits three times at two-week intervals. Two weeks after the last injection the animals were bled, and the antiserum was found to be reactive with the NC1 domain. Monovalent Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion of the IgG fraction of the antiserum. 96-well Immulon 1 plates (Fisher Scientific Co.) were coated with 50 μl of COL-IV, pepsin-derived triple helical fragment, and NC1 domain in serial dilutions starting from 25, 25, and 40 μg/ml overnight, respectively. The triple helical peptide (THP-III) and HEP-III peptides were coated in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline in serial dilutions starting from 200 μg/ml. We have previously determined that under these conditions, ≈45–50% of each of these fragments adhere to plastic (5Koliakos G.G. Kouzi-Koliakos K. Furcht L.T. Reger L.A. Tsilibary E.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In order to block the remaining reactive sites the plates were treated with 200 μl of BSA at 2 mg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C. The [35S]methionine-labeled cells were detached from culture flasks by incubation with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C, washed twice with DMEM, and resuspended to the appropriate concentration in binding buffer (DMEM, 125 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml BSA at pH 7.4). A 50-μl suspension containing 5000 cells was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with binding buffer, and 100 μl of “lysis” buffer (0.5 m NaOH, 1% SDS in distilled water) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 60 °C for 30 min and 45 min in the case of the NC1 fragment. The lysate was transferred to scintillation vials and counted. The binding of HMC to albumin (control, 1–2%) was subtracted. The data were plotted after determining the equimolar amounts of COL-IV and fragments to compare the ability of each component to bind mesangial cells, expressed as a mean of quadruplicate wells ± SD of the percentage of the total input counts/min. Competition of mesangial cell adhesion to solid-phase COL-IV (2.5 mg/ml) was performed with peptides HEP-III and THP-III. Serial dilutions of peptides were preincubated with HMC for 30 min, and then the cells with peptide were added to 96-well plates coated with COL-IV and incubated for a further 30 min. The non-adherent cells were washed off, and adherent cells were processed as described earlier. The data were means of quadruplicate wells and were expressed as a percentage of cell adhesion in the absence of peptide. Mouse mAbs to the integrin receptors α1 (SR84), α2 (P1H5), α3 (P3D11), α4 (P4G9), α5(P3D10), and β1 (P5D2) have been previously described as adhesion-inhibiting antibodies in various systems (36Wayner E.A.

A mAb directed to a cell surface HLA determinant was used as a negative control (W6/32, HB95; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). W6/32 bound to the surface of cultured mesangial cells but did not influence adhesion to COL-IV. Hybridoma culture supernatant or ascites fluid used in inhibition experiments was quantitated for antibody content by the technique of quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Integrins α1, α2, α3, α5, and β1 have been previously reported to be present on mesangial cells (as determined by flow cytometry (38Setty S. Anderson S.S. Wayner E.A. Kim Y. Clegg D.O. Tsilibary E.C. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Subunits α4 and α6were not expressed on these cells. The role of these integrins in adhesion of mesangial cells to COL-IV was examined with an inhibition assay using monoclonal antibodies against several integrin subunits. These were added to solid-phase COL-IV along with [35S]methionine-labeled mesangial cells. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. W6/32 supernatant or ascites was used as a control. Inhibition of adhesion, using saturation amounts of antibodies, was seen only with α1, α2, and β1 integrin subunits. Therefore, the inhibition pattern of COL-IV and its fragments was further studied using these antibodies. All inhibition assays in this study were done in quadruplicate, and the standard error was in all instances <5%. To confirm the role of the NC1 domain in cell adhesion, the adhesion of HMC to COL-IV was studied after blocking the NC1 domain with anti-NC1 antibody. Solid-phase COL-IV, at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, was preincubated with anti-NC1 antibody at a concentration of 1.25 μg/ml. Radiolabeled HMC were added for 30 min. Non-adherent cells were washed off, and adherent cells were quantitated as described previously. Adhesion of HMC in the presence of anti-NC1 antibody was compared with adhesion to COL-IV in the absence of antibody. 96-well plates were coated overnight with 50 μl of COL-IV and a pepsin-derived triple helical fragment at 2.5 μg/ml, NC1 at 10 μg/ml, and HEP-III and THP-III at 50 μg/ml. These coating concentrations were selected, based on direct cell adhesion assays as described above, using the middle of the log phase. The plates were incubated with 2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline to block the remaining reactive sites on plastic for 2 h, and then serial dilutions of hybridoma culture supernatant containing known quantities of antibody were added to each well in quadruplicate. W6/32 supernatant or ascites was used as a control. Inhibition of adhesion on COL-IV was seen only with α1, α2, and β1anti-integrin antibodies, so the inhibition pattern of COL-IV fragments was studied using these antibodies. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach to determine the quantity of antibody in the hybridoma culture supernatant (39Coligan J.E. et al.Current Protocols in Immunology. 1992; (Section 2.1, Suppl. 4, CPI)Google Scholar). The quantity of antibody required to saturate the binding sites on human mesangial cells was determined by flow cytometry. The starting concentration of all antibodies used in the inhibition assays was consistently well above the saturating concentration, as determined by flow cytometry.35S-Labeled cells were processed as described above and were added to each well in 50 μl (5000/well). The adhesion assay was allowed to proceed for 30 min. Then, non-adherent cells were washed off and bound cells were quantitated as described previously. Data were expressed as a percentage of maximal binding observed in the absence of antibody. HEP-III peptide was coupled to activated CH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (40Miles A.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29047-29050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 30 mg of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of Me2SO and diluted to 5 ml with 15 mm sodium carbonate and 35 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.6). The peptide solution was added to 3 ml of preswollen beads and mixed overnight at 4 °C. A mock column was made in parallel without peptide, for use as a control. Unbound peptide was removed with previously used diluent, and reactive sites were hydrolyzed at pH 8.0 with 0.1 m Tris-HCl for 2 h. HMC were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as described earlier and lysed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmoctyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 4 °C. Following ultracentrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the cell lysate was precleared with the mock-coupled Sepharose beads as a slurry by mixing overnight at 4 °C. The lysate was then incubated with the peptide-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The peptide-Sepharose beads were then packed into a column, and the column was washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 20 mm EDTA in lysis buffer lacking the cations. Eluates were incubated with anti-integrin antibodies to immunoprecipitate specific integrins (36Wayner E.A. Gil S.G. Murphy F. Wilke M.S. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Elution fractions were electrophoresed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. Mesangial cell adhesion to the main fragments of COL-IV (the major triple helix and the NC1 domain) was compared with that of the intact molecule in a solid-phase assay. In dose-response cell binding experiments the highest percent adhesion was observed when COL-IV was plated at a concentration of 25 μg/ml and did not increase thereafter. Maximally, approximately 70–80% of the cells adhered on COL-IV (Table I). 2.5 μg/ml COL-IV promoted 30% adhesion of added mesangial cells (Fig.1 A). In similar experiments the pepsin-derived triple helical fragment bound a maximum of ≈65% cells, and NC1 bound ≈15% cells (Fig. 1 A); HEP-III and THP-III peptides bound ≈15% cells (Fig. 1 B). In the competition experiments we used 2.5 μg/ml COL-IV, 2.5 μg/ml pepsin-IV, 10 μg/ml NC1, and 50 μg HEP-III to promote slightly less than half-maximal cell binding. We also examined whether HEP-III in solution competed for the binding of mesangial cells to intact COL-IV. HMC were added in the presence of either peptides HEP-III or THP-III to solid-phase-adsorbed COL-IV (Fig. 1 C). Both forms of peptide inhibited cell adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. THP-III inhibited HMC adhesion slightly better than HEP-III. In other experiments, when the main NC1 site in intact solid-phase COL-IV was blocked with anti-NC1 antibodies, there was a reduction in adhesion of HMC to COL-IV (≈15%) as compared with the absence of specific antibodies to NC1 (Fig. 2).Table IMesangial cell adhesion to COL-IV and fragmentsSubstrateMaximum % of cell adhesionInhibition of adhesionα1α2β1COL-IV75507095Pepsin-IV65802095NC115754595HEP-III15108030 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Inhibition of human mesangial cell adhesion to COL-IV in the presence of anti-NC1 and various anti-integrin antibodies.

Antibodies to the integrin subunits α3and α5, present on mesangial cells, did not inhibit binding. The binding of mesangial cells to COL-IV in the presence of an antibody to the NC1 domain was ≈15% less than in the presence of control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of various integrins in mediating the adhesion of mesangial cells to COL-IV was examined with inhibition assays. In these experiments, monoclonal antibodies against several integrin subunits (reported previously to inhibit adhesion of different cells to various substrates (36Wayner E.A. Gil S.G. Murphy F.

Percent adhesion in the presence of serial dilutions of these antibodies was then determined. From the examined panel of α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, and β1 anti-integrin antibodies, only antibodies against the α1, α2, and β1 competed for the binding of mesangial cells to COL-IV. The maximal observed inhibition in the presence of anti-β1 was ≈95%, in the presence of anti-α1 it was ≈50%, and in the presence of anti-α2 it was ≈70% (Fig. 2, Table I). Antibodies to α1 and α2 together caused inhibition to the same extent as β1. Antibodies to α4 did not result in inhibition, as expected, since α4 is not expressed by mesangial cells (38Setty S. Anderson S.S. Wayner E.A. Kim Y. Clegg D.O. Tsilibary E.C. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these assays, the α1β1 and α2β1integrin receptors mediate the adhesion of human mesangial cells to COL-IV. We further determined whether there was preferential use of α1β1 or α2β1receptors by certain regions of the molecule. In order to obtain these data the inhibition assays were repeated with triple helical and NC1 fragments, as well as peptide HEP-III as substrates immobilized on a solid surface. Anti-β1 antibodies abolished adhesion to triple helical fragments and NC1 domains almost completely when used at the highest concentration. This is consistent with the previous observation that inhibition with β1 was almost complete on intact COL-IV. Only 30% inhibition was seen on peptide HEP-III (Fig. 3, A–C). Antibodies to the α2 integrin subunit inhibited adhesion to triple helical fragments only minimally (≈20%), even at the highest concentration, but effectively inhibited HMC adhesion to NC1 (≈60% at the highest concentration) and HEP-III (≈80% inhibition at the highest concentration) (Fig. 3, A–C). Anti-α1 integrin antibodies also inhibited adhesion to pepsin-derived triple helical fragments of COL-IV and NC1, but inhibition of adhesion to HEP-III was not significant, even at the highest concentration used. When anti-α1 and anti-α2 were combined, inhibition of adhesion to all fragments was almost complete (Fig. 3, A–C). The HEP-III peptide was immobilized to CH-Sepharose, and affinity chromatography was performed with a [35S]methionine-labeled extract of HMC. Equal counts of the eluate obtained with 20 mm EDTA were incubated with 10 μg/ml mAb against α1, α2, α3, β1 integrin subunits and normal mouse IgG as control. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with detection by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation with anti-β1integrin subunit mAb resulted in detection of 116- and 130-kDa proteins (Fig. 4). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the same eluant with anti-α2 and α3integrin subunit mAb resulted in detection of 116- and 130-kDa proteins (Fig. 4). The molecular masses correspond to the α2, α3 (130 kDa), and β1 (116 kDa) integrin subunits (36Wayner E.A. Gil S.G. Murphy F. Wilke M.S. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993"

A recent study by Linet et al. (6Linet M.S. Hatch E.E. Kleinerman R.A. Robison L.L. Kaune W.T. Friedman D.R. Severson R.K. Haines C.M. Hartsock C.T. Niwa S. Wacholder S. Tarone R.E. N. Engl. J.

However, concerns regarding other forms of EMF exposure remain. Since no directly genotoxic effects are exerted by EMF, it is thought that EMF may participate in leukemogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia by influencing their proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation programs (7Zhang X.R.

In a recent study, we discovered that exposure of B-lineage lymphoid cells to low energy EMF stimulates the Src protooncogene family protein tyrosine kinase, LYN, leading to downstream activation of protein kinase C (10Uckun F.M.

These results prompted the hypothesis that a delicate growth regulatory balance might be altered in B-lineage lymphoid cells by EMF-induced activation of LYN kinase. In a subsequent study, we examined the molecular mechanism of enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover in lymphoma B-cells exposed to low energy EMF (11Dibirdik I. Kristupaitis D. Kurosaki T.

Our findings were consistent with a sequential activation model according to which EMF exposure first leads to activation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases. Src family protein tyrosine kinases domains interact with and phosphorylate as yet unidentified immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, leading to recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as well as PLC-γ2 via their Src homology (SH2) domains to the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Subsequently, SYK is activated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases and phosphorylates PLC-γ2 leading to its activation. Activation of PLC-γ2 results in increased inositol phospholipid turnover, production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and protein kinase C activation (11Dibirdik I. Kristupaitis D.

BTK was also identified as the mediator of apoptosis in B-lineage lymphoid cells exposed to ionizing radiation (19Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests an important role for BTK in the regulation of PLC-γ2 activity level (20Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The concerted actions of both BTK and SYK are required for the B-cell antigen receptor-induced PLC-γ2 activation (20Takata M.

Here, we show that low energy EMF exposure initiates a biochemical signaling cascade intimately linked to BTK. Our study provides unprecedented experimental evidence that BTK is the mediator of EMF-induced enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover in lymphoma B-cells.

Merritt's four square coil system is known to produce a large volume of uniform magnetic field. Unless otherwise indicated, the applied vertical sinusoidal 60-Hz field was 0.1 millitesla (1 gauss). The current needed to obtain 1 gauss was 0.7 A. The magnetic field was parallel to the coil axis and was uniform near the axis and the center of the coil system. Cells were maintained at all times in a low AC (8 milligauss) environment except during a single centrifugation step. This was achieved by using a 2-pole motor tissue incubator (CEDCO model IRE 93) with low AC fields for routine cell culture and by defining the lowest field regions within the incubator. Exponentially growing cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in serum-free medium in 1.5-ml capacity microcentrifuge tubes were exposed to the 1-gauss, 60-Hz EMF by placing the tubes at the center of the four-coil field generator contained in the incubator with shielding sheets of metal alloy at the bottom of the chambers. Control tubes were simultaneously placed inside a duplicate incubator without the exposure apparatus. To measure the fields in the incubators, the laminar flow hood, centrifuge, and nearby areas, a gaussmeter (MAG model 25, Magnetic Sciences International) was used. EMF strength was constantly monitored with the gaussmeter and adjusted manually if needed. In all experiments, the coils were activated before the cells had been placed in, to avoid fluctuations of the EMF during turning on the apparatus. The coils were turned off only after the cells were taken out of the exposure system. To evaluate the effects of EMF on the enzymatic activity of BTK, exponentially growing cells were exposed to EMF and, at the indicated time points after EMF exposure, the test tubes were immediately immersed in ice water for 30 s to 1 min. Cells were spun down at 3,000 × gfor 5 min at 0 °C and lysed in a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and 1 mm sodium molybdate as phosphatase inhibitors, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors. Lysates were spun twice at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. 500-μg samples of the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-BTK antibody (3 μl/500 μg of lysate) and immune complex kinase assays (26Uckun F.M.

All BTK kinase and Western blot autoradiograms were subjected to densitometric scanning using an automated AMBIS system (Automated Microbiology System, Inc., San Diego, CA), and for each time point a stimulation index was determined by comparing the density ratios of the kinase and protein bands to those of the base-line sample and using the formula: stimulation index (SI) = (density of kinase band/density of BTK protein band)test sample:(density of kinase band/density of BTK protein band)base-line control sample.

Ice-cold perchloric acid (20%) was added after EMF exposure to the cell suspensions to stop further reaction.

LYN kinase plays a pivotal role in ligand-induced signal transduction events in B-lineage lymphoid cells and is thought to mediate its downstream effects (e.g.activation of PLC-γ2 and inositol phospholipid turnover) by activating the tyrosine kinases SYK and BTK (13Bolen J.B.

We previously reported that exposure of B-lineage lymphoid cells to low energy EMF stimulates the protein tyrosine kinase LYN, and activation of LYN kinase was sufficient and mandatory for EMF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in B-lineage lymphoid cells (10Uckun F.M.

To further elucidate the EMF-induced signal transduction events in B-lineage lymphoid cells, we decided to examine the enzymatic activity of BTK in DT40 lymphoma B-cells after EMF exposure using immune complex kinase assays. We first exposed DT40 lymphoma B-cells to low energy EMF at a constant frequency (60 Hz), but increasing intensities (1–10 gauss), and examined the enzymatic activity of BTK at various time points after the initiate of the EMF exposure. As shown in Fig. 1, 60-Hz EMF exposure at a field intensity of 1 gauss or 3 gauss induced rapid activation of BTK (p77BTK) kinase activity, as reflected by increased autophosphorylation. This rapid activation of BTK was observed in four consecutive independent experiments. The magnitude of activation was less at higher field intensities. Therefore, a field intensity of 1 gauss was used in subsequent experiments. Different domains of BTK are important for its physiologic functions (13Bolen J.B. Curr. Opin.

BTK has a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a TEC homology domain, a single SH3 domain, a single SH2 domain, and a catalytic kinase domain (12Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Immunol.

The PH domain is responsible for interactions with various isoforms of protein kinase C,βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, the precursor to Ins-1,4,5-P3 (35Tsukada S.

The SH3 domain is responsible for interactions with proline-rich sequences such as TEC domains, whereas the SH2 domain facilitates the interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (13Bolen J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the SH2 and PH domains of BTK are required for the activation of PLC-γ2 in B-cell antigen receptor-mediated B-cell activation (20Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), but the same domains are not essential for the activation of BTK induced by ionizing radiation (19Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to determine if the SH2 and PH domains of BTK are required for its activation following EMF exposure. Exposure of control wild-type DT40 cells to EMF resulted in a time-dependent activation of BTK, as measured by enhanced autophosphorylation. While the autophosphorylation showed a 7.9-fold increase at 30 min by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram, the abundance of the enzyme, as determined by anti-BTK Western blot analysis, showed only a 6% increase during the course of the experiment, suggesting altered specific activity. The BTK-protein adjusted stimulation indices (SI) were 1.9 at 2.5 min, 4.6 at 5 min, 6.4 at 15 min, and 7.4 at 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, the magnitude and time course of BTK activation in BTK-deficient DT40 cells reconstituted with the wild-type humanbtk gene were very similar to those of wild-type DT40 cells (BTK-protein adjusted SI at 30 min = 9.6). By comparison, introduction of a SH2 domain-mutant or a PH domain-mutant humanbtk gene resulted in substantially attenuated EMF responses, as evidenced by the 3–4-fold lower maximum SI than in wild-type DT40 cells, suggesting important roles for the SH2 and PH domains in BTK activation after EMF exposure (Fig. 2, C andD). As expected, no BTK bands were detected in immune complex kinase assays or anti-BTK Western blots of DT40 cells, which were rendered BTK-deficient through targeted disruption of the btk gene by homologous recombination knockout, and were used as a negative control (Fig. 3 A). Targeted disruption of the lyn gene abolished the activation of BTK after EMF exposure, indicating that LYN kinase acts upstream of BTK in the EMF-induced signaling cascade (Fig. 3 B). By comparison, targeted disruption of the syk gene did not abolish the BTK activation. However, the magnitude of the BTK signal seemed markedly attenuated in SYK-deficient DT40 cells (maximum SI: 2.9 at 15 min), consistent with the existence of cross-talk between BTK and SYK in generating an optimal EMF response (Fig. 3 C). In accordance with our previous study (11Dibirdik I. Kristupaitis D. Kurosaki T. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Chu A. Pond D. Tuong D. Luben R. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4035-4039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), exposure of DT40 cells to EMF resulted in enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover (Fig.4 A). Because BTK is required for the B-cell antigen receptor-induced PLC-γ2 activation in DT40 cells (20Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we then examined the role of BTK in EMF-induced inositol phospholipid turnover. Targeted disruption of the btk gene abolished the EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal (Fig.4 B). Introduction of wild-type (but not a kinase domain mutant) human btk gene into the BTK-deficient DT40 cells restored their ability to respond to EMF with enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover (Fig. 4, C and D). The lack of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in BTK− and BTK−,rBTK(K−) cells was not due to lower expression levels of PLC-γ2 enzyme in these cells (Fig.4 E). These results demonstrate that BTK is essential for EMF-induced PLC-γ2 activation in DT40 lymphoma B-cells, and its kinase domain is required for the Ins-1,4,5-P3 response. In summary, we examined the molecular mechanism of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased inositol phospholipid turnover in DT40 lymphoma B-cells exposed to low energy EMF. Our findings provide unprecedented evidence that EMF exposure initiates a biochemical signaling cascade intimately linked to BTK. Like the LYN kinase, which functions upstream, BTK plays an important role in initiation and maintenance of signaling events that control the proliferation and survival of B-lineage lymphoid cells. Recent studies demonstrated that BTK regulates apoptotic signals (19Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T.

Therefore, this study further supports the hypothesis that a delicate growth regulatory balance in B-lineage lymphoid cells might be altered by EMF exposure. The mechanism by which exposure of lymphoma B-cells to low energy EMF triggers activation of LYN and BTK remains to be deciphered."

Most Gram-negative bacteria actively secrete proteins to the extracellular medium in amounts sometimes comparable to those achieved by Gram-positive bacteria or by yeast. Polypeptides secreted by Gram-negative bacteria include biodegradative enzymes, toxins, and pathogenicity factors that have important industrial or medical applications. As a result, there is now considerable interest in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that allow a polypeptide to initiate a journey in the cytoplasm and its subsequent routing to a specific cellular compartment. These studies have highlighted the remarkable diversity of the targeting processes involved in bacterial secretion (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol.

Exoproteins taking this two-step route possess a N-terminal signal peptide and use the generalsec machinery for inner membrane translocation. Transport across the outer membrane in the second step requires a secretory apparatus encoded by large gene clusters, which are either specific or common to several exoproteins. Polypeptides transported via the hemolysin-type secretory pathway cross the cell envelope by a single-step process without periplasmic intermediates. Proteins targeted through this pathway have no N-terminal signal sequence and show sec-independent translocation to the medium. However, they require the assistance of accessory proteins, encoded by genes contiguous to the exoprotein gene, which are presumed to form a “pore” or an intermembrane channel. Secretion signals essential for translocation are located in the C-terminal part of these proteins. All proteins transported by these pathways do not contain sufficient internal information to reach the external medium without assistance. By contrast, the unusual secretion system of gonococcal IgA proteases employs a two-step route, but aftersec-dependent translocation of the inner membrane, the periplasmic intermediate is directed to the outer membrane by a C-terminal propeptide, which is subsequently cleaved by autolysis of the enzyme precursor (5Pohlner J.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the culture supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-agarose column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and eluted with a NaCl linear gradient (500 ml–500 ml, 0–0.8m NaCl). The propeptide was eluted in front of the gradient, the protease at 0.3 m NaCl, and the α-amylase at 0.5 m NaCl. The latter was further purified as described (11Feller G. Payan F. Theys F. Qian M. Haser R. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the propeptide were brought to 4 mNaCl and loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (1.5 × 20 cm), subsequently washed with a decreasing gradient (40 ml) from 4 to 0m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Proteins were eluted with a gradient (40 ml) of 0–10% (v/v) isopropanol containing 2 mmPMSF. 1The abbreviations used are: PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EPS, 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4,6-O-ethylidene; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AHP, A. haloplanctis protease. Fractions containing the propeptide were then loaded on a DEAE-agarose column (1.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmPMSF, pH 7.5, and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl (500 ml). An Ultrogel AcA 54 column (2.5 × 100 cm) eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was used as the last chromatographic step. The protease recovered from the first fractionation of the crude supernatant was further purified by Ultrogel AcA 54 and DEAE-agarose chromatography under the above-mentioned conditions, except that PMSF was omitted. The last purification step was carried out on a Beckman System Gold chromatograph fitted with an FPLC anion exchange column (Hydropore-AX, Rainin, 1 × 10 cm) eluted with a gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 15% (v/v) isopropanol, pH 7.5. For further experiments, the purified proteins were conditioned in the appropriate buffers by gel filtration on PD10 columns. An expression vector for the α-amylase precursor (pαH12) was constructed by ligating theHpaI site located 60 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon of the amy gene to the SmaI site of the pUC12 polylinker. This construction was used as template for subsequent PCR and inverse PCR amplifications by VentR DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using optimized conditions described elsewhere (14Cease K.B. Potcova C.A. Lohff C.J. Zeigler M.E. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The vector pαH12WT* encoding for the recombinant mature α-amylase was constructed by PCR amplification of the amy gene using a silent sense primer and the mutating antisense primer 5′-CCTCTAGATTCATGAGGCAGAACTG-3′, which introduces a stop codon and aXbaI site after the mature enzyme coding sequence. The mutations were returned in the template using aPvuII-XbaI restriction fragment. Deletion of the α-amylase coding region in pEPCT was carried out by inverse PCR of pαH12 using silent primers, 24 nucleotides in length, ending at codon GCT for Ala-30 (antisense primer) and starting at codon AAT for Asn-448 (sense primer). The amplification product was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen), phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and circularized by ligation before transformation. Deletion of theamy gene in plasmid pEPST1 was produced by PstI digestion of pαH12 and recircularization of the vector, retaining only a coding sequence ending at Ala-30. The β-lactamase-propeptide fusion in pBLACT was performed by inverse PCR on a construction made of a propeptide coding region (EcoRV-XhoI) cloned downstream from thebla gene (XbaI-SphI) ofPsychrobacter immobilis (15Feller G. Zekhnini Z. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in the polylinker of pSP73 (Promega). Amplification used an antisense primer ending at codon AAC for the C-terminal Asn-362 from β-lactamase and a sense primer starting at codon AAT for Asn-448 from α-amylase. The hybrid coding sequence was then introduced in the kanamycin-resistant vector pBGS18+ (16Spratt B.G. Hedge P.J. te Heesen S. Edelman A. Broom-Smith J.K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) at restriction sites (XbaI-SphI) identical to those of the cloned wild-type bla gene. The sequence of these constructions was checked by double-strand sequencing on an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli RR1 under the constitutive lacZ assistance (no isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction) at 18 °C in a medium containing 16 g/liter Bactotryptone, 16 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, 2.5 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The recombinant precursor and mature α-amylase were purified using the protocol developed for the wild-type enzyme, except that concentration of the supernatant by ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation was required before the first chromatographic step. α-Amylase assay was carried out at 25 °C using 3.5 mm EPS (Boehringer Mannheim) as substrate and excess (23 units/ml) of α-glucosidase as coupling enzyme in 100 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.1. Activities toward the synthetic substrate were recorded in a thermostated Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron) and calculated on the basis of an absorption coefficient for 4-nitrophenol of 8,980 m−1 cm−1at 405 nm (17Rauscher E. Neumann U. Schaich E. von Bülow S. Wahlefeld A.W. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters k cat andK m were determined by the initial velocity method using a nonlinear regression computer fit of the saturation curves. The standard assay of β-lactamase was carried out at 25 °C with 300 μm nitrocefin (Glaxo Group Research) as the substrate in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (18O'Callaghan C. Morris A. Kirby S. Shingler A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Protease assays using azocasein as the substrate were performed as described previously (19Davail S. Feller G. Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17448-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation constantsK d for chloride and calcium were determined by activation kinetics following Cl− or Ca2+titration of the apo-enzymes and fitting the saturation curves by a nonlinear regression analysis of the Hill equation, as described previously (11Feller G. Payan F. Theys F. Qian M. Haser R. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Feller G. le Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23836-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). DTNB titration was carried out in 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTNB, 8m urea, pH 8.0, using an absorption coefficient for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate of 13,600 m−1cm−1 at 412 nm (20Habeeb A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a 0.2-cm path length cell under constant nitrogen flush using a Jobin Yvon CD6 dichrograph. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using a pulsed-liquid-phase protein sequencer (Procise 492, Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer Division, Foster City, CA) fitted with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. C-terminal amino acid sequences were obtained on a Procise 494CT sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer Division) equipped for alkylthiohydantoin analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of protein samples was performed on a BIO-Q electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom). The cloning of the amy gene from A. haloplanctis in E. coli, its nucleotide sequence, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the native α-amylase have been reported previously (10Feller G. Lonhienne T. Deroanne C. Libioulle C. Van Beeumen J. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5217-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The updated nucleotide sequence of the 3′ region of the gene is shown in Fig. 1along with the corresponding open reading frame. These new data indicate that the amy gene encodes an α-amylase precursor composed of 669 amino acid residues. N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of the native α-amylase secreted by A. haloplanctis allow the location of three distinct functional domains of the precursor: (i) the peptide signal made of 24 residues, (ii) the mature enzyme composed of 453 residues with aM r value of 49,340, and (iii) a large C-terminal propeptide composed of 192 residues (Fig. 1). Inspection of A. haloplanctis culture supernatants revealed the occurrence of a 21-kDa protein, which was further purified to homogeneity. N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences identified this component as the α-amylase propeptide and confirmed the unique cleavage site between Ser-453 and Ser-454 (Fig. 1). Electrospray mass spectrometry yielded anM r value of 21,518 ± 1.5, in excellent agreement with that deduced from the gene (21,519). However, electrophoretic mobility on SDS gels leads to overestimated values (see Fig. 5). The propeptide is a slightly acidic protein, having a pI = 5.0 determined under non-denaturing conditions. It contains four cysteine residues. Sulfhydryl titration by DTNB of both the native and the denatured protein in 8 m urea indicates that there is no free thiol group, demonstrating the occurrence of two disulfide linkages. There is no significant difference in the amino acid molar ratios of both native α-amylase and the cleaved C-terminal domain. A search through the GenBank/EMBL data banks failed to reveal any significant homology with known proteins or translated nucleotide sequences, except with the C-terminal region (34% identity in 200 amino acid overlap) of the hypothetical α-amylase from the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (Swissprot P91982). To date, only the nucleotide sequence of C. elegans α-amylase is known, but multiple sequence alignment with the translated protein indicates that it also belongs to the Ca2+- and Cl−-dependent α-amylase family. Its C-terminal extension (200 residues predicted) is possibly involved in secretion or it could serve to anchor the enzyme to the eukaryote membrane.Figure 5In vitro maturation of the recombinant α-amylase precursor.

Western blot using IgG anti-propeptide (data not shown) confirmed the propeptide release.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Secondary structure prediction algorithms (GCG 9.0) suggest a high content of β-sheet-forming residues, with several possible amphipathic β-sheets as indicated by hydrophobic moment analysis. This is further emphasized by the far-UV circular dichroism spectra of the secretion helper (Fig. 2). Secondary structure analysis of CD spectra (21Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar) correctly estimated the α-helix and the β-sheet content (20% and 30%, respectively) of the known α-amylase three-dimensional structure (22Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Protein Sci. 1997; 7: 564-572Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) taken as reference. CD spectra of the propeptide contrasted with those of α-amylase and were typical of a β-pleated protein (50–60%) with a low α-helical content (∼10%). Addition of urea abolished the CD signals and confirms the existence of secondary structure organization of the isolated propeptide. A. haloplanctis is a psychrophilic bacterium efficiently growing at near-zero temperatures (generation time of 4.0 h at 4 °C) and reaching cell densities as high as 5 × 1010 cells/ml after 100 h of growth (Fig. 3). Addition of maltose up to 3% results in a 200-fold induction of α-amylase expression. Fig. 3 also shows that the amylolytic activity is sharply produced in the supernatant during the exponential growth phase. Rabbit antibodies raised against α-amylase and the propeptide were used to study expression of the amy gene in the wild-type strain. Western blot analysis of samples taken at all growth stages (Fig. 4) reveals that α-amylase is expressed in the culture supernatant as a 70-kDa precursor, which further dissociates into the mature enzyme and the free propeptide. The level of extracellular activity correlates with the production of the precursor rather than with the appearance of the mature enzyme, already suggesting that the precursor is active. Neither the precursor nor its two products have been detected in cell pellets.Figure 4Secretion and maturation of the α-amylase precursor in A. haloplanctis culture supernatant.Western blots of cell-free supernatant samples corresponding to the culture shown in Fig. 3. Sampling time and antigen molecular mass are indicated. Upper panel, antigen detection using rabbit IgG anti-propeptide. Lower panel, antigen detection by rabbit IgG anti-α-amylase. Secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to study the maturation mechanism, the precursor was expressed inE. coli. The amy gene was cloned downstream from the lacZ promoter of pUC12, resulting in the production of 60–100 mg of precursor/liter in the host culture supernatant. N- and C-terminal amino acid sequence determinations indicated that the signal peptide is correctly cleaved in E. coli and that no additional post-translational cleavage occurred. This recombinant precursor is fully active (see below), and a native conformation of the propeptide is expected, taking into account the extracellular location of the gene product. When incubated in wild-type conditions (4 °C in sterile broth or in 10 mm imidazole and the medium salts), the purified precursor is stable for weeks. By contrast, addition of filter-sterilized aliquots of A. haloplanctis culture supernatants initiated its cleavage into α-amylase and the propeptide. This demonstrates the requirement for an extrinsic factor (i.e. a protease) in the maturation process. Only one proteolytic enzyme was detected in A. haloplanctis culture supernatants. This 45-kDa protease (AHP) is a metalloenzyme (60% inhibition by excess EDTA) from the serine-protease family (98% inhibition by 2 mm PMSF). AHP has a broad specificity and readily hydrolyses macromolecular substrates such as precipitated casein or azo-labeled casein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of AHP (S-T-P-N-D-P-P-F-D-D-Q-S-Y-Y-E-Q-A-G-) shows strong homology with some other microbial Ser proteases such as those from Bacillus thuringiensis (accession no. JN0369) and Dichelobacter nodosus (no. L18984) and, notably, with the protease from a mesophilic Alteromonas strain (no. D38600). When the purified AHP and the recombinant precursor are mixed in thein vivo ratio (≤1/10 in sterile broth), cleavage into α-amylase and the propeptide occurs at a rate similar to that recorded in A. haloplanctis cultures (Fig.5). Furthermore, the N-terminal sequence of the in vitro processed propeptide is identical to that of the wild-type propeptide, demonstrating that AHP is the extrinsic factor required for the maturation of the precursor. The specific cleavage of the propeptide by the nonspecific AHP protease prompted us to test the action pattern of other nonspecific proteases such as Pronase, proteinase K, and subtilisin. As shown in Fig. 5, these proteases preferably cleaved the precursor in the linker region between α-amylase and the propeptide. Proteolytic cleavage by E. coli proteases was also noted during expression of the recombinant precursor. Indeed, about 5% of the produced enzyme is cleaved before starting the purification procedure. N-terminal sequence of the propeptide processed in E. coli reveals that the cleavage site is displaced between Thr-455 and Glu-456 (Fig. 1). AM r value of 21,331 for this propeptide is predicted from the nucleotide sequence, in perfect agreement with the electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis (21,330 ± 4). It is concluded that the linker region between α-amylase and the propeptide probably consists of a disordered, solvent-exposed loop, prone to various proteolytic attacks. This is also supported by the lack of defined electron density for the last five residues in the x-ray structure of A. haloplanctis α-amylase (22Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Protein Sci. 1997; 7: 564-572Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The foldase activity generally associated with propeptides (8Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) has been probed by removing the propeptide sequence from the amy gene and introducing a stop codon after Ser-453, the last residue of the mature wild-type enzyme. Properties of the wild-type and recombinant α-amylases as well as those of the recombinant precursor are compared in Table I. It is shown that both the kinetic and ion-binding parameters are identical in the three related enzymes. All the cysteine residues of the native α-amylase and of the propeptide are engaged in disulfide linkages. Thus, the lack of significant free sulfhydryl groups, as detected by DTNB titration, also confirmed the absence of misfolded species in the recombinant enzymes.Table IKinetic parameters, dissociation constants, and free thiol groups for the wild-type and the recombinant α-amylasesα-Amylasek catK mk cat/K mK d(Cl−)K d(Ca)2+Cysteines1-aCysteines from the amino acid sequence.Free thiols −1μms −1 · μm −1mmmmol −1mol −1Wild-type780 ± 25174 ± 84.65.9 ± 0.22.10−880.03Native, recombinant (pαH12WT*)792 ± 34168 ± 144.76.1 ± 0.22.10−880.05Precursor, recombinant (pαH12)781 ± 39171 ± 84.66.2 ± 0.22.10−8120.061-a Cysteines from the amino acid sequence. Open table in a new tab Involvement of the propeptide in the secretion pathway of A. haloplanctisα-amylase has been analyzed by genetic modification of theamy gene and its expression in E. coli. Its function of secretion helper during translocation across the outer bacterial wall is well illustrated in Fig.6. When the amy gene (pαH12) is expressed in E. coli, the extracellular targeting of the precursor follows the bacterial growth curve. At the end of the exponential growth phase (≈30 h), about 80% of the total enzyme production is found in the cell-free supernatant of E. coli, 15% is found in the periplasmic space, and 5% remains cell-associated as determined by osmotic shocks (data not shown). The same results were obtained when the amy gene expression was reduced 100-fold (in E. coli BL21 expressing the LacI repressor), showing that the appearance of the precursor in the medium is not the result of its overexpression. By contrast, removal of the propeptide sequence (pαH12WT*) leads to periplasmic accumulation of the recombinant α-amylase (followed by its release into the medium during cell lysis). It is concluded that the propeptide efficiently assists outer membrane translocation in E. coli. The outer membrane integrity has been checked by monitoring the β-lactamase activity in the cell-free supernatants (β-lactamase is a periplasmic enzyme encoded by the plasmid vector and is responsible for the antibiotic resistance). Fig. 6 shows that heterologous secretion of the α-amylase precursor (pαH12) induces outer membrane damage inE. coli as indicated by the release of β-lactamase in the medium, by the slight growth inhibition and early cell lysis. The autonomous outer membrane insertion of the propeptide was analyzed by removing the α-amylase coding region from the amy gene (pEPCT). In order to target the modified gene product into the periplasmic space, the peptide signal and the 30 N-terminal amino acids, which can form the export initiation domain (23Rasmussen B.A. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Anderson H. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9751-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), were not deleted. In addition, the six last C-terminal residues of the mature α-amylase were also conserved. Indeed, sequence alignment with other chloride-dependent α-amylases from insects and vertebrates shows that the bacterial enzyme is six residues longer at the C terminus. These residues can therefore belong to the linker region with the propeptide and were not deleted. The control construction (pEPST1) is identical but only encodes for the peptide signal and the 30 first α-amylase residues. When the pEPCT construct is expressed in E. coli, two gene products recognized by IgG anti-propeptide already appear in the supernatant during the exponential growth phase and further accumulate in the extracellular medium (Fig. 7). As shown by Western blots, one compound corresponds to the wild-type propeptide, whereas the second has a slightly higher molecular mass (±3.5 kDa). It is likely that the propeptide is expressed with the export initiation domain and that cleavage at the linker by E. coli proteases further occurs in the periplasm, as already noted for the complete precursor. Autonomous propeptide translocation also induces outer membrane damage as indicated by β-lactamase leakage, whereas the control vector encoding for the export initiation domain alone does not affect the host cells. The ability of the α-amylase propeptide to export a foreign passenger was tested by the construction of a β-lactamase-propeptide protein fusion. The class C β-lactamase from the Gram-negative bacteriumP. immobilis A5 (15Feller G. Zekhnini Z. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was selected because (i) it is also a heat-labile psychrophilic enzyme; (ii) like other β-lactamases, the recombinant enzyme accumulates in the periplasmic space of E. coli; and (iii) it is devoid of disulfide bonds that may impair outer membrane translocation in E. coli as reported previously (25Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although the α-amylase contains four disulfide bonds but is secreted efficiently. The coding sequence of the propeptide and of the six C-terminal linker residues were fused to the bla gene by inverse PCR and cloned in a kanamycin-resistant vector (pBLACT). The control vector pBLAC4 is identical but only carries the wild-type bla gene. The β-lactamase-propeptide fusion remains catalytically active and provides the usual ampicillin resistance; its specific activity on nitrocefin in clear periplasmic extracts is similar to that of the wild-type β-lactamase prepared in the same conditions. Unlike the native β-lactamase, which remains periplasmic, the β-lactamase-propeptide fusion appears in the cell-free supernatant as shown in Fig. 8. However, the extracellular targeting of the fusion is delayed when compared with α-amylase (pαH12), indicating a less efficient translocation process. No cleavage of the fusion protein was detected in the supernatant by Western blots using IgG anti-propeptide but mild proteolytic treatment using proteinase K, Pronase, and A. haloplanctis serine protease allowed to remove the C-terminal propeptide (data not shown). In most enzymes possessing an N- or C-terminal propeptide, truncation of the prosequence precludes correct folding of the associated enzyme leading to inactive polypeptides. A foldase activity or an intramolecular chaperone function has been therefore attributed to propeptides (8Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have shown that A. haloplanctisα-amylase produced in the presence or in the absence of the propeptide has the same catalytic and ion binding properties (Table I). Owing to the stringent structural requirements for functional substrate and ion binding site formation, it can be safely concluded that the enzyme synthesized without the propeptide is properly folded and, therefore, that its C-terminal domain is definitely not an intramolecular chaperone. By contrast, the propeptide is involved in the translocation across the outer bacterial wall, as evidenced by its autonomous translocation and the extracellular targeting of the α-amylase precursor in E. coli (Figs. 6 and 7). In the latter, propeptide-assisted membrane spanning induces outer membrane alterations, which are likely to be due to differences in outer wall composition (especially in lipids) between the mesophilic E. coli and the psychrophilic A. haloplanctis. The purified propeptide has a high β-sheet content (Fig. 2). Additionally, it is interesting that the 15 last residues of the propeptide can form an amphipathic β-sheet ending with a C-terminal phenylalanine, which are essential features for the correct assembly of most bacterial outer membrane proteins such as PhoE (26Struyvé M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The following two-step secretion pathway of A. haloplanctisα-amylase can be proposed. The 200-fold induction of α-amylase production suggests the occurrence of a maltose-regulated promoter as already reported for some other microbial α-amylases (27Virolle M.J. Long C.M. Chang S. Bibb M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After gene induction and initiation of the translation, the nascent α-amylase precursor undergoes the classical sec-dependent inner membrane translocation, as evidenced by the occurrence of a cleavable signal peptide. The periplasmic intermediate then inserts into the outer wall via its C-terminal propeptide in a way probably similar to other bacterial outer membrane proteins. However, the next specific events involve translocation of the α-amylase domain across the outer wall and the extracellular release of the uncleaved precursor in a native conformation. The last step requires the assistance of the nonspecific AHP protease in order to remove the C-terminal secretion helper by cleavage at the easily accessible linker region. As the precursor is not detected in A. haloplanctis cell pellets, the post-transcriptional events leading to secretion seem very fast, without accumulation of detectable cell-associated intermediates. The propeptide-assisted mechanism of membrane spanning (through or beside a possible β-barrel) and the translocation driving force remain unknown. To our knowledge, few other bacterial exoenzymes possessing a C-terminal propeptide have been reported: Neisseria IgA proteases (5Pohlner J. Halter R. Beyreuther K. Meyer T.F.

According to the available data, the extracellular routing of these enzymes and of α-amylase should follow the same main steps of the above mentioned secretion pathway. However, the propeptide from A. haloplanctis α-amylase precursor is unusual because it remains associated to the precursor in the external medium, it requires external proteolytic assistance for cleavage, it can be recovered from supernatants, and it has no intramolecular chaperone function.

https://openalex.org/W2026170926,"We have recently identified AQPcic (foraquaporin cicadella), an insect aquaporin found in the digestive tract of homopteran insects and involved in the elimination of water ingested in excess with the dietary sap (Le Cahérec, F., Deschamps, S., Delamarche, C., Pellerin, I., Bonnec, G., Guillam, M. T., Gouranton, J., Thomas, D., and Hubert, J. F. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem.241, 707–715). Like many other aquaporins, AQPcic is inhibited by mercury reagents. In this study, we have demonstrated that residue Cys82 is essential for mercury inhibition. Another mutant version of AQPcic (AQP-C134S), expression of which in Xenopus laevis failed to produce an active molecule, was successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using stopped-flow analysis of reconstituted proteoliposomes, we demonstrated that the biological activity and Hg sensitivity of yeast-expressed wild type and mutant type AQPcic was readily assessed. Therefore, we propose that the yeast system is a valid alternative to Xenopus oocytes for studying particular mutants of aquaporin. We have recently identified AQPcic (foraquaporin cicadella), an insect aquaporin found in the digestive tract of homopteran insects and involved in the elimination of water ingested in excess with the dietary sap (Le Cahérec, F., Deschamps, S., Delamarche, C., Pellerin, I., Bonnec, G., Guillam, M.

The existence of molecules implicated in water transport across the cellular membranes has been postulated for many years. The high permeability of certain cell types (i.e. erythrocytes, epithelial cells of the kidney proximal tubules or collecting duct) are not readily explained by simple diffusion of water across the lipid bilayer (1Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores and Plasma Membranes: Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 1-228Google Scholar). In 1992, Agre and co-workers identified AQP1 (foraquaporin 1, initially called CHIP28), which functions in the regulation of water transport across the membrane in human erythrocytes (2Preston G.M. Caroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). In mammals, water channels have been characterized in cell membranes of a variety of tissues such as the kidney (AQP1 (Ref. 2Preston G.M. Caroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P.

In a previous study, we characterized the first insect aquaporin, which we termed AQPcic (for aquaporincicadella, initially called P25). AQPcic is present in an epithelial complex found in the digestive tract (the filter chamber) of an homopteran sap-sucking insect, Cicadella viridis(16Guillam M.-T. Beuron F. Grandin N. Hubert J.-F.

Hubert J.-F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The filter chamber of this insect is highly specialized in water transport, permitting excess of ingested water to be rapidly transferred from the initial midgut to the terminal midgut through a transepithelial osmotic gradient (20Gouranton J. J. Microsc. 1968; 7 (555): 559Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding AQPcic was recently isolated and sequenced (18Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus far, the functional characterization of AQPcic has been performed either by injecting native AQPcic-reconstituted proteoliposomes into Xenopusoocytes (19Le Cahérec F. Bron P. Verbavatz J.-M. Garret A. Morel G. Cavalier A. Bonnec G. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.-F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by microinjection of in vitro transcribed cRNA into Xenopus oocytes (18Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Through this work, we demonstrated that the Hg sensitivity of AQPcic is lower than that of AQP1 (18Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We postulated that this difference may be due to the intramembraneous localization of cysteine residue(s) implicated in mercurial inhibition. In this study, we identify the mercurial inhibitory site of AQPcic by utilizing three AQPcic mutants, in which Cys82, Cys90, and Cys134 are replaced by serine residues. The replacement of Cys82 in AQPcic completely abrogates Hg sensitivity of the protein, suggesting that Cys82 has a critical role in aquaporin function. We further demonstrate that certain mutants when expressed in Xenopus oocytes are not correctly processed and therefore propose an alternative system to analyze such mutants. pSP-AQPcic corresponds to the full-length AQPcic coding sequence subcloned into plasmid pXβG-ev1 (18Le Cahérec F.

The wild type or mutated forms of AQPcic were placed under the control of a GAL10-CYC1 promoter and a phosphoglycerate kinase terminator. The coding region of AQPcic was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two primers: Y1, 5′-GGGGAATTC ATGGCCGCCGACAAGT-3′; Y2, 5′-CGCAAGCTTGAGCTCGTACACTAGTGTCTGGAGCT-3′. The polymerase chain reaction primers contain EcoRI andSacI restriction sites (underlined) used to clone into the yeast vectors' polylinker. These constructs were called pYeDP10-AQPcic and pYeDP60-AQPcic. Mutagenesis on cysteine residues 82, 90, and 134 was performed with theCLONTECH mutagenesis kit (Promega) using pSP-AQPcic vector as a template. Primer PSE (Table I) contains a mutation that destroys the ScaI site of pXβG-ev1 (PSE, Table I), and the mutation primers (listed in Table I) contain the mutated codons. Mutations were confirmed by enzymatic nucleotide sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The coding region of mutant C134S was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers Y1 and Y2 and the pSP-AQP-C134S construction as a template and subcloned in the yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (the construct was termed pYeDP60-C134S).Table IOligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis of AQPcicPSE5′-CTTGGTTGAATTCTCAGCAGTCACAG-3′C82S2345′-CGTGTCAGGG[TCC]CACATCAAC-3′255C90S2605′-CCGTCACC[TCA]GGCCTCCTCG-3′280C134S3875′-CAGGGGCACTCTT[TCT]ATGACGAG-3′410 Open table in a new tab cRNA injections into oocytes were performed as described previously (18Le Cahérec F.

Briefly, oocytes swelling was induced by a 5-fold dilution of extracellular buffer A (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) and was monitored by videomicroscopy.

For mercurial inhibition analysis, oocytes were incubated 15 min in 0.3 mmHgCl2 prior to osmotic shock. For each experiment,Xenopus oocyte total membranes were prepared by the method described in Ref. 24Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Studies were performed using the W303.1B strain of S. cerevisiae (α, leu2, his3, trp1, ura3, ade2–1, can R, cyr +) as described previously (25Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Two culture conditions were used to overexpress the recombinant aquaporins. Yeast transformants containing pYeDP10 vector (called Y10) or pYeDP10-AQPcic (Y10-AQPcic) were grown at 28 °C for 24 h in a minimal medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% casamino acids, and 2% glucose) to OD660 nm = 3. To induce heterologous expression of AQPcic, the cells were diluted to 0.1 OD (660 nm) in galactose medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% casamino acids, and 2% galactose). Yeast transformants containing, respectively, pYeDP60 vector (Y60), pYeDP60-AQPcic (Y60-AQPcic), or pYeDP60-AQPC134S (Y60-C134S) were grown at 28 °C in a rich medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bactopeptone, 0.5% glucose) for 36 h. Induction of protein expression was performed by direct addition of galactose in the culture medium (20 g/liter). The yeast cells were grown at 28 °C with continuous shaking for 16–20 h. Yeast cells were harvested, homogenized with glass beads, and shaken manually, and the total membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (26Centeno F. Deschamps S. Lompré A.-M. Anger M.

AQPcic was purified using a method adapted from the purification of AQP1 (27Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol.

Membrane proteins were solubilized by addition of one volume of 4% N-lauroylsarcosine, 4 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; OG, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; SRP, signal recognition particle. for 2 h at room temperature. The non-solubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 10 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 volume of 1.2% OG (n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside), 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and AQPcic solubilization was performed overnight at 4 °C. Preparation was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min at 10 °C, and the supernatant (containing AQPcic) was recovered and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Millipore). The material was loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with chromatography buffer (1.2% OG, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT). The column was eluted with a 15-ml gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Highly pure AQPcic was eluted at 0.15 mNaCl. To prepare proteoliposomes, lipid solution (23% cholesterol, 77% phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid (9/1, w/w)) was dried to a thin film under a stream of nitrogen. The lipid film was dissolved either in 2 ml of 1.2% OG, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with or without aquaporins. The protein/lipid ratio of proteoliposomes was 1/150 (w/w). The solutions were dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer D (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and filtered through a 0.2-μm Millex GV membrane (Nucléopore). AQPcic proteoliposomes or control liposomes were exposed to an osmotic gradient by rapid mixing with an equal volume of buffer D containing mannitol, and the P f were measured. The concentration of mannitol was sufficient to increase by 2-fold the osmolarity of the mixed solution. Experiments were performed with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SFM3, Biologic, Claix, France) characterized by a dead time of 0.8 ms and a maximal rate of data acquisition of 10 kHz. The light of a 150-watt mercury-xenon arc lamp is driven from the monochromator to the observation chamber (8 μl) by an optical fiber. The increase of the 90° scattered light intensity, corresponding to water efflux from the liposomes, was followed at λex = 430 nm. The data obtained from at least 10 determinations were averaged and fitted to single exponential curves using a software provided by Biologic (Claix, France). The fitting parameters were used to calculate the initial rate constantk (s−1) and the P f (cm·s−1) was determined according to Equation 2.Pf=k/[(S/V0)×Vw×Δosm×ς]Equation 2 S/V 0 (cm−1) is the ratio of the vesicle surface area to the initial volume,V w is the partial molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), Δosm is the osmotic difference between the initial intra- and extravesicular mannitol concentrations, and ς is the reflexion coefficient of the mannitol (ςman = 1; see Ref. 29Zadunaiski J.A.

Immunodetection was performed using polyclonal antibodies raised against the nativeCicadella AQPcic protein (17Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M.-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J.-P. Delamarche C.

In order to identify the mercurial inhibitory site(s) of AQPcic, we constructed three mutants, which contain substitutions to serine at positions Cys82 (AQP-C82S), Cys90 (AQP-C90S), and Cys134 (AQP-C134S) (Fig.1). The mutant or wild type forms of AQPcic were in vitro transcribed and injected intoXenopus oocytes, and water permeability coefficients (P f ) of oocytes were measured after hypoosmotic shock with or without HgCl2 pretreatment. As shown in Fig.2 A, the P f values for wild type AQPcic and mutant types AQP-C82S and AQP-C90S are similar. In contrast, the replacement of Cys134 by a serine in AQP-C134S totally inhibited the aquaporin-induced water permeability (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Expression of wild type or mutated AQPcic inXenopus oocytes. A, The Pf of oocyte expressing wild type or mutated AQPcic were measured under hypoosmotic condition with or without a pretreatment in 0.3 mmHgCl2 for 15 min.

Total membrane proteins were prepared from 10–15 oocytes and amount of proteins equivalent to 1 oocyte was resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane and AQPcic was detected using a polyclonal antibody raised against the native aquaporin.

Although the C90S substitution did not modify the HgCl2 sensitivity of AQPcic, mutation of Cys82 totally abolished the inhibitory effect of mercurial reagent (Fig. 2 A). These results clearly demonstrate that Cys82 is the Hg-sensitive site in AQPcic. To verify the presence and the integrity of the expressed aquaporins, we performed a Western blot with oocyte membrane proteins, using an AQPcic antibody (Fig. 2 B). The recombinant AQPcic or the two mutant AQP-C82S and AQP-C90S proteins were expressed in the injected oocytes (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3, 4, and5, respectively). Although there was a slight difference in the amount of AQP-C90S and AQP-C82S, the P f values measured for these oocytes were similar (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no protein was present in the membrane (Fig. 2 B,lane 6) or in the cytoplasm (data not shown) prepared from oocyte injected with C134S cRNA, suggesting a lack (or undetectable) of protein expression. In order to understand the lack of AQP-C134S protein expression in oocytes, we analyzed translation ability of the C134S cRNA in anin vitro reticulocyte lysate system. Fig.3 clearly shows that AQP-C134S cRNA was translatable (lane 3), as well as its wild type counterpart (lane 1). These results indicate that a single replacement of Cys134by a serine residue can alter expression, stability, or targeting of recombinant aquaporin in Xenopus oocyte. Yeast cells were transformed with constructs derived from pYeDP10 vector (yeast Y10 and Y10-AQPcic) or constructs derived from pYeDP60 vector (yeast Y60, Y60-AQPcic, and Y60-C134S). Heterologous protein expression was induced by transferring the cells in a galactose culture medium for 16–20 h at 28 °C. In minimal medium conditions, yeast concentrations reach values of 2–3.107 cells/ml, whereas values of 9–10.107 cells/ml are obtained in rich medium culture. To verify expression of wild type or mutated aquaporins, total membrane proteins were prepared. Western blot analyses revealed a single 25-kDa polypeptide in Y10-AQPcic, Y60-AQPcic, and Y60-C134S membrane fractions (Fig. 4, lanes 3,4, and 6, respectively), the electrophoretic mobility of which is similar to that of native AQPcic protein (Fig. 4,lane 1). No immunoreactive band was observed in total membranes prepared from control yeast (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and5). Interestingly, the mutation of Cys134modified neither the expression nor the stability of the protein when it was expressed in yeast cells. Treatment of the Y60-AQPcic (Fig. 5, lane 3) or Y60-C134S membranes with N-lauroylsarcosine solubilized most of the membrane proteins except the aquaporin, which remained in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6). AQPcic or AQP-C134S were extracted from the insoluble fraction by addition of 1.2% OG (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 7). Such procedure allowed us to purify significant amounts of 90% pure AQPcic. AQPcic and AQP-C134S were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 5, lanes 9 and 10). Purified AQPcic or AQP-C134S were reconstituted into proteoliposomes, the radii of which were measured by electron microscopy after negative staining (the values are respectively 216 ± 46 nm and 199 ± 71 nm, n= 40). The osmotic water permeability coefficient (P f ) was determined by rapidly increasing the extravesicular osmolarity in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed on proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant proteins prepared from both Y10-AQPcic and Y60-AQPcic transformed cells. As shown on Fig. 6, no significant permeability difference was observed between the two AQPcic proteoliposomes (P f = 10.36 ± 0.7 10−3 cm/s and 10.65 ± 0.9 10−3 cm/s, respectively at 20 °C; Fig. 6 A (mean of three independent experiments)). The P f of the AQPcic reconstituted proteoliposomes was significantly increased when compared with the permeability of control liposomes (P f = 3.2 ± 0.3 10−3 cm/s at 20 °C (n = 3), Fig.6 A). A similar increase of P f was observed with the protein AQP-C134S reconstituted into proteoliposomes (P f = 9.1 ± 0.3 10−3 cm/s at 20 °C (n = 3), Fig. 6 A). To investigate the effects of mercurial reagents on AQPcic permeability, some experiments were performed in the presence of HgCl2. Addition of 1 mm HgCl2 for 15 min dramatically reduced the P f of AQPcic- or AQP-C134S proteoliposomes to values of 3.36 ± 0.1 10−3 cm/s and 3.27 ± 0.15 10−3 cm/s, respectively (Fig. 6 B), similar to control liposomes. However, the addition of HgCl2 had no effect on control liposomes water permeability (Fig. 6 B). Determination of P f for the control liposomes or AQPcic proteoliposomes were then performed at varying temperatures (data not shown). Measurements of Arrhenius activation energies (E a ) indicated an E a of 12.98 kcal/mol for liposomes and 4.49 kcal/mol for AQPcic-proteoliposomes. The low E a value calculated for AQPcic-proteoliposomes clearly indicates that the incorporated proteins facilitate the water transport. These results provide additional evidence that the recombinant AQPcic is responsible of the water permeability in reconstituted proteoliposomes. In this study, we have identified the cysteine residue involved in the mercurial sensitivity of AQPcic. We then showed that a single point mutation of aquaporin can abolish its expression in Xenopusoocyte. Furthermore, we have successfully expressed and purified recombinant aquaporin in yeast cells. With the exception of a few water channels (e.g. AQP4, Ref.5Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), most aquaporins are inhibited by mercurial agents that bind the SH group of cysteine amino acids. Some of the cysteines involved in the Hg sensitivity were identified by site-directed mutagenesis (Cys189 on E loop for AQP1 (Ref. 24Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Cys181and Cys182 in the E loop for AQP2 and AQP5 (Refs. 32Bai L. Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). Our previous results have shown that the sensitivity of AQPcic to HgCl2 was lower compared with that of AQP1 and that the reversibility of AQPcic Hg inhibition by β-mercaptoethanol was partial (18Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The absence of cysteine residue in the E loop area of AQPcic might explain the differential sensitivity of the two proteins. Among cysteine residues of AQPcic, Cys82, Cys90localized close to the NPA box in the B loop, and Cys134 in the C loop appeared most likely as potential Hg-binding sites. Other cysteine residues are localized in/or close to the transmembrane domains and thus are unlikely to be bound by mercury (see Fig. 1). Our data demonstrate that a single mutation of Cys82 in serine abolishes the HgCl2 inhibition of AQPcic, identifying cysteine 82 as the Hg-binding site. Agre and collaborators (34Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have constructed a double mutant of AQP1 (A73C/C189S), in which intracellular Ala73 from the B loop and extracellular Cys189 from the E loop were replaced, respectively, by a cysteine and a serine residue (Fig. 1). When expressed inXenopus oocytes, the Hg sensitivity of this double mutant (A73C/C189S) was two-thirds that of wild type AQP1 (34Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the hourglass model (34Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the residue Cys82 of AQPcic and its equivalent Ala73 in AQP1 are localized deep within the pore. The intramembraneous position of these amino acids might explain the reduced accessibility of the Hg-binding site and, thus, the lower sensitivity of AQPcic or AQP1 mutant to a mercurial reagent. In contrast, Shi and Verkman (35Shi L.B. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have mutated the Gly72 of AQP4 in a cysteine residue (in AQP4, Gly72 is the equivalent of Ala73 in AQP1 and Cys82 in AQPcic). The AQP4-G72C mutant presents a significantly greater sensitivity to HgCl2 than AQPcic or AQP1 mutant. Similarly, replacement of Ala210 by cysteine in AQP4 (the equivalent of Cys189 in AQP1) did not confer mercury sensitivity (5Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that the structures of the channel apertures in AQPcic are closer to AQP1 than to AQP4 ones. Our data showed that the C134S injected oocytes had aP f value resembling to the water-injected oocytes. However, the absence of expression of the mutated protein and/or its instability in Xenopus oocytes might explain the lack of aquaporin function. To analyze the function of the AQP-C134S mutant, we have overexpressed wild type or mutated AQPcic in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The presence of a functional AQP-C134S in the yeast membranes as well as the wild type AQPcic attests that a single replacement of Cys134 in serine changes neither the expression of the protein nor its stability in yeast. It thus appears that this substitution does not provoke the same changes in the expressing machinery of the two cells, which suggests that oocyte and yeast cells behave differently when overexpressing a foreign membrane protein. Xenopus oocytes have been largely used as an experimental system for expression and functional analysis of heterologous proteins (see, e.g., review in Refs. 36Sigel E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 117: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 37Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Tsiuriupa G.P. Pashkov V.N. Mol. Biol. 1994; 28: 725-737PubMed Google Scholar), but the intracellular transport or plasma membrane targeting remains largely unexplained in these cells. In order to study aquaporin function, localization and quantification of the protein of interest are crucial steps. Unexpressed or misrouted aquaporin mutants inXenopus oocyte system have been described previously for some AQP1 or AQP2 mutants. The only partial integration of several (potentially functional) AQP2 mutants in oocyte plasma membrane (39Mulders S.M. Knoers N.V. Van Lieburg A.F. Monnens L.A. Leumann E. Wuhl E. Schober E. Rijss J.P. Van Os C.H. Deen P.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 242-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Mulders S.M. Rijss J.P. Hartog A. Bindels R.J. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F451-F456PubMed Google Scholar), the mistargeting of some AQP1 mutants (34Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the low expression of AQP1-C189W (24Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are responsible of the reduced P f values of injected oocytes. Consequently, a functional analysis of such kind of aquaporin mutants in Xenopus oocytes is definitely not conceivable. In contrast to the limited knowledge on membrane proteins targeting in higher eukaryote cells, the yeast intracellular transport of secretory or membrane proteins is extensively studied (see, e.g., Refs. 41Hann B.C. Stirling C.J. Walter P. Nature. 1992; 356: 532-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Feldheim D. Yoshimura K. Admon A. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Different observations suggest that, in S. cerevisiae, only a subset of preproteins that are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane require the function of a signal recognition particle (SRP) (44Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For instance, yeast cells are viable in the absence of SRP and SRP receptor and may “adapt” over time and thereby gain the ability to translocate many proteins (45Ogg S.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that SRP-mediated targeting is not the only route through which proteins enter secretory pathway. This “adaptation” of yeast cells possibly explain the easy production of high level of recombinant membrane aquaporins in S. cerevisiae. In this paper, we propose a rapid and efficient way to successfully perform functional studies on wild type and/or mutant aquaporins by overcoming problems encountered by mistargeted aquaporins inXenopus oocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2041797074,"The retinoic acid signaling pathway is controlled essentially through two types of nuclear receptors, RARs and RXRs. Ligand dependent activation or repression of retinoid-regulated genes is dependent on the binding of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) heterodimers to retinoic acid response element (RARE). Although unliganded RXR/RAR heterodimers bind constitutively to DNA in vitro, a clear in vivoligand-dependent occupancy of the RARE present in the RARβ2 gene promoter has been reported (Dey, A., Minucci, S., and Ozato, K. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 8191–8201). Nucleosomes are viewed as general repressors of the transcriptional machinery, in part by preventing the access of transcription factors to DNA. The ability of hRXRα/hRARα heterodimers to bind to a nucleosomal template in vitro has therefore been examined. The assembly of a fragment from the RARβ2 gene promoter, which contains a canonical DR5 RARE, into a nucleosome core prevented hRXRα/hRARα binding to this DNA, in conditions where a strong interaction is observed with a linear DNA template. However, histone tails removal by limited proteolysis and histone hyperacetylation yielded nucleosomal RAREs able to bind to hRXRα/hRARα heterodimers. These data establish therefore the role of histones NH2termini as a major impediment to retinoid receptors access to DNA, and identify histone hyperacetylation as a potential physiological regulator of retinoid-induced transcription. The retinoic acid signaling pathway is controlled essentially through two types of nuclear receptors, RARs and RXRs.

Core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are the main protein components of chromatin around which DNA is wrapped in 146-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); RARE, retinoic acid response element; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor; DR5, direct repeat with a 5-bp spacer; T3, thyroid hormone; T3R, thyroid hormone response element; CBP, cAMP response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ExoIII, exonuclease III. segments, forming stable nucleosomal structures. Nucleosome spacing and histones post-translational modifications, and most notably acetylation, varies greatly from one chromosomal domain to another (with hyperacetylated histones being preferentially associated to transcriptionally active chromatin) and have strong effects on gene activity (reviewed in Refs.2Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1996; 86: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar and 3Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Beside these long range effects, chromatin assembly on regulatory regions of eukaryotic promoters affects directly the transcriptional activity of genes. Due to the organization of these DNA sequences into precisely positioned arrays of nucleosomes, transcription factors access to their cognate response elements is in most cases restricted and nucleosome assembly is therefore viewed as a general cellular strategy to repress transcription. In vitroassembly of nucleosomes on short DNA fragments documented this type of effect for many DNA-binding proteins, including Gal4 (4Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), SP1 (5Li B. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear factor 1 (6Blomquist P. Li Q. Wrange Ö. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and TATA-binding protein (8Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and genetic experiments in yeast using the PHO5 transcription unit have established a link between transcriptional activation and chromatin structure disruption (reviewed in Ref. 9Grunstein M. Hecht A. Fisher-Adams G. Wan J. Mann R.K. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Laroche T. Gasser S. J. Cell. Sci. 1995; : 29-36Crossref Google Scholar). However, chromatin organization is also, in some instances, a mean to favor transcriptional activity of genes, as described for the estrogen-regulated vitellogenin B1 gene (10Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, transcription regulation must be viewed as a complex set of interactions involving specific transacting factors, general transcription factors, and coactivators recruitment onto a nucleoprotein complex. The productive interaction of DNA-binding proteins with their cognate response elements is thus conditioned by two parameters: (i) structural features of the nucleosome and (ii) dynamic processes leading to the alteration of chromatin structure by macromolecular complexes such as SWI/SNF (4Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar,11Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Structural features of chromatin also implies a competition between chromatin constituents and transcriptional coactivators (some of which bearing strong structural similarities with histones H3 and H4 (15Xie X.L. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)), which will eventually determine the overall transcriptional activity of genes (reviewed in Ref. 16Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the role of chromatin structure in nuclear receptors binding to their response elements, we have used purified components to investigate the impact of nucleosome assembly on a promoter containing a prototypical retinoic acid response element (RARE). Retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs) heterodimers bind,in vitro, to RAREs with high affinity, irrespective of the presence of ligand. On the contrary, Ozato and co-workers (1Dey A. Minucci S. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8191-8201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) established, by in vivo footprinting experiments, that agonist treatment of target cells is an absolute prerequisite for heterodimers binding to the RARE of the RARβ gene, as it is to observe biological effects of retinoids in vivo. This agonist-dependent occupancy of hormone response element was also observed with the glucocorticoid receptor (17Becker P.B. Gloss B. Schmid W. Strähle U. Schütz G. Nature. 1986; 324: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The transcriptional and DNA binding activities of these nuclear receptors are therefore controlled in vivo at multiple levels, which include post-translational modifications (see for examples, Ref. 18Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10806-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and19Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and by epigenetic mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 20Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Svaren J. Hörz W. Elgin S.C.R. Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 89-103Google Scholar and 21Minucci S. Ozato K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation observed in the presence of RAR and RXR is triggered by binding of heterodimers to RAREs that consist, in most cases, of a direct repeat (DR) of the sequence PuGGTCA. A direct repeat of the hexanucleotide PuG(G/T)TCA spaced by five nucleotides favors the binding of RXR/RAR heterodimers, whereas a spacing of four, three, or one base converts the direct repeat into a thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and 9-cis-RA or PPAR response element, respectively (Ref. 22Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1993; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 23Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). RXR/RAR heterodimers display the highest affinity for half-sites spaced by 5 bp (DR5) and a lower affinity for half-sites having a 2-bp spacing. DR1 RAREs accommodate heterodimer binding in an opposite polarity (i.e. RAR being the 3′-bound receptor) (reviewed in Ref. 24Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly on DNA sequences containing such direct repeats should therefore introduce two new types of constraints upon RXR/RAR heterodimer binding to DNA, as a consequence of the helical nature of the DNA. The first type of constraint is defined by the translational phasing of the nucleosome, which describes 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the octamer core on the linear DNA sequence and thus identify the dyad axis of the nucleosomal core particle. Transcription factors access to their cognate DNA-binding site is facilitated when protein-DNA interactions take place close to nucleosome boundaries, reflecting a looser interaction of DNA with histones, as demonstrated for the glucocorticoid receptor (25Li Q. Wrange Ö. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The second type of constraint is the rotational phasing within the nucleosome core, which reflects the orientation of any segment of DNA relative to the core histone surface (26Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In this work, we have first examined the positioning of histone octamers in vitro on a retinoid-regulated promoter, the P2 promoter of the human retinoic acid receptor β (RAR-β2) that contains a DR5 response element (β-RARE (27de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H.G. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar)). We find that nucleosomes assembled spontaneously on DNA fragments from the RARβ gene P2 promoter at a position placing the β-RARE at the dyad axis of the core particle. Binding of purified hRARα/hRXRα heterodimers was prevented by the wrapping of the RARE around the native octamer. On the contrary, heterodimer binding could be observed when histone tails were removed by limited proteolysis and when histones were hyperacetylated, suggesting a critical role of this post-translational modification in the regulation of the DNA binding activity of retinoids receptorsin vivo. Antiproteases, trypsin, and trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma. Taq DNA polymerase was from Life Technologies, Inc.

Restriction enzymes and agarose were from Promega (Madison, WI), oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Le Sart-Tilman, Belgium). Acrylamide and bisacrylamide mixture (Protogel) were from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). The JM109 bacterial strain was used for all subcloning procedures, whereas the M15 strain (Qiagen) was used for the overexpression of both His6-hRARα and His6-Flag-hRXRα (18Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P.

HeLa cells were used as a source for core histones and grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml) to 80–90% confluency prior to harvesting and histone octamer extraction. Core histones were prepared essentially as described in Côté et al. (32Côté J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 6: 108-128Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The entire procedure was carried out at 4 °C. HeLa cells from 20 T225 flasks were collected in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and washed twice with this buffer. 20 pellet volumes of buffer CLB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 were added and cells broken by 10–15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 × g and the nuclei pellet washed twice with buffer CLB. 50 ml of buffer TNE400 (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin) was added for 12 mg of DNA and the mixture was stirred gently for 15 min. Nuclei were pelleted and washed once with buffer TNE400, then resuspended in buffer PB600 (50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 0.6 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin). While stirring, 20 g of dry hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad) was added per 12 mg of DNA. The slurry was poured in a Econo column (5.0 × 20.0 cm, Bio-Rad) and the flow-through was discarded. The resin was washed with 15 volumes of buffer PB600 and core histones were eluted from the matrix with buffer PB2500 (50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 2.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm leupeptin). OD280 was monitored and fractions containing more than 2 mg/ml histones were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. Hyperacetylated histones were prepared as above except that cells were treated for 18 h with 10 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma). Cross-linking experiments were performed using dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Histones were fractionated on 17% polyacrylamide, 0.9 macetic acid, 6.25 m urea as described by Panyim and Chalkley (29Panyim S. Chalkley R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) on 20-cm gels. Gels were run at 20 mA for 15 h and stained with Coomassie Blue. In this system, the expected order of migration is H1-H3-H2A, H2B-H4 (from top to bottom). Full-length hRARα and hRXRα were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography to homogeneity as described previously (30Rachez C. Sautiere P. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem,. 1996; 271: 17996-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). hRARα was expressed as a NH2-terminal fusion protein with a His6 tag, whereas hRXRα was fused to the His6 tag upstream of the Flag epitope (IBI-Kodak, Rochester, NY). hRXRα was eluted from the affinity matrix by enterokinase cleavage, thereby removing the His6 tag from the protein. Both receptors were expressed in the M15 Escherichia coli strain. Monoclonal antibodies directed against MRGS-His6 and Flag epitopes were purchased from Qiagen and IBI-Kodak, respectively. The bacterial expression vectors pQE9-hRARα and pQE9-His6-F-hRXRα have been described previously (18Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol.

Milligram amounts of plasmid DNA were cut and selectively dephosphorylated at one end by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Promega), and the resulting insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. After phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA fragments were ethanol-precipitated and quantified. 10 pmol were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by gel-filtration using standard procedures (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Liss Div., John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted essentially as described in Ref.32Côté J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 6: 108-128Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, except that the dialysis step was replaced by a serial dilution in buffer NRB (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) from 2 m NaCl to 1.5, 1.2, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.3 mNaCl to reach a final volume of 200 μl. Typically, 50–100 ng of end-labeled probe (1–5 × 106 cpm, 300 fmol) were mixed with varying core histones amounts, so as to obtain a histone:DNA mass ratio ranging from 0.5 to 3, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 μg of bovine serum albumin. Naked DNA controls were obtained by performing similar dilutions in the absence of histones, which were added after the last dilution step. Aliquots of each reconstitute were analyzed on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) and samples containing more than 90% of reconstituted octamer-DNA complexes were used in further experiments. The final concentration of nucleosome core particles was around 5–10 fmol/μl. Reconstitutes or naked DNAs were treated with either DNase I or exonuclease III prior to DNA extraction and resolving of DNA fragments on 6% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gels. 15 μl of reconstitution or control mixtures (about 30,000–40,000 cpm) were brought to 5 mm MgCl2 and CaCl2 and 1 unit of DNase I (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) was added. Digestions were for 0 to 8 min at room temperature (∼22 °C), and stopped by addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). 10 μg of proteinase K was added per sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. DNAs were extracted with phenol and phenol/chloroform prior to ethanol precipitation. Exonuclease III protection experiments were run similarly except that samples were brought to 4 mm MgCl2, and digested with 200 units of exonuclease III (Appligene/Oncor, Strasbourg, France). Linear amplification of the coding strand was performed using standard polymerase chain reaction conditions (33Lefebvre B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 186PubMed Google Scholar) and the 19-mer oligonucleotide 5′-ACACAGAATGAAAGATTGAATT-3′. 1 pmol of 5′-end labeled primer was used in a reaction mixture containing 1.5 mmMgCl2 and ∼30 femtomoles of DNase I-treated, non-labeled DNA. Thermocycling was performed using 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 41 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Amplification products were phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on 8% acrylamide, 6m urea sequencing gels. Binding reactions and electrophoresis were run as described in Ref. 18Lefebvre P. Gaub M.P. Tahayato A. Rochette-Egly C. Formstecher P. J. Biol.

Unless mentioned otherwise, ∼30,000 cpm of naked DNA or reconstituted nucleosomes (about 10 fmol) were combined in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 1 to 5 pmol of purified His6-hRARα and/or F-hRXRα. Complexes were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE at 4 °C at 20 volts/cm (8–10 mA), or when mentioned on 1% agarose gels in 0.5 × TAE buffer (10 V/cm, 35 mA for 3 h at 4 °C). 1 × TAE is 90 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA. Antibodies used in supershift experiments were those used for Western blot analysis of receptor preparations. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection of His6-hRARα and F-hRXRα was performed as described previously using the IBI BioMax system (19Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The protein content of receptor preparations was assayed by the Bradford assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sequencing reactions were run using32P-labeled primers and dideoxynucleotides mixes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham/U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequencing reactions were run using the native pPro-RAREβ plasmid as a template, yielding DNA ladders extending beyond the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA fragment used in reconstitution experiments. In this study, we used purified core histones from HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A andB) to reconstitute nucleosome core particles following dilution from high salt. As shown by SDS-PAGE fractionation of core histones, histone H1 concentration was less than 3% of total histones (Fig. 1 A). Histone oligomers were further characterized by cross-linking to characterize the octameric structure of purified histones. The main cross-linked band appeared to be an octamer, indicating that our starting material for reconstitution experiments is indeed a stable core nucleosome. DNA fragments used in nucleosome reconstitution experiments contain a RARE organized as a direct repeat of two hexanucleotides separated by 5 bp (DR5). An imperfect DR5 RARE (DR5) is also found 14 bp upstream of this RARE, whereas the TATA box is located 6 bp downstream of the DR5 sequence. Additional cis-acting elements are also present in this sequence (Fig. 4). Labeled DNA fragments of varying length (326, 240, and 182 bp, Fig. 1 C) containing these functional cis-acting elements were used to investigate whether they can assemble into a nucleosome core in the presence of histone octamers. Similar amounts of each DNA fragment were thus used as a template for nucleosome assembly with increasing amount of histones. As expected, DNA fragments above 200 bp generated complexes displaying discrete electrophoretic mobilities, indicative of the association of several histone octamers on these DNAs, or of distinct octamer positioning (Fig. 1 C). More interestingly, the 182-bp fragment showed a strong propensity to form a unique, low mobility complex in similar conditions.Figure 4Sequence of the wild-type RAR-β2 promoter fragment used in reconstitution experiments. Assignment of nucleosome boundaries and rotational phasing. A summary of the exonuclease III and DNase I protection patterns shown in Figs. 2 and 3on the wild type RAR-β2 promoter are shown. Sequence has been truncated at 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the nucleosome (+112/−34).Dots indicate the nucleosome-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites detected on the coding strand, whereas trianglesdepict DNase I-hypersensitive sites detected on the noncoding strand. Positions of the imperfect DR5 element, as well as that of the canonical DR5 RARE and of the TATA box are indicated between the two strands. Additional cis-acting elements such as a cAMP-response element (−99 to −92), a AP-1 response element (−84 to −78), and a Inr element (−8 to +5) have also been characterized in this promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether this product has features of native nucleosomes, we first optimized reconstitution parameters to obtain >95% of the probe reconstituted in nucleosome cores by carefully adjusting the histone:DNA mass ratio, which was found to be optimal in the 0.8 to 3.0 range in our conditions (Fig.2 A). Boundaries of the core particle were determined by the exonuclease III protection assay (Fig.2 B). This enzyme digests from the 3′ end to the 5′ end of DNA and its progression along the sequence is strongly, but not totally, inhibited by proteins bound to DNA. Thus translational positioning of the reconstituted nucleosome can be analyzed by the ExoIII assay (Fig. 2 B). The protection pattern of the labeled top strand indicated a major histone-induced ExoIII stop at position +32 (see Fig. 4 for sequence numbering), with weaker protections being observed at positions +42, +52, + 62. On the contrary, no stop to ExoIII progression could be detected for the 5′-labeled lower strand, suggesting that histone octamers position preferentially at the 5′ end of this particular DNA fragment. Thus these data define a ∼150-bp segment on which nucleosome cores adopt a preferential, but not unique, positioning. The nucleosomal structure of this complex was further characterized by DNase I experiments (Fig.3). DNase I cleavage sites (which correspond to a maximal accessibility of the DNA minor groove) on reconstitutes were clearly different from these of naked DNA. A periodic pattern extended from −101 to +2 on the upper strand, but the −61 to −20 segment was consistently found to be less accessible to DNase I cleavage for reasons that are not clear to us. Thus DNase I-generated fragments were amplified by a linear polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 3 B) to fully characterize the rotational positioning of the double helix over the DR5 RARE and TATA box sequences. Again, a highly 10–11 bp periodic cleavage pattern was observed, typical for a DNA fragment organized around the surface of a histone octamer. This repetitive pattern was also clearly and reproducibly detected on the bottom strand in reconstituted DNA fragments on a stretch extending from −87 to +24 (Fig. 3 C). Thus the DNase I pattern, together with 5′ and 3′ boundaries defined by the ExoIII protection assay, strongly suggest that a histone octamer is positioned from −112 to +32, with the DR5 RARE lying across the dyad axis of the nucleosome and demonstrate that this precise DNA segment has an intrinsic structure directing a precise translational and rotational positioning of the histone octamer. These features are summarized in Fig. 4.Figure 3Rotational phasing of the 182-bp RAR-β2 promoter fragment. A, DNase I footprint of the upper strand of the RAR-β2 promoter. Free DNA (F) or reconstituted monosomes (R) were incubated for 0, 1, 2, or 5 min or 0, 2, 5, or 10 min, respectively, with 1 unit of DNase I at room temperature. DNAs were extracted and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.Black dots indicate sites of enhanced DNase I sensitivity of nucleosomal DNA compared with free DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2067353136,"Human malignant cells are targeted by homologous complement C3b if they express M161Ag, a 43-kDa protein with C3-activating property. cDNA of M161Ag cloned from human leukemia cell lines predicted M161Ag as a novel secretory protein comprised of 428 amino acids including 5 amino acids encoded by TGA codons (Matsumoto M., Takeda, J., Inoue, N., Hara, T., Hatanaka, M., Takahashi, K., Nagasawa, S., Akedo, H., and Seya, T. (1997) Nat. Med. 3, 1266–1270), although the origin of this gene was obscure. Here we clarified this point through genomic and biochemical analysis: 1) 5′-UT and genomic sequences represented the prokaryote promoter and ribosomal binding site; 2) the TGA codons in M161Ag cDNA were translated not into selenocysteines but into tryptophans; 3) M161Ag anchored onto the membrane secondary to its N-terminal palmitoylation like prokaryote lipoproteins; 4) genomic and cDNA clones of M161Ag were highly homologous to Mycoplasma fermentans gene encoding P48, a monocytic differentiation/activation factor, recently released in the data base, although the resultant proteins were different in the amino acid sequences. Additionally, purified soluble M161Ag efficiently provoked IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6 like P48, and further IL-10 and IL-12 in human peripheral blood monocytes. Thus, M161Ag originates from M. fermentans, and latently infectedM. fermentans allows human cells to produce M161Ag.

Selective tumor destruction has long been desired for tumor immunity. Recently we discovered a membrane-associated novel gene product expressed on some malignant human cells/cell lines, but not on normal cells, in close conjunction with apoptotic stimuli such as Fas or x-irradiation. This protein, with a molecular mass of 43 kDa and named M161Ag (1Matsumoto M. Seya T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2270-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto M. Yamashita F.

The C-opsonized tumor cells are rapidly cleared, presumably through the expressed M161Ag.Its cloned cDNA, however, suggested that M161Ag was a secretory protein and suprisingly contained 5 amino acids encoded by TGA codons (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A possible C-activation characteristic of M161Ag is that once secreted from the tumor cells, it activates homologous C via the alternative pathway on the cell membrane, thereby allowing for homologous C3 targeting (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, M161Ag appeared to have unique structural, functional and expression profiles. Yet, information about the relevant amino acids encoded by TGA codons, genomic organization, the type of protein anchoring onto membranes, and the regulatory mechanism of protein expression remain to be settled.We previously thought that the M161Ag gene was of human origin because M161Ag was expressed on malignant human cells from patients. However, a similar DNA sequence of non-human origin, named P48, was released after the submission of the amino acid sequence of M161Ag (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The P48 protein was first described as a novel human cytokine inducing the production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in human monocytes and then corrected into a product of Mycoplasma fermentans, a parasitic prokaryote (5Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4459-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beezhold D.H. Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Immunology. 1989; 143: 3217-3221Google Scholar, 7Kostyal D.A. Beezhold D.H. Hall R.E. J.

Irrespective of the high homology between these two genes, there are significant differences in the primary structures as well as functional profiles of these gene products. Meanwhile, several papers have been published suggesting that leukemia (9Taylor-Robinson D. Wirostko E. Wirostko W.J. Wirostko B.M. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1555-1556Abstract PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and AIDS (10Lo S-C. Tsai S. Benish J.R. Shin J.W-K. Wear D.J. Wong D.M. Science. 1990; 251: 1074-1076Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are frequently associated with parasitic M. fermentans and its gene products.Here we demonstrate that M161Ag is a lipoprotein derived from M. fermentans. Furthermore, we found that M161Ag is a potent biological response modifier that provokes IL-10 and IL-12 in addition to inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes.DISCUSSIONWe initially expected M161Ag to be a human gene product, because its cDNA had a polyadenylation signal followed by the poly(A) tail and the protein was originally detected in bone marrow cells of patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy and in those with aplastic anemia. 3M. Matsumoto and T. Seya, unpublished data.Additionally, the 5 TGA codons in the ORF of this protein could be read into selenocysteines if it were a human protein. At that time, no protein or nucleotide sequence similar to M161Ag was found in the data base.The findings of the present study can be summarized as follows. 1) 5′-UT of cDNA and genomic sequences predicted the presence of the prokaryote promoter and ribosomal binding site (Fig. 2). 2) A poly(A) tail-like sequence as well as an AATAAA polyadenylation signal was conserved not only in the cDNA but also in the genome (Fig. 2). 3) There was a correlation between M161Ag expression andMycoplasma infection (Fig. 3). 4) Homology searches indicated that the P48 monocyte differentiation/activation factor gene originating from M. fermentans (accession number U70254) was highly homologous to our M161Ag cDNA and genome. 5) The TGA codons encoded Trp but not selenocysteine residues in the purified protein as in Mycoplasma proteins. Therefore, we conclude that M161Ag is a protein of Mycoplasma but not human origin. However, the size variety of genomic Southern analysis remains unexplained. Strain-to-strain difference and/or genomic integration of the M161Ag gene may account for this unusual result.These points are reminiscent of the suggestion that mitochondria are derived from parasitic bacteria because they have their own genome and proteins. Some of the genomic structure still bear the marks of prokaryotic origin. An intriguing point is that the M161Ag mRNA partly mimics those of eukaryotes, and this may be advantageous for attainment of stable dynamics and steady-state level in the parasitic environment (18Taljanidisz J. Karnik P. Sarkar N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).M161Ag is a multifunctional protein with abilities of C activation and cytokine induction. P48 of M. fermentans induces the production of IL-1Β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in human monocytes and monocytic cell lines (4Hall R.E. Agarwal S. Kestler D.P. Cobb J.A. Goldstein K.M. Chang N-S. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4459-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beezhold D.H. Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Immunology. 1989; 143: 3217-3221Google Scholar, 7Kostyal D.A. Beezhold D.H. Hall R.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kestler D.P. Agarwal S. Hall R.E. Immunology. 1995; 86: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequences were largely different throughout the C-terminal regions between M161Ag and P48, the IL-1β-, TNF-α-, and IL-6-inducing activity must be mapped within the N-terminal domain conserved between these two proteins. However, M161Ag, but not P48, stimulates monocytes to induce IL-10 and IL-12 which affect the polarization and development of naive T-helper cells. Again, M161Ag has C-activating ability which has not been determined in P48. The stretched sequence of M161Ag including 5 Trp residues may play a role in the latter functions.M161Ag is a putative membrane protein with a lipid anchor since M161Ag was palmitoylated (Fig. 4 C). The lipid moiety on bacterial lipoproteins strongly potentiates the humoral as well as the cellular immune responses (19Deres K. Schild H. Wiesmuller K-H. Jung G. Rammensee H-G. Nature. 1989; 342: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Indeed, MALP-2 (a recently isolated M. fermentans-derived 2-kDa lipopeptide, macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2), carries 1 mol of C16:0 and an additional mole of a mixture of C18:0 and C18:1 fatty acids per lipopeptide molecule (20Mühlradt P.F. Kieß M. Meyer H. Sußmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and acts as an inducer of NO at picomolar concentrations (20Mühlradt P.F. Kieß M. Meyer H. Sußmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the amino acid sequence of this lipopeptide was entirely consistent with the N-terminal 14-amino acid sequences of M161Ag and P48. It is likely that soluble forms of this M. fermentansgene product confer another function on macrophages besides C-activation and cytokine production. However, the mechanisms whereby soluble M161Ag is generated from the membrane-associated forms to express its functions still remain unknown.M. fermentans is a mycoplasma species capable of infecting humans and has been suspected of serving as a cofactor of AIDS development (21Blanchard A. Montagnier L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 687-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Katseni V.L. Gilroy C.B. Ryait B.K. Ariyoshi K. Bieniasz P.D. Weber J.N. Taylor-Robinson D. Lancet. 1993; 341: 271-273Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several groups (10Lo S-C. Tsai S. Benish J.R. Shin J.W-K. Wear D.J. Wong D.M. Science. 1990; 251: 1074-1076Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Castedo M. Dutilleul V. Susin S. Marchetti P. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar) speculated that M. fermentans facilitates depletion of T cells or immature myelomonocytic cells, favoring the progression of functional immunodeficiency in AIDS. Yet, the products of M. fermentansresponsible for immune modulation, polyclonal B or T cell activation, cytokine production, and cytocidal effect (23Biberfeld G. Nilsson E. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Feng S.H. Lo S-C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3916-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mühlradt P.F. Schade U. Infect.

Lett. 1992; 34: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have not been identified. A possible interpretation is that M161Ag and/or P48 is a molecule relevant to AIDS progression. C3-activating function of M161Ag is also consistent with the observation that C3 deposition is induced on CD4+ T cells of HIV-infected individuals (27Yefenof E. Asojö B. Klein E. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Yefenof E. Magyarlaki T. Fenyo E-M. Wahren B. Klein E Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Coinfection of M. fermentans with HIV may actually support progression to AIDS in latent patients via the functions of M161Ag.These results also explain why M161Ag-positive myeloid cell lines were obtained after most of the cells died. Like human myeloid cell lines P39(+) and K562(+), infection with M. fermentans may cause cell death in affected cells, and some that survive are persistently infected with M. fermentans and are M161Ag-positive. The parasitic growth of M. fermentans may be regulated by signals related to cell death, since M161Ag synthesis is induced by x-irradiation and Fas stimulation and up-regulated with TNF-α (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Our sequential studies showed that the M. fermentans gene product M161Ag had dual functions: complement activation and cytokine induction. Once M161Ag is expressed because of latent infection offermentans, it converts self cells to non-self and elicits innate immune responses via activation of C3/C5 and monocytes. However, the roles of autologous C3 activation and deposition on host cells and Th1-activating cytokine production in the acquired immune responses are still poorly understood. Furthermore, parasitic infection of M. fermentans has been associated with oncogenic properties (29Johnson L. Wirostko E. Wirostko W. Wirostko B. Lancet. 1996; 347: 901-902Abstract PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Tsai S. Wear D.J. Shin J.W-K. Lo S-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10197-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These issues will be further clarified using recombinant M161Ag and deletion mutants, and such studies are currently in progress in our laboratory. Selective tumor destruction has long been desired for tumor immunity. Recently we discovered a membrane-associated novel gene product expressed on some malignant human cells/cell lines, but not on normal cells, in close conjunction with apoptotic stimuli such as Fas or x-irradiation. This protein, with a molecular mass of 43 kDa and named M161Ag (1Matsumoto M. Seya T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2270-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto M. Yamashita F.

The C-opsonized tumor cells are rapidly cleared, presumably through the expressed M161Ag. Its cloned cDNA, however, suggested that M161Ag was a secretory protein and suprisingly contained 5 amino acids encoded by TGA codons (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A possible C-activation characteristic of M161Ag is that once secreted from the tumor cells, it activates homologous C via the alternative pathway on the cell membrane, thereby allowing for homologous C3 targeting (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, M161Ag appeared to have unique structural, functional and expression profiles. Yet, information about the relevant amino acids encoded by TGA codons, genomic organization, the type of protein anchoring onto membranes, and the regulatory mechanism of protein expression remain to be settled. We previously thought that the M161Ag gene was of human origin because M161Ag was expressed on malignant human cells from patients. However, a similar DNA sequence of non-human origin, named P48, was released after the submission of the amino acid sequence of M161Ag (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The P48 protein was first described as a novel human cytokine inducing the production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in human monocytes and then corrected into a product of Mycoplasma fermentans, a parasitic prokaryote (5Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4459-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beezhold D.H. Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Immunology. 1989; 143: 3217-3221Google Scholar, 7Kostyal D.A. Beezhold D.H. Hall R.E. J.

Irrespective of the high homology between these two genes, there are significant differences in the primary structures as well as functional profiles of these gene products. Meanwhile, several papers have been published suggesting that leukemia (9Taylor-Robinson D. Wirostko E. Wirostko W.J. Wirostko B.M. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1555-1556Abstract PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and AIDS (10Lo S-C. Tsai S. Benish J.R. Shin J.W-K. Wear D.J. Wong D.M. Science. 1990; 251: 1074-1076Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are frequently associated with parasitic M. fermentans and its gene products. Here we demonstrate that M161Ag is a lipoprotein derived from M. fermentans. Furthermore, we found that M161Ag is a potent biological response modifier that provokes IL-10 and IL-12 in addition to inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. DISCUSSIONWe initially expected M161Ag to be a human gene product, because its cDNA had a polyadenylation signal followed by the poly(A) tail and the protein was originally detected in bone marrow cells of patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy and in those with aplastic anemia. 3M. Matsumoto and T. Seya, unpublished data.Additionally, the 5 TGA codons in the ORF of this protein could be read into selenocysteines if it were a human protein. At that time, no protein or nucleotide sequence similar to M161Ag was found in the data base.The findings of the present study can be summarized as follows. 1) 5′-UT of cDNA and genomic sequences predicted the presence of the prokaryote promoter and ribosomal binding site (Fig. 2). 2) A poly(A) tail-like sequence as well as an AATAAA polyadenylation signal was conserved not only in the cDNA but also in the genome (Fig. 2). 3) There was a correlation between M161Ag expression andMycoplasma infection (Fig. 3). 4) Homology searches indicated that the P48 monocyte differentiation/activation factor gene originating from M. fermentans (accession number U70254) was highly homologous to our M161Ag cDNA and genome. 5) The TGA codons encoded Trp but not selenocysteine residues in the purified protein as in Mycoplasma proteins. Therefore, we conclude that M161Ag is a protein of Mycoplasma but not human origin. However, the size variety of genomic Southern analysis remains unexplained. Strain-to-strain difference and/or genomic integration of the M161Ag gene may account for this unusual result.These points are reminiscent of the suggestion that mitochondria are derived from parasitic bacteria because they have their own genome and proteins. Some of the genomic structure still bear the marks of prokaryotic origin. An intriguing point is that the M161Ag mRNA partly mimics those of eukaryotes, and this may be advantageous for attainment of stable dynamics and steady-state level in the parasitic environment (18Taljanidisz J. Karnik P. Sarkar N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).M161Ag is a multifunctional protein with abilities of C activation and cytokine induction. P48 of M. fermentans induces the production of IL-1Β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in human monocytes and monocytic cell lines (4Hall R.E. Agarwal S. Kestler D.P. Cobb J.A. Goldstein K.M. Chang N-S. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4459-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beezhold D.H. Leftwich J.A. Hall R.E.

Immunology. 1995; 86: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequences were largely different throughout the C-terminal regions between M161Ag and P48, the IL-1β-, TNF-α-, and IL-6-inducing activity must be mapped within the N-terminal domain conserved between these two proteins. However, M161Ag, but not P48, stimulates monocytes to induce IL-10 and IL-12 which affect the polarization and development of naive T-helper cells. Again, M161Ag has C-activating ability which has not been determined in P48. The stretched sequence of M161Ag including 5 Trp residues may play a role in the latter functions.M161Ag is a putative membrane protein with a lipid anchor since M161Ag was palmitoylated (Fig. 4 C). The lipid moiety on bacterial lipoproteins strongly potentiates the humoral as well as the cellular immune responses (19Deres K. Schild H. Wiesmuller K-H. Jung G. Rammensee H-G. Nature. 1989; 342: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Indeed, MALP-2 (a recently isolated M. fermentans-derived 2-kDa lipopeptide, macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2), carries 1 mol of C16:0 and an additional mole of a mixture of C18:0 and C18:1 fatty acids per lipopeptide molecule (20Mühlradt P.F. Kieß M. Meyer H. Sußmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and acts as an inducer of NO at picomolar concentrations (20Mühlradt P.F. Kieß M. Meyer H. Sußmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the amino acid sequence of this lipopeptide was entirely consistent with the N-terminal 14-amino acid sequences of M161Ag and P48. It is likely that soluble forms of this M. fermentansgene product confer another function on macrophages besides C-activation and cytokine production. However, the mechanisms whereby soluble M161Ag is generated from the membrane-associated forms to express its functions still remain unknown.M. fermentans is a mycoplasma species capable of infecting humans and has been suspected of serving as a cofactor of AIDS development (21Blanchard A. Montagnier L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 687-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Katseni V.L. Gilroy C.B. Ryait B.K. Ariyoshi K. Bieniasz P.D. Weber J.N. Taylor-Robinson D. Lancet. 1993; 341: 271-273Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several groups (10Lo S-C. Tsai S. Benish J.R. Shin J.W-K. Wear D.J. Wong D.M.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar) speculated that M. fermentans facilitates depletion of T cells or immature myelomonocytic cells, favoring the progression of functional immunodeficiency in AIDS. Yet, the products of M. fermentansresponsible for immune modulation, polyclonal B or T cell activation, cytokine production, and cytocidal effect (23Biberfeld G. Nilsson E. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Feng S.H. Lo S-C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3916-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mühlradt P.F. Schade U. Infect.

Lett. 1992; 34: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have not been identified. A possible interpretation is that M161Ag and/or P48 is a molecule relevant to AIDS progression. C3-activating function of M161Ag is also consistent with the observation that C3 deposition is induced on CD4+ T cells of HIV-infected individuals (27Yefenof E. Asojö B. Klein E. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Yefenof E. Magyarlaki T. Fenyo E-M. Wahren B. Klein E Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Coinfection of M. fermentans with HIV may actually support progression to AIDS in latent patients via the functions of M161Ag.These results also explain why M161Ag-positive myeloid cell lines were obtained after most of the cells died. Like human myeloid cell lines P39(+) and K562(+), infection with M. fermentans may cause cell death in affected cells, and some that survive are persistently infected with M. fermentans and are M161Ag-positive. The parasitic growth of M. fermentans may be regulated by signals related to cell death, since M161Ag synthesis is induced by x-irradiation and Fas stimulation and up-regulated with TNF-α (3Matsumoto M. Takeda J. Inoue N. Hara T. Hatanaka M. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. Akedo H. Seya T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Our sequential studies showed that the M. fermentans gene product M161Ag had dual functions: complement activation and cytokine induction. Once M161Ag is expressed because of latent infection offermentans, it converts self cells to non-self and elicits innate immune responses via activation of C3/C5 and monocytes. However, the roles of autologous C3 activation and deposition on host cells and Th1-activating cytokine production in the acquired immune responses are still poorly understood. Furthermore, parasitic infection of M. fermentans has been associated with oncogenic properties (29Johnson L. Wirostko E. Wirostko W. Wirostko B. Lancet. 1996; 347: 901-902Abstract PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Tsai S. Wear D.J. Shin J.W-K. Lo S-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Paranemic joints are a key intermediate in homologous recombination and are important in understanding the mechanism for a search of homology. The efficiency of paranemic joint formation depended on the length of homology and the topological forms of the duplex DNA. The presence of negative superhelicity increased the pairing efficiency and reduced the minimal length of homology required for paranemic joint formation. Negative superhelicity stimulated joint formation by favoring the initial unwinding of duplex DNA that occurred during the homology search and was not essential in the maintenance of the paired structure. Regardless of length of homology, formation of paranemic joints using circular duplex DNA required the presence of more than six negative supercoils. Above six negative turns, an increasing degree of negative superhelicity resulted in a linear increase in the pairing efficiency. These results support a model of two distinct kinds of DNA unwinding occurring in paranemic joint formation: an initial unwinding caused by heterologous contacts during synapsis and a later one during pairing of the homologous molecules.

Escherichia coli RecA protein is a prototype of a class of recombination proteins that are widespread among prokaryotes and eukaryotes (for reviews, see Refs. 1West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev.

BioEssays. 1993; 15: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RecA protein is essential in homologous genetic recombination. In vitro, RecA protein polymerizes on single-stranded DNA to form a helical nucleoprotein filament that mediates homologous pairing with duplex DNA and subsequent strand exchange between the two parental molecules. Much of the information on RecA-promoted homologous pairing is derived from a model reaction involving circular single-stranded DNA and linear duplex DNA. In such a system wherein a free DNA end is available, the incoming single strand and its complement in the duplex DNA are free to rotate around each other. The heteroduplex DNA produced has the classical intertwined or plectonemic structure of duplex DNA (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since a free end only represents a small fraction of the entire molecule, the apposition of two DNA molecules, especially in vivo, is likely to occur within the interior region at a distance from the ends. RecA protein also promotes the homologous alignment of two DNA substrates in the absence of a free end. The resulting joint is termed paranemic: the DNA strands from the two parental molecules are paired in the homologous region but not topologically linked, and the joint is unstable in the absence of RecA protein (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Riddles P.W. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimentally, paranemic joints can be studied free from plectonemic joints by pairing circular single-stranded DNA with either superhelical DNA or linear “buried homology” duplex DNA in which the homologous region is flanked at both sides by stretches of heterologous sequences (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,7DasGupta C. Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Neither combination has net intertwining of the aligned DNA strands nor complete displacement of the strand of like polarity within the original duplex. A poorly understood event in homologous recombination is homology recognition. Since a paranemic joint is a key intermediate in homologous pairing and the joint formation takes place at or immediately after homology recognition (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M.

Chem. 1985; 260: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), studies on factors critical for paranemic joint formation may provide clues on the mechanism for the search of homology. One such factor is negative superhelicity. During joint formation, the double-stranded DNA is unwound (8Wu A.M. Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7886-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is defined here as a reduction in twist without a change in linking number. DNA unwinding mediated by RecA protein involves a disruption of base stacking but presumably not the base pairing. The extensive unwinding of duplex DNA is probably a result of binding and alignment to the incoming nucleoprotein filament, the axial spacing of which is extended about 1.5 times that in native B-form DNA (10Flory J. Radding C.M. Cell. 1982; 28: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Williams R. Spengler S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 187: 109-118Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because of the unwinding, the topology of the duplex DNA affects the efficiency of paranemic joint formation. Negatively superhelical DNA is a better substrate in forming paranemic joints than positively superhelical DNA and relaxed circular duplex DNA (12Ramdas J. Mythili E. Muniyappa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17395-17400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rould E. Muniyappa K. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Negative superhelicity also plays an essential role in allowing the formation of paranemic joints between imperfectly homologous molecules (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which negative superhelicity stimulates paranemic joint formation is unclear. Besides substrate topology, the length of homology also influences homologous recombination (14Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 647-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Shen P. Huang H.V. Genetics. 1986; 112: 441-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Singer B.S. Gold L. Gauss P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11486-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since homologous recombination takes place with little sequence preference, the process requires a minimal length of homology to differentiate between homologous and heterologous contacts (18Thomas C.A.J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1966; 5: 315-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Depending on the pathway involved, genetic studies showed that the minimal length for homologous recombination is about 20–100 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). (15Shen P. Huang H.V. Genetics. 1986; 112: 441-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Singer B.S. Gold L. Gauss P. Doherty D.H. Cell. 1982; 31: 25-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Above the minimal length, the frequency of homologous recombination increases with the length of homology. When homologous pairing is restricted to DNA ends in vitro, formation of stable joint molecules by RecA protein requires a homology length of about 30 bp (19Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6492-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although the size of paranemic joints ranges from a few hundred to several thousand bp (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7886-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Christiansen G.

Biol. 1990; 215: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the minimal homology length required and the effect of homology length on paranemic joint formation have not been fully examined. In this report, we showed that the efficiency of paranemic joint formation was dependent on the length of homology and the topological forms of the duplex DNA substrate. The minimal length of homology required varied with the topological forms of the duplex. We found that negative superhelicity stimulated joint formation by favoring the initial underwinding of duplex DNA but was not involved in the stabilization of the paranemic joint itself. RecA protein was purified as described (24Chow S.A. Chiu S.-K. Wong B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The concentration of RecA protein was determined by absorbance using a value for E277 nm1% (corrected for light scattering) of 6.33 (25Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. Chase J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E. coli topoisomerase I was a gift from Dr. Leory Liu at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and wheat germ topoisomerase I was purchased from Promega. E. colisingle-stranded DNA-binding protein was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Creatine phosphokinase (Type I), S1 nuclease, and proteinase K were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Nuclease-free bovine serum albumin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [methyl-3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and spermidine and creatine phosphate were from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or BDH Laboratory Supplies. To prepare chimeric DNA molecules, various lengths (59–662 bp) of phage DNA (φX174 or G4) were inserted into the multiple cloning site of plasmid IBI20 (International Biotechnology Inc.) or Bluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) using standard cloning procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The construction of the chimeric plasmids is described in the legend to Fig. 1. For convenience, the chimeric plasmids were named pX/Y-Z, where X refers to the source of the plasmid vector, Y refers to the source of the phage insert, and Z refers to the length of the insert DNA. Circular single-stranded (viral or plus strand) DNA and supercoiled [3H]DNA from phages φX174, G4, M13, and the chimeric phage M13Gori1 were prepared as described (24Chow S.A. Chiu S.-K. Wong B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Circular single-stranded DNA of the phagemid Bluescript II KS+ was prepared as suggested by the manufacturer. The purities of the circular single-stranded and supercoiled DNA preparations were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the preparations were found to contain less than 5% linear and nicked molecules, respectively. The concentrations of single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA were measured by absorbance at 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 8.3 and 6.7, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the concentration of DNA was expressed in mol of nucleotide residues. Relaxed circular duplex DNA was prepared by incubating 10 μg of the negatively supercoiled DNA with 10 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min under conditions described by the manufacturer. Such treatment resulted in the relaxation of greater than 95% of the negatively supercoiled DNA as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. To produce a set of superhelical DNA with different numbers of superhelical turns, negatively superhelical DNA of pKS/G4–138 (3,074 bp) or pKS/G4–662 (3,571 bp) isolated from E. coli strain HB101 was treated with wheat germ topoisomerase I in the presence of various amounts of ethidium bromide. The amount of ethidium bromide used was adjusted such that for each superhelical turn to be retained after the enzyme treatment, 14 molecules of ethidium bromide was added for each plasmid duplex DNA molecule (27Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Pugh B.F. Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concentration of the ethidium bromide solution was determined by absorbance at 480 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5.6 mm−1 cm−1 (29Baase W.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 797-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Except for the presence of ethidium bromide, the reaction conditions were the same as that described earlier for the production of relaxed circular duplex DNA. After treatment with topoisomerase I, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.1% SDS, and 300 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. The ethidium bromide and proteins were then removed by three rounds of extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The production of superhelical DNA containing different superhelical densities was confirmed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (30Conley E.C. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10156-10163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA bands were visualized by staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The mobility of the DNA products increased with increasing amount of ethidium bromide present in the reaction mixture, corresponding to an increasing degree of negative superhelicity (27Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As a negative control, supercoiled DNA was incubated in the complete reaction mixture without wheat germ topoisomerase I, and the mobility of the DNA remained unchanged. The superhelical density of untreated plasmid DNA in our preparation was about −0.07. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction mixture contained a final concentration of 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mm ATP, 6 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 88 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (nuclease-free), 1.8 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, and circular single-stranded DNA. The mixture was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. RecA protein was then added, and the incubation was continued for another 10 min at 37 °C. The amount of RecA protein was added in a ratio of 1 mol of RecA protein for every 2 mol of total nucleotide residues available for RecA binding. The pairing reaction was initiated by adding 4 μm duplex [3H]DNA and adjusting the final concentration of MgCl2 to 13 mm. Unless otherwise specified, the number of single-stranded DNAs in the pairing reaction was in 4-fold excess over the number of duplex DNA molecules. The concentration of single-stranded DNA (ss) used was calculated as follows: [ss] = 4 ([duplex]/2)(length of ss/length of duplex). The formation of paranemic joints was measured by a P-loop assay (24Chow S.A. Chiu S.-K. Wong B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is modified from the D-loop assay (31Beattie K.L. Wiegand R.C. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 783-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both assays measure the retention by nitrocellulose filters of duplex DNA that has attached to single-stranded or partially single-stranded DNA. However, in the P-loop assay, the removal of RecA protein by high salt concentrations is minimized in order to preserve the metastable joints. At appropriate times, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were directly diluted in 4.2 ml of ice-cold 1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.5). The solution was immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (Sartorius type SM11306, 0.45-μm pore size) that had been soaked in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate (pH 7.5). The filters were then rinsed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold 1.5 m NaCl, 0.15m sodium citrate (pH 7.5), dried under a heat lamp, and put into vials with 5 ml of toluene containing 0.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.01% 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene. The radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. To measure the formation of joint molecules that were stable in the absence of RecA protein (32Chow S.A. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 200-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at appropriate times we added to the sample aliquots a final concentration of 1% SDS and 20 mmEDTA. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 6 min prior to the nitrocellulose filter assay as described above. Alternatively, we added to the sample aliquots a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and 300 μg/ml proteinase K. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before passing through nitrocellulose filters. Unwinding of duplex DNA was examined by pairing circular single-stranded DNA with relaxed closed circular duplex DNA. The three-stranded pairing reaction was carried out as described under “Standard Reaction Conditions.” Twenty minutes after the addition of 8 μm relaxed circular duplex DNA, a 100-μl aliquot was removed, and 3 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I was added to the mixture. After a further incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, the reaction was terminated by adjusting the mixture to 300 μg/ml proteinase K, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the products were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel (30Conley E.C. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10156-10163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were separated in the first dimension at 7 V/cm for 5 h in the absence of any intercalating agent. The gel was then soaked in 2 liters of 0.09m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) containing 4 μm of chloroquine for 16 h with gentle shaking. In the second dimension, the gel was placed at 90° to the previous dimension, and electrophoresis was carried out at 7 V/cm for 5 h with the soaking buffer used as the running buffer. After gel electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in distilled water for 16 h to remove chloroquine prior to staining in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 15–30 min. The gel was then destained in 10 mmMgSO4 solution prior to UV photography. RecA protein promotes the pairing between circular single-stranded and circular double-stranded DNA to form paranemic joints in which the DNA strands are paired without net intertwining (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we used two combinations of DNA substrates for the formation of paranemic joints: pairing of a circular single-stranded DNA with either a chimeric closed circular duplex DNA or a linear “buried homology” duplex DNA in which the homologous region is flanked on both sides by stretches of heterologous sequences (see Fig.1). Except for the chimeric phage M13Gori1, the chimeric duplex DNA was constructed by inserting different lengths of phage G4 or φX174 DNA into plasmid DNA that are completely heterologous to the phage DNA sequences (Fig.1). The chimeric, double-stranded DNA was paired with the single-stranded DNA of the parental phage to form paranemic joints. In one combination of DNA substrates, circular single strands and circular duplex, there was a complete absence of DNA ends. In the other combination, the duplex DNA lacked a DNA end that was homologous to the circular single-stranded DNA. Therefore, in both combinations, net intertwining of DNA strands was prohibited, and the pairing between the two DNA molecules led to the formation of paranemic joints (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Riddles P.W. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When superhelical or linear “buried homology” duplex DNA containing different lengths of phage DNA sequences were paired with the circular single-stranded phage DNA, the formation of joint molecules increased correspondingly with the length of homology shared between the two DNA substrates (Fig. 2). When the duplex DNA was superhelical, the maximal efficiency of paranemic joint formation was reached at a homology length of 2,200 bp (Fig. 2, A and C), whereas linear “buried homology” duplex DNA required a homology length of 6,400 bp to reach the plateau (Fig. 2, B and C). For any particular length of homology between 140 and 2,200 bp, superhelical duplex DNA exhibited a higher efficiency of joint formation than that of linear “buried homology” duplex DNA (Fig. 2 C). At a homology length of 6,400 bp, the efficiencies of joint formation of the two kinds of duplexes were indistinguishable. The minimal length of homology required for paranemic joint formation also differed between superhelical and linear “buried homology” duplex DNA. The minimal lengths required were between 59 and 138 bp for superhelical DNA and between 497 and 662 bp for linear duplex DNA (Fig. 2). The finding that negatively superhelical DNA generally produced a higher yield of joint molecules than their linear counterparts indicated that negative superhelicity enhanced the formation of paranemic joints. Previous studies have shown that negative superhelicity, perhaps by stabilizing the nascent structure made by RecA protein, plays a determining role in permitting the formation of paranemic joints between imperfectly homologous molecules (5Bianchi M. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and between gapped and fully double-stranded DNA (33Chiu S.-K. Wong B.C. Chow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21262-21268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Conley E.C. Muller B.M. West S.C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 340A: 121-133PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10164-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of DNA topology on the formation of paranemic joints, we paired circular single-stranded G4 or pBluescript II KS+ DNA with various topological forms of pKS/G4–662 duplex DNA (Fig. 1 A, e). In this experiment, the length of homology depends on the source of the single-stranded DNA: 662 bp for G4 and 2,950 bp for pBluescript II KS+. The results showed that, among negatively superhelical, linear, and relaxed circular duplex DNA, superhelical DNA had the highest efficiency, while relaxed closed circular duplex DNA had the poorest efficiency in the formation of paranemic joints (Fig. 3, Aand B). The difference in pairing efficiency between linear and relaxed closed circular duplex DNA was more prominent with DNA substrates that shared a longer length of homology (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, with relaxed closed circular duplex DNA, the yield of joint formation was the same regardless of whether the duplex DNA shared 662 or 2,910 bp of homology with the incoming single-stranded DNA (Fig. 3, A and B). The pairing efficiency of the relaxed circular duplex DNA could be drastically increased when the DNA was cleaved by the restriction enzyme KpnI, which introduces a single cut and generates a 3′-end complementary to the single-stranded DNA (see substrate e in Fig. 1 A). When the enzyme was added to an ongoing pairing reaction involving circular single-stranded G4 DNA and relaxed closed circular duplex of pKS/G4–662, there was a prompt increase in joint formation (Fig. 3 C). This experiment showed that the poor pairing efficiency of the relaxed closed circular duplex DNA was due to a topological constraint and not to an inactivation of the duplex during its preparation or to the presence of inhibitors. Similar to our observation presented here, Rould et al. (13Rould E. Muniyappa K. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that relaxed closed circular duplex DNA formed paranemic joints less efficiently than linear duplex. However, they found that negatively superhelical duplex DNA paired less efficiently than linear “buried homology” duplex DNA. We believe that the discrepancy may be due to a difference in the superhelical density of the duplex DNA used in the two studies. Below a certain density of negative superhelicity, we showed that superhelical duplex DNA paired less efficiently than linear duplex DNA (see Fig. 7 and “Discussion”). The result shown in Fig. 2 clearly indicated that, with substrates that contained short homology lengths, negative superhelicity was required for paranemic joint formation. It was not clear, however, whether negative superhelicity was required continuously for the stability of the paranemic joints once it was formed. To address this question, we formed paranemic joints by pairing negatively superhelical DNA of pKS/G4–138 with circular single-stranded G4 DNA (Fig. 4). We chose this combination of DNA substrates because with a homology length of 138 bp, there was a large difference in paranemic joint formation between the superhelical and linear DNA (Fig. 2). At various times after the start of the pairing reaction, the circular duplex DNA was converted to linear “buried homology” DNA by the addition of the restriction enzyme ScaI, which cleaves the duplex DNA once in the heterologous region (Fig. 1 A). The circular duplex DNA was completely linearized within 2 min of ScaI incubation as determined by the filter assay of Kuhnlein et al. (36Kuhnlein U. Penhoet E.E. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B) and by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). When the circular duplex DNA was linearized during the pairing reaction, a substantial fraction of the joint molecules remained, and the level was unchanged for at least 25 min after the addition of the restriction enzyme (Fig. 4 A). The final yield of paranemic joints was determined by the time of addition of the restriction enzyme. For instance, when the enzyme was added at the start of the pairing reaction, about 10% of the duplex was in paranemic joints throughout the course of the reaction, whereas about 60% of the duplex DNA was detected as joint molecules when the restriction enzyme was added 50 min after the start of the pairing reaction. Therefore, once the supercoiled DNA was linearized, it became incapable of joint formation. However, when the supercoiled DNA was linearized after joint formation, a majority of the joints remained even in the absence of negative superhelicity. To confirm that the joints that survived restriction enzyme treatment remained paranemic in nature, we incubated the mixture at 4 °C in 1% SDS for 6 min to remove RecA protein before the filter assay (32Chow S.A. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 200-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No joint molecules were detected after deproteinization (Fig. 4 A), indicating that these joints were indeed paranemic. Thus, we conclude that negative superhelicity promotes the formation of paranemic joints but is not necessary for the maintenance of the paranemic joints. Since no paranemic joint was detected between circular single-stranded DNA and linear duplex with a homology length shorter than 662 bp (Fig. 2), it may reflect the minimal requirement of 662 bp of homology between the described substrates for paranemic joint formation. Alternatively, it was possible that linear duplex with homology length shorter than 662 bp could form paranemic joints but that they were too unstable to survive the filter assay.

In major part, pharmacologic dissection of the pivotal role of the Ca2+ pump of SR in E-C coupling has been achieved with aid of the microbial metabolites cyclopiazonic acid (7Goegor D.E. Riley R.T.

Rev. 1978; 58: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) on physiologic function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Especially contributory to our current understanding of SR function has been studies with the complex plant alkaloid ryanodine (C3-O-(pyrrole-2-carbonyl) ryanodol), a potent and specific modulator of a class of intracellular Ca2+release channels (11Besch Jr., H.R. Jones L.R. Sutko J.L. Willerson J.T. Circulation. 1977; 56: 128Google Scholar, 12Sutko J.L. Willerson J.T. Circ. Res. 1980; 46: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Fleischer S.

Chem. 1987; 261: 16636-16643Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For over a decade it has been appreciated that Ca2+ release channels (both on sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum) exhibit a complex response to ryanodine. At the single channel level, the effects of ryanodine are now appreciated to be quantal, occurring in a minimum of two discrete steps. Submicromolar concentrations induce an abrupt change from a flickery, predominantly closed (zero conductance) state to a sustained, higher (fractional, i.e.less than full) conductance state. “Locked” in this fractional conductance state and hovering about half-way between closed and fully open, the Ca2+ release channel modified by ryanodine is less restive, displaying fewer opening events than in the absence of ryanodine (16Lai F.A. Meissner G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Buck E. Zimanyi I. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23560-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rarely at submicromolar but more readily at micromolar concentrations, ryanodine may induce a second step change in the ionic conductance of the Ca2+ release channel to a persistently closed state displaying opening events only rarely. For convenience of discussion, we adopt the convention describing the locked, fractional conductance state as “modified” (18Tinker A. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Welch W. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2110-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the persistently closed, zero conductance state produced at high ryanodine concentrations as “shut.” Assays at the multi-channel level with muscle microsomes reveal graded responses to ryanodine, reflecting the ensemble of the many individual quantal events. Passive Ca2+ efflux assays evaluating ensemble effects typically employ sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane vesicles prepared from fast skeletal muscles (19Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lattanzio Jr., F.A. Schlatterer R.G. Nicar M. Campbell K.P. Sutko J.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 412-421PubMed Google Scholar). Low concentrations of ryanodine (≤60 μm) activate or open the RyR1s of such preparations, whereas higher concentrations deactivate, that is they close them. The resultant, biphasic response curves reflect the aggregate of the step quantal changes occurring in the multitude of individual Ca2+ release channels of such microsomes. We have recently shown that the behavior of single channels incorporated into lipid bilayers (18Tinker A. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Welch W. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2110-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is consistent with their aggregate behavior judged from flux studies with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Calcium sparks seem to demonstrate a similar phenomenon (22Hui C.S. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Details of the molecular processes that trigger RyRs to respond to ryanodine in a biphasic manner remain obscure. A robust strategy to approach understanding of the modulation of RyR1 could be assembled from structure-activity relationships that would identify chemical functionalities on the molecule that prove to be integral for high affinity interactions and comparison of these with topological features found essential for ryanoid channel modulating characteristics. The present study is a step in the latter direction. It is generally recognized that the C3 substituent on the A-ring of ryanodine is important to its affinity for ryanodine-binding sites on RyR1 (23Jefferies P.R. Toia R.F. Casida J.E. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 54: 1147-1149Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Welch W. Ahamad S. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Humerickhouse R.A. Besch Jr., H.R. Ruest L. Sutko J.L.

However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate whether the chemical nature of C3 substituents are especially important for the efficacy of ryanoids at opening, on the one hand, or closing, on the other, the Ca2+ release channel to ionic flux. This paucity results from chemical synthetic limitations. Although de-esterification of the C3 ester is facile, re-esterification with original stereochemistry is not. In fact, it is presently unattainable. Thus, comparisons of efficacy of C3-modified ryanoids have been limited for the most part to comparisons between ryanodine and ryanodol, the latter having no C3 ester. The present study adds pyridyl ryanodine to the mix. Also termed ryanodyl-3-nicotinate in the literature, the affinity but not the functional consequences of pyridyl ryanodine have been investigated. Jefferies et al.(23Jefferies P.R. Toia R.F. Casida J.E. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 54: 1147-1149Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) first identified this ryanoid as a naturally occurring minor secondary metabolite from Ryania wood. They found pyridyl ryanodine to be “essentially inactive compared with ryanodine for insecticidal activity, for toxicity to mice, and for competition with [3H]ryanodine at the Ca2+ ryanodine receptor complex of skeletal muscle.” For use in the present study, we purified to >98% a sufficient quantity of pyridyl ryanodine to permit a more extensive functional evaluation of this natural ryanoid. Among the numerous derivatives of ryanodine thus far reported, only a few C10-Oeq esters increased RyR1 affinity (26Gerzon K. Humerickhouse R.A. Besch Jr., H.R. Bidasee K.R. Emmick J.T. Roeske R.W.

Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 145-159Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such effective ester substituents were incorporated into pyridyl ryanodine and compared in the present study with ryanodine and ryanodol and certain other of their esters. The results show clearly that affinity consequences of C3 ester substituents do not predict their channel activating character. Furthermore, anchoring substituents at the C10-Oeq position effect no greater changes in activation potency of weak ryanoids than they do of highly effective ryanodines. Apparently the topologic features determinant for RyR1 activation and deactivation are not congruent with those responsible for apparent affinity for binding to RyR1. Ryanodine (C3-O-(pyrrole-2-carbonyl) ryanodol) and pyridyl ryanodine (C3-O-(pyridyl-3-carbonyl) ryanodol) used in this study were obtained from Integrated Biotechnology Corp. (Carmel, IN) or were isolated and purified to ≥98% single compounds from chipped Ryania speciosa wood supplied by them, using procedures previously described (21Humerickhouse R.A. Besch Jr., H.R.

Briefly, JSRV (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated in binding buffer (500 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4 at 37 °C) containing 6.7 nm[3H]ryanodine and varying concentrations of the ryanoids (up to 50 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the vesicles were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters (0.45 μm) using a cell harvester (Brandel model M-24R), washed 3 times with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (pH 7.4 at 0 °C), quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined simultaneously by incubating JSRV with a concentration of the respective unlabeled ryanoid 10 × higher than the highest concentration used in the binding assay. Displacement curves and IC50 and K d values were calculated using Microsoft Excel®, CA-Cricket Graph (version 1.1), the coupled binding analysis program EBDA/Ligand (34McPherson G.A. Comput.

Ryanoid-induced changes in Ca2+ efflux were assessed by measuring their abilities to alter passive Ca2+efflux from JSRV previously loaded with 45Ca2+as described (19Meissner G. J. Biol.

In this assay, JSRV (3.5 mg/ml) were incubated in Ca2+ loading buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1.1 mm Ca2+ (spiked with 0.25 μm45Ca2+), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0 at 22 °C)), in the presence of varying concentrations of the ryanoids (up to 5 mm) for 2 h at 22 °C. The Ca2+load achieved was 20–30 nmol/mg JSRV protein. Passive Ca2+(45Ca2+) efflux through RyR1 pathways was determined by diluting the vesicles (5 μl) 100-fold into an efflux buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm Ca2+, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0 at 22 °C). After 3 s, efflux was stopped by further diluting the vesicles 6-fold into an ice-cold stop solution (140 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mm ruthenium red) and rapidly filtering. The vesicles on the filters were then washed 3 times with 3 ml of rinse solution (identical to stop solution except without ruthenium red), and the 45Ca2+remaining inside the vesicles was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Since Ca2+ efflux may be different from different vesicle populations (reflecting, for example, different densities of RyR1s), the measurements can be taken to represent only an average over all vesicles in the preparation. We use herein the term ensemble functional patency to describe the effect of a given ryanoid-induced opening toward net Ca2+ efflux. The lower the amount of45Ca2+ remaining in the vesicles the greater the ensemble functional patency of RyRs to Ca2+ efflux and vice versa. It is not clear whether one or more than one channel on a given vesicle may be adequate to empty Ca2+ vesicular content in 3 s. In addition, as discussed below, efficacy for channel opening varies among ryanoids and must be considered when evaluating efficacy consequences of chemical modifications of ryanodine. To compare the ability of the various ryanoids to open the Ca2+ release channels fully, it was necessary to institute a protocol that would establish it for each JSRV population.

Concentration-effect curves with several dozen ryanodine derivatives never revealed efflux any greater than this combination (data not shown). Thus we used as an operational definition of full efficacy that which occurs with 1 μmguanidino-propionyl ryanodine in the presence of 1 mmAMP-PCP. It was 88 ± 5% (mean ± S.D.) for all nine preparations used in the present studies. The residual 12% could be released within 2 s by 1 μm A23187 (data not shown). Binding affinities were determined from the ability of the compounds to compete with 6.7 nm[3H]ryanodine for binding to receptor sites on RyR1, using displacement binding affinity assays. As shown in Fig.2 a, the model ryanoids exhibit substantial differences in apparent receptor affinity. Ryanodol (▵) was weakest in this regard, exhibiting an IC50 value of 8000 ± 50.9 nm (K d = 2970 ± 49.6 nm) for RyR1. Derivatives varying at the C3 secondary hydroxyl of ryanodol, containing either pyridyl-3-carbonate (pyridyl ryanodine) or pyrrole-2-carbonate (ryanodine), showed significantly enhanced affinity for RyR1 (IC50 value of 700 ± 10.2 nm(K d = 260 ± 12.2 nm), for pyridyl ryanodine and IC50 value of 6.2 ± 0.2 nm(K d = 2.4 ± 0.2 nm for ryanodine, respectively (Fig. 2 a, • and ▴)). All three displacement binding affinity isotherms display apparent saturation binding kinetics and are parallel to each other, as anticipated from their similarities in chemical structure. These results are compatible with those from previous studies showing that an ester substituent on the C3 carbon enhances high affinity ryanoid interactions with RyR1 from rabbit skeletal muscles. The present studies suggest that, in addition, the chemical nature of the C3 ester plays a substantial role in the high affinity interaction of the ryanoids with RyR1 (see also TableI, data column 2). High affinity interactions of ryanoids with RyR1 apparently depend to some degree on an appropriately sized sub"

It consists of the transmembrane IICMan-IIDMan complex and the cytoplasmic IIABMan subunit. IIABMan has two flexibly linked domains, IIAMan and IIBMan, each containing a phosphorylation site (His-10 and His-175). Phosphoryl groups are transferred from the phosphoryl carrier protein phospho-HPr to His-10, hence to His-175 and finally to the 6′ OH of the transported hexose. Phosphate-binding sites and phosphate-catalytic sites frequently contain arginines, which by their guanidino group can stabilize phosphate through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. IIBMan contains five arginines which are invariant in the homologous IIB subunits of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis. The IIA domains have no conserved arginines. The five arginines were replaced by Lys or Gln one at a time, and the mutants were analyzed for transport and phosphorylation activity. All five IIB mutants can still be phosphorylated at His-175 by the IIA domain. R172Q is completely inactive with respect to glucose phosphotransferase (phosphoryltransfer from His-175 to the 6′ OH of Glc) and hexose transport activity. R168Q has no hexose transport and strongly reduced phosphotransferase activity. R204K has no transport but almost normal phosphotransferase activity. R304Q has only slightly reduced transport activity. R190K behaves like wild-type IIABMan. Arg-168, Arg-172, and Arg-304 are part of the hydrogen bonding network on the surface of IIB, which contains the active site His-175 and the interface with the IIA domain (Schauder, S., Nunn, R.S., Lanz, R., Erni, B. and Schirmer, T.

Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in energy transduction, signal transduction and enzyme regulation. P-type ATPases transport cations across the cell membrane and are transiently phosphorylated on an aspartic acid during turnover (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Protein kinases and protein phosphatases regulate the activity of enzymes and membrane bound receptors by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (2Bourret R.B. Borkowich K.A. Simon M.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 401-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of bacteria (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69); IIABMan, hydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporter; IICMan and IIDMan, transmembrane subunits of the mannose transporter; IICBGlc, transmembrane subunit of the glucose transporter of the PTS; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69); IIABMan, hydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporter; IICMan and IIDMan, transmembrane subunits of the mannose transporter; IICBGlc, transmembrane subunit of the glucose transporter of the PTS; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. active transport and signaling are two functions of a protein phosphorylation cascade comprising four phosphoprotein units. The four components, enzyme I, HPr, IIA, and IIB sequentially transfer phosphoryl groups from phosphoenolpyruvate to carbohydrates that are accumulated across the cell membrane by a mechanism coupling translocation to phosphorylation. Whereas enzyme I and HPr are two energy coupling components, IIA and IIB together with the transmembrane IIC (and sometimes an additional IID) units form the sugar-specific transport complexes. IIA, IIB, and IIC occur either as protein subunits or as domains of a multidomain protein. Escherichia coli for example has over 30 genes for transporter complexes that differ in substrate specificity, amino acid sequence, and subunit/domain composition. The phosphorylation sites are histidines in enzyme I, HPr and the different IIA components, cysteines in the IIBs belonging to the glucose, mannitol, and lactose family, and histidines in the IIBs belonging to the mannose family of PTS transporters (for reviews see Refs. 4Postma P.W.

Phosphate-binding sites and phosphate-catalytic sites frequently contain arginines, which by their guanidino group can stabilize phosphate through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions (6Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons with respect to invariant arginines in PTS proteins from different bacteria reveal the following picture. The N-terminal domain of enzyme I has Arg-126, Arg-186, and Arg-195, which are completely invariant in 17 sequences. Arg-186 and Arg-195 are close to the phosphorylation site His-189 (7Liao D.I. Silverton E. Seok Y.J. Lee B.R. Peterkofsky A. Davies D.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Arg-131 is conserved in 14 and Arg-136 is conserved in 15 sequences. The C-terminal domain has 7 completely invariant arginines (Protein Domain Data Base:protein.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom/prodom.html). The functional role of these residues in enzyme I has not been explored. HPr is a 9-kDa open faced four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with three α-helices on one face. Arg-17, which is close to the active site His-15, is invariant in all 22 known sequences. When Arg-17 is replaced by Ser or Glu, phospho-donor and -acceptor activity of HPr are reduced to between 6% and less than 0.1% of the control (8Anderson J.W. Pullen K. Georges F. Klevit R.E. Waygood E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12325-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group bound to His-15 of HPr is most likely complexed by the guanidino group of Arg-17, as inferred from its restricted conformational freedom observed upon phosphorylation of HPr, and from 31P chemical shift changes (9Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15271-15282Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, more recently this stabilization of the phosphoryl group by the guanidino group has been questioned, based on a molecular dynamics simulation in water and refined NMR data of phospho-HPr (10Van Nuland N.A.J. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Jones B.E. Rajagopal P. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 10: 2107-2119Google Scholar). No invariant arginines occur in the 21 IIA components of the glucose family and in the five IIA domains of the mannose family of PTS transporters. Two arginines, Arg-424 and Arg-426, are invariant in the IIB components of the glucose family. They are close to the active site Cys-421 (residues numbers refer to theE. coli IICBGlc subunit), and both are essential for phospho-donor activity toward glucose but not for phospho-acceptor activity (12Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Five arginine residues, Arg-168, Arg-172, Arg-190, Arg-204, and Arg-304 (numbers refer to E. coliIIABMan subunit), are invariant in the IIB domains of the PTS transporters of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae (13Wehmeier U.F. Lengeler J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Bacillus subtilis (14Martin Verstraete I. Debarbouille M. Klier A. Rapoport G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) belonging to the mannose family. Arg-168 and Arg-172 are close in sequence to the active site His-175 of IIABMan. In summary, it appears that arginines close to the active site residues occur in the even numbered phosphorylation sites (HPr and IIB) of the glucose and mannose specific PTS and possibly in enyzme I but that arginines are absent from the IIA domains. The mannose transporter complex of E. coli consists of three subunits. The IICMan and IIDMan subunits comprise six and one putative membrane-spanning segments (15Huber F. Erni B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They contain the substrate binding site, and they facilitate the penetration of bacteriophage λ DNA by an as yet unknown mechanism (16Elliott J. Arber W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 161: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two IIABMan subunits form a stable homodimer, which reversibly binds to the IICMan-IIDMan complex (K D 5–10 nm). The IIABMansubunit consists of two protein domains (IIA and IIB), which are connected by a 20-residue-long hinge peptide rich in alanine and proline (18Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains can be separated by limited trypsinolysis at two lysine residues in the hinge. The IIAMan domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr at His-10 and donates the phosphoryl group to His-175 of the IIBMan domain. IIBManthen donates the phosphate to the sugar. Although IIBMancan accept a phosphate from IIAMan in the absence of the IICMan-IIDMan complex, it can donate the phosphate to the sugar only in the ternary complex with IICMan and IIDMan. The IIAMandomain has an α/β open pleated sheet structure. The central β-sheet consists of four parallel strands from one subunit and one antiparallel strand from the second subunit in the dimer (19Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This β strand exchange makes the dimer highly resistant to subunit dissociation. While this work was in progress, the x-ray structure of IIBLev of B. subtilis was solved (20Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has an open pleated α/β fold consisting of a strongly twisted seven-stranded β-sheet with helices on both faces (Fig. 4). The IIBMan domain has 47% amino acid sequence identity with IIBLev, and the two proteins complement each other (20Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the functions of the invariant arginines in the IIBMan domain of the mannose transporter. E. coliK12-UT580ΔLPM (ΔmanXYZ::cat) and ZSC112LΔLPM(ΔmanXYZ::cat ptsG glk) carry a deletion of the chromosomal manXYZ allele. Gene replacement was done in E. coli DPE271 (recD) as described (21Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol.

(i) TheHindIII-KpnI fragment encoding residues 111–323 of IIABMan, the complete IICMan, and residues 1–241 of IIDMan was removed from plasmid pTSML1 (22Erni B. Zanolari B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15495-15503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and replaced by KpnI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pMc5–8 (23Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M.

(ii) The recombinant plasmid pTSΔLPM::Cm was linearized with NdeI and used to transform E. coli DPE271 (recD). (iii) Transformants defective in mannose uptake were selected on McConkey indicator plates containing mannose and chloramphenicol and tested for the loss of ampicillin resistance. (iv) The cat gene was then P1 transduced into UT580 and ZSC112L. ZSC112ΔLPM was transformed with plasmid pTSPM6 (encoding IICMan and IIDMan) (18Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a second plasmid encoding the IIABMan mutants, and the strains were used for in vivo experiments. WA2127ΔHIC (manXYZ, ΔptsH ptsI crr) (24Mao Q. Schunk T. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used as host for protein expression. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. XL1-blue (Stratagene) was used for cloning and plasmid amplification. IIABMan mutants R168Q,R172Q, R304Q were constructed using the gapped duplex procedure (23Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J.

Mutants R190K and R204K were constructed by overlap extension mutagenesis (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). Mutant clones were identified by DNA sequencing. The HindIII-SnaBI segments carrying the mutations were cloned into the expression vector pJFL (encodingmanX under the control of tacP, identical with pTACL293) (27Seip S. Balbach J. Behrens S. Kessler H. Flükiger K. Demeyer R. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7174-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). E. coli WA2127ΔHIC was transformed with derivatives of pJFL encoding wild-type and mutant IIABMan. IIABManwas overexpressed and purified as described (25Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme I and HPr were purified as described (24Mao Q. Schunk T. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The IICMan-IIDMancomplex was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography (28Huber, F., Topology, Purification, and Subunit Composition of the Mannose Transporter of Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis, 1996, University of Bern.Google Scholar). 2R. Gutknecht, R. Lanz, and B. Erni, unpublished results. In vitrophosphorylation of [14C]Glc was assayed by ion-exchange chromatography as described (25Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of incubation mixture contained 0.5 μg of enzyme I, 2.8 μg of HPr, and 0.5 μl of crude membranes (∼4 μg protein) containing the IICMan-IIDMan complex. Uptake of [14C]dGlc by bacteria was assayed as described (29Buhr A. Daniels G.A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3847-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [14C]dGlc concentration was 120 μm, the specific activity was 6600 dpm/nmol. The cell density in the assay mixture wasA 600 = 15. 100-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, diluted in ice-cold minimal salts medium, and applied to glass fiber filters under suction. The rate and the extent of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was measured in a filter binding assay (21Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation mixture (50 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm NaF, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol) contained 15 μg of enzyme I, 2.5 μg of HPr, and 85 μg of IIABMan per 250 μl. The phosporylation reaction was started by adding to the incubation mixture at 24 °C [32P]PEP (∼1200 dpm/nmol) to a final concentration of 80 μm. Aliquots of 40 μl were withdrawn at the indicated time points and diluted into 1 ml of 80% ammonium sulfate solution at 4 °C. The protein precipitates were collected on glass microfiber filters (GF/F, Whatman) under suction. The precipitate was washed with 2× 1 ml of ice-cold 80% ammonium sulfate, and the filters were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. To measure the dephosphorylation rate of PIIABMan (rate of P transfer to mannose) the reaction mixture was first incubated with 80 μm [32P]PEP for 5 min (pulse). At time 0 the following components were added together: a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled PEP (chase); 1 μg of IICMan/IIDMan; an aqueous suspension of E. coli lipids (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml; Glc to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. 40-μl aliquots were withdrawn and processed as indicated above. Control reactions containing all components with the exception of IICMan/IIDMan were done in parallel. The background counts due to enzyme I and HPr (less than 10%) were subtracted from the counts of the complete system. In parallel, the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed on 17.5% polyacrylamide gels as described (21Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20-μl incubation mixtures contained 100 μm [32P]PEP (<1200 dpm/nmol), 1 μg of enzyme I, 1 μg of HPr, 6 μg of IIABMan, and where indicated 2 μg of IICMan/IIDMan. [32P]PEP was prepared as described (30Roossien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of the three subunits of the mannose transporter was directed by two compatible plasmids encoding the soluble IIABMan subunit and the transmembrane IICMan-IIDMan complex. The expression of IICMan/IIDMan was constitutive. Expression of IIABMan was induced with 30 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, at which concentration the cell growth rate on a mineral salts medium containing mannose as the only carbon source was maximal.2 Cells expressing wild-type IIABMan or mutants R190K and R304Q produced red colonies on McConkey mannose indicator plates, whereas mutants R168Q and R172Q produced yellow colonies. R204K produced yellow colonies with a small red center. The initial rates of [14C]dGlc uptake by wild-type and R190K expressing cells were very similar, whereas the R304Q mutant had about 50% of wild-type activity (Fig. 1 A). The arginine mutants R168Q, R172Q and R204K had less than 5% transport activity. The results from McConkey plates and in vivotransport studies are consistent and indicate that arginines 168, 172, and 204 are essential for transport activity of the mannose transporter, whereas arginines 190 and 304 are dispensable when replaced by lysine and glutamine, respectively. As expected, these conservative replacements did not have a major impact on structural stability and folding since all five mutant proteins could be overexpressed and also retained the strong affinity for phosphocellulose characteristic of IIABMan (not shown). They differ from the H175C active site mutant, which is no longer phosphorylated and displays a reduced affinity for phosphocellulose (25Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the intact cell the PTS transporters catalyze vectorial transport coupled to phosphorylation of the substrate. Observations made with the glucose transporter indicate that phosphorylation of intracellular substrates by the PTS (nonvectorial phosphorylation) also occurs in intact cells. The physiological significance of this activity is unknown (31Thompson J. Chassy B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 224-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nuoffer C. Zanolari B. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6647-6655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation without transport can be assayed with purified proteins. Purified IIABMan proteins were incubated in the presence of PEP and [14C]Glc, enzyme I, HPr, and crude membrane vesicles containing the IICMan-IIDMancomplex, and the formation of [14C]Glc6P was measured (Fig. 1 B). The R190K and R304Q mutants had the same activity as wild-type IIABMan, R204K had 70% and R168Q had 10% activity. The R172Q mutant was completely inactive. These in vitro results are consistent with the observations made with intact cells with one exception; the R204K mutant, which had a very lowin vivo transport activity, retained 70% nonvectorial phosphorylation activity. The IIABMan subunit consists of two independent domains (IIA and IIB) each containing one phosphorylation site. IIB accepts the phosphoryl groups from the IIAMan domain. All five invariant arginines are located in the IIB domain. How does the substitution of the invariant arginines affect phosphorylation at the two active sites? The arginine mutants of IIAB were phosphorylated with [32P]PEP in the presence of enzyme I and HPr. Thereafter the IIAMan and IIBMan domains were cleaved by limited trypsinolysis and separated by gel electrophoresis. All mutant proteins were phosphorylated on IIAMan (as expected) and also on the mutated IIBMan domains (Fig.2 A). The amount of32P in the IIB band is lower than in the IIA band because histidine Nδ phosphates are more sensitive to hydrolysis than histidine Nε phosphates and because the IIB domain also is more sensitive to incipient trypsinolysis than IIA (18Erni B. Zanolari B. Graff P. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio32P-IIB to 32P-IIA after gel electrophoresis is between 0.3 and 0.4 for wild-type, R190K, and R304Q and between 0.13 and 0.15 for the R168Q, R172Q and R204K mutants. This suggests that the less active mutants are phosphorylated less efficiently or are less stable toward hydrolysis during gel electrophoresis. The addition of the IICMan-IIDMan complex and glucose in excess of [32P]PEP results in the complete dephosphorylation of all the phosphorylated proteins with the only exception of the R172Q mutant, indicating that the R172Q mutant can accept a phosphoryl group but is unable to donate it to glucose (Fig.2 B, + lanes). When glucose is omitted but the IICMan-IIDMan complex is present, wild-type IIABMan and the fully active R190K and R304Q are phosphorylated to a lesser degree than the less active R168Q, R172Q and R204K mutants (Fig. 2 B, − lanes). This is possibly due to IICMan/IIDMan-mediated spontaneous hydrolysis, which is faster with active IIABManthan with the less active IIABMan mutants. For a more quantitative analysis, the time course of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was determined in solution. Purified IIABMan was incubated with enzyme I, HPr, and [32P]PEP, and aliquots were removed at the indicated time points (Fig. 3 A). R168Q,R172Q,R190K are phosphorylated at 50–75% the rate of the wild-type in the presence of a saturating concentration of HPr. The remaining mutants are phosphorylated at more than 80% the rate. The small difference vanishes when the HPr concentration is rate-limiting (Fig. 3 B). The dephosphorylation rates were measured in a pulse-chase experiment. IIABMan was labeled with32P in the presence of enzyme I and HPr. The chase was triggered by the addition of an excess of IICMan-IIDMan complex, glucose as P-acceptor and unlabeled PEP. The dephosphorylation rate is maximal for wild-type IIABMan. R204K, R190K, and R304Q dephosphorylate at an intermediate rate whereas R168Q and R172Q are very slow (Fig. 3C). A difference between R168Q and R172Q could be seen when the IICMan/IIDMan concentration was increased. The rate of dephosphorylation of R168Q as well as of wild-type IIABMan increased with increasing IICMan/IIDMan concentration, whereas R172Q remained inactive irrespective of the IICMan/IIDMan concentration (Fig.3 D).Figure 3Time course of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IIABMan.

Protein precipitates were collected on filters and counted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, same as Abut in the presence of a rate-limiting concentration (90 μg/ml) of HPr. C, purified IIABMan was phosphorylated for 5 min (pulse). At time 0, IICMan/IIDMan, 0.5 mm Glc, and a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled PEP (chase) was added. As control, Glc and PEP but no IICMan/IIDMan were added to wild-type IIABMan (solid circles, dotted). The reactions were stopped at the indicated time points as described in A.D, same as C with the wild-type and the slow R168Q mutant but with different concentrations of IICMan/IIDMan (1 μg (dotted); 2 μg (dash-dotted); 4 μg (dashed); 8 μg (solid)) during the chase period. Wild-type (○); R168Q (□); R172Q (▵); R190K (▿); R204K (⬡); R304Q (♦). The maximum ratio of 32Pi to IIABMan is 2 because there are two phosphorylation sites per IIABMansubunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The IIABMan subunit together with the transmembrane IICMan-IIDMan complex mediate transport and phosphorylation of mannose and related hexoses. Arginines play a specific role in many phosphoproteins where they stabilize the phosphoryl group in the ground and/or in the transition state (6Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The IIB proteins of E. coli, B. subtilis, andK. pneumoniae share five invariant arginines. To elucidate the functional role of these conserved residues for phosphorylation and transport, they were replaced one at a time with either Lys or Gln. Substrate phosphorylation is completely blocked in the R172Q mutant, strongly inhibited in the R168Q mutant, and three times slower than wild-type for the other mutants. Arg-172 together with His-175 is at the center of the active site loop (Fig.4). The conformation of Arg-172 in the crystal structure (of the nonphosphorylated IIBLev) precludes a direct interaction between the guanidino group and a phosphoryl group, which would be bound to Nδ of His-175. However, already a minor conformational change would suffice to bring the guanidino group within van der Waals distance of P-His-175. The high crystallographic B-factors for the loop and the complete absence of electron density for the Arg-172 side chain indicate flexibility allowing for such a move (20Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arg-168 and Arg-304 are components of a hydrogen bonding network that links the active site loop to a second large loop comprising residues 305–311. Other components of this network are the invariant Asp-170 of the active site loop, the invariant Asn-264 of the adjacent β-strand 5, residue 302 (Glu/Asp) of β-strand 6, and the invariant Asp-309 in the loop between β-strands 6 and 7 (Fig. 4). The β6/β7 loop is accessible from the protein surface and according to the docking model not involved in contacts to the IIA domain (20Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arg-204 is located on the edge of the first half of the β-sheet and does not interact directly with the phosphorylation site. The R204K mutant supports nonvectorial glucose phosphorylation but not glucose translocation. Arg-204 of IIABMan therefore appears important for solute translocation by the IICMan-IIDMan complex. Mutation of the nearby His-219 (H219Q) reduces the affinity of IIABMan for the IICMan-IIDMan complex resulting in 20-fold reduced phosphotransferase activity (25Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, these residues and the region of the β-sheet comprising them yielded only weak signals in the NMR experiments with the isolated IIBMan domain. The high degree of conformational flexibility of this region could be due to missing interactions with the IICMan-IIDMancomplex (33Gschwind R.M. Gemmecker G. Leutner M. Kessler H. Gutknecht R. Lanz R. Flükiger K. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that the first half of the β-sheet of IIBMan might form the interface with the IICMan-IIDMan complex. While this work was in progress four new transporters belonging to the mannose family were discovered, one for glucose in Lactobacillus curvatus (34Veyrat A. Gosalbes M.J. Pérez-Martı́nez G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3469-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), one for glucose and mannose in Vibrio furnissii (35Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and a system for N-acetylgalactosamine in E. coli comprising two IIB subunits (IIBAgaand IIBAga′) (36Reizer J. Ramseier T.M. Reizer A. Charbit A. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All five arginines are conserved inL. curvatus. In the IIBs of V. furnissii and of the E. coli GalNAc system only the two arginines near the active site histidine (Arg-168 and Arg-172) are invariant, whereas Ile and Leu are found in the position of Arg-190 and Gln instead of Arg-204 and Arg-304. Two Arg mutants (R426K and R428K) that have the same phenotype as R172Q of IIABMan were found in IICBGlc of theE. coli glucose transporter, which belongs to the glucose family and is structurally unrelated to the mannose transporter (12Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When the phosphorylation cascade (enzyme I-HPr-IIA-IIB) of the two phosphotransferase systems for glucose and mannose are compared, the following patterns of structural and functional properties can be recognized. The active sites of enzyme I and IIA are on concave surfaces, they do not contain arginines near the active site, and the histidines are phosphorylated at Nε of the imidazole ring. The even numbered components of HPr and IIB have active sites protruding from the surface of the proteins, they are phosphorylated at Nδ of the imidazole ring or at a cysteine, and they contain one or several invariant and essential arginines. This periodicity and the structural and functional complementarity between alternating active sites is particularly striking between HPr and the IIB domain, where the conformations of the β/α active site loops are very similar (20Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The fact that mutants can be phosphorylated but not donate the phosphoryl group to the next component suggests that the structural requirements for accepting a phosphoryl group are less exacting than for donating a phosphoryl group. The transition state apparently is stabilized by the phosphoryl donor rather than the phosphoryl acceptor protein. This was demonstrated with short basic peptides containing either a histidine or a cysteine that are rapidly phosphorylated by enzyme I but cannot donate the phosphoryl group further to an acceptor protein (37Mukhija S. Erni B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inverse mechanism has been observed with CheY, the response regulator of the chemotactic signaling cascade. CheY, which is phosphorylated at an aspartyl residue can autocatalyze the phosphoryl transfer not only from the cognate phosphoryl donor, the sensor kinase CheA, but also from low molecular weight phosphates such as phosphoramidate or acetylphosphate (38Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Attempts to phosphorylate IIABMan with phosphohistidine or phosphoramidate failed so far. It remains to be seen in the future whether the phosphotransfer mechanisms of the PTS and of the two component regulatory systems (39Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar) can be characterized as catalysis by phospho-donor (kinase-like) and catalysis by phospho-acceptor (phosphatase-like), respectively. We thank Stephan Schauder for helpful discussions, suggestions, and the preparation of Fig. 4."
https://openalex.org/W2066186399,"The soluble human transferrin receptor (TfR) found in blood is the result of a proteolytic cleavage occurring in the ectodomain of the receptor close to the transmembrane domain at Arg-100. We have discovered another cleavage site between Gly-91 and Val-92 even closer to the transmembrane domain. Cleavage at Gly-91 differs markedly from the normal cleavage site. It occurs when the entire cytoplasmic portion or the proximal 31 amino acids of the transmembrane domain are deleted. A soluble disulfide-bonded dimer of the TfR is released into the medium in contrast to the cleavage at Arg-100 where a dimer lacking intersubunit disulfide bonds is released. Whereas the cleavage at Arg-100 is generated by cycling through the endosomal system, pulse-chase experiments indicate that cleavage at Gly-91 occurs predominantly during the biosynthesis of the receptor. Pulse-chase analysis of the biosynthesis of mutant TfRs that lack the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain show that they exit the endoglycosidase H-sensitive compartment at a slower rate than the wild type TfR. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain influences the trafficking of the TfR either by influencing the folding of the ectodomain or by providing a positive signal for its transport through the biosynthetic pathway.

Iron is released from transferrin in the acidic environment of endosomes, and transferrin and its receptor return to the cell surface where the cycle is repeated 100–200 times during the lifetime of the receptor. The number of TfRs on the cell surface regulates the amount of iron taken into cells. In turn, TfR numbers are regulated at the synthetic level by the stability of its mRNA, which is sensitive to intracellular iron pools. It is regulated at the level of degradation by the release of TfR from the cell by proteolytic cleavage and presumably the lysosomal degradative pathway (1Enns C.A. Rutledge E.A. Williams A.M. Biomembranes. 1996; 4: 255-287Google Scholar). The soluble form of the TfR found in blood has been characterized and studied extensively (for review, see Refs. 1Enns C.A. Rutledge E.A. Williams A.M. Biomembranes. 1996; 4: 255-287Google Scholar and 2Cook J.D. Skikne M.S. Baynes R.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The TfR is a type II membrane protein with the NH2 terminus in the cytoplasm and the COOH terminus in the ectodomain, and NH2-terminal sequencing of the soluble TfR revealed the cleavage site to be Arg-100 (3Shih Y.J.

It is released as a homodimer composed of 80-kDa subunits. Under denaturing but nonreducing conditions it migrates as a monomer, indicating a lack of intersubunit disulfide bonds (3Shih Y.J.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of TfR released into the medium varies with cell type (6Rutledge E.A. Enns C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. A. Rutledge, I. Gaston, B. J. Root, T. E. McGraw, and C. A. Enns, unpublished observations. In both rats and humans the amount of soluble TfR in the blood correlates directly with erythropoiesis, indicating that cleavage of the TfR may be the major way of down-regulating the TfR during the differentiation of red blood cell precursors (2Cook J.D. Skikne M.S. Baynes R.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Nair M.K. Ebner K.E. Cook J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). While examining the trafficking of various mutated TfRs, we discovered a different cleavage site in the ectodomain of the TfR which results in the release of a soluble disulfide-bonded dimer of the TfR. This soluble TfR was sequenced, and the cleavage site was determined to be after Gly-91. Cleavage at Gly-91 occurs in TfRs in which 20 amino acids are deleted in the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR proximal to the membrane (amino acids 29–59). No detectable cleavage of wild type TfR at Gly-91 is detected. We present evidence that the protease that cleaves the TfR at Gly-91 is a resident of the early biosynthetic pathway, further distinguishing this cleavage from the previously characterized endosomal cleavage at Arg-100. Importantly, the extent of cleavage at Gly-91 correlates with the transit rate of the TfR through the ER-Golgi compartments. The longer the TfR spends in the endo H-sensitive compartment (e.g. ER/cis-Golgi), the greater the extent of cleavage at Gly-91. These results imply that the region of the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR proximal to the membrane is required for rapid transit through the early biosynthetic compartments. The deletion of amino acids 29–59 increases cleavage of the TfR by slowing its transit through the early compartments, thereby increasing the time the TfR is in the compartment containing the protease. TRVb cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line deficient in endogenous TfR (8McGraw T. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J.

The P59A TfR and the Δ29–59 TfR mutants were made by PCR overlap extension (14Horton M.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1983; 144: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The TfR cDNA in pcDTR1 (15McClelland A. Kuhn L.C. Ruddle F.H. Cell. 1984; 39: 267-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was cut out with EcoRV and XbaI, eliminating the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions, and was inserted into pcDNA3, in which the HindIII site in the multiple cloning site was destroyed by digestion with HindIII and filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase. PCR mutagenesis was carried out using the outside primers to the T7 promoter (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) and to nucleotides 975–995 of the TfR (5′-ATG TCC AAA GAA TGA AAGTTC-3′). The inside, overlapping, and mutagenic primers for creating the P59A TfR were 5′-AAG GCC AAT GTC ACA AAA GCA AAA AGG TGT AGT-3′ and 5′-TTT TGT GAC ATT GGC CTT-3′, and for creating the Δ29–59 TfR they were 5′-AGC CTG GCT CGG CAA AAA AGG TGT AGT GGA AGT-3′ and 5′-TTG CCG AGC CAG GCT-3′. The first round of PCRs, using 3 units of Vent polymerase, from an outside primer to an inside primer created two overlapping fragments, one containing the mutation. These fragments were gel purified by electroelution, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended for the second round of PCR, with 3 units of Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), the products from the first PCR round, and the two outside primers, to create a full-length mutated fragment. The fragment was gel purified, digested with EcoRV and HindIII, and ligated into the pcDNA3 TfR plasmid, which had been digested with EcoRV and HindIII. The resulting plasmids were transformed into DH5′α bacteria, and colonies were screened for the correct plasmid, which was then sequenced along the entire length that had been subjected to PCR, about 900 nucleotides. No errors were found. The T104DΔ3–59 was made by loop-out mutagenesis of the T104D construct using the Amersham site-directed mutagenesis kit and the oligonucleotide 5′-CAG TTC AGA ATG ATG AAA AGG TGT AGT GGA-3′. Samples were processed for electrophoresis and Western blots as described previously (16Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17648-17654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were developed by incubation with a sheep anti-TfR serum (16Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

Protein bands were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation sequence analysis in either an Applied Biosystems Inc. 476A or 477A system using standard sequencing cycles. Amino acid determinations were made by visual inspection of resulting chromatograms. Cells (35-mm dishes) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cooled on ice. They were incubated with 1 ml of 3.4 mm sulfosuccinimidyl biotin (Pierce) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline just before use to label cell surface proteins. After 30 min on ice they were washed three times with medium and incubated in 2 ml of medium overnight (12–17 h) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was collected, and the cells were washed and lysed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100. The TfR was isolated from the lysates and media with 100 μl and 200 μl of transferrin-agarose, respectively. It was eluted with 2 × Laemmli buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) lacking reducing agents.

Cells labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys for 10 min were washed, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with anti-TfR serum. Half of the immunoprecipitate was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 50 milliunits of endo H in sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, according to manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The other half was mock digested under the same conditions. The TfR was eluted from the immunoprecipitate with 2 × Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. We have shown previously that the soluble TfR found in blood is generated by cleavage of the wild type TfR at Arg-100 by an unidentified protease (3Shih Y.J. Baynes R.D. Hudson B.G. Flowers C.H.

The soluble TfR fragment migrates as a monomer on nonreducing SDS gels, indicating that it does not contain any intersubunit disulfide bonds. Elimination of theO-linked carbohydrate by mutating the Thr at position 104 to any number of amino acids potentiated the cleavage of the TfR at Arg-100 (10Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage is affected by the composition of theO-linked carbohydrate four amino acids away and is generated in endocytic vesicles (5Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rutledge E.A. Enns C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage pattern of a TfR in which the cytoplasmic domain has been deleted (Δ3–59 TfR) is different from that seen for the wild type TfR. A large increase in the amount of soluble TfR is detected in the medium of cells expressing the Δ3–59 TfR compared with the amount of soluble TfR found in the medium of cells expressing the wild type TfR (Fig. 1). This large increase was unexpected because cleavage of the wild type TfR at Arg-100 occurs in an endosomal compartment following internalization from the plasma membrane, and the Δ3–59 TfR is internalized significantly more slowly than the wild type TfR (11McGraw T. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

A characteristic of the cleavage at Arg-100 is that it is enhanced by elimination of the O-linked oligosaccharide at Thr-104 (T104D TfR) (6Rutledge E.A. Enns C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of O-linked glycosylation at Thr-104 on cleavage of the Δ3–59 TfR we constructed a Δ3–59 TfR containing a mutation of Thr-104 to Asp-104 (10Rutledge E.A. Root B.J. Lucas J.J. Enns C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and determined the effect of this mutation on the formation of soluble TfR. The amount of soluble TfR generated from Δ3–59 TfR is greater than that generated from cells expressing the T104D TfR, and elimination of the O-linked glycosylation site does not result in enhanced release of soluble TfR from the Δ3–59 TfR (medium: Δ3–59 and T104DΔ3–59; Fig. 1). Therefore, either the truncated form of the TfR does not contain an O-linked oligosaccharide at this site, or the cleavage at the alternate site is not sensitive to glycosylation (see below). The soluble TfR generated from the Δ3–59 TfR is heterogeneous on nonreducing gels, and the majority of the released TfR contains at least one intersubunit disulfide bond. In contrast, the soluble TfRs generated from either the wild type TfR or the T104D TfR show no appreciable soluble disulfide-bonded dimer (Fig. 1). Two intersubunit disulfide bonds have been identified in the TfR at Cys-98 and Cys-89 (22Alvarez E. Gironès N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jing S.-Q. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11555-11559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the new cleavage site had to be between Cys-98 and the putative transmembrane domain starting at Cys-89. To determine the cleavage site, the soluble TfR generated from Δ3–59 TfR was isolated from the medium of transfected cells. NH2-terminal sequencing of the first six amino acids of the soluble disulfide-linked TfR dimer indicates that the major cleavage site is between Gly-91 and Val-92 (∼90%) with a minor cleavage site between Cys-89 and Lys 90 (∼10%) (Fig. 2). Sequencing eight amino acids of the soluble monomer derived from Δ3–59 TfR on nonreducing SDS gels indicates that the cleavage occurs at Arg-100. Lack of sequencing at Thr-104 is consistent with an O-linked oligosaccharide at this site, suggesting that the Δ3–59 TfR contains an O-linked glycosylation at Thr-104 (24Hayes G.R. Enns C.A. Lucas J.J. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Do S.-I. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, the mobility of the dimer shifts to 80 kDa. The mobilities of the soluble TfRs cleaved at either Gly-91 or Arg-100 under reducing conditions were indistinguishable from one another (results not shown). Because this cleavage site at Gly-91 is different from the one identified previously we sought to characterize where in the cell the cleavage was occurring and why eliminating the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR resulted in the novel cleavage in its ectodomain. Previous studies indicated that cleavage of the TfR at Arg-100 occurs when the TfR cycles through the endocytic compartments (5Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TfR contains the endocytic sequence YTRF in the cytoplasmic domain at amino acids 20–23. The Δ3–59 TfR is defective in endocytosis and accumulates on the cell surface (13Pytowski B. Judge T.W. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Therefore we wanted to test whether the Gly-91 cleavage was occurring at the plasma membrane because cell surface metalloproteases such as TACE have been implicated in the cleavage of an increasing number of proteins such as the tumor necrosis factor α, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules (27Arribas J. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Mutation of two critical amino acids, Tyr-20 → Cys and Phe-23 → Ala (C20A23 TfR), or deletion of the endocytic signal (Δ3–28 TfR) results in TfRs equally as defective in endocytosis as the Δ3–59 TfR (11McGraw T. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus if cleavage was on the cell surface then these cytoplasmic mutations should result in the release of a soluble disulfide-linked TfR dimer into the medium. No detectable amounts of cleaved TfR above that of the wild type TfR could be detected in the medium even when large amounts of medium were collected and the blots were exposed longer than normal (Fig.3). These results indicate that a cell surface protease was not responsible for the cleavage of the TfR at Gly-91. They differ from the generation of the soluble TfR cleaved at Arg-100. In the latter case, elimination of the endocytic signal resulted in less soluble TfR being produced (5Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cleavage at Gly-91 is seen when the entire cytoplasmic domain is missing and not when the region from amino acids 3–28 is missing, this suggests that the region 29–59 may be important for generating the soluble disulfide-linked TfR. The TfR with a deletion in the juxtamembrane region was generated to determine whether this sequence is important in the generation of the soluble disulfide-linked TfR dimer. A soluble TfR containing intersubunit disulfide bonds is generated from Δ29–59 TfR (Fig.4). This process is not as efficient as in the Δ3–59 TfR (Fig. 3). The cleavage of the TfR missing the NH2-terminal 26 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain (Δ3–28 TfR) was compared with the cleavage of the TfR missing the 31 transmembrane-proximal amino acids (Δ29–59 TfR) (Figs. 3 and 4). The Δ3–59 TfR produces a greater amount of soluble disulfide-bonded dimer than does the Δ29–59 TfR. Because the Δ29–59 TfR and the Δ3–28 TfR have similarly sized cytoplasmic domains, the composition of the cytoplasmic domain is likely to be more important than the length of the cytoplasmic domain in regard to the production of this form of the soluble TfR. Mutational analysis of residues around a variety of membrane proteins indicates that the protease(s) cleave at a specific distance from the membrane in addition to having amino acid specificity (for review, see Ref. 31Arribas J. Lopez-Casillas F. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain of the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR might have residues that could anchor the TfR in the membrane at a fixed position relative to the membrane. Altering the amino acids by truncation of this portion of the cytoplasmic domain, as is the case with Δ3–59 TfR and Δ29–59 TfR, could result in a shift of the TfR in the membrane, making it more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at a new site. One explanation for the cleavage at Gly-91 could be that an α-helix breaking Pro at position 59 influences the position of the TfR in the membrane. However, mutation of Pro-59 to an α-helix permissive Ala had no effect on the cleavage of the TfR (Fig. 4). Another possibility concerns the addition of palmitic acid to the TfR. The covalent modification of proteins with palmitic acid contributes to the anchoring of proteins in membranes (32Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). The wild type TfR is normally palmitoylated at Cys-61 and perhaps Cys-67 (22Alvarez E. Gironès N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jing S.-Q. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11555-11559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated Δ3–59 TfR could lack palmitate, and therefore the transmembrane region of the TfR may not be anchored in the membrane properly. Cells containing either wild type or Δ3–59 TfR were labeled with either [3H]palmitate or [35S]Met/Cys. Approximately equal numbers of TfRs were immunoprecipitated, and the relative amounts of [3H]palmitate incorporated into the TfRs were visually compared with the amount of [35S]Met/Cys incorporated (Fig. 5). Both the wild type and Δ3–59 TfR contain the same number of methionine and cysteine residues, so such a comparison is valid. Significantly more [3H]palmitate was incorporated into the truncated Δ3–59 TfR than into the wild type TfR, indicating that enhanced cleavage of Δ3–59 is not caused by reduced palmitoylation. Palmitoylation occurs at the plasma membrane (32Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this observation because a greater proportion of Δ3–59 TfR than wild type TfR is at the plasma membrane. Earlier studies indicated that generation of the soluble TfR by cleavage at Arg-100 occurred after the TfR had reached the plasma membrane and while it was cycling through endocytic compartments in the cell (5Rutledge E.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31864-31868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two methods were used to determine that most of the soluble TfR cleaved at Gly-91 is generated during the biosynthesis of the TfR before it reaches the cell surface. In one set of experiments cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 1 h, washed, and chased for up to 24 h. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of newly synthesized Δ3–59 TfR indicates that the soluble receptor that is cleaved at Gly-91 (dimer on nonreducing SDS gels) is generated within the first 2 h of its synthesis, and very little additional dimer is generated with a longer chase. The cleavage at Arg-100 (monomer on nonreducing SDS gels) takes place continuously and linearly during the lifetime of the TfR (Fig. 6). In another set of experiments, cells were labeled overnight with [35S]Met/Cys, washed to remove soluble TfR generated soon after labeling, and chased with nonradioactive medium. Most of the radioactivity is in the mature fully glycosylated form of the TfR and less in immature forms under these conditions. Production of soluble disulfide-linked dimer from mature TfR is reduced compared with that from newly synthesized TfR. The results from these experiments indicate that the soluble disulfide-linked dimer is generated during the biosynthesis of the TfR. A precursor-product relationship of dimer being converted to monomer is not seen because the amount of dimer remains stable instead of decreasing. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the soluble disulfide-linked TfR cleaved at Gly-91 is generated in the biosynthetic pathway, and the soluble TfR cleaved at Arg-100 is generated from the mature TfR. To confirm these conclusions, cell surface proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C. The cleaved TfR was isolated from medium 24 h after biotinylation, and the cleavage site and extent of cleavage were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Cleaved biotinylated TfR was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ECL on Western blots (Fig. 7). Relative amounts of cleaved biotinylated TfR were compared with total cleaved TfR detected by"

The DNA topoisomerases alter DNA topology via the introduction of transient breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of this biopolymer (1Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar,2Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These enzymes participate in the essential cellular processes of DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (3Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerases are classified into two groups based on their mode of DNA strand scission: the type I enzymes mediate the transient single-strand breakage of a DNA substrate, whereas the type II topoisomerases break both strands. Because of their essential role in the cell, the eukaryotic topoisomerases have become important targets for the development of antitumor agents (4Kingsbury W.D. Boehm J.C. Jakas D.R. Holden K.G. Hecht S.M. Gallagher G. Caranfa M.J. McCabe F.L. Faucette L.F. Johnson R.K. Hertzberg R.P. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA cleavage involves nucleophilic attack of a tyrosine OH group in the active site of topoisomerase I on the phosphate ester backbone, resulting in the attachment of tyrosine to the DNA through an oligonucleotide 3′-phosphate with concomitant release of an oligonucleotide having a free 5′-OH terminus (5Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4805-4809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After strand passage of the free DNA strand around the unbroken strand, religation of the broken strand occurs by a process believed to involve reversal of the cleavage reaction. Under normal circumstances the cleavage and ligation reactions are tightly coupled with low steady-state concentrations of the covalent intermediate (6Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3488-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the two partial reactions can be uncoupled in vitro, e.g. by site-specific cleavage of partially double-stranded substrates containing a high efficiency cleavage site (see Fig. 1) (7Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the “suicide substrate” occurs without sequential religation due to the instability of the duplex involving the truncated strand downstream from the site of cleavage; loss of this oligonucleotide traps the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent intermediate. The covalently bound enzyme is catalytically competent, as may be judged by formation of the intact duplex upon admixture of an oligonucleotide complementary to the single-stranded region in the enzyme-DNA covalent binary complex (see Fig. 1 B). The covalent binary complex also undergoes ligation with partially complementary acceptors containing a free 5′-OH group (8McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5130-5137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The topoisomerases I from all species characterized thus far recognize specific nucleotide sequences in their DNA substrates, which are cleaved with high efficiency (see Fig. 1) (9Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12529-12535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Christiansen K. Svejstrup A.B.D. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9690-9701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such sites can be identified by footprinting analysis (11Stevnsner T. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cleavage-ligation reactions have been studied in some detail, further investigation is needed to define the possible roles of single nucleotides within high efficiency sequences on enzyme binding, as well as cleavage and ligation (12Vosberg H.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 114: 19-102PubMed Google Scholar). Different approaches have been utilized to determine the role of individual nucleotides, including phosphate ethylation (13Krogh S. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and deoxyguanosine N7-methylation and subsequent depurination to create abasic sites (11Stevnsner T. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abasic sites within the scissile strand on the 5′-side of the high efficiency cleavage site rendered the DNA substrate refractory to cleavage by topoisomerase I (11Stevnsner T. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Pourquier et al. (14Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have incorporated deoxyuridine and abasic sites into the noncleaved strand of a DNA substrate and investigated the effect on topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage. They found that the position of cleavage was altered and that the new site of cleavage was dependent on the location of the site modified. We have reported previously that topoisomerase I can catalyze the ligation to the covalent topoisomerase I-DNA binary complex of complementary acceptor oligonucleotides having modified nucleophiles at the 5′ terminus; the resulting duplexes have altered connectivity at the site of ligation (15Henningfeld K.A. Arslan T. Hecht S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1701-1714Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, we have extended these findings by employing a modified acceptor oligonucleotide having the 5′-terminal deoxyadenosine linked to the remainder of the oligomer through a 2 → 5′-phosphodiester bond (see Fig. 1C). When employed in the presence of a partial DNA duplex that afforded a single-stranded region complementary to the acceptor upon cleavage by topoisomerase I, the modified oligonucleotide was incorporated into a newly formed duplex (16Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The extent of (modified) duplex formation was only ∼10% of that achieved with the respective unmodified acceptor oligonucleotide after 1 h, but the yield of the modified duplex could be increased to 20% after a 13-h incubation (16Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, modified partial duplexes were utilized as substrates; each contained a single 3′-deoxyadenosine moiety within the DNA topoisomerase I-binding region on the scissile strand. The facility of cleavage or ligation was altered in a fashion dependent on the location of the 3′-deoxyadenosine moiety. To further characterize the role of single nucleotides within the recognition domain on substrate recognition and cleavage by topoisomerase I, additional partial duplex substrates containing modifications in the scissile and noncleaved strand have been prepared. Presently we demonstrate that (i) substitutions on the scissile or noncleaved strands can affect the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage and ligation reactions, (ii) certain combinations of modified nucleotides within the substrate can substantially enhance overall cleavage and ligation efficiency, (iii) topoisomerase I can effect the cleavage and ligation of a 2′ → 5′-phosphate ester linkage within the DNA substrate, and (iv) alterations in efficiency of enzyme action caused by the introduction of a 3′-deoxynucleotide at a specific site can sometimes be compensated by introduction of the complementary 3′-deoxynucleotide at the same site on the opposite strand.

Oligonucleotides were hybridized in 100 μl (total volume) of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 40 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2. The solution was heated to 80 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature under ambient conditions over a period of about 3 h. Due to the low DNA oligonucleotide concentrations, hybridization mixtures contained 0.13 pmol of the labeled strand and a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled strands to ensure complete hybridization of the labeled DNA. The 5′-32P end-labeled partial duplex (6.5 fmol, 100,000 dpm) was incubated with calf thymus topoisomerase I (20Wang L.-K. Johnson R.K. Hecht S.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (8.8 ng) in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of (17- or 19-mer) acceptor oligonucleotide in a reaction mixture (total volume, 20 μl) containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min followed by proteolysis with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (37 °C for 1 h). The reaction mixtures were dissolved in 12 μl of loading solution (10m urea, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The reaction mixtures were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and quick chilled on ice; 6.5-μl aliquots were applied to a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19% (w/v) acrylamide, 1% (w/v) N-methylenebisacrylamide, 8 m urea) and run at 50 W for 2–3 h in 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm EDTA. Reaction mixtures consisted of 10 μl (total volume) of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40,000 dpm of 5′-32P end-labeled duplex DNA and 2 μg of calf thymus DNA. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 66 units of exonuclease III. After 30 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 200 mm EDTA and 8 μl of loading solution. The reactions were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and quick chilled on ice; 5 μl was applied to a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The mobilities of the degradation products were compared with the products resulting from Maxam-Gilbert G and A+G base-specific reactions (17Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The 3′-deoxynucleotide monomers were prepared according to published procedures (16Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Rizzo C.J. Dougherty J.P. Breslow R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 4129-4132Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and incorporated into the DNA substrates within the topoisomerase I-binding region on the scissile and noncleaved strands using standard protocols for solid phase phosphoramidite chemistry (18Caruthers M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Cleavage from the solid support and removal of the base and phosphate protecting groups was affected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All oligonucleotides were purified first by Nensorb column chromatography and then by preparative 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The formation of modified duplexes was verified by exonuclease III digestion, which accurately reflected the position of the modified nucleotide in each of the partial duplexes (15Henningfeld K.A. Arslan T. Hecht S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1701-1714Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage and ligation reactions were investigated using partial duplexes containing high efficiency topoisomerase I cleavage sequences (22Christiansen K. Bonven B.J. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a single 3′-deoxnucleotide within the noncleaved strand at various positions. The 17- and 19-nucleotide acceptor oligonucleotides were fully complementary to those regions of the duplex that became single-stranded upon cleavage at sites 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 1). We first investigated the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage-ligation reaction using partial duplexes singly modified within the noncleaved strand at positions −1, −2, −4, or −6. The 5′-32P end-labeled partial duplexes containing these modifications were treated with calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I in the presence of the 17-mer acceptor oligonucleotide at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixtures were quenched by treatment with 1% SDS and proteolyzed with proteinase K to digest the covalently bound enzyme. The reactions were analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.2 A, the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage and ligation in the presence the 17-mer acceptor oligomer afforded ligated products when the noncleaved strand was modified at positions −4 or −6. Modifications at position −1 or −2 in the noncleaved strand diminished ligation with the 17-mer acceptor, although the presence of some cleavage products was apparent. To determine whether the modifications at positions −1 and −2 in the noncleaved strand created a duplex that was a poor substrate for the enzyme or simply created new preferred cleavage sites, the same set of reactions under the same conditions was carried out in the presence of the 19-mer acceptor. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage-ligation reaction with the unmodified partial duplex using a 19-mer acceptor afforded only a very limited amount of ligation product (cf. lanes 3 and 6), in good agreement with a previous study (23Henningfeld K.A. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation of topoisomerase I with partial duplexes containing a modified nucleoside at position −1 or −2 gave good yields of ligation product (Fig. 2 B , lanes 9 and 12) in the presence of the 19-mer acceptors. The use of 19-mer acceptors with partial duplexes containing a modification at position −4 or −6 in the noncleaved strand afforded little ligation product (Fig. 2 B, lanes 15 and18). The results indicate clearly that the location of the modified bases within the noncleaved strand can be important determinants of the site of cleavage. As shown in TableI, which indicates the relative efficiency and site selectivity of cleavage in the absence of any acceptor oligonucleotide, the site selectivity of cleavage paralleled the position at which ligation ultimately obtained preferentially (cf. Table I and Fig. 2). Interestingly, the overall efficiency of cleavage was lower for substitutions of deoxynucleotides at positions −4 and −6 than for substitutions at positions −1 and −2.Table IEffect of modification of the noncleaved strand on the efficiency and site selectivity of DNA cleavage by topoisomerase ISite of modificationCleavage efficiencyaExtent of total cleavage obtained at sites 1 and 2, relative to the value obtained for the unmodified partial duplex.Site 1:Site 21005 :1−1801 :3−2811 :3.5−42213 :1−63555 :1a Extent of total cleavage obtained at sites 1 and 2, relative to the value obtained for the unmodified partial duplex. Open table in a new tab Following the experiments involving partial duplexes singly modified at sites on the noncleaved strand, we investigated the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage reaction using doubly modified partial duplexes. The same set of reactions that had been used for the partial duplexes containing an unmodified scissile strand was carried out with partial duplexes containing 3′-deoxyadenosine at position +1. As shown in Fig. 3 A,modification at position +1 completely eliminated ligation of the 17-mer acceptor. Inspection of Fig. 3 A suggests that this modification diminished cleavage at site 1 and resulted in an increase in cleavage at site 2 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and6). The same set of experiments was then carried out with the 19-mer acceptor. The partial duplex having a single modification at the position +1 in the scissile strand and an unmodified noncleaved strand afforded enhanced ligation involving site 2 cleavage (Fig.3 B , lanes 5 and 6). The enzymatic reactions involving partial duplexes containing modifications both at position +1 in the scissile strand and positions −1 or −2 in the noncleaved strand gave increased site 2 cleavage as compared with the +1 substitution on the scissile strand alone (cf. lanes 5,8, and 11). In these cases the enzyme can efficiently catalyze the ligation reactions to afford full-length products (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 12). However, the substitutions at positions −4 or −6 in the noncleaved strand in addition to the +1 substitution on the scissile strand resulted in minimal ligation at best in the presence of the 17- or 19-mer acceptors (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 15 and18). Nucleotides in the scissile strand were then systematically substituted to determine which were particularly important for recognition and cleavage by topoisomerase I. In addition to assessing the structural effects of a modification at position −1, we were particularly interested to see whether topoisomerase I would cleave the DNA backbone at the unnatural 2′ → 5′ linkage present in these substrates. As shown in Fig.4 A (lane 6), topoisomerase I can cleave and ligate the unnatural 2′ → 5′ phosphodiester linkage at the topoisomerase I high efficiency cleavage site in the modified partial duplex. The extent of ligation obtained with this singly modified partial duplex was 10% of that obtained for the unmodified partial duplex, as determined by phosphorimager analysis. The partial duplexes containing a modification at position −1 in the scissile strand in addition to a modification at position −4 or −6 in the noncleaved strand were also substrates for the cleavage-ligation reaction, although the enzyme catalyzed the cleavage-ligation reaction to a lesser extent (∼5%) relative to unmodified partial duplex (Fig. 4 A, lanes 15 and18, and Fig. 5). The partial duplex having a single modification at position −1 in the scissile strand was cleaved and ligated with greater facility at site 2, as verified by enzymatic reactions in the presence of the 19-mer acceptor (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Additional modification at position −1 or −2 on the noncleaved strand along with the modification at position −1 on the scissile strand had little further effect on the extent of cleavage and ligation at site 2 (Fig.4 B, cf. lanes 6, 9, and12). As shown previously for the modification at position +1 (Fig. 3 B), regardless of the acceptor employed, there was minimal ligation product formed when the substrate was modified at position −4 or −6 on the noncleaved strand in addition to the substitution at position −1 on the scissile strand (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 15 and18).Figure 5Schematic representation of topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage-ligation of a substrate having a 2′ → 5′ linkage at the cleavage site. The percentage of ligation product obtained with a substrate containing a single modification at position −1 in the scissile strand of the partial duplex was 10% relative to that obtained using the unmodified partial duplex as a substrate, as determined by phosphorimager analysis. The partial duplex containing double modifications at position −1 in the scissile strand along with a modification at position −4 or −6 in the noncleaved strand were also substrates for the enzyme, although the enzyme catalyzed the cleavage-ligation reaction to a lesser extent (∼5%) relative to unmodified partial duplex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Modified oligonucleotides were used to investigate the effect on topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage and ligation of incorporating 3′-deoxynucleotides at position −2 of the scissile strand. Interestingly, modification at position −2 did not significantly affect substrate cleavage and ligation by topoisomerase I (Fig.6 A). Only an additional modification at position −1 on the noncleaved strand altered the cleavage site of the enzyme from site 1 to 2 (Fig. 6, A andB, cf. lanes 9). This double modification resulted in exclusive cleavage at site 2 as indicated by a ligated product in presence of the 19-mer acceptor (Fig. 6 B,lane 9), whereas all other modifications on the noncleaved strand afforded no ligated product with the 19-mer acceptor. Interestingly, in this case modification at position −4 or −6 within the noncleaved strand actually enhanced the extent of cleavage and ligation at site 1 (Fig. 6 A, lanes 15 and18). As described previously, modification at position −4 of the scissile strand resulted in decreased ligation of the 17-mer acceptor oligonucleotide by shifting the substrate cleavage site (Fig. 7). Inclusion of 3′-deoxyadenosine at position −4 in the scissile strand in addition to modification at positions −1 or −2 in the noncleaved strand altered cleavage from site 1 to site 2 essentially completely (Fig. 7). Interestingly, when there was a “compensatory” modification at −4 on the noncleaved strand, the product of cleavage and ligation at site 1 was restored, consistent with possible stabilization of the duplex, which could enable effective ligation by topoisomerase I. Modification at −6 on the noncleaved strand disrupted ligation by the enzyme with both the 17- and 19-mer. Although topoisomerase I is clearly cleaving the substrate at site 2 in the presence of the position −6 modification on the noncleaved strand, this modification presumably alters binding of the enzyme, thereby affecting ligation relative to the normal duplex. The substitution at position −6 resulted in cleavage largely at site 1 and concomitant enhancement of ligated product formation (Fig. 8). Interestingly, modifications at positions −1 and −2 on the noncleaved strand that previously altered cleavage by topoisomerase I to site 2 when present as the sole modification (16Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or in combination with the presence of 3′-deoxyadenosine at position −4 on the scissile strand (Fig. 7), afforded cleavage predominantly at site 1 when combined with modification at position −6 on the scissile strand (Fig. 8). Additional modifications on the noncleaved strand at positions −4 or −6 resulted in cleavage virtually exclusively at site 1 (Fig. 8). The substrate having modifications on both strands at position −6 gave enhanced ligation at site 1 relative to the unmodified substrate (Fig.8). In the presence of a 19-mer acceptor, the modification at position −2, combined with modification at position −6 on the scissile strand, exhibited the greatest amount of ligation due to partial cleavage at site 2. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I participates in the control of DNA topology. The enzyme can relax supercoiled DNA by transiently cleaving one strand of the DNA substrate and then passing and religating the cleaved strand via a 3′-linked DNA-enzyme covalent intermediate containing a phosphorotyrosine linkage (15Henningfeld K.A. Arslan T. Hecht S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1701-1714Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Christiansen K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that DNA topoisomerase I can promote the rearrangement of DNA structure; nucleotide insertions and deletions were noted in addition to alteration of the DNA backbone (15Henningfeld K.A. Arslan T. Hecht S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1701-1714Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Henningfeld K.A. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The enzyme trapped using “suicide substrates” can undergo ligation with exogenous DNA acceptors, affording structural transformations of the DNA (25Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Christiansen, K., Westergaard, O., DNA Repair Mechanisms: Proceedings of the 35th Alfred Benzon Symposium, Bohr, V. A., Wassermann, K., Kraemer, K. H., 1993, 361, 371, Munksgaard, Copenhagen, Denmark.Google Scholar). The minimum DNA duplex region required for topoisomerase I-mediated reaction in vitro was determined as an optimized sequence containing nine nucleotides on the scissile strand and five nucleotides on the noncleaved strand (9Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12529-12535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 1 A). This sequence is cleaved with the same specificity by eukaryotic topoisomerase I from various organisms (26Christiansen, K., Westergaard, O., DNA Repair Mechanisms: Proceedings of the 35th Alfred Benzon Symposium, Bohr, V. A., Wassermann, K., Kraemer, K. H., 1993, 361, 371, Munksgaard, Copenhagen, Denmark.Google Scholar) and functions as a high efficiency site for DNA relaxation (27Busk H. Thomsen B. Bonven B.J. Kjeldsen E. Nielsen O.F. Westergaard O. Nature. 1987; 327: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine which nucleotides contribute to the sequence specificity and facility of catalysis by the eukaryotic enzyme, previous studies have utilized DNA containing methylated nucleotides, abasic sites, and uracil substitutions. Abasic sites at positions −2 to −7 on the scissile strand rendered the substrate refractory to cleavage by topoisomerase I. An abasic site at position −1 had little effect on enzyme function (11Stevnsner T. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that an abasic site on the noncleaved strand at positions −1 to −4 suppressed DNA cleavage at the normal site and created new cleavage sites. An abasic site at position −6 on the noncleaved strand increased the extent of cleavage (14Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Neither study involved a substrate having two modifications within the topoisomerase I-binding region, although double modifications could potentially facilitate a better understanding of the role of DNA structure on topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage, relaxation, and ligation. Two abasic sites would be expected to destabilize the DNA duplex dramatically (28Goljer I. Withka J.M. Kao J.Y. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Shida T. Arakawa M. Sekiguchi J. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1994; 13: 1319-1326Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast with the effects of abasic sites on DNA stability, it has been reported that the insertion of two 3′-deoxyadenosines within a 16-nucleotide duplex reduced theT m by only 11–12 °C, depending on the sites of substitution (30Dougherty J.P. Rizzo C.J. Breslow R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6254-6255Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Hashimoto H. Switzer C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6255-6256Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we utilized as substrates a few modified partial duplexes, each of which contained a single 3′-deoxyadenosine within the topoisomerase I-binding region on the scissile strand. Depending on the location of the 3′-deoxyadenosine substitution, the facility of the topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage or ligation reaction was altered (16Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Presently, we have modified the partial duplex systematically to assess the importance of specific nucleotides by incorporating their 3′-deoxynucleotide counterparts. Depending on the site of substitution, this particular modification can significantly modulate the effects of the enzyme by altering cleavage site or facility of cleavage or ligation, presumably reflecting alterations in substrate binding by the enzyme. Initially, 3′-deoxynucleotides were incorporated into the noncleaved strand to observe the effect on cleavage and ligation. These data (Fig.2) indicate that modifications at positions −1 and −2 alter the cleavage site, because ligation was observed in presence of the 19-mer acceptor but not in presence the 17-mer acceptor. The same trend was observed in the absence of any acceptor (Table I). It could be argued that these modifications affect accessibility of the enzyme to cleavage site 1 rather than the affinity of the enzyme for this substrateper se, given the increase in cleavage at site 2. Introduction of 3′-deoxynucleotides into positions −4 and −6 had a lesser effect on cleavage and ligation at site 1; little change in the amount of ligation was noted for the substrate modified at positions −4 or −6. This was true despite the fact that the extent of cleavage for these modified partial duplexes in the absence of acceptor oligonucleotides was only a small fraction of that observed for the unmodified partial duplex. This clearly indicates that the acceptors can facilitate the overall process of cleavage and ligation. It is interesting that the formation of ligation products from the substrates modified at positions −4 and −6 resulted essentially exclusively from cleavage at site 1. Suppression of cleavage at site 2 might be thought to be logical because, for example, position −4 on the noncleaved strand bears the same relationship to site 2 that position −2 does to site 1 (cf. Figs. 2 and 6). Alternatively, 3′-deoxynucleotides were incorporated within the scissile strand. Beginning with a modification at position +1, 3′-deoxynucleotides were also introduced systematically at positions −1, −2, −4, and −6 within the scissile strand (Fig. 3). These modified oligonucleotides were then utilized in coupled cleavage-ligation reactions. Subsequently, the modified scissile strands were combined with modified noncleaved strands to obtain more information about topoisomerase I function. 3′-Deoxynucleotide incorporation at position +1 in the scissile strand significantly altered substrate cleavage from site 1 to site 2, contrary to the enhancement of cleavage demonstrated when uracil and abasic sites were incorporated at these positions (14Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The results were also contrary to experiments in which depurination of +1 caused accumulation of cleaved intermediates (11Stevnsner T. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the 19-mer acceptor, topoisomerase I cleaved the partial duplex predominantly at site 2; the intermediate underwent ligation to form the 30-mer product. Further modifications at positions −1 or −2 had no effect on ligation when the 19-mer acceptor was present, whereas further modification at position −4 or −6 on the noncleaved strand decreased ligation even in the presence of the 19-mer acceptor (Fig.3). The substitution of a 3′-deoxynucleotide at position −1 was of special interest because it permitted investigation of the ability of the enzyme to cleave the DNA backbone at the site of an unnatural linkage. Topoisomerase I did effect cleavage at site 1 in this substrate (Fig.4), although most of the cleavage was redirected to site 2. The intermediate cleavage products formed at sites 1 and 2 both underwent ligation in the presence of the 17- and 19-mer acceptor oligonucleotides, respectively. As noted for the substrates lacking any scissile strand modification (Fig. 2), additional modification of the partial duplexes at positions −1 and −2 on the noncleaved strand suppressed cleavage at site 1; modifications at position −4 and −6 suppressed cleavage at site 2. In contrast, the substrate having 3′-deoxythyimidine at position −2 (scissile strand) exhibited unaltered cleavage and ligation at site 1 (Fig. 6). However, cleavage at site 2 was completely suppressed in analogy with the effects of substitution at position +1 on cleavage at site 1 (cf. Figs. 3 and 6). However, additional modification on the noncleaved strand did alter the cleavage-ligation patterns at sites 1 and 2. The substrate additionally modified at position −1 on the noncleaved strand underwent cleavage and ligation poorly, and only at site 2, whereas additional modification at position −2 on the noncleaved strand also resulted in limited cleavage and ligation but only at site 1. Additional substitutions at positions −4 or −6 on the noncleaved strand afforded substrates whose cleavage and ligation at site 1 was enhanced (Fig. 6, cf. lanes 3, 15, and18). Introduction of 3′-deoxyadenosine at position −4 of the noncleaved strand resulted in cleavage and ligation almost exclusively at site 2 (Fig. 7). This is consistent with the interpretation that the presence of the 3′-deoxynucleotide actually has a facilitating effect on cleavage at the closer cleavage site, fully consistent with the effects noted upon modification at position −2 on the scissile strand (cf. Figs. 6 and 7). Additional modification at site −1 or −2 on the noncleaved strand had minimal further effects on the ratio of cleavage-ligation at site 1 versus site 2. The most dramatic effects occurred in the presence of a modification at position −6 on the scissile strand. Cleavage occurred exclusively at site 1 in the presence of the substrate lacking any modification on the noncleaved strand. The same was also true for partial duplexes having 3′-deoxynucleotides at position −4 or −6. Even in the presence of modifications at positions −1 or −2 on the noncleaved strand, which frequently alter the cleavage from site 1 to site 2, topoisomerase I cleaved the substrate predominantly at site 1. Further, most of the substrates afforded a greater extent of cleavage and ligation than the unmodified partial duplex substrate (Fig. 8). This constitutes strong evidence that alteration of DNA structure at a site distant from the actual cleavage site can have a strong facilitating effect on DNA cleavage and ligation. Of particular interest was an analysis of the effects of introducing complementary 3′-deoxynucleotides at the same site on both strands. Substitutions at positions −1 and −2 on both strands (Figs. 4 and 6, respectively) had the effect of shifting topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage to those sites (2 and 1, respectively) farther from the position of modification. Interestingly, when the modifications were present at sites distant from both cleavage sites, the compensatory modifications enhanced both the facility and specificity of cleavage. This was apparent for modification at positions −4, which restored virtually full cleavage-ligation to site 1 (Fig. 2) and especially for modification at positions −6, which resulted in strong enhancement of cleavage-ligation specifically at site 1 (Fig. 8). Overall, substitution at position −2 on the noncleaved strand generally directs cleavage to site 2 and thereby greater ligation at this site. The exceptions occur where the modification occurs opposite a complementary modification and in the presence of a substrate modified at position −6 on the scissile strand. Interestingly, modification at position −1 on the noncleaved strand alters cleavage to site 2 in almost every case. The single exception involves substrates modified at position −6 on the scissile strand. Because the modification of DNA at a specific site must alter overall DNA structure, the present results do not permit firm conclusions to be drawn about the specific sites of topoisomerase I-DNA interaction. However, the patterns of response to DNA structural alterations argue strongly that specific common enzyme-DNA contacts do control the specificity and efficiency of DNA substrate cleavage and ligation by topoisomerase I. We thank Xiangyang Wang for the sample of calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I used in these experiments."
