https://openalex.org/W2965008727,"Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a typical event in the early stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study aims to elucidate the protection of erianin, a natural compound isolated from Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, against DR development. Erianin alleviated BRB breakdown and rescued the reduced claudin1 and occludin expression in retinas from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Erianin reduced microglial activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-κB transcriptional activation, and the elevated TNF-α expression both in vitro and in vivo. ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 abrogated NF-κB activation in d-glucose-treated BV2 cells. Erianin reduced cellular glucose uptake, and molecular docking analysis indicated the potential interaction of erianin with glucose transporter (GLUT)1. GLUT1 inhibitor (STF31) reduced the activation of the ERK1/2-NF-κB signaling pathway. Coculture with d-glucose-stimulated microglial BV2 cells and with TNF-α stimulation both induced inner BRB and outer BRB damage in human retinal endothelial cells and APRE19 cells, but erianin improved all these damages. In summary, erianin attenuated BRB breakdown during DR development by inhibiting microglia-triggered retinal inflammation via reducing cellular glucose uptake and abrogating the subsequent activation of the downstream ERK1/2-NF-κB pathway. Moreover, erianin also alleviated BRB damage induced by TNF-α released from the activated microglia.-Zhang, T., Ouyang, H., Mei, X., Lu, B., Yu, Z., Chen, K., Wang, Z., Ji, L. Erianin alleviates diabetic retinopathy by reducing retinal inflammation initiated by microglial cells via inhibiting hyperglycemia-mediated ERK1/2-NF-κB signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2966596276,"Background Understanding the burden and contextual risk factors is critical for developing appropriate interventions to control undernutrition. Methods This study used data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey to estimate the prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting. Single multiple logistic regressions were used to identify the factors associated with underweight, wasting and stunting. The study involved 2720 children aged 0–59 months old and mother pairs. All analyses were done in STATA/IC version 15.0. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results The prevalence of underweight, wasting and stunting were 10.4%, 5.3%, and 18.4% respectively. The age of the child was associated with underweight, wasting and stunting, whereas the sex was associated with wasting and stunting. Normal or overweight/obese maternal body mass index category, high woman’s autonomy and middle-class wealth index were associated with a lower odds of undernutrition. The factors that were associated with a higher odds of child undernutrition included: low birth weight (<2.5 kg), minimum dietary diversity score (MDDS), a higher (≥4th) birth order number of child, primary educational level of husband/partner and domicile in the northern region of Ghana. Conclusion There is still a high burden of child undernutrition in Ghana. The age, sex, birth weight, birth order and the MDDS of the child were the immediate factors associated with child undernutrition. The intermediate factors that were associated with child undernutrition were mainly maternal related factors and included maternal nutritional status and autonomy. Distal level factors which were associated with a higher odds of child undernutrition were the wealth index of the household, paternal educational status and region of residence. We recommend that interventions and policies for undernutrition should address socioeconomic inequalities at the community level while factoring in women empowerment programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2965044191,"Apoptosis and autophagy are dynamic processes that determine the fate of cells. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficiency in the intestine leads to abnormal Paneth cells and impaired autophagy function. Here, we will elucidate the mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial VDR regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. We used in vivo VDRlox and VDR∆IEC mice and ex vivo organoids generated from small intestine and colon tissues. We found that VDR deficiency induced more apoptotic cells and significantly increased cell death in the small intestine and colon of VDR∆IEC mice. The proapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) associated X protein (Bax) was enhanced, whereas autophagy related 16 like 1 (ATG16L1) and Beclin-1 were decreased in the intestines of VDRΔIEC mice. Apoptosis induced by Bax reduced autophagy by decreasing Beclin-1. Physical interactions between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 were increased in the VDR-deficient epithelia from mice. The growth of VDR∆IEC organoids was significantly slower with fewer Paneth cells than that of VDR+/+ organoids. The expression levels of Beclin-1 and lysozyme were decreased in VDR∆IEC organoids. Bacterial endotoxin levels were high in the serum from VDR∆IEC mice and made mice susceptible to colitis. In the organoids and colitis IL-10-/- mice, vitamin D3 treatment increased VDR and ATG16L1 protein expression levels, which activated autophagic responses. In summary, intestinal epithelial VDR regulates autophagy and apoptosis through ATG16L1 and Beclin-1. Our studies provide fundamental insights into the tissue-specific function of VDR in modulating the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.-Lu, R., Zhang, Y.-G., Xia, Y., Sun, J.

https://openalex.org/W2943644807,"The availability of digital payment technologies (such as internet banking, mobile money, and credit/debit cards) has rapidly increased in the developing world, and is a cornerstone for financial inclusion initiatives in developing countries. Despite significant efforts to promote digital payments, rates of adoption remain modest in some low-income countries. In particular, the rate of adoption in India remains low despite significant efforts to promote adoption. In this paper, we consider possible reasons for the low rates of adoption among merchants in Jaipur, India with small fixed-location store enterprises. Using survey data for 1,003 merchants, we find little evidence that supply-side barriers to obtaining necessary infrastructure or meeting prerequisite requirements to adopt digital payments explain the low level of adoption. Merchants are able to obtain infrastructure to transact digitally (such as bank accounts and smart phones), fees on digital platforms are affordable, and merchants are sufficiently literate to be able to use digital payment systems. We conclude that adoption is both feasible and inexpensive. Therefore, low rates of adoption do not appear to be the result of supply-side barriers, but due rather to demand-side factors or taxes. We find direct evidence of such demand-side factors, such as a perceived lack of customers wanting to pay digitally, and concerns that records of mobile payments might increase tax liability. Our results thus suggest that simply lowering the costs associated with adopting these technologies is unlikely to be successful in increasing adoption of digital payments."
https://openalex.org/W2964598535,"A hallmark of G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is the conversion of external stimuli into specific cellular responses. In this tightly-regulated process, extracellular ligand binding by GPCRs promotes specific conformational changes within the seven transmembrane helices, leading to the coupling and activation of intracellular “transducer” proteins, such as heterotrimeric G proteins. Much of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern GPCR activation is derived from experiments with purified receptors reconstituted in detergent micelles. To elucidate the influence of the phospholipid bilayer on GPCR activation, here we interrogated the functional, pharmacological, and biophysical properties of a GPCR, the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Compared with detergent-reconstituted β2AR, the β2AR in HDL particles had greatly enhanced levels of basal (constitutive) activity and displayed increased sensitivity to agonist activation, as assessed by activation of heterotrimeric G protein and allosteric coupling between the ligand-binding and transducer-binding pockets. Using 19F NMR spectroscopy, we directly linked these functional differences in detergent- and HDL-reconstituted β2AR to a change in the equilibrium between inactive and active receptor states. The contrast between the low levels of β2AR constitutive activity in cells and the high constitutive activity observed in an isolated phospholipid bilayer indicates that β2AR basal activity depends on the reconstitution system and further suggests that various cellular mechanisms suppress β2AR basal activity physiologically. Our findings provide critical additional insights into GPCR activation and reveal how dramatically reconstitution systems can impact membrane protein function.

https://openalex.org/W2965269178,"The objective of this study was to develop a new calibration method that enables calibration of Hounsfield units (HU) to bone mineral densities (BMD) without the use of a calibration phantom for fracture risk prediction of femurs with metastases using CT-based finite element (FE) models. Fifty-seven advanced cancer patients (67 femurs with bone metastases) were CT scanned atop a separate calibration phantom using a standardized protocol. Non-linear isotropic FE models were constructed based on the phantom calibration and on two phantomless calibration methods: the “air-fat-muscle” and “non-patient-specific” calibration. For air-fat-muscle calibration, peaks for air, fat and muscle tissue were extracted from a histogram of the HU in a standardized region of interest including the patient’s right leg and surrounding air. These CT peaks were linearly fitted to reference “BMD” values of the corresponding tissues to obtain a calibration function. For non-patient-specific calibration, an average phantom calibration function was used for all patients. FE failure loads were compared between phantom and phantomless calibrations. There were no differences in failure loads between phantom and air-fat-muscle calibration (p = 0.8), whereas there was a significant difference between phantom and non-patient-specific calibration (p<0.001). Although this study was not designed to investigate this, in four patients who were scanned using an aberrant reconstruction kernel, the effect of the different kernel seemed to be smaller for the air-fat-muscle calibration compared to the non-patient-specific calibration. With the air-fat-muscle calibration, clinical implementation of the FE model as tool for fracture risk assessment will be easier from a practical and financial viewpoint, since FE models can be made using everyday clinical CT scans without the need of concurrent scanning of calibration phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W2964555311,"Previous research revealed the feline skin bacterial microbiota to be site-specific and the fungal microbiota to be individual-specific. The effect of other factors, such as genotype and environment, have not yet been studied in cats, but have been shown to be potentially important in shaping the cutaneous microbiota of other animals. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of these factors on the bacterial and fungal microbiota of feline skin and oral cavity. The influence of genotype was assessed through the analysis of different cat breeds, and the influence of environment through comparison of indoor and outdoor cats. DNA was extracted from skin and oral swabs, and bacterial and fungal next-generation sequencing were performed. Analysis of the skin microbiota of different cat breeds revealed significant differences in alpha diversity, with Sphynx and Bengal cats having the most diverse communities. Many taxa were found to be differentially abundant between cat breeds, including Veillonellaceae and Malassezia spp. Outdoor environment exposure had considerable influence on beta diversity, especially in the oral cavity, and resulted in numerous differentially abundant taxa. Our findings indicate that the oral bacterial microbiota and both fungal and bacterial microbiota of feline skin are influenced by breed, and to a lesser degree, environment."
https://openalex.org/W2964849191,"This study examined the relationships between the attitudes and the management behaviour of the farmer and the on-farm welfare of their ewes. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating these relationships in extensive sheep farming systems. Thirty-two sheep farmers and 6200 ewes were sampled across Victoria, Australia. Questionnaire interviews and on-farm animal welfare assessments were conducted. The ewes were assessed at two-time points, mid-pregnancy and weaning. To examine relationships between farmer and ewe variables, categorical principal component analyses, correlations and logistic regressions were used. The main findings of this study indicate relationships between farmer attitudes and management behaviour, consistent with findings from other more intensive livestock industries. Farmers were more likely to check the body condition of their ewes (Odds ratio = 2.37, P = 0.03), perform ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis (Odds ratio = 1.16, P = 0.02) and test for egg count before deworming sheep (Odds ratio = 2.88, P = 0.01) if they perceived these activities were important/valuable. In addition, farmers that performed these activities had a more active management style, and ewes in better welfare: fewer lame ewes at mid-pregnancy (r = -0.38 P = 0.04), and fewer ewes in need of further care at mid-pregnancy and weaning respectively (r = -0.47, P = 0.01; r = -0.50, P = 0.01). When combining the qualitative and quantitative analyses, behavioural attitudes (attitudes towards specific management behaviours) and perceived behavioural control (perceived barriers to performing the behaviour) emerged as the two main drivers underpinning farmer management behaviour. The results of this study indicate that the way farmers manage their ewes influences welfare outcomes, and management decisions are influenced by attitudes towards management practices. These findings demonstrate the opportunity to create change in farmer management behaviour and improve sheep welfare via targeted education programs."
https://openalex.org/W2965280479,"The potential role of whole genome duplication (WGD) in evolution is controversial. Whereas some view WGD mainly as detrimental and an evolutionary ‘dead end’, there is growing evidence that the long-term establishment of polyploidy might be linked to environmental change, stressful conditions, or periods of extinction. However, despite much research, the mechanistic underpinnings of why and how polyploids might be able to outcompete non-polyploids at times of environmental upheaval remain indefinable. Here, we improved our recently developed bio-inspired framework, combining an artificial genome with an agent-based system, to form a population of so-called Digital Organisms (DOs), to examine the impact of WGD on evolution under different environmental scenarios mimicking extinction events of varying strength and frequency. We found that, under stable environments, DOs with non-duplicated genomes formed the majority, if not all, of the population, whereas the numbers of DOs with duplicated genomes increased under dramatically challenging environments. After tracking the evolutionary trajectories of individual genomes in terms of sequence and encoded gene regulatory networks (GRNs), we propose that duplicated GRNs might provide polyploids with better chances to acquire the drastic changes necessary to adapt to challenging conditions, thus endowing DOs with increased adaptive potential under extinction events. In contrast, under stable environments, random mutations might easily render the GRN less well adapted to such environments, a phenomenon that is exacerbated in duplicated, more complex GRNs. We believe that our results provide some additional insights into how genome duplication and polyploidy might help organisms to compete for novel niches and survive ecological turmoil, and confirm the usefulness of our computational simulation in studying the role of WGD in evolution and adaptation, helping to overcome some of the traditional limitations of evolution experiments with model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2966756304,"Human immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most prevalent antibody class at mucosal sites with an important role in mucosal defense. Little is known about the impact of N-glycan modifications of IgA1 and IgA2 on binding to the Fcα receptor (FcαRI), which is also heavily glycosylated at its extracellular domain. Here, we transiently expressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-binding monomeric IgA1, IgA2m(1), and IgA2m(2) variants in Nicotiana benthamiana ΔXT/FT plants lacking the enzymes responsible for generating nonhuman N-glycan structures. By coinfiltrating IgA with the respective glycan-modifying enzymes, we generated IgA carrying distinct homogenous N-glycans. We demonstrate that distinctly different N-glycan profiles did not influence antigen binding or the overall structure and integrity of the IgA antibodies but did affect their thermal stability. Using size-exclusion chromatography, differential scanning and isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and molecular modeling, we probed distinct IgA1 and IgA2 glycoforms for binding to four different FcαRI glycoforms and investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of complex formation. Our results suggest that different N-glycans on the receptor significantly contribute to binding affinities for its cognate ligand. We also noted that full-length IgA and FcαRI form a mixture of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes tending toward a 1:1 stoichiometry due to different IgA tailpiece conformations that make it less likely that both binding sites are simultaneously occupied. In conclusion, N-glycans of human IgA do not affect its structure and integrity but its thermal stability, and FcαRI N-glycans significantly modulate binding affinity to IgA."
https://openalex.org/W2965073936,"Mutations in human prominin 1 (PROM1), encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein localized mainly to plasma membrane protrusions, have been reported to cause retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and cone–rod dystrophy. Although the structural role of PROM1 in outer-segment (OS) morphogenesis has been demonstrated in Prom1-knockout mouse, the mechanisms underlying these complex disease phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we utilized a zebrafish model to further investigate PROM1’s role in the retina. The Prom1 orthologs in zebrafish include prom1a and prom1b, and our results showed that prom1b, rather than prom1a, plays an important role in zebrafish photoreceptors. Loss of prom1b disrupted OS morphogenesis, with rods and cones exhibiting differences in impairment: cones degenerated at an early age, whereas rods remained viable but with an abnormal OS, even at 9 months postfertilization. Immunofluorescence experiments with WT zebrafish revealed that Prph2, an ortholog of the human transmembrane protein peripherin 2 and also associated with OS formation, is localized to the edge of OS and is more highly expressed in the cone OS than in the rod OS. Moreover, we found that Prom1b deletion causes mislocalization of Prph2 and disrupts its oligomerization. We conclude that the variation in Prph2 levels between cones and rods was one of the reasons for the different PROM1 mutation–induced phenotypes of these retinal structures. These findings expand our understanding of the phenotypes caused by PROM1 mutations and provide critical insights into its function.

This survey aimed to provide clarity by quantifying the prevalence of SV (forced sex or sexual acts) by 1) sexual partners, and 2) non-partners, and to describe factors associated with these outcomes among women (18-49 years) living in Rustenburg Municipality.We conducted a cluster-randomized household survey (November-December 2015). Women were asked about their experiences of SV, associated attitudes and behaviours, and access to services. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with partner and non-partner SV.Of eligible households, 83·1% (1700/2044) participated. Of 966 women invited, 836 participated (86·5%). Average age of participants was 31.6 years (95%CI: 30·9, 32·4) with 45% having completed at least secondary school, and 60% unemployed or looking for work. Lifetime prevalence of SV was 24.9% (95%CI: 21·7-28·5), reaching 9.0% (95% CI: 6·6-12·1) by age 15. Almost one third told no one of their SV experiences. Factors related to financial dependence were associated with SV by a partner. History of termination of pregnancy increased the likelihood of SV by a non-partner as an adult. Women who experienced SV in childhood or as an adult were more likely to experience SV from a different type of perpetrator than those who did not.We found a high prevalence of SV, including during childhood, in this setting, with limited access to care. This and the high morbidity attributed to SV calls for increased service provision."
https://openalex.org/W2966444666,"Src homology domain 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) participates in multiple cell functions including cell shape, movement, and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of SHP2 in eosinophil recruitment into lungs in allergic airway inflammation and explored the underlying mechanism. Both SHP2 and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) kinase were robustly activated in the airway eosinophils of children with allergic asthma and of a mouse model with allergic airway inflammation. Moreover, inhibition of SHP2 activity by its specific inhibitors reverses the dephosphorylation of p190-A Rho GTPase-activating protein and in turn attenuates RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling, resulting in the attenuation of eosinophil migration in response to platelet-activating factor stimulation. Specifically, SHP2 deletion in myeloid cells did not affect the number and classification of circulating leukocytes but significantly attenuated the allergen-induced inflammatory cell, especially eosinophil, infiltration into lungs, and airway hyperreactivity. Notably, genetic interaction between RhoA and SHP2 indicated that RhoA inactivation and SHP2 deletion synergistically attenuated the allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into lungs and airway hyperreactivity, whereas overexpression of active RhoA robustly restored the SHP2 deletion-resultant attenuation of allergen-induced eosinophil recruitment into lungs and airway hyperreactivity as well. Thus, this study demonstrates that SHP2 via RhoA/ROCK signaling regulates eosinophil recruitment in allergic airway inflammation and possibly in allergic asthma.-Xu, C., Wu, X., Lu, M., Tang, L., Yao, H., Wang, J., Ji, X., Hussain, M., Wu, J., Wu, X.

The analysis of USV can be used as a reliable measure of the general affective state, for testing the efficacy of pharmacological compounds and for investigating communication in mutant mice with predicted social or communication deficits. Social and communication studies in mice have focused mainly on the investigation of USV emitted by neonatal pups after separation from the dam and during social interaction between adult males and females. Longitudinal USV analysis among the different developmental states remained uninvestigated. In our study, we first recorded USV from three inbred mouse strains C57BL/6N, DBA/2 and FVB/N during the neonatal stages after separation from the littermates and then during a reunion with one littermate. Our results revealed significant strain-specific differences in the numbers and categories of USV calls. In addition, the USV profiles seemed to be sensitive to small developmental progress during infancy. By following these mice to the adolescent stage and measuring USV in the three-chamber social test, we found that USV profiles still showed significant differences between these strains in the different trials of the test. To study the effects of social context on USV characteristics, we measured USV emitted by another cohort of adolescent mice during the direct social interaction test. To this end, this study provides a strategy for evaluating novel mouse mutants in behavioral questions relevant to disorders with deficits in communication and sociability and emphasizes the important contribution of genetics and experimental contexts on the behavioral outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2964571058,"Crops are variously susceptible to biotic stresses–something expected to increase under climate change. In the case of staple crops, this potentially undermines household and national food security. We examine recent wheat rust epidemics and smallholders’ coping mechanisms in Ethiopia as a case study. Wheat is a major food crop in Ethiopia widely grown by smallholders. In 2010/11 a yellow rust epidemic affected over one-third of the national wheat area. Two waves of nationally representative household level panel data collected for the preceding wheat season (2009/10) and three years after (2013/14) the occurrence of the epidemic allow us to analyze the different coping mechanisms farmers used in response. Apart from using fungicides as ex-post coping mechanism, increasing wheat area under yellow rust resistant varieties, increasing diversity of wheat varieties grown, or a combination of these strategies were the main ex-ante coping mechanisms farmers had taken in reducing the potential effects of rust re-occurrence. Large-scale dis-adoption of highly susceptible varieties and replacement with new, rust resistant varieties was observed subsequent to the 2010/11 epidemic. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify the key factors associated with smallholder ex-ante coping strategies. Household characteristics, level of specialization in wheat and access to improved wheat seed were the major factors that explained observed choices. There was 29–41% yield advantage in increasing wheat area to the new, resistant varieties even under normal seasons with minimum rust occurrence in the field. Continuous varietal development in responding to emerging new rust races and supporting the deployment of newly released resistant varieties could help smallholders in dealing with rust challenges and maintaining improved yields in the rust-prone environments of Ethiopia. Given the global importance of both wheat and yellow rust and climate change dynamics study findings have relevance to other regions."
https://openalex.org/W2965817249,"Cervicitis is one of the major health problems amongst women caused by infection of various pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) as well as human papillomavirus (HPV), and persistent cervical inflammation is one of the etiologic agents of cervical cancer. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition and subsequent elimination of these pathogens. Variations in the Toll-like receptor genes influence susceptibility to pathogens as well as disease progression independently.Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms, five each of TLR4 and TLR9 genes were analyzed among 130 cervicitis patients and 150 controls either using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele specific-PCR.T. vaginalis infection was found at the highest frequency (30.7%) as compared to C. trachomatis (1.5%), N. gonorrhoeae (2.3%) and HPV (4.6%) infections in cervicitis patients. TLR4 rs11536889 CC (age-adjusted OR, 2.469 [95% CI, 1.499 to 4.065]; p < 0.001) and TLR9 rs187084 TC (age-adjusted OR, 2.165 [95% CI, 1.267-3.699]; p = 0.005) genotypes showed the higher distribution in cervicitis patients compared to controls.

The core area in which we find all sleeping trees and the trees from which the gibbons duet and the wider home range (HR) which has varying levels of overlap with neighbouring gibbon groups. The core area is strenously defended, with the wider HR being more of a shared area for neighbouring groups. We present ranging and movement data on four wild gibbon groups from January 2010 to July 2018. Global Positioning System (GPS) data were collected every 5 mins on habitauted groups in Sebangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia resulting in 35,521 waypoints. Gibbon home- and corerange sizes were calculated using 95%, and 50%, volume contours of kernel density estimates. Home-ranges ranged from 58.74-147.75 ha with a mean of 95.7 ± SD 37.75 ha, the highest of comparable Hylobates species. Core-range size ranged from 20.7-51.31 ha with a mean size of 31.7 ± SD 13.76 ha. Gibbons had consistant site fidelity for their home- and core ranges; percentage overlap ranged from 4.3 23.97% with a mean 16.5 ± SD 8.65% overlap in home-range area. Core ranges did not overlap with the exception of two groups, in which a 0.64 ha (2.69%) overlap occurred. Unsurprisingly forest loss from fire does affect the location of the HR of the impacted group, but does not appear to affect adjacent groups, though more data are needed on this. Understanding the complex use of space of these territorial animals is important in assessing both carrying capacity for wild populations and understading how reintroduced gibbon pairs will establish their core and HR."
https://openalex.org/W2966792163,"Many bacterial species contain dynamin-like proteins (DLPs). However, so far the functional mechanisms of bacterial DLPs are poorly understood. DynA in Bacillus subtilis is a 2-headed DLP, mediating nucleotide-independent membrane tethering in vitro and contributing to the innate immunity of bacteria against membrane stress and phage infection. Here, we employed content mixing and lipid mixing assays in reconstituted systems to study if DynA induces membrane full fusion, characterize its subunits in membrane fusion, and further test the possibility that GTP hydrolysis of DynA may act on the fusion-through-hemifusion pathway. Our results based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicated that DynA could induce aqueous content mixing even in the absence of GTP. Moreover, DynA-induced membrane fusion in vitro is a thermo-promoted slow process, and it has phospholipid and membrane curvature preferences. The D1 part of DynA is crucial for membrane binding and fusion, whereas D2 subunit plays a role in facilitating membrane fusion. Surprisingly, digestion of DynA mediated an instant rise of content exchange, supporting the assumption that disassembly of DynA is a driving force for fusion-through-hemifusion. DynA is a rare example of a membrane fusion catalyst that lacks a transmembrane domain and hence sets this system apart from well-characterized fusion systems such as the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes.-Guo, L., Bramkamp, M. Bacterial dynamin-like protein DynA mediates lipid and content mixing."

The primary mechanism by which N. gonorrhoeae becomes resistant to ESCs is by acquiring a mosaic penA allele, encoding penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) variants containing up to 62 mutations compared with WT, of which a subset contribute to resistance. To interpret molecular mechanisms underpinning cephalosporin resistance, it is necessary to know how PBP2 is acylated by ESCs. Here, we report the crystal structures of the transpeptidase domain of WT PBP2 in complex with cefixime and ceftriaxone, along with structures of PBP2 in the apo form and with a phosphate ion bound in the active site at resolutions of 1–7-1.9 Å. These structures reveal that acylation of PBP2 by ESCs is accompanied by rotation of the Thr-498 side chain in the KTG motif to contact the cephalosporin carboxylate, twisting of the β3 strand to form the oxyanion hole, and rolling of the β3–β4 loop toward the active site. Recognition of the cephalosporin carboxylate appears to be the key trigger for formation of an acylation-competent state of PBP2. The structures also begin to explain the impact of mutations implicated in ESC resistance. In particular, a G545S mutation may hinder twisting of β3 because its side chain hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with Thr-498. Overall, our data suggest that acylation is initiated by conformational changes elicited or trapped by binding of ESCs and that these movements are restricted by mutations associated with resistance against ESCs.

https://openalex.org/W2966528741,"To induce osteogenicity in bone graft substitutes, plasmid-based expression of BMP-2 (pBMP-2) has been successfully applied in gene activated matrices based on alginate polymer constructs. Here, we investigated whether cell seeding is necessary for non-viral BMP-2 gene expression in vivo. Furthermore, to gain insight in the role of BMP-producing cells, we compared inclusion of bone progenitor cells with non-osteogenic target cells in gene delivery constructs. Plasmid DNA encoding GFP (pGFP) was used to trace transfection of host tissue cells and seeded cells in a rat model. Transgene expression was followed in both cell-free alginate-ceramic constructs as well as constructs seeded with syngeneic fibroblasts or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Titration of pGFP revealed that the highest pGFP dose resulted in frequent presence of positive host cells in the constructs. Both cell-loaded groups were associated with transgene expression, most effectively in the MSC-loaded constructs. Subsequently, we investigated effectiveness of cell-free and cell-loaded alginate-ceramic constructs with pBMP-2 to induce bone formation. Local BMP-2 production was found in all groups containing BMP-2 plasmid DNA, and was most pronounced in the groups with MSCs transfected with high concentration pBMP-2. Bone formation was only apparent in the recombinant protein BMP-2 group. In conclusion, we show that non-viral gene delivery of BMP-2 is a potentially effective way to induce transgene expression in vivo, both in cell-seeded as well as cell-free conditions. However, alginate-based gene delivery of BMP-2 to host cells or seeded cells did not result in protein levels adequate for bone formation in this setting, calling for more reliable scaffold compatible transfection methods."
https://openalex.org/W2966587840,"We recently reported that membrane potential (ΔΨ) primarily determines the relationship of complex II-supported respiration by isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria to ADP concentrations. We observed that O2 flux peaked at low ADP concentration ([ADP]) (high ΔΨ) before declining at higher [ADP] (low ΔΨ). The decline resulted from oxaloacetate (OAA) accumulation and inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase. This prompted us to question the effect of incremental [ADP] on respiration in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) mitochondria, wherein ΔΨ is intrinsically low because of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). We found that succinate-energized IBAT mitochondria, even in the absence of ADP, accumulate OAA and manifest limited respiration, similar to muscle mitochondria at high [ADP]. This could be prevented by guanosine 5'-diphosphate inhibition of UCP1. NAD+ cycling with NADH requires complex I electron flow and is needed to form OAA. Therefore, to assess the role of electron transit, we perturbed flow using a small molecule, N1-(3-acetamidophenyl)-N2-(2-(4-methyl-2-(p-tolyl)thiazol-5-yl)ethyl)oxalamide. We observed decreased OAA, increased NADH/NAD+, and increased succinate-supported mitochondrial respiration under conditions of low ΔΨ (IBAT) but not high ΔΨ (heart). In summary, complex II-energized respiration in IBAT mitochondria is tempered by complex I-derived OAA in a manner dependent on UCP1. These dynamics depend on electron transit in complex I.-Fink, B.

Little data exists on the associations between combined exposures to As and PAH with immunotoxicity in humans. In this work we examined associations between As and PAH exposures with lymphoid cell populations in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as alterations in differentiation and activation of B and T cells. Two hundred men, participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh, were selected for the present study based on their exposure to As from drinking water and their cigarette smoking status. Blood and urine samples were collected from study participants. We utilized multiparameter flow cytometry in PBMC to identify immune cells (B, T, monocytes, NK) as well as the T-helper (Th) cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tregs) following ex vivo activation. We did not find evidence of interactions between As and PAH exposures. However, individual exposures (As or PAH) were associated with changes to immune cell populations, including Th cell subsets. Arsenic exposure was associated with an increase in the percentage of Th cells, and dose dependent changes in monocytes, NKT cells and a monocyte subset. Within the Th cell subset we found that Arsenic exposure was also associated with a significant increase in the percentage of circulating proinflammatory Th17 cells. PAH exposure was associated with changes in T cells, monocytes and T memory (Tmem) cells and with changes in Th, Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets all of which were non-monotonic (dose dependent). Alterations of immune cell populations caused by environmental exposures to As and PAH may result in adverse health outcomes, such as changes in systemic inflammation, immune suppression, or autoimmunity."

Cell surface LPP3 can terminate the signaling actions of bioactive lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1 phosphate, which likely explains its role in developmental angiogenesis, vascular injury responses, and cell migration. Heritable variants in the final intron PLPP3 associate with interindividual variability in coronary artery disease risk that may result from disruption of enhancer sequences that normally act in cis to increase expression of the gene. However, the mechanisms regulating PLPP3 expression are not well understood. We show that the human PLPP3 promoter contains three functional NF-κB response elements. All of these are required for maximal induction of PLPP3 promoter activity in reporter assays. The identified sequences recruit RelA and RelB components of the NF-κB transcription complex to chromatin, and these transcription factors bind to the identified target sequences in two different cell types. LPA promotes binding of Rel family transcription factors to the PLPP3 promoter and increases PLPP3 gene expression through mechanisms that are attenuated by an NF-κB inhibitor, LPA receptor antagonists, and inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 kinase. These findings indicate that up-regulation of PLPP3 during inflammation and atherosclerosis results from canonical activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade to increase PLPP3 expression through nuclear import and binding of RelA and RelB transcription factors to the PLPP3 promoter and suggest a mechanism by which the LPP3 substrate, LPA, can regulate PLPP3 expression.

The sole yeast Atg8 gene has six mAtg8 (mammalian Atg8) homologs, including the MAP1LC3 (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3) family and the GABA receptor–associated proteins. Selective autophagy receptors interact with two conserved hydrophobic pockets (termed the W-site and L-site) of mATG8 proteins through a linear motif called the LC3-interacting region (LIR) with the general composition (W/F/Y)XX(I/L/V). To address a lack in our knowledge regarding LIR peptide specificity toward each mATG8 homolog, here we used competitive time-resolved FRET to sensitively and quantitatively characterize the interactions between LIRs and mAtg8. We report that 14 representative LIR-containing peptides display differential binding affinities toward the mAtg8 proteins and identified the LIR domain peptide of TP53INP1 as exhibiting high affinity for all six mATG8 proteins. Using peptide truncation studies, we found that both N- and C-terminal acidic residues, as well as the C-terminal Cys residue of the TP53INP1 LIR peptide, are required for its high-affinity binding to LC3A and LC3B, whereas binding to the GABARAP subfamily proteins was facilitated by residues either N-terminal or C-terminal to the core motif. Finally, we used NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis to gain molecular insights into these findings. Collectively, our results may aid in the development of molecules that selectively disrupt specific mATG8–LIR interactions to dissect the biological roles of the six mATG8 homologs for potential therapeutic applications.

https://openalex.org/W2966033854,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are frequently driven by auto-activated, mutant KIT and have durable response to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, acquired resistance is an increasing clinical issue in GIST patients receiving front-line imatinib therapy. Our previous studies showed the colocalization of KIT with DAPI-stained nuclei in GIST cells without knowing the role of nuclear KIT in GIST tumorigenesis. In this article, we first identified the binding of nuclear KIT to the promoter of NFKB inhibitor beta (NFKBIB) by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP assays, which was accompanied with enhanced NFKBIB protein expression in GIST cells. Clinically, high NCCN risk GISTs had significantly higher mean expression levels of nuclear phospho-KIT and NFKBIB as compared with those of intermediate or low/very low-risk GISTs. Conversely, downregulation of NFKBIB by siRNA led to RELA nuclear translocation that could bind to the KIT promoter region and subsequently reduced KIT transcription/expression and the viability of GIST cells. These findings were further confirmed by either RELA overexpression or NFKB/RELA inducer, valproic acid, treatment to result in reduced KIT expression and relative cell viability of imatinib-resistant GIST cells. Combining valproic acid with imatinib showed significantly better growth inhibitory effects on imatinib-resistant GIST48 and GIST430 cells in vitro, and in the GIST430 animal xenograft model. Taken together, these results demonstrate the existence of a nuclear KIT-driven NFKBIB-RELA-KIT autoregulatory loop in GIST tumorigenesis, which are potential targets for developing combination therapy to overcome imatinib-resistant of KIT-expressing GISTs."
https://openalex.org/W2966169626,"Natural antibodies are an innate-like subset of serum antibodies involved in host defense, tumor surveillance, homeostasis, and autoimmunity. Defining the natural antibody repertoire is critical for identifying biomarkers, developing vaccines, controlling and preventing autoimmunity, and understanding the development and organization of the immune system. While natural antibodies to protein antigens have been studied in depth, little is known about natural antibodies to carbohydrate antigens. To address this, we profiled IgM from umbilical cord blood and matched maternal sera on a glycan microarray. Since standard methods to detect maternal contamination in cord serum did not have sufficient sensitivity for our study, we developed a highly sensitive microarray-based assay. Using this method, we found that over 50% of the cord samples had unacceptable levels of maternal contamination. For the cord samples with high purity, anti-glycan IgM antibodies were prevalent and recognized a broad range of non-human and human glycans. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, cord IgM repertoires showed a high degree of similarity with each other but were distinct from maternal IgM repertoires. Our results demonstrate that many anti-glycan antibodies in human serum are natural antibodies and provide new insights into the development of anti-glycan antibody repertoires."
https://openalex.org/W2964657684,"Infrastructure systems are the structural backbone of cities, facilitating the flow of essential services. Because those systems can be disrupted by natural hazards, risk management has been the prevailing approach for assessing the consequences and expected level of damage. Although this may be a valuable metric, the practice of risk assessment does not represent how hazards affect a network of assets on a larger scale. In contrast, network topology metrics are useful because they evaluate the performance of network infrastructures by looking at the system as a whole. As described here, we began this study to improve our understanding of how flooding events affect the topological properties of road networks, in this case, the urban road infrastructure of Zurich, Switzerland. Using maps of flooding risk, we developed a procedure to extract the damaged networks and analyze the centrality metrics for peak water levels on the surface of the city. Our approach modelled roads as edges and junctions between roads as nodes. The betweenness centrality metric characterizes the importance of nodes or edges for any type of exchange within a network, whereas the closeness centrality metric measures the accessibility of a specific node to all the other nodes. This investigation produced three main findings. First, descriptive analyses showed that the characteristics and patterns of nodes and edges changed under the flooding events. Second, the distribution function of centrality metrics became heavier in the tails as the flood magnitude increased. Third, the associated strain shifted critical nodes to areas in which those nodes would not be important under normal conditions. These findings are essential for identifying crucial locations and devising plans to address risks. Future projects could expand our approach by including traffic flow to move the analysis closer to real-world flows, and by studying the accessibility under emergency conditions at local levels."

This paper describes models of fluid flow and transport of soluble material within a packed granular bed in the context of coffee extraction. Coffee extraction is described by diffusion of soluble material from particles of one or more representative sizes into fluid flowing through the packed bed. One-dimensional flow models are compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. A fine and a coarse coffee grind are considered. Model results are compared to experimental data for a packed cylindrical coffee bed and the influence of a change in geometry to a truncated cone is considered. Non-uniform flow in the truncated cone causes significant variation in the local extraction level. Coffee extraction levels during brewing are analysed using extraction maps and the degree of variation is represented on the industry standard coffee brewing control chart. A high variation in extraction yield can be expected to impart bitter flavours into the brew and thus is an important variable to quantify."

Our previous study identified SOX2 as a marker in cervical cancer stem cells driven by a full promoter element of SOX2 EGFP reporter. Here, dual-luciferase reporter and mutagenesis analyses were employed, identifying key cis-elements in the SOX2 promoter, including binding sites for SOX2, OCT4 and NF-YA factors in SOX2 promoter. Mutagenesis analysis provided additional evidence to show that one high affinity-binding domain CCAAT box was precisely recognized and bound by the transcription factor NF-YA. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-YA in primitive cervical cancer cells SiHa and C33A significantly activated the transcription and the protein expression of SOX2. Collectively, our data identified NF-YA box CCAAT as a key cis-element in the SOX2 promoter, suggesting that NF-YA is a potent cellular regulator in the maintenance of SOX2-positive cervical cancer stem cell by specific transcriptional activation of SOX2."
https://openalex.org/W2965206461,"Like eukaryotic and archaeal viruses, which coopt the host's cellular pathways for their replication, bacteriophages have evolved strategies to alter the metabolism of their bacterial host. SPO1 bacteriophage infection of Bacillus subtilis results in comprehensive remodeling of cellular processes, leading to conversion of the bacterial cell into a factory for phage progeny production. A cluster of 26 genes in the SPO1 genome, called the host takeover module, encodes for potentially cytotoxic proteins that specifically shut down various processes in the bacterial host, including transcription, DNA synthesis, and cell division. However, the properties and bacterial targets of many genes of the SPO1 host takeover module remain elusive. Through a systematic analysis of gene products encoded by the SPO1 host takeover module, here we identified eight gene products that attenuated B. subtilis growth. Of the eight phage gene products that attenuated bacterial growth, a 25-kDa protein called Gp53 was shown to interact with the AAA+ chaperone protein ClpC of the ClpCP protease of B. subtilis Our results further reveal that Gp53 is a phage-encoded adaptor-like protein that modulates the activity of the ClpCP protease to enable efficient SPO1 phage progeny development. In summary, our findings indicate that the bacterial ClpCP protease is the target of xenogeneic (dys)regulation by a SPO1 phage-derived factor and add Gp53 to the list of antibacterial products that target bacterial protein degradation and therefore may have utility for the development of novel antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2966159237,"Here we explore the carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the co-existing carbonate and phosphate fractions of fish tooth enameloid as a tool to reconstruct past aquatic fish environments and harvesting grounds. The enameloid oxygen isotope compositions of the phosphate fraction (δ18OPO4) vary by as much as ~4‰ for migratory marine fish such as gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), predominantly reflecting the different saline habitats it occupies during its life cycle. The offset in enameloid Δ18OCO3-PO4 values of modern marine Sparidae and freshwater Cyprinidae from the Southeast Mediterranean region vary between 8.1 and 11.0‰, similar to values reported for modern sharks. The mean δ13C of modern adult S. aurata and Cyprinus carpio teeth of 0.1±0.4‰ and -6.1±0.7‰, respectively, mainly reflect the difference in δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the ambient water and dietary carbon sources. The enameloid Δ18OCO3-PO4 and δ13C values of ancient S. aurata (Holocene) and fossil Luciobarbus sp. (Cyprinidae; mid Pleistocene) teeth agree well with those of modern specimens, implying little diagenetic alteration of these tooth samples. Paired δ18OPO4-δ13C data from ancient S. aurata teeth indicate that hypersaline water bodies formed in the Levant region during the Late Holocene from typical Mediterranean coastal water with high evaporation rates and limited carbon input from terrestrial sources. Sparid tooth stable isotopes further suggest that coastal lagoons in the Eastern Mediterranean had already formed by the Early Holocene and were influenced by terrestrial carbon sources. Overall, combined enameloid oxygen and carbon isotope analysis of fish teeth is a powerful tool to infer the hydrologic evolution of aquatic environments and assess past fishing grounds of human populations in antiquity."
https://openalex.org/W2964490902,"Many details of the pathophysiology of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) still remain unknown, making animal experiments an indispensable tool for assessment of diagnostics and therapy. For animal protection and project authorization, one needs objective measures to evaluate the severity and burden in each model. Corticosterone is described as a sensitive stress parameter reflecting the acute burden, and inflammatory markers can be used for assessment of the extent of the brain lesion. However, the brain lesion itself may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis early after SAH, as shown for ischemic stroke, probably interfering with early inflammatory processes, thus complicating the assessment of severity and burden on the basis of corticosterone and inflammation. To assess the suitability of these markers in SAH, we evaluated the courses of corticosterone, IL-6 and TNF-α up to 6h in an acute model simulating SAH in continuously anaesthetized rats, lacking the pain and stress induced impact on these parameters. Animals were randomly allocated to sham or SAH. SAH was induced by cisterna magna blood-injection, and intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow were measured under continuous isoflurane/fentanyl anaesthesia. Withdrawn at predetermined time points, blood was analysed by commercial ELISA kits. After 6h the brain was removed for western blot analysis of IL-6 and TNF-α. Serum corticosterone levels were low with no significant difference between sham and SAH. No activation of the HPA-axis was detectable, rendering corticosterone a potentially useful parameter for stress assessment in future chronic studies. Blood IL-6 and TNF-α increased in both groups over time, with IL-6 increasing significantly more in SAH compared to sham towards the end of the observation period. In the basal cortex, IL-6 and TNF-α increased only in SAH. The pro-inflammatory response seems to start locally in the brain, reflected by an increase in peripheral blood. An additional surgery-induced systemic inflammatory response should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2964575728,"The physical characteristics of postmenopausal women that are associated with upper back pain are not well-understood. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the physical characteristics associated with presence and severity of upper back pain in healthy postmenopausal women. Self-reported upper back pain presence (within the previous month) and severity (numerical rating scale) were examined against the physical characteristics: height; weight; body mass index; breast size; breast ptosis; upper back extensor muscle endurance (isometric chest raise test); head, shoulder and upper back posture (photogrammetry); thoracic extension mobility (photogrammetry); bone mineral density (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)); body composition (DXA); and thoracic kyphosis, thoracic osteoarthritis and thoracic vertebral fracture (all radiography). A multivariable logistic regression model, adjusted for age, was built using physical characteristics with a significant univariate association with upper back pain. Censored Tobit regression, adjusted for age, was used to examine each physical characteristic against upper back pain severity. Postmenopausal women (n = 119) with a mean (SD) age of 61.4 (7.0) years participated in the study. After adjusting for age, the physical characteristics independently associated with upper back pain were: height (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31–0.79); and upper back extensor muscle endurance (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.28–0.75). This model explained 31% of the variance in upper back pain (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, being taller and having better upper back extensor muscle endurance were associated with lower odds for upper back pain. After adjusting for age, differences in upper back pain severity were explained by upper back extensor muscle endurance (p = <0.001) and lean mass (p = 0.01). Conclusion: As a modifiable physical characteristic of postmenopausal women with upper back pain, upper back extensor muscle endurance is worth considering clinically."

Therefore, both volumes presented a similar efficacy, though neither resulted in effective pain control during irreversible pulpitis treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02422823."
https://openalex.org/W2965225178,"The Netherlands has a maternity care system with integrated midwifery care, including the option of home birth for low risk women. A small group of Dutch (holistic) midwives is willing to assist women in high risk pregnancies during a home birth against medical advice. We examined holistic midwives' motivations and way of practice, in order to provide other maternity care professionals with insight into the way they work and to improve professional relationships between all care providers in the field. An exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and a grounded theory method were used. We performed in-depth interviews with twenty-four holistic midwives on their motivations for working outside their professional boundaries. Open, axial and selective coding of the interview data was done in order to generate themes. We held a focus group for a member check of the findings. Four main themes were found: 1) The regular system is failing women, 2) The relationship as basis for empowerment, 3) Delivering client centered care in the current system is demanding, and 4) Future directions. One core theme emerged that covered all other themes: Addressing a need. Holistic midwives explained that many of their clients had no other choice than to choose a home birth in a high risk pregnancy because they felt let down by the regular system of maternity care. Holistic midwives appear to deliver an important service. They provide continuity of care and succeed in establishing a relationship with their clients built on trust and mutual respect, truly putting their clients' needs first. Some women feel let down by the regular system, and holistic midwives may be the last resort before those women choose to deliver unattended by any medical professional. Maternity care providers should consider working with holistic midwives in the interest of good patient care."

This study assessed the impact of the of the Single Exit Price (SEP) regulation introduced in South Africa in 2004 on a basket of generic.Private sector price data of a basket of medicines (December 1999 to December 2014) was obtained from various price files (Pharmacy Software Vendors and Community Pharmacy). The price of the medicine was expressed in a single unit dose. The medicines investigated used the WHO/HAI methodology. The Interrupted Time-Series (ITS) model was used to estimate the change in slope and level of medicines investigated (50 originator and its available generics) before and after the policy change.Majority of the medicines analysed reflect a substantial decrease in medicine prices immediately after implementation of the pricing regulations as reflected in both the change in level and the change in slope using the interrupted time series analysis.This study indicates that the SEP regulation had an impact on medicine pricing in South Africa in both the short (immediately on the introduction) and long term (over the study period). Most medicines investigated showed a smaller yearly increase in price compared to before regulations.This study provides evidence of the impact of medicine pricing intervention from a middle-income country, and useful lessons can be drawn by other developing countries looking at introducing medicine price controls."

However, there are still threats to their long-term persistence. A previous study reported that Cape mountain zebra had low genetic diversity in three relict populations and that urgent conservation management actions were needed to mitigate the risk of further loss. As these suggestions went largely unheeded, we undertook the present study, fifteen years later to determine the impact of management on genetic diversity in three key populations. Our results show a substantial loss of heterozygosity across the Cape mountain zebra populations studied. The most severe losses occurred at De Hoop Nature Reserve where expected heterozygosity reduced by 22.85% from 0.385 to 0.297. This is alarming, as the De Hoop Nature Reserve was previously identified as the most genetically diverse population owing to its founders originating from two of the three remaining relict stocks. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of multiple private alleles from all populations, and a related reduction in genetic structure across the subspecies. These losses could lead to inbreeding depression and reduce the evolutionary potential of the Cape mountain zebra. We recommend immediate implementation of evidence-based genetic management and monitoring to prevent further losses, which could jeopardise the long term survival of Cape mountain zebra, especially in the face of habitat and climate change and emerging diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2964700770,"Viral infections universally rely on numerous hijacked host factors to be successful. It is therefore possible to control viral infections by manipulating host factors that are critical for viral replication. Given that host genes may play essential roles in certain cellular processes, any successful manipulations for virus control should cause no or mild effects on host fitness. We previously showed that a group of positive-strand RNA viruses enrich phosphatidylcholine (PC) at the sites of viral replication. Specifically, brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication protein 1a interacts with and recruits a PC synthesis enzyme, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, Cho2p, to the viral replication sites that are assembled on the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Deletion of the CHO2 gene inhibited BMV replication by 5-fold; however, it slowed down host cell growth as well. Here, we show that an engineered Cho2p mutant supports general PC synthesis and normal cell growth but blocks BMV replication. This mutant interacts and colocalizes with BMV 1a but prevents BMV 1a from localizing to the perinuclear ER membrane. The mislocalized BMV 1a fails to induce the formation of viral replication complexes. Our study demonstrates an effective antiviral strategy in which a host lipid synthesis gene is engineered to control viral replication without comprising host growth."
https://openalex.org/W2964470344,"A pivotal matter to aquaculture is the sourcing of sustainable resources as ingredients to aquafeeds. Levels of plant delivered oils as source of fatty acids (FA) in aquafeeds have reached around 70% resulting in reduced levels of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in salmon fillet composition. EPA and DHA can modulate inflammation and immune response, so it is crucial to understand how fish immune response is affected by low LC n-3 PUFA diet and if this diet can have a detrimental effect on vaccine response. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can produce EPA/DHA from α-linolenic acid (ALA) and this endogenous capacity can be explored to develop families with higher tolerance to low LC n-3 PUFA diets. Here we analyze innate and adaptive immune response in Atlantic salmon to a commercial vaccine after being fed low levels of EPA and DHA, and we also compare three strains of salmon selected by their endogenous capacity of synthesizing LC- n-3 PUFA. A total of 2,890 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (p-value adjusted < 0.1) when comparing vaccinated fish against control non-vaccinated. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis with 442 up/downregulated genes revealed that most DEGs were both related to immune response as well as part of important immune related pathways, as “Toll-like receptor” and “Cytokine-Cytokine interaction”. Adaptive response was also addressed by measuring antigen specific IgM, and titers were significantly higher than in the pre-immune fish at 62 days post-immunization. However, diet and strain had no/little effect on vaccine-specific IgM or innate immune responses. Atlantic salmon therefore display robustness in its response to vaccination even when feed low levels of LC n-3 PUFA."
https://openalex.org/W2965604457,"Oncology-associated adverse drug/device reactions can be fatal. Some clinicians who treat single patients with severe oncology-associated toxicities have researched case series and published this information. We investigated motivations and experiences of select individuals leading such efforts. Clinicians treating individual patients who developed oncology-associated serious adverse drug events were asked to participate. Inclusion criteria included having index patient information, reporting case series, and being collaborative with investigators from two National Institutes of Health funded pharmacovigilance networks. Thirty-minute interviews addressed investigational motivation, feedback from pharmaceutical manufacturers, FDA personnel, and academic leadership, and recommendations for improving pharmacovigilance. Responses were analyzed using constant comparative methods of qualitative analysis. Overall, 18 clinicians met inclusion criteria and 14 interviewees are included. Primary motivations were scientific curiosity, expressed by six clinicians. A less common theme was public health related (three clinicians). Six clinicians received feedback characterized as supportive from academic leaders, while four clinicians received feedback characterized as negative. Three clinicians reported that following the case series publication they were invited to speak at academic institutions worldwide. Responses from pharmaceutical manufacturers were characterized as negative by 12 clinicians. One clinician’s wife called the post-reporting time the “Maalox month,” while another clinician reported that the manufacturer collaboratively offered to identify additional cases of the toxicity. Responses from FDA employees were characterized as collaborative for two clinicians, neutral for five clinicians, unresponsive for negative by six clinicians. Three clinicians endorsed developing improved reporting mechanisms for individual physicians, while 11 clinicians endorsed safety activities that should be undertaken by persons other than a motivated clinician who personally treats a patient with a severe adverse drug/device reaction. Our study provides some of the first reports of clinician motivations and experiences with reporting serious or potentially fatal oncology-associated adverse drug or device reactions. Overall, it appears that negative feedback from pharmaceutical manufacturers and mixed feedback from the academic community and/or the FDA were reported. Big data, registries, Data Safety Monitoring Boards, and pharmacogenetic studies may facilitate improved pharmacovigilance efforts for oncology-associated adverse drug reactions. These initiatives overcome concerns related to complacency, indifference, ignorance, and system-level problems as barriers to documenting and reporting adverse drug events- barriers that have been previously reported for clinician reporting of serious adverse drug reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2965737814,"HNF4α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α) is one of the master regulators of pancreatic β-cell development and function, and mutations in the HNF4α gene are well-known monogenic causes of diabetes. As a member of the nuclear receptor family, HNF4α exerts its gene regulatory function through various molecular interactions; however, there is a paucity of knowledge of the different functional complexes in which HNF4α participates. Here, to find HNF4α-binding proteins in pancreatic β-cells, we used yeast two-hybrid screening, a mammalian two-hybrid assay, and glutathione S-transferase pulldown approaches, which identified EBP1 (ErbB3-binding protein 1) as a factor that binds HNF4α in a LXXLL motif–mediated manner. In the β-cells, EBP1 suppressed the expression of HNF4α target genes that are implicated in insulin secretion, which is impaired in HNF4α mutation-driven diabetes. The crystal structure of the HNF4α ligand-binding domain in complex with a peptide harboring the EBP1 LXXLL motif at 3.15Å resolution hinted at the molecular basis of the repression. The details of the structure suggested that EBP1’s LXXLL motif competes with HNF4α coactivators for the same binding pocket and thereby prevents recruitment of additional transcriptional coactivators. These findings provide further evidence that EBP1 plays multiple cellular roles and is involved in nuclear receptor–mediated gene regulation. Selective disruption of the HNF4α–EBP1 interaction or tissue-specific EBP1 inactivation can enhance HNF4α activities and thereby improve insulin secretion in β-cells, potentially representing a new strategy for managing diabetes and related metabolic disorders.

In this work, we present the evidence that EBP1 also acts as a repressor of HNF4α-mediated transcription through interacting with the LXXLL motif–binding pocket of HNF4α, which has a direct link to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells that is impaired in the HNF4α mutation-driven diabetes. To search out additional key binding partners of HNF4α in pancreatic β-cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens (utilizing the service provided by the Yeast Model System Genomics facility at Duke University, which is now closed) and identified EBP1 as one of its binding partners. The bait vectors containing various constructs of HNF4α were made and screened against the pretransformed mouse pancreatic library as prey. When full-length HNF4α or the ligand-binding domain (LBD) only was used as bait, EBP1 was identified as one of the putative binding partners, together with the well-known HNF4α transcriptional coregulators such as PGC-1α, GRIP1/NCoA2, and the mediator component MED25 of RNA polymerase II (the original figures of the plates with proper controls were not provided to us except the table of potential binding partners and their sequence information). DNA sequence analysis of the positive clones revealed four cDNAs derived from the same gene, encompassing the 197–373 or 286–367 region of EBP1 (NP_035249) containing the LXXLL motif (positions 354–358). This mouse sequence shares 99% sequence identity with its human counterpart (only 4 amino acid differences of 394). To confirm the initial yeast two-hybrid findings, mammalian two-hybrid assay was carried out with HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HNF4α–EBP1 mutual interaction was evident even in the absence of additional external ligand, and this interaction was greatly reduced when the EBP1 mutant (EBP1–NR) in which the sole LXXLL sequence was mutated to LXXAA was used, suggesting its involvement in this interaction. A weak residual interaction by EBP1–NR suggests a possible involvement of other regions of EBP1 for HNF4α interactions, although the LXXLL motif plays a major role. To map the critical domains of HNF4α and EBP1 for their mutual interactions, mammalian two-yeast assay and GST pulldown experiments were performed with a series of HNF4α truncation mutants and EBP1 full-length protein. The crystal structures of EBP1 and HNF4α are available, and they indicate that the entire structure of EBP1 is made of a single well-folded domain (34Kowalinski E. Bange G. Bradatsch B. Hurt E.

Therefore, several different constructs of HNF4α encompassing various regions of the protein were made and used for examination, whereas a single construct of EBP1 full-length was used. As shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. S1, all the truncated mutants containing the HNF4α–LBD (positions 151–377) made interactions, and the LBD alone proved to be sufficient for interaction with EBP1. These findings are in line with the initial yeast two-hybrid screening outcomes in which the protein products corresponding to the amino acid 197–373 or 286–367 region of EBP1 containing the LXXLL motif (positions 354–358) showed interactions with both HNF4α–LBD alone and the full-length HNF4α. Taken together, these binding analysis results prove that EBP1 physically interacts with HNF4α in living cells and present EBP1 as a potential transcriptional regulator. Because EBP1 is a well-known transcriptional corepressor for another NR, AR-regulated genes (28Zhang Y. Akinmade D. Hamburger A.W. The ErbB3 binding protein Ebp1 interacts with Sin3A to repress E2F1 and AR-mediated transcription.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (16254079): 6024-603310.1093/nar/gki903Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y.

The reporter vector pGL3-HNF1α contained one copy of the HNF4α response element (−64 to −52) within the promoter of human HNF1α (−298 to the first AGT) (20Han E.H. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I. MED25 is a mediator component of HNF4α-driven transcription leading to insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22952853): e4400710.1371/journal.pone.0044007Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, EBP1 substantially reduced the expression of the reporter gene (lanes 3 and 7), whereas this effect is completely masked by the EBP1 LXXAA mutant (EBP1–NR) or shEBP1 (lanes 4 and 8 or lanes 5 and 9, respectively), suggesting a direct involvement of EBP1 in HNF4α-mediated transactivation (see Fig. S2 for validation of EBP1 knockdown by shRNA). To assure a direct role by EBP1, we also measured the HNF4α expression levels when the cells were singly transfected or cotransfected with EBP1, in which the HNF4α expression levels remained the same (Fig. S3A), indicating that this is not due to reduced HNF4α protein expression but is mainly attributed to the direct repressive activity of EBP1. To investigate whether EBP1 also serves as a repressor for other NRs, in addition to AR and HNF4α, a selective set of representative NRs have been tested by similar overexpression and transcription reporter assays. We chose PPARγ, ERα, PR, RARα, and RXR for the studies, among which all but ERα showed repressive outcomes upon the overexpression of EBP1 (Fig. 2, B–F). This is quite contrast to our previous findings in which HNF4α and ERα displayed the same positive response to the overexpression of MED25 (mediator complex subunit 25), whereas other NRs did not (20Han E.H. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I.

Thus, it appears that coregulatory recruitments by NRs are member-specific, and each coregulator or mediator component works for its own cognate members of the NR superfamily (39Korzus E. Torchia J.

MODY patients are mainly characterized by a severe impairment of insulin secretion, and the mutations in the MODY gene products, including HNF4α, are monogenic causes of an insulin secretion defect resulting in diabetes onset (41Owen K.

Thus, to probe the involvement of EBP1 in HNF4α-specific target gene expression and insulin secretion in β-cells, we next tested whether EBP1 is required for HNF4α transcriptional activation of previously known HNF4α target genes that are directly involved in β-cell insulin secretion such as PPARα (3Miura A.

A matrix is established by taking the transmission timing of the wireless pulse, the preprocessing time of the label, and the receiving time as elements. The result of the matrix calculation shows that the position of the label is related to the above three factors. Experiments are carried out to simulate base station intervals of 20–90 m on an underground roadway. The results show that when the spacing of the positioning base stations is 70 m, the average positioning error is a minimum of 0.0302 m and the positioning delay is a minimum of 0.43 s. In the same experimental environment, after 60 days of continuous operation, it is found that the mean change in the positioning accuracy of the two-round-trip system is within ±0.0003 m while the delay change is within ±0.03 s, showing good system stability."

Methods A retrospective chart review study was conducted at diabetes clinic of Addis Ababa’s public teaching hospitals among a randomly selected sample of 685 charts of patients with T2DMwho were on follow up from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2017. Data was collected using data abstraction tool. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan Meier plots, median survival time, Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard survival models were used for analysis. Results Median time to first optimal glycaemic control among the study population was 9.5 months. Factors that affect time to first optimal glycaemic control were age group (HR = 0.635, 95% CI: 0.486–0.831 for 50–59 years, HR = 0.558, 95% CI: 0.403–0.771for 60–69 years and HR = 0.495, 95% CI: 0.310–0.790 for > = 70 years), diabetes neuropathy (HR = 0.502, 95% CI: 0.375–0.672), more than one complication (HR = 0.381, 95% CI: 0.177–0.816), hypertension (HR = 0.611, 95% CI: 0.486–0.769), dyslipidemia (HR = 0.609, 95% CI: 0.450–0.824), cardiovascular disease (HR = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.458–0.979) and hospital patient being treated (HR = 1.273, 95% CI: 1.052–1.541). Conclusions Median time to first optimal glycaemic control among T2DM patients is longer than expected which might imply that patients are being exposed to more risk of complication and death."
https://openalex.org/W2965998991,"We present the Naive Discriminative Reading Aloud (ndra) model. The ndra differs from existing models of response times in the reading aloud task in two ways. First, a single lexical architecture is responsible for both word and non-word naming. As such, the model differs from dual-route models, which consist of both a lexical route and a sub-lexical route that directly maps orthographic units onto phonological units. Second, the linguistic core of the ndra exclusively operates on the basis of the equilibrium equations for the well-established general human learning algorithm provided by the Rescorla-Wagner model. The model therefore does not posit language-specific processing mechanisms and avoids the problems of psychological and neurobiological implausibility associated with alternative computational implementations. We demonstrate that the single-route discriminative learning architecture of the ndra captures a wide range of effects documented in the experimental reading aloud literature and that the overall fit of the model is at least as good as that of state-of-the-art dual-route models."
https://openalex.org/W2965276891,"The purpose of this study was to apply texture analysis (TA) to evaluate the uniformity of SPECT images reconstructed with the 3D Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (3D-OSEM) algorithm. For this purpose, a cylindrical homogeneous phantom filled with 177Lu was used and a total of 24 spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) were considered inside the phantom. The location of the VOIs was chosen in order to define two different configurations, i.e. gravity and radial configuration. The former configuration was used to investigate the uniformity of distribution of 177Lu inside the phantom, while the latter configuration was used to investigate the lack of uniformity from center towards edge of the images. For each VOI, the trend of different texture features considered as a function of 3D-OSEM updates was investigated in order to evaluate the influence of reconstruction parameters. TA was performed using CGITA software. The equality of the average texture feature trends in both spatial configurations was assumed as the null hypothesis and was tested by functional analysis of variance (fANOVA). With regard to the gravity configuration, no texture feature rejected the null hypothesis when the number of subsets increased. For the radial configuration, the statistical analysis revealed that, depending on the 3D-OSEM parameters used, a few texture features were capable of detecting the non-uniformity of 177Lu distribution inside the phantom moving from the center of the image towards its edge. Finally, cross-correlation coefficients were calculated to better identify the features that could play an important role in assessing quality assurance procedures performed on SPECT systems."
https://openalex.org/W2964383888,"There are approximately 10,000-12,000 Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) inhabiting the Oregon coast, and unlike other species of pinnipeds in this region, are reliably present year-round. Despite this, and drastic rebounds in population since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, limited data is available for the present period regarding their space use at sea, and within estuarine, riverine, or bay areas within the state.To examine site-based differences in space use for 24 adult Pacific harbor seals captured and outfitted with satellite transmitters at two predominant haulout sites on the Oregon Coast, USA.We captured 24 adult harbor seals from two haulout sites on the Central Oregon coast between September 2014-16 and fitted them with external Wildlife Computers SPOT5 satellite transmitters to track movement. Using state-space modeled locations derived from satellite telemetry data, we evaluated spatial behavior of these animals using a correlated random walk model via R package crawl. Kernel density estimation was subsequently used to calculate home range and core area for each animal. Percent use of open ocean habitat versus use of estuaries, rivers and bays was quantified, as was an initial examination of presence within five newly-established marine reserves in Oregon. Examination of haulout site-related differences in spatial behavior were examined for seals captured in Netarts and Alsea Bays, Oregon and haul out behavior related to time of day, season, and tidal level was also investigated.The average individual home range for seals was 364.47 ± 382.87 km2 with seals captured in Alsea bay demonstrating a significantly higher home range area than those captured in Netarts Bay. Alsea bay seals also tended to range farther from shore than Netarts Bay animals. The average calculated core area for seals encompassed on average 29.41 ± 29.23 km2 per animal, however the home range of one animal was so small, core area could not be calculated. Use of marine reserves was limited for animals in this study, representing less than 2% of locations with a majority occurring in Cape Perpetua Marine Reserve and North Marine Protected Area. Seals were more likely to haul out during low tides and periods of low light (dusk, night and dawn), and hauling out behavior increased in winter months.These findings demonstrate the first major documentation of space use of harbor seals in the state for nearly three decades, and lends itself to future comparison and formation of mechanistically-based hypotheses for behavior of a common marine mammal in the highly productive northern California Current System."
https://openalex.org/W2965901700,"More than 50% of the world’s lung cancer cases occur in Asia and more than 20% of cancer deaths in Asia are attributable to lung cancer. The U.S. National Lung Screening Trial has shown that lung cancer screening with computed tomography (CT) can reduce lung cancer deaths. Using the Lung Cancer Policy Model–Asia (LCPM-Asia), we estimated the potential mortality reduction achievable through the implementation of CT-based lung cancer screening in China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The LCPM-Asia was calibrated to the smoking prevalence of each of the aforementioned countries based on published national surveys and to lung cancer mortality rates from the World Health Organization. The calibrated LCPM-Asia was then used to simulate lung cancer deaths under screening and no-screening scenarios for the four countries. Using screening eligibility criteria recommended by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which are based on age and smoking history, we estimated the lung cancer mortality reduction from screening through year 2040. By 2040, lung cancer screening would result in 91,362 life-years gained and 4.74% mortality reduction in South Korea; 290,325 life-years gained and 4.33% mortality reduction in Japan; 3,014,215 life-years gained and 4.22% mortality reduction in China; and 8,118 life-years gained and 3.76% mortality reduction in Singapore. As for mortality reduction by smoker type, current smokers would have the greatest mortality reduction in each country, ranging from 5.56% in Japan to 6.86% in Singapore. Among the four countries, lung cancer screening under CMS eligibility criteria was most effective in South Korea and least effective in Singapore. Singapore’s low smoking prevalence and South Korea’s aging population and higher smoking prevalence may partially explain the discrepancy in effectiveness. CT screening was shown to be promising as a means of reducing lung cancer mortality in the four countries."
https://openalex.org/W2966404642,"Background Positive mindset (PM) is an important domain of health-related quality of life in Singapore, a multi-ethnic urban city state in Southeast Asia. We therefore developed and calibrated a novel item bank to measure and improve PM. Methods We developed an initial candidate pool of 48 items from focus groups, in-depth interviews and existing instruments locally developed and validated for use in Singapore. We administered all items in English to a multi-stage sample stratified for age and gender, of subjects with and without medical conditions recruited from the community and a hospital, and calibrated their responses using Samejima’s Graded Response Model. We evaluated a final 36-item bank with respect to Item Response Theory (IRT) model assumptions, model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), concurrent and known-groups validity. Results Among 493 participants (49.3% male, 41.6% above 50 years old, 33% Chinese, Malay and Indian), bifactor model analyses supported unidimensionality: explained common variance of the general factor was 0.86 and omega hierarchical was 0.97. Local independence was deemed acceptable: the average absolute residual correlations were <0.06 and 3.3% of the total item-pair residuals were flagged for local dependence. The overall model fit was adequate and provided good coverage of the PM construct (theta range: -3.6 to +2.4). Five items exhibited DIF with respect to ethnicity and gender, but were retained without modification of scores because they measured important aspects of PM. Scores correlated in the hypothesized direction with a self-reported measure of global health (Spearman’s rho = -0.28, p<0.001) and discriminated between groups of participants with and without a self-reported diagnosis of a mood disorder (p = 0.007) adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education and marital status. Conclusion The 36-item PM item bank demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties for the English-speaking Singaporean population. IRT model assumptions were sufficiently met and scores showed concurrent and known-groups validity. Future studies to evaluate the validity of PM scores when items are administered adaptively are needed."
