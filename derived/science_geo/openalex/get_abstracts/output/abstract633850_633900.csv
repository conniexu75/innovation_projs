https://openalex.org/W2946891987,"Crop yields are projected to decrease under future climate conditions, and recent research suggests that yields have already been impacted. However, current impacts on a diversity of crops subnationally and implications for food security remains unclear. Here, we constructed linear regression relationships using weather and reported crop data to assess the potential impact of observed climate change on the yields of the top ten global crops–barley, cassava, maize, oil palm, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane and wheat at ~20,000 political units. We find that the impact of global climate change on yields of different crops from climate trends ranged from -13.4% (oil palm) to 3.5% (soybean). Our results show that impacts are mostly negative in Europe, Southern Africa and Australia but generally positive in Latin America. Impacts in Asia and Northern and Central America are mixed. This has likely led to ~1% average reduction (-3.5 X 1013 kcal/year) in consumable food calories in these ten crops. In nearly half of food insecure countries, estimated caloric availability decreased. Our results suggest that climate change has already affected global food production."
https://openalex.org/W2810602713,"Recent progress in artificial intelligence through reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success on increasingly complex single-agent environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real-world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents, and environments reflecting this degree of complexity remain an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input. These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning, and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these agents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and defending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode high-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the trained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates and opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents. These results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial agents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W3105444973,"A fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics requires the Hamiltonians to be Hermitian which guarantees real eigen-energies and probability conservation. However, a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with Parity-Time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry can still display entirely real spectra. The Hermiticity requirement may be replaced by $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry to develop an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics. A series of experiments have been carried out with classical systems including optics, electronics, microwaves, mechanics and acoustics. However, there are few experiments to investigate $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric physics in quantum systems.Here we report the first observation of the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking in a single spin system. We have developed a novel method to dilate a general $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one, which can be realized in a practical quantum system.Then the state evolutions under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians, which range from $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric unbroken to broken regions, have been experimentally observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Due to the universality of the dilation method, our result opens a door for further exploiting and understanding the physical properties of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum systems."

Governments do not always follow these intentions, however, and often legally remove protections and reduce the extent of protected areas. Golden Kroner et al. looked across the United States and Amazonia over the past 200 years and found more than 700 such changes, two-thirds of which have occurred since the year 2000 (see the Perspective by Naughton-Treves and Holland). The majority of these were to permit destructive practices, such as resource extraction. Thus, these changes do not just alter status but lead to irreparable environmental harm.

This hypothesis has been difficult to validate by functional experiments. Gifford et al. sequenced the genomes of two parents who were asymptomatic and their three children, all of whom had early-onset heart disease. They identified three likely culprit genetic variants, two in transcription factor genes linked to heart development and one in a gene encoding a muscle structural protein. When they introduced these three variants together into mice by gene editing, the mice developed heart disease resembling that seen in the children. Science , this issue p. 865"

But why do some species radiate in this way, while other, related, species do not. Ishikawa et al. looked across sticklebacks to determine why some, originally marine, lineages were able to colonize postglacial freshwater environments (see the Perspective by Weber and Tong). They found that a gene involved in fatty acid desaturation was duplicated in freshwater lineages. Transgenic manipulation of this gene allowed marine lineages to synthesize fatty acids and thus survive on fatty acid–deficient freshwater diets. Science , this issue p. 886 ; see also p. 831"
https://openalex.org/W2946969509,"Malaria control efforts require implementation of new technologies that manage insecticide resistance. Metarhizium pingshaense provides an effective, mosquito-specific delivery system for potent insect-selective toxins. A semifield trial in a MosquitoSphere (a contained, near-natural environment) in Soumousso, a region of Burkina Faso where malaria is endemic, confirmed that the expression of an insect-specific toxin (Hybrid) increased fungal lethality and the likelihood that insecticide-resistant mosquitoes would be eliminated from a site. Also, as Hybrid-expressing M. pingshaense is effective at very low spore doses, its efficacy lasted longer than that of the unmodified Metarhizium Deployment of transgenic Metarhizium against mosquitoes could (subject to appropriate registration) be rapid, with products that could synergistically integrate with existing chemical control strategies to avert insecticide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2947403755,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the major components of a tumour microenvironment, comprise heterogeneous populations involved in tumour progression. However, it remains obscure how CAF heterogeneity is governed by cancer cells. Here, we show that cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs) induce a series of chemokines in activated fibroblasts and contribute to the formation of the heterogeneity. In a xenograft model of diffuse-type gastric cancer, we showed two distinct fibroblast subpopulations with alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression or chemokine expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) profiling of the EVs and the transfection experiment suggested that several miRNAs played a role in the induction of chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL8 in fibroblasts, but not for the myofibroblastic differentiation. Clinically, aberrant activation of CXCL1 and CXCL8 in CAFs correlated with poorer survival in gastric cancer patients. Thus, this link between chemokine expression in CAFs and tumour progression may provide novel targets for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2947422914,"Gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be involved in intestinal nutrition, defense, and immunity, as well as participating in disease progression. This study was to investigate gut microbiota changes in chickens challenged with netB-positive Clostridium perfringens strain (CP1) and/or the predisposing Eimeria species (Eimeria) and fed diets with fishmeal supplementation. In addition, the effects of lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA), on necrotic enteritis (NE) reduction and modulation of microbiota were evaluated. The results demonstrated that microbial communities in the jejunum were distinct from those in the cecum, and the microbial community change was more significant in jejunum. Challenge of CP1 in conjunction with Eimeria significantly reduced species diversity in jejunal microbiota, but cecal microbiota remained stable. In the jejunum, CP1 challenge increased the abundance of the genera of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Escherichia Shigella, and Weissella, but significantly decreased the population of Lactobacillus. Eimeria infection on its own was unable to promote NE, demonstrating decrements of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Lactobacillus. Co-infection with CP1 and Eimeria reproduced the majority of NE lesions with significant increment of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and reduction in Lactobacillus. The advance of changes on these two taxa increased the severity of NE lesions. Further analyses of metagenomeSeq, STAMP, and LEfSe consistently showed significant overgrowth of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 was associated with NE. The supplementation of lauric acid did not reduce NE incidence and severity but decreased the relative abundance of Escherichia Shigella. In conclusion, significant overgrowth of C. perfringens as well as other Clostridium species in Clostridium sensu stricto 1 with the decrement of Lactobacillus in the jejunum is the featured microbiota correlated with NE. Controlling proliferation of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and manipulation of Lactobacillus in the jejunum should be the strategy to prevent NE."

Observing this fragile crystal is tricky because it requires extreme conditions—low temperatures and densities—and very noninvasive probes. Shapir et al. created such conditions in a carbon nanotube, which housed the electrons, and a second nanotube that scanned the first nanotube, serving as a probe. The measured electronic densities were consistent with theoretical predictions for small Wigner crystals of up to six electrons in one dimension. Science , this issue p. 870"
https://openalex.org/W2947445588,"Teleporting a trapped-ion quantum gate Gating—controlling the state of one qubit conditioned on the state of another—is a key procedure in all quantum information processors. As the scale of quantum processors increases, the qubits will need to interact over larger and larger distances, which presents an experimental challenge in solid-state architectures. Wan et al. implemented the 20-year-old theoretical proposal of quantum gate teleportation that allows separated qubits to interact effectively. They deterministically teleported a controlled-NOT gate between two computational qubits in spatially separated zones in a segmented ion trap, demonstrating a feasible route toward scalable quantum information processors.

https://openalex.org/W2947316812,"How the mole-rat lost its pain Pain alerts our bodies that something is amiss and typically we stop the pain-causing activity. Numerous species of plants and prey animals take advantage of this response by producing pain-causing substances that are released during predation attempts. In turn, species that encounter these substances often evolve ways of turning off the pain-producing mechanism. Eigenbrod et al. searched RNA transcripts in eight species of subterranean rodents related to pain-resistant naked mole-rats. They found multiple changes to ion channels involved in pain across the different species. Understanding such adaptations could elucidate pain mechanisms and help us develop approaches for pain relief. Science , this issue p. 852"
https://openalex.org/W2911921255,"The relationship between child health, wellbeing and education demonstrates that healthier and happier children achieve higher educational attainment. An engaging curriculum that facilitates children in achieving their academic potential has strong implications for educational outcomes, future employment prospects, and health and wellbeing during adulthood. Outdoor learning is a pedagogical approach used to enrich learning, enhance school engagement and improve pupil health and wellbeing. However, its non-traditional means of achieving curricular aims are not yet recognised beyond the early years by education inspectorates. This requires evidence into its acceptability from those at the forefront of delivery. This study aimed to explore headteachers', teachers' and pupils' views and experiences of an outdoor learning programme within the key stage two curriculum (ages 9-11) in South Wales, United Kingdom. We examine the process of implementation to offer case study evidence through 1:1 interviews with headteachers (n = 3) and teachers (n = 10) and focus groups with pupils aged 9-11 (n = 10) from three primary schools. Interviews and focus groups were conducted at baseline and six months into implementation. Schools introduced regular outdoor learning within the curriculum. This study found a variety of perceived benefits for pupils and schools. Pupils and teachers noticed improvements in pupils' engagement with learning, concentration and behaviour, as well as positive impacts on health and wellbeing and teachers' job satisfaction. Curriculum demands including testing and evidencing work were barriers to implementation, in addition to safety concerns, resources and teacher confidence. Participants supported outdoor learning as a curriculum-based programme for older primary school pupils. However, embedding outdoor learning within the curriculum requires education inspectorates to place higher value on this approach in achieving curricular aims, alongside greater acknowledgment of the wider benefits to children which current measurements do not capture."
https://openalex.org/W2947994258,"Therapy for public speaking phobia using virtual reality exposure (VRE) has focused on distress arousal rather than distress habituation. Understanding habituation will help optimise session duration, making treatment more affordable and accessible. This pilot study utilised within-speech repeated measures to examine distress habituation during three brief public speaking scenarios in a non-clinical sample (n = 19; 18–76 years). VRE elicited significant distress in all three scenarios. Although within-scenario distress habituation was not observed, between-scenario habituation was partially supported. An increase in distress during the second scenario indicated that three consecutive speech performances were critical in achieving habituation. Brief repeated VRE scenarios using an agent audience were effective in eliciting public speaking distress, as well as habituation."
https://openalex.org/W2947439640,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is among the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus, and often leads to end-stage renal disease ultimately requiring dialysis or renal transplantation. The loss of podocytes has been reported to have a role in the onset and progression of DN. Here, we addressed the activation mechanism of Smad3 signaling in podocytes. Expression of RII and activation of Smad3 were induced by AGE exposure (P<0.05). Reduction of the activation of RII-Smad3 signaling ameliorated podocyte injuries in Smad3-knockout diabetic mice. The bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) significantly regulated activation of RII-Smad3 signalings (P<0.05). Moreover, the epithelium-specific transcription factor, Elf3was induced by AGE stimulation and, subsequently, upregulated RII expression in cultured podocytes. Induction of Elf3 and activation of RII-Smad3 signaling, leading to a decrease in WT1 expression, were observed in podocytes in diabetic human kidneys. Moreover, AGE treatment induced the secretion of Elf3-containing exosomes from cultured podocytes, which was dependent on the activation of the TGF-β-Smad3 signaling pathway. In addition, exosomal Elf3 protein in urine could be measured only in urinary exosomes from patients with DN. The appearance of urinary exosomal Elf3 protein in patients with DN suggested the existence of irreversible injuries in podocytes. The rate of decline in the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) after measurement of urinary exosomal Elf3 protein levels in patients with DN (R2 = 0.7259) might be useful as an early non-invasive marker for podocyte injuries in DN."

All associated data files are merged into a single dataset with descriptive column names. The package also provides tools to assist in quality control by exploring the primary demographics of subsets of participants; query of disease diagnoses for one or more individuals, and estimating disease frequency relative to a reference variable; and to retrieve genetic metadata.Having a dataset with meaningful variable names, a set of UKB-specific exploratory data analysis tools, disease query functions, and a set of helper functions to explore and write genetic metadata to file, will rapidly enable UKB users to undertake their research."
https://openalex.org/W2946947537,"Humic acids derived from Chinese weathered coal were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under various conditions, and their chemical composition and structure were examined. The raw material humic acids (HA) and oxidized humic acids (OHAs) were characterized by elemental analysis and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our results show that aromatic functional groups accounted for more than 70% of the HA and OHAs and there were significant differences in their structures and compositions. Compared to the HA, the average H and N contents of the OHAs decreased by 5.15% and 2.52%, respectively, and the average O content of those of the OHAs increased by 5.30%. The hydrophobicity index (HI) of HA is higher than those of the OHAs. Importantly, in the hypothesis test between the properties and preparation conditions of humic acid using SPSS, the partial η2 of the temperature, hydrogen peroxide concentration, liquid-solid ratio, and time were 0.809, 0.771, 0.748 and 0.729, respectively; thus, among the preparation conditions, temperature is the most important factor affecting the humic acids properties."
https://openalex.org/W2947525390,"Lynx1 is the first three-finger prototoxin found in the mammalian central nervous system. It is a GPI-anchored protein modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain. Besides the brain, the Lynx1 protein was found in the lung and kidney. Endogenous Lynx1 controls the nicotine-induced up-regulation of the expression of α7 type nAChRs in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells as well as the cell growth. Here, we analyzed the Lynx1 expression in the set of human epithelial cells. The Lynx1 expression both at the mRNA and protein level was detected in normal oral keratinocytes, and lung, colon, epidermal, and breast cancer cells, but not in embryonic kidney cells. Co-localization of Lynx1 with α7-nAChRs was revealed in a cell membrane for lung adenocarcinoma A549 and colon carcinoma HT-29 cells, but not for breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. The recombinant water-soluble variant of Lynx1 without a GPI-anchor (ws-Lynx1) inhibited the growth of A549 cells causing cell cycle arrest via modulation of α7-nAChRs and activation of different intracellular signaling cascades, including PKC/IP3, MAP/ERK, p38, and JNK pathways. A549 cells treatment with ws-Lynx1 resulted in phosphorylation of the proapoptotic tumor suppressor protein p53 and different kinases participated in the regulation of gene transcription, cell growth, adhesion, and differentiation. Externalization of phosphatidylserine, an early apoptosis marker, observed by flow cytometry, confirmed the induction of apoptosis in A549 cells upon the ws-Lynx1 treatment. Our data revealed the ability of ws-Lynx1 to regulate homeostasis of epithelial cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2946858220,"Despite progress in treatment strategies, only ~24% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients survive >1 year. Our goal was to elucidate deregulated pathways modulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) in PDAC and Vater ampulla (AMP) cancers. Global miRNA expression was identified in 19 PDAC, 6 AMP and 25 paired, histologically normal pancreatic tissues using the GeneChip 4.0 miRNA arrays. Computational approaches were used for miRNA target prediction/identification of miRNA-regulated pathways. Target gene expression was validated in 178 pancreatic cancer and 4 pancreatic normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 20 miRNAs were significantly deregulated (FC≥2 and p<0.05) (15 down- and 5 up-regulated) in PDAC. miR-216 family (miR-216a-3p, miR-216a-5p, miR-216b-3p and miR-216b-5p) was consistently down-regulated in PDAC. miRNA-modulated pathways are associated with innate and adaptive immune system responses in PDAC. AMP cancers showed 8 down- and 1 up-regulated miRNAs (FDR p<0.05). Most enriched pathways (p<0.01) were RAS and Nerve Growth Factor signaling. PDAC and AMP display different global miRNA expression profiles and miRNA regulated networks/tumorigenesis pathways. The immune response was enriched in PDAC, suggesting the existence of immune checkpoint pathways more relevant to PDAC than AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2947581927,"The occurrence of a stressful event is considered to increase the risk of developing depression. In the present study we explore whether the breakup of a romantic relationship can be used as an experimental model to study a depression-like state during a period of stress in individuals without a psychiatric disorder. The primary aim of our study was to investigate: 1) whether individuals with a recent romantic relationship breakup (''heartbreak"") demonstrate symptoms of depression, 2) how to describe heartbreak characteristics based on data from a comprehensive questionnaire battery, and 3) whether this description can capture severity of depression symptoms. Secondary, we were interested in gender differences with regard to the above study objectives. Subjects who have experienced a relationship breakup in the preceding six months (N = 71) or are in a romantic relationship (N = 46) participated in our study. A questionnaire battery was administered to acquire information related to depression, mood, the breakup and (former) relationship. Principal Component Analysis with Procrustes bootstrapping was performed to extract components from the questionnaire data. Even though our sample of individuals who recently have experienced a relationship breakup can be on average considered non-depressed, group-level depression scores were elevated compared to individuals in a relationship (p = .001) and 26.8% reported symptoms corresponding to mild, moderate or severe depression. We described heartbreak by two principal components interpreted as ''sudden loss"" and ''lack of positive affect"", respectively. Highly significant correlations between the component scores and depression scores were found (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively), although these correlations differed between the genders. Based on these findings, we propose that the experience of a romantic relationship breakup is a viable experimental model to examine symptoms of depression in individuals without a psychiatric disorder. This way, stress-related coping and depression vulnerability can be studied in further research."
https://openalex.org/W2947989595,"Organelle selective imaging can reveal structural and functional characters of cells undergoing external stimuli, and is considered critical in revealing biological fundamentals, designing targeted delivery system, and screening potential drugs and therapeutics. This paper describes the nucleoli targeting ability of nanoscale carbon dots (including nanodiamond) that are hydrothermally made with controlled surface charges. The surface charges of carbon dots are controlled in the range of -17.9 to -2.84 mV by changing the molar ratio of two precursors, citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA). All carbon dots samples show strong fluorescence under wide excitation wavelength, and samples with both negative and positve charges show strong fluorescent contrast from stained nucleoli. The nucleoli selective imaging of live cell has been confirmed with Hoechst staining and nucleoli specific staining (SYTO RNA-select green), and is explained as surface charge heterogeneity on carbon dots. Carbon dots with both negative and positive charges have better ability to penetrate cell and nucleus membranes, and the charge heterogeneity helps carbon dots to bind preferentially to nucleoli, where the electrostatic environment is favored."
https://openalex.org/W2947622767,"Obesity is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but how obesity promotes renal injury remains poorly understood. Here we showed that ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme converting citrate to acetyl-CoA, is highly induced in the kidney of overweight or obese patients with CKD and ob/ob BTBR mice. ACL induction is associated with increased ectopic lipid accumulation (ELA), glomerulosclerosis, and albuminuria. Acetyl-CoA is the substrate for de novo lipogenesis as well as for histone acetylation. By raising acetyl-CoA concentration ACL promotes H3K9/14 and H3K27 hyperacetylation leading to up-regulation of several rate-limiting lipogenic enzymes and fibrogenic factors. On the other hand, the excess acetyl-CoA generated as a result of ACL induction provides the substrate for these lipogenic enzymes to drive de novo lipogenesis leading to ELA, a detrimental event toward renal injury. In mesangial cells, ACL is synergistically induced by high glucose, palmitate, and TNF-α via NF-κB and PKA pathways. Under these conditions, H3K9/14 and H3K27 hyperacetylation, as well as the induction of the lipogenic and fibrogenic proteins, are completely blocked in the presence of an ACL inhibitor. Collectively, these data suggest that ACL is an epigenetic regulator that promotes renal ELA and fibrogenesis leading to renal injury in obesity.-Chen, Y., Deb, D. K., Fu, X., Yi, B., Liang, Y., Du, J., He, L., Li, Y. C. ATP-citrate lyase is an epigenetic regulator to promote obesity-related kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2947929931,"Recent increase in the detection of unusual G1P[8], G3P[8], G8P[8], and G9P[4] Rotavirus A (RVA) strains bearing the DS-1-like constellation of the non-G, non-P genes (hereafter referred to as the genotype 2 backbone) requires better understanding of their evolutionary relationship. However, within a genotype, there is lack of a consensus lineage designation framework and a set of common sequences that can serve as references. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on over 8,500 RVA genotype 2 genes systematically retrieved from the rotavirus database within the NCBI Virus Variation Resource. In line with previous designations, using pairwise comparison of cogent nucleotide sequences and stringent bootstrap support, reference lineages were defined. This study proposes a lineage framework and provides a dataset ranging from 34 to 145 sequences for each genotype 2 gene for orderly lineage designation of global genotype 2 genes of RVAs detected in human and animals. The framework identified five to 31 lineages depending on the gene. The least number of lineages (five to seven) were observed in genotypes A2 (NSP1), T2 (NSP3) and H2 (NSP5) which are limited to human RVA whereas the most number of lineages (31) was observed in genotype E2 (NSP4). Sharing of the same lineage constellations of the genotype 2 backbone genes between recently-emerging, unusual G1P[8], G3P[8], G8P[8] and G9P[4] reassortants and many contemporary G2P[4] strains provided strong support to the hypothesis that unusual genotype 2 strains originated primarily from reassortment events in the recent past involving contemporary G2P[4] strains as one parent and ordinary genotype 1 strains or animal RVA strains as the other. The lineage framework with selected reference sequences will help researchers to identify the lineage to which a given genotype 2 strain belongs, and trace the evolutionary history of common and unusual genotype 2 strains in circulation."

However, its potential mechanism remains unknown. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect and mechanism of hyperandrogenemia and flutamide (a non-steroidal anti-androgen) on the embryo implantation and pregnancy during mid-pregnancy.We used a mouse model in which PCOS-like hyperandrogenemia was induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate. In this model, we observed the effect of hyperandrogenemia and flutamide on the decidualization, angiogenesis and uNK cells by methods of immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, western blotting and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) lectin staining.Testosterone and flutamide treatment did not significantly influence the numbers of implanted embryo compared with the control group. However, different doses of testosterone significantly increased the ratio of resorbed /implanted embryo, decreased the level of prl8a2 mRNA and cyclin D3 protein, inhibited the uterine angiogenesis and reduced the numbers of uNK cells, but combined treatment with flutamide markedly decreased the resorbed embryos, increased expressions of prl8a2 mRNA and cyclin D3 protein and angiogenesis and numbers of uNK cells.Flutamide treatment can efficiently ameliorate the hyperandrogenemia-induced the disorders in aspects of decidualization, angiogenesis and uNK cells, which further improve the poor endometrial receptivity in PCOS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2946868891,"CGRP, adrenomedullin (ADM), and adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2) family peptides are important neuropeptides and hormones for the regulation of neurotransmission, vasotone, cardiovascular morphogenesis, vascular integrity, and feto‒placental development. These peptides signal through CLR/RAMP1, 2 and 3 receptor complexes. CLR/RAMP1, or CGRP receptor, antagonists have been developed for the treatment of migraine headache and osteoarthritis pain; whereas CLR/RAMP2, or ADM receptor, antagonists are being developed for the treatment of tumor growth/metastasis. Based on the finding that an acylated chimeric ADM/ADM2 analog potently stimulates CLR/RAMP1 and 2 signaling, we hypothesized that the binding domain of this analog could have potent inhibitory activity on CLR/RAMP receptors. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that acylated truncated ADM/ADM2 analogs of 27–31 residues exhibit potent antagonistic activity toward CLR/RAMP1 and 2. On the other hand, nonacylated analogs have minimal activity. Further truncation at the junctional region of these chimeric analogs led to the generation of CLR/RAMP1-selective antagonists. A 17-amino-acid analog (Antagonist 2–4) showed 100-fold selectivity for CLR/RAMP1 and was >100-fold more potent than the classic CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP8-37. In addition, we showed (1) a lysine residue in the Antagonist 2–4 is important for enhancing the antagonistic activity, (2) an analog consisted of an ADM sequence motif and a 12-amino-acid binding domain of CGRP exhibits potent CLR/RAMP1-inhibitory activity, and (3) a chimeric analog consisted of a somatostatin analog and an ADM antagonist exhibits dual activities on somatostatin and CLR/RAMP receptors. Because the blockage of CLR/RAMP signaling prevents migraine pain and suppresses tumor growth/metastasis, further studies of these analogs, which presumably have better access to the tumor microenvironment and nerve endings at the trigeminal ganglion and synovial joints as compared to antibody-based therapies, may lead to the development of better anti-CGRP therapy and alternative antiangiogenesis therapy. Likewise, the use of bifunctional somatostatin-ADM antagonist analogs could be a promising strategy for the treatment of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors by targeting an antiangiogenesis agent to the neuroendocrine tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2947201845,"Background Whilst there has been extensive study of the mechanisms underlying the regulation for pictures, the ability and the mechanisms beyond the regulation of words remains to be clarified. Similarly, the effect of strategy when applying a regulatory process is still poorly explored. The present study seeks to elucidate these issues comparing the effect of regulation and of strategy to both neutral and emotional words and pictures. Methodology/Principal findings Thirty young adults applied the strategy of distancing to the emotions elicited by unpleasant and neutral pictures and words while their subjective ratings and ERPs were recorded. At a behavioral level, participants successfully regulated the arousal and the valence of both pictures and words. At a neural level, unpleasant pictures produced an increase in the late positive potential modulated during the regulate condition. Unpleasant linguistic stimuli elicited a posterior negativity as compared to neutral stimuli, but no effect of regulation on ERP was detectable. More importantly, the effect of strategy independently of stimulus type, produced a significant larger Stimulus Preceding Negativity. Dipole reconstruction localized this effect in the middle frontal areas of the brain. Conclusions As such, these new psychophysiological findings might help to understand how pictures and words can be regulated by distancing in daily life and clinical contexts, and the neural bases of the effect of strategy for which we suggest an integrative model."
https://openalex.org/W2947353787,"The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to current first-line antibiotic regimens constitutes a major global health threat. New treatments against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are thus eagerly needed in particular in countries with a high MDR-TB prevalence. In this context, macozinone (PBTZ169), a promising drug candidate with an unique mode of action and highly potent in vitro tuberculocidal properties against MDR Mycobacterium strains, has now reached the clinical phase and has been notably tested in healthy male volunteers in Switzerland. To that endeavor, a multiplex UHPLC-MS/MS method has been developed for the sensitive and accurate human plasma levels determination of PBTZ169 along with five metabolites retaining in vitro anti-TB activity. Plasma protein precipitation with methanol was carried out as a simplified sample clean-up procedure followed by direct injection of the undiluted supernatant for the bioanalysis of the six analytes within 5 min, using 1.8 μm reversed-phase chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry employing electrospray ionization in the positive mode. Stable isotopically-labelled PBTZ169 was used as internal standard (ISTD), while metabolites could be reliably quantified using two unlabeled chemical analogues selected as ISTD from a large in-house analogous compounds library. The overall methodology was fully validated according to current recommendations (FDA, EMEA) for bioanalytical methods, which include selectivity, carryover, qualitative and quantitative matrix effect, extraction recovery, process efficiency, trueness, precision, accuracy profiles, method and instrument detection limits, integrity to dilution, anticoagulant comparison and short- and long-term stabilities. Stability studies on the reduced metabolite H2-PBTZ169 have shown no significant impact on the actual PBTZ169 concentrations determined with the proposed assay. This simplified, rapid, sensitive and robust methodology has been applied to the bioanalysis of human plasma samples collected within the frame of a phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers receiving PBTZ169."
https://openalex.org/W2953322693,"To link optic nerve (ON) structural properties to clinical markers of glaucoma using advanced, semi-automated diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography in human glaucoma patients.We characterized optic neuropathy in patients with unilateral advanced-stage glaucoma (n = 6) using probabilistic dMRI tractography and compared their results to those in healthy controls (n = 6).We successfully identified the ONs of glaucoma patients based on dMRI in all patients and confirmed that dMRI measures of the ONs correlated with clinical markers of glaucoma severity. Specifically, we found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the ONs of eyes with advanced, as compared to mild, glaucoma (F(1,10) = 55.474, p < 0.0001, FDR < 0.0005). Furthermore, by comparing the ratios of ON FA in glaucoma patients to those of healthy controls (n = 6), we determined that this difference was beyond that expected from normal anatomical variation (F(1,9) = 20.276, p < 0. 005). Finally, we linked the dMRI measures of ON FA to standard clinical glaucoma measures. ON vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCD) predicted ON FA (F(1,10) = 11.061, p < 0.01, R2 = 0.66), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) predicted ON FA (F(1,10) = 11.477, p < 0.01, R2 = 0.63) and ON FA predicted perceptual deficits (visual field index [VFI]) (F(1,10) = 15.308, p < 0.005, R2 = 0.52).We describe semi-automated methods to detect glaucoma-related structural changes using dMRI and confirm that they correlate with clinical measures of glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2947073159,"Along with the increasing popularity of taekwondo, there is a need of evidence-based talent identification (TID) and development programs based upon profiles of future elite athletes. This study first aims to investigate the differences between elite and non-elite taekwondo athletes in anthropometry, physical performance and motor coordination. The second aim is to demonstrate the applicability of z-scores in TID research. A total of 98 Taekwondo athletes between 12 and 17 years old were tested using a generic test battery consisting of four anthropometrical (Height, Weight, Fat Percentage, BMI), six physical performance (Sit & Reach, Sprint 5m, Sprint 30m, Counter Movement Jump, Squat Jump, Endurance Shuttle Run) and three motor coordination tests (Moving Sideways, Jumping Sideways, Walking Backwards). Based on the individual success at international competition level, 18 were categorised as elite athletes and 80 were considered as non-elite. T-tests (step 1) on raw test scores and MANOVAs on z-scores (step 2) were conducted to examine differences between the elite and non-elite taekwondo athletes for anthropometry, physical performance and motor coordination tests. Finally, z-scores were reconverted to raw scores to demonstrate practical significance for coaches. Overall, elite taekwondo athletes score better compared to the non-elite group. The MANOVA analysis better scores for elites on fat percentage (-0.55 versus 0.12;p = 0.006), BMI (-0.37 versus 0,08;p = 0.067) sprint speed 30m (-0.48 versus 0.11;p = 0.029), counter movement jump (0.79 versus -0.18;p = 0.000), squat jump (0.42 versus -0.11;p = 0.041), moving sideways (0.79 versus -0.18;p = 0.000) and walking backwards (0.54 versus -0.12;p = 0.006). This study confirms our knowledge on physical profiles of elite taekwondo athletes and expands our knowledge to the domain of motor coordination. This study showed how the z-score method can be used to distinguish between elite and non-elite athletes, the former being low in number by definition."
https://openalex.org/W2947478594,"The Luangwa Valley in eastern Zambia is a transverse offshoot of the Great Rift Valley system. This region appears to have an isolating effect as evidenced by suspected endemic subspecies, such as the Cookson’s wildebeest and Thornicroft’s giraffe. Recent mitochondrial DNA studies demonstrated that African lions in Zambia consist of two highly diverse eastern and western sub-populations. Herein, we report nuclear and mitochondrial DNA results from 409 lions that support this population substructure across Zambia but proposes only partial isolation of the Luangwa Valley with more movement between the populations than previously thought. Population assignment analysis identifies two populations with little evidence of admixture assigning lions to either the eastern or western sub-populations. A high occurrence of private alleles and clear evidence for a Wahlund effect further justify the presence of a highly structured population. But, while mitochondrial DNA analysis still shows little to no matrilineal gene flow (FST = 0.53) between sub-populations, microsatellite analysis suggests there is gene flow (FST = 0.04) with low but significant isolation-by-distance and an average of 6 migrants per generation. Evidence of isolation-by-distance is also found in factorial correspondence analysis with the Lower Zambezi National Park and eastern corridor clusters overlapping isolated clusters of the Luangwa Valley and western sub-population. From this evidence, the Luangwa Valley appears separated from the western sub-population with some dispersal through the southern regions of the eastern sub-population. Both the eastern and western sub-populations have high heterozygosity (0.68 and 0.69, respectively) and genetic diversity (0.47 and 0.50, respectively) values, indicative of genetically healthy populations."
https://openalex.org/W2947976343,"Adult intestinal epithelial stem cells are a promising resource for treatment of intestinal epithelial disorders that cause intestinal failure and for intestinal tissue engineering. We developed two different animal models to study the implantation of cultured murine and human intestinal epithelial cells in the less differentiated ""spheroid"" state and the more differentiated ""enteroid"" state into the denuded small intestine of mice. Engraftment of donor cells could not be achieved while the recipient intestine remained in continuity. However, we were able to demonstrate successful implantation of murine and human epithelial cells when the graft segment was in a bypassed loop of jejunum. Implantation of donor cells occurred in a random fashion in villus and crypt areas. Engraftment was observed in 75% of recipients for murine and 36% of recipients for human cells. Engrafted spheroid cells differentiated into the full complement of intestinal epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate for the first time successful engraftment into the small bowel which is optimized in a bypassed loop surgical model."
https://openalex.org/W2950170557,"Different genomic sites evolve inter-dependently due to the combined action of epistasis, defined as a non-multiplicative contribution of alleles at different loci to genome fitness, and the physical linkage of different loci in genome. Both epistasis and linkage, partially compensated by recombination, cause correlations between allele frequencies at the loci (linkage disequilibrium, LD). The interaction and competition between epistasis and linkage are not fully understood, nor is their relative sensitivity to recombination. Modeling an adapting population in the presence of random mutation, natural selection, pairwise epistasis, and random genetic drift, we compare the contributions of epistasis and linkage. For this end, we use a panel of haplotype-based measures of LD and their various combinations calculated for epistatic and non-epistatic pairs separately. We compute the optimal percentages of detected and false positive pairs in a one-time sample of a population of moderate size. We demonstrate that true interacting pairs can be told apart in a sufficiently short genome within a narrow window of time and parameters. Outside of this parameter region, unless the population is extremely large, shared ancestry of individual sequences generates pervasive stochastic LD for non-interacting pairs masking true epistatic associations. In the presence of sufficiently strong recombination, linkage effects decrease faster than those of epistasis, and the detection of epistasis improves. We demonstrate that the epistasis component of locus association can be isolated, at a single time point, by averaging haplotype frequencies over multiple independent populations. These results demonstrate the existence of fundamental restrictions on the protocols for detecting true interactions in DNA sequence sets."
https://openalex.org/W2947365930,"Introduction In 2016, for the very first time, the Ministry of Health in Zambia implemented a reactive outbreak response to control the spread of cholera and vaccinated at-risk populations with a single dose of Shancol—an oral cholera vaccine (OCV). This study aimed to assess the costs of cholera illness and determine the cost-effectiveness of the 2016 vaccination campaign. Methodology From April to June 2017, we conducted a retrospective cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in three peri-urban areas of Lusaka. To estimate costs of illness from a household perspective, a systematic random sample of 189 in-patients confirmed with V. cholera were identified from Cholera Treatment Centre registers and interviewed for out-of-pocket costs. Vaccine delivery and health systems costs were extracted from financial records at the District Health Office and health facilities. The cost of cholera treatment was derived by multiplying the subsidized cost of drugs by the quantity administered to patients during hospitalisation. The cost-effectiveness analysis measured incremental cost-effectiveness ratio—cost per case averted, cost per life saved and cost per DALY averted—for a single dose OCV. Results The mean cost per administered vaccine was US$1.72. Treatment costs per hospitalized episode were US$14.49–US$18.03 for patients ≤15 years old and US$17.66–US$35.16 for older patients. Whereas households incurred costs on non-medical items such as communication, beverages, food and transport during illness, a large proportion of medical costs were borne by the health system. Assuming vaccine effectiveness of 88.9% and 63%, a life expectancy of 62 years and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$1,500, the costs per case averted were estimated US$369–US$532. Costs per life year saved ranged from US$18,515–US$27,976. The total cost per DALY averted was estimated between US$698–US$1,006 for patients ≤15 years old and US$666–US$1,000 for older patients. Conclusion Our study determined that reactive vaccination campaign with a single dose of Shancol for cholera control in densely populated areas of Lusaka was cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2947887973,"Concordance among wetland physicochemical conditions, vegetation, and surrounding land cover may result from the influence of land cover on the sources of plant propagules, on physicochemical conditions, and their subsequent determination of growing conditions. Alternatively, concordance may result if differences in climate, soils, and species pools are spatially confounded with differences in human population density and land conversion. Further, we expect that land cover within catchment boundaries will be more predictive than land cover in symmetrical buffers if runoff is a major pathway. We measured concordance between land cover, wetland vegetation and physicochemical conditions in 48 prairie pothole wetlands, controlling for inter-wetland distance. We contrasted land-cover data collected over a four-year period by multiple extraction approaches including topographically-delineated catchments and nested 30 m to 5,000 m radius buffers. After factoring out inter-wetland distance, physiochemical conditions were significantly concordant with land cover. Vegetation was not significantly concordant with land cover, though it was strongly and significantly concordant with physicochemical conditions. More, concordance was as strong when land cover was extracted from buffers <500 m in radius as from catchments, indicating the mechanism responsible is not topographically constrained. We conclude that local landscape structure does not directly influence wetland vegetation composition, but rather that vegetation depends on 1) physicochemical conditions in the wetland that are affected by surrounding land cover and on 2) regional factors such as the vegetation species pool and geographic gradients in climate, soil type, and land use."
https://openalex.org/W2946950033,"Introduction Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment that reduces mortality and improves cardiac function in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, about 30% of patients passing the current criteria do not benefit or benefit only a little from CRT. Three predictors of benefit based on different ECG properties were compared: 1) “strict” left bundle branch block classification (SLBBB); 2) QRS area; 3) ventricular electrical delay (VED) which defines the septal-lateral conduction delay. These predictors have never been analyzed concurrently. We analyzed the relationship between them on a subset of 602 records from the MADIT-CRT trial. Methods & results SLBBB classification was performed by two experts; QRS area and VED were computed fully automatically. High-frequency QRS (HFQRS) maps were used to inspect conduction abnormalities. The correlation between SLBBB and other predictors was R = 0.613, 0.523 and 0.390 for VED, QRS area in Z lead, and QRS duration, respectively. Scatter plots were used to pick up disagreement between the predictors. The majority of SLBBB subjects– 295 of 330 (89%)–are supposed to respond positively to CRT according to the VED and QRS area, though 93 of 272 (34%) non-SLBBB should also benefit from CRT according to the VED and QRS area. Conclusion SLBBB classification is limited by the proper setting of cut-off values. In addition, it is too “strict” and excludes patients that may benefit from CRT therapy. QRS area and VED are clearly defined parameters. They may be used to optimize biventricular stimulation. Detailed analysis of conduction irregularities with CRT optimization should be based on HFQRS maps."
https://openalex.org/W2947940654,"Previously, we have reported that spherical particles (SPs) are formed by the thermal remodeling of rigid helical virions of native tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) at 94°C. SPs have remarkable features: stability, unique adsorption properties and immunostimulation potential. Here we performed a comparative study of the amino acid composition of the SPs and virions surface to characterize their properties and take an important step to understanding the structure of SPs. The results of tritium planigraphy showed that thermal transformation of TMV leads to a significant increase in tritium label incorporation into the following sites of SPs protein: 41-71 а.a. and 93-122 a.a. At the same time, there was a decrease in tritium label incorporation into the N- and C- terminal region (1-15 a.a., 142-158 a.a). The use of complementary physico-chemical methods allowed us to carry out a detailed structural analysis of the surface and to determine the most likely surface areas of SPs. The obtained data make it possible to consider viral protein thermal rearrangements, and to open new opportunities for biologically active complex design using information about SPs surface amino acid composition and methods of non-specific adsorption and bioconjugation."

We focus (1) on the innate immune system cell count: monocytes, eosinophil granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes, neutrophil granulocytes; and thrombocytes; and (2) on the adaptive immune system cell count: lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells). Moods were measured on the positive (PA) and negative (NA) dimensions of the PANAS scale, divided in four groups based on their PA and NA median scores: hedonic, positive mood, negative mood and anhedonic. We focus further on (3) thyroid cells: T3 and T4; and (4) on social support. We found significant differences between mood groups and mean cell counts for basophilic granulocytes and thrombocytes but not for monocytes, eosinophil granulocytes and neutrophil granulocytes in the innate immune system. However, in the adaptive immune system we found mean lymphocyte cell counts to be different in all four mood groups. We also found that T3 and T4 levels differ significantly across all mood groups and work in very close association with lymphocytes to activate the adaptive immune system. These differences were most significant in the hedonic and anhedonic groups. The findings allow us to better understand mood groups, especially the hedonic and anhedonic groups, and open up new avenues for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2947323502,"Humans have a lower risk of death from myocardial infarction (MI) living at low elevations (<2500 m), which are not high enough to induce hypoxia. Both chronic hypoxia pre-MI, achieved by altitude simulation >5000 m, and intermittent hypobaric hypoxia post-MI can reduce MI size in rodents, and it is believed that hypoxia is the key stimulus. To explore mechanisms beyond hypoxia we studied whether altitude simulation <2500 m would also be associated with reduced infarct size. We performed left-anterior descending artery ligation on C57BL6 mice. Control mice (n = 12) recovered at 754 mmHg (atmospheric pressure, control), and treatment group mice (n = 13) were placed in a hypobaric chamber to recover 3-hours daily at 714 mmHg for 1 week. Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular function was performed on Day 0, Day 1 and Day 8. Intermittent hypobaric treatment was associated with a 14.2±5.3% improvement in ejection fraction for treatment group mice (p<0.01 vs. Day 1), with no change observed in control mice. Cardiac output, stroke volume, and infarct size were also improved in treated mice, but no changes were observed in HIF-1 activation or neovascularization. Next, we studied the acute hemodynamic effects of low altitude stimulation in intact mice breathing 100% oxygen using left ventricular catheterization and recording of pressure-volume loops. Acute reductions in barometric pressure from 754 mmHg to 714 mmHg and 674 mmHg were associated with reduced systemic vascular resistance, increased stroke volume and cardiac output, and no change in blood pressure or heart rate. Ex-vivo vascular function was studied using murine mesenteric artery segments. Acute reductions in barometric pressure were associated with greater vascular distensibility. We conclude that intermittent hypobaric treatment using simulated altitudes <2500 m reduces infarct size and increases ventricular function post-MI, and that these changes are related to altered arterial function and not hypoxia-associated neovascularization."

Depressive symptoms are independent predictors of δ and are thereby implicated as “dementing”. Serum resistin levels partially mediate the association between depressive symptoms and δ. We use a novel “off-diagonal” CHI SQ algorithm to demonstrate our ability to select individuals demented solely by depression’s effect in both the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) (N ≌ 3,500), and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI (N ≌ 1,750), and demonstrate the higher resistin levels of such cases in TARCC.

https://openalex.org/W2947926324,"While physical activity reduces risk of developing myocardial infarction (MI), it is unknown whether a history of physical activity is also protective of fatal arrhythmia and case-fatality in patients who have suffered an acute MI.104,801 individuals included in 2003-2014 in the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS), a prospective population-based study with self-reported leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in three categories measured at baseline, were followed until 2014 through national registries. The 1,517 individuals who suffered a first time MI during follow-up constituted the study population. Outcomes were fatal MI, defined as date of death same as date of MI (including out-of-hospital deaths) and 28-day fatality. Through multivariable analyses the association between baseline LTPA and outcomes were assessed adjusted for CVD risk factors.Of 1,517 MI events, 117 (7.7%) were fatal and another 79 (5.6%) lead to death within 28 days. Median time from baseline to MI was 3.6 years (IQR 1.7-5.8). LTPA was associated with lower risk of fatal MI with odds ratios of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22-0.73) for light and 0.41 (0.22-0.76) for moderate/high LTPA after multivariable adjustment with sedentary LTPA as reference. Age, alcohol-intake, education and smoking were identified as other predictors for fatal MI. We found no association between LTPA and 28-day case fatality.Among individuals with MI, those that have engaged in any light or moderate physical activity were more likely to survive their MI. Results are consistent with effect of exercise preconditioning on risk of fatal arrhythmia."
https://openalex.org/W2949608527,"Mannitol, a sugar alcohol used in commercial food products, has been previously shown to induce sex-biased mortality in female Drosophila melanogaster when ingested at a single concentration (1 M). We hypothesized that sex differences in energy needs, related to reproductive costs, contributed to the increased mortality we observed in females compared to males. To test this, we compared the longevity of actively mating and non-mating flies fed increasing concentrations of mannitol. We also asked whether mannitol-induced mortality was concentration-dependent for both males and females, and if mannitol’s sex-biased effects were consistent across concentrations. Females and males both showed concentration-dependent increases in mortality, but female mortality was consistently higher at concentrations of 0.75 M and above. Additionally, fly longevity decreased further for both sexes when housed in mixed sex vials as compared to single sex vials. This suggests that the increased energetic demands of mating and reproduction for both sexes increased the ingestion of mannitol. Finally, larvae raised on mannitol produced expected adult sex ratios, suggesting that sex-biased mortality due to the ingestion of mannitol occurs only in adults. We conclude that sex and reproductive status differences in mannitol ingestion drive sex-biased differences in adult fly mortality."

In addition, we provide proof of a recent conclusion that all carotenoid-containing droplets contain a mixture of all carotenoids present, rather than only a subset of them-a conclusion that diverges from the previously-held view. Our results have implications for the mechanism(s) giving rise to these carotenoid mixtures in the differently-coloured droplets."

Even in patients diagnosed at an early stage, characteristics of disease progression remain heterogeneous. Up-to-date molecular classifications stratify the ccRCC samples into two clusters. We analyzed gene expression in 23 T1 or T3 ccRCC samples. Unsupervised clustering divided this group into three clusters, two of them contained pure T1 or T3 samples while one contained a mixed group. We defined a group of 36 genes that discriminate the mixed cluster. This gene set could be associated with tumor classification into a higher stage and it contained significant number of genes coding for molecular transporters, channel and transmembrane proteins. External data from TCGA used to test our findings confirmed that the expression levels of those 36 genes varied significantly between T1 and T3 tumors. In conclusion, we found a clustering pattern of gene expression, informative for heterogeneity among T1 and T3 tumors of clear cell renal cell carcinoma."

However, relatively little is known about the natural history of D. melanogaster. In particular, neither the natural predators faced by wild populations of D. melanogaster, nor the anti-predatory behaviors they may employ to escape and avoid their enemies have been documented. Here we observe and describe the influence of two predators that differ in their mode of hunting: zebra jumping spiders, Salticus scenicus (active hunters) and Chinese praying mantids, Tenodera sinensis (ambush predators) on the behavioral repertoire of Drosophila melanogaster. We documented three particularly interesting behaviors: abdominal lifting, stopping, and retreat—which were performed at higher frequency by D. melanogaster in the presence of predators. While mantids had only a modest influence on the locomotory activity of D. melanogaster, we observed a significant increase in the overall activity of D. melanogaster in the presence of jumping spiders. Finally, we observed considerable among-individual behavioral variation in response to both predators."
https://openalex.org/W2947352312,"Background The Option B+ strategy streamlines delivery of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant women, but concerns remain about ART treatment adherence and long term outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of HIV-positive, postpartum breastfeeding women receiving ART via Option B+ in Nairobi, Kenya. The primary outcome was virologic failure in plasma (HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL), and detection in breast milk (>150 copies/mL) and endocervical secretions (>100 copies/mL) at 2 postpartum timepoints. Correlates of virologic failure were assessed using univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression. Results Of 42 women at 6–14 weeks postpartum, 21.4% of women had HIV RNA detected in plasma; 14.3% in breast milk, and 23.7% in endocervical secretions. At 18–24 weeks postpartum, the percentages were 21.1%, 7.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Younger maternal age, intent to breastfeed for longer, and later ART start in pregnancy were significantly associated with plasma virologic failure (p < 0.05 for each). Odds of plasma virologic failure at 6–14 weeks postpartum were 1.25 times higher (95% CI 1.04, 1.51) for each increase in week of gestation at ART initiation. Only 3 women had resistance mutations to their regimen. Conclusions Despite months of ART, nearly one-quarter of the women in our cohort did not achieve plasma virologic suppression in the postpartum period. After adjusting for time on ART, earlier ART initiation in pregnancy was significantly associated with plasma suppression. Our findings suggest that postpartum HIV RNA monitoring in Option B+ programs will be needed to achieve elimination of MTCT."

Even after two decades of universal salt iodization (USI) implementation, the efficacy of USI has not been reported in high risk groups in vulnerable regions in Ghana. We aimed to assess and improve ID status in childbearing age women (all lactating women) and their toddlers in northern Ghana, a geographically and socioeconomically vulnerable region. We provided weekly supply of household iodized salt and community-based feeding of native Hibiscus Sabdariffaa leaves meal (HSM) prepared with iodized salt to women and their toddlers in intervention (n = 60) vs. control group (n = 60). At baseline, ID was prevalent in women (36%) and their toddlers (29%). For women, both median UIC values for intervention (57.4 ug/l) and control group (65.1 ug/l) were below the recommended UIC value of 100 ug/l with no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.2778). At the endpoint, median UIC for the intervention group (123.6 ug/l) was significantly higher (p = 0.008) than the control group (59.7 ug/l). Our results suggest that weekly supply of iodized salt along with the feeding HSM is an effective channel for improving iodine status of economically disadvantaged groups in communities remote from coastal lands. Furthermore, our results suggest that decreased median UIC among lactating mothers does not necessarily imply lower iodine status for their breastfed toddlers. And finally, the observed median UIC<100 ug/l may point to a non-improvement in iodine status for the past decade for Ghana. There is a need to revisit, assess, and ascertain the challenges in preventing populations from attaining the intended benefits of the USI policy in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2947356398,"Nitrogen additions are known to elicit variable responses in semi-arid ecosystems, with responses increasing with precipitation. The response of semi-arid ecosystems to nitrogen are important to understand due to their large spatial extent worldwide and the global trend of increasingly available nitrogen. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a single nitrogen addition pulse on a semi-arid big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystem in western Wyoming. This is important given that sagebrush ecosystems are poorly understood, despite their prevalence in the western US. In addition, large-scale nitrogen additions have begun on sagebrush landscapes in Wyoming in order to mitigate population declines in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The study objectives were (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a nitrogen fertilization pulse in increasing sagebrush biomass and forage quality, and (2) to assess effects of nitrogen addition on soil biogeochemistry and vegetation community structure. We fertilized 15 plots across 5 locations in western Wyoming using a single pulse of urea (5.5g N m-2). In addition, we immobilized available nitrogen through surface hay treatments (250g hay/m2). Nitrogen additions failed to increase growth of sagebrush, alter nitrogen content of sagebrush leaders, or alter greenhouse gas efflux from soils. The plant community also remained unchanged; total cover, species richness, and community composition were all unaffected by our treatment application. Over the two years of this study, we did not find indications of nitrogen limitation of ecosystem processes, despite a wet growing season in 2014. Thus, we have found a general lack of response to nitrogen in sagebrush ecosystems and no treatment effect of a single pulse of N to sagebrush biomass or forage quality."
https://openalex.org/W2947855212,"Purpose To assess the physiology of the retina by electroretinography (ERG) with skin electrodes in eyes that had undergone vitrectomy with silicone oil (SO) tamponade. Design Retrospective case series. Method ERGs were recorded from eleven eyes with complex vitreoretinal disorders and from the normal fellow eyes. The affected eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with SO tamponade. ERGs were recorded before and after the SO was removed. The amplitudes and implicit times of the a- and b-waves of the affected eyes were compared to those of the normal fellow eyes. In addition, the ratios of the amplitudes of the b-waves of the affected eyes to those of the fellow eyes were compared before and after the SO was removed. Results ERGs were recordable from 7 eyes (63.6%) before the SO was removed and 11 eyes (100%) after the SO was removed. The a- and b-wave amplitudes were significantly smaller in the affected eyes than those of the fellow eyes at the baseline. The b-wave amplitude before the removal of the SO was significantly and positively correlated with that after the SO removal. The ratios of the b-waves of the affected/normal fellow eye significantly increased after the SO was removed. Conclusion The results indicate that ERGs picked up by skin electrode can be used to assess the physiology of the retina in eyes with a SO tamponade. The amplitude of the b-waves of the ERGs in silicone-filled eyes can be used to predict the amplitude after the silicone is removed."
https://openalex.org/W2947082618,"Background Childhood amnesia in adults can be defined as the relative paucity of autobiographical memories from the first years of life. An earlier study by Wessel, Schweig and Huntjens demonstrated that ‘how’ we ask for an earliest memory may bias adults’ estimations of when the earliest childhood memory actually happened. They suggested that snapshot memories (i.e., mental pictures) were less sensitive to an age manipulation than event memories (i.e. narratives). We aimed at replicating and extending these findings using a Dutch community sample stratified for age, gender and educational level. Method Participants (N = 619) were randomized into one of three experimental conditions. Prior to recalling their earliest memory, participants in the early and late conditions were presented with examples referring to memories from age 1–2 or 5–6, respectively. The example memories in the control group did not contain any age cues. Participants reported the estimated age in their earliest memory and their strategy for arriving at this estimate. They also rated their memory’s phenomenology (e.g. vividness). Independent judges rated memory type (e.g., snapshot memories). Results Compared to the control group, participants in the early condition estimated the age in their memory to be significantly earlier. The difference between the late and control conditions was too small to be of interest. We did not observe a statistically significant interaction between memory type and condition. Snapshot memories were from a younger age than event memories and showed differences with respect to phenomenology (e.g., emotional intensity). Conclusion The results of this community study replicate earlier findings that instructions including age cues influence estimates of age in earliest memories. Although snapshot and event memories seem to be qualitatively different, the idea that they respond differently to an age manipulation could not be corroborated."

I went through my upcoming oral presentation in my head as my 4-year-old ran ahead, searching for our seats. We have traveled together as a dynamic duo ever since my baby was 3 months old, when we set off to Brazil to attend a conference and conduct fieldwork. I am a nontenured researcher looking for a permanent academic position, and travel is crucial for building my reputation and CV. But this trip would be our last for a while, because paying for my child's travel has rendered me a bankrupt botanist.

> “Paying for my child's travel has rendered me a bankrupt botanist.” 

As a single parent with no family members nearby, I have no alternative but to bring my child with me when I travel for work—and to pay for it out of my own pocket. The expenses add up quickly, including airfare, child care, and increased food costs relative to what we would spend at home.

For years, I decided it was worth it. I need to do fieldwork to keep my career going. By giving seminars, presenting at conferences, and participating in working groups, I raise my profile with potential employers and—I hope—improve my chance of landing a permanent position. So, when potential trips came up, I usually took them.

But the costs have started to become untenable. To have enough money to pay for rent, groceries, and other necessities, I have become very particular about which opportunities I accept. I've had to decline invitations to give seminars at major institutions and keynote presentations at conferences because the trips would have been too expensive. I can only say yes when an opportunity is too good to turn down and the travel will be relatively affordable. I recently traveled to Germany to participate in a working group—a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend 4 days with eminent people in my field discussing a new data set and novel ways to analyze it. It was a tremendous experience, and I'm glad I went. But my child and I ate simple meals for weeks afterward to offset what I spent to participate.

Support for dependent travel is simply too rare. Some institutions, particularly U.S. universities, offer grants for this purpose. Last year, I was thrilled to win a €500 “attendance aid grant” offered by the European Society for Evolutionary Biology for its meetings, which covered my child's airfare and child care at the conference. But I have not been able to find any other similar grants or support that I can apply for—from funding agencies, scientific societies, or my institution.

On the bright side, free or subsidized child care seems to be getting slightly more common, at least in my field. At the recent working group in Germany and the conference in Spain, free child care was available for anyone who needed it—essential support that made my participation possible. On another occasion, when I said I would have to turn down an invitation to give a lecture because the travel would be too expensive, the organizers offered free child care for the day, which made it feasible for me to attend.

But child care is only one piece of the puzzle. More universities, funding agencies, scientific societies, and conference organizers should offer grants and other support mechanisms for parents and other caretakers who incur additional expenses for work-related travel. I acknowledge that resources are limited, and I fully understand the pushback these types of proposals can elicit. Why should hard-won money go to paying for my child's travel? Why should my family be treated differently than any other, in academia or in any workplace? My response is that if academics like me are not supported, we will continue to hit the “glass ceiling,” fall through the “gender sieve,” or whatever else you want to call it. Making science equitable is not about giving everyone the same opportunities; it's about supporting the needs of individual scientists so that we all can thrive.
