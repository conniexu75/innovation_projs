https://openalex.org/W3118613563,"University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes-such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic-the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts.Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students.Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously.Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students' mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education."
https://openalex.org/W3118450710,"Background Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology and progression of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) by removing the pathogenic cytokines is hypothesized to dampen CRS. Objective To evaluate the outcomes of the patients with COVID-19 having CRS being treated with TPE compared to controls on the standard of care. Methodology Retrospective propensity score-matched analysis in a single centre from 1st April to 31st July 2020. We retrospectively analyzed data of 280 hospitalized patients developing CRS initially. PSM was used to minimize bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. Using PSM 1:1, 90 patients were selected and assigned to 2 equal groups. Forced matching was done for disease severity, routine standard care and advanced supportive care. Many other Co-variates were matched. Primary outcome was 28 days overall survival. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, CRS resolution time and timing of viral clearance on Polymerase chain reaction testing. Results After PS-matching, the selected cohort had a median age of 60 years (range 32–73 in TPE, 37–75 in controls), p = 0.325 and all were males. Median symptoms duration was 7 days (range 3–22 days’ TPE and 3–20 days controls), p = 0.266. Disease severity in both groups was 6 (6.6%) moderate, 40 (44.4%) severe and 44 (49%) critical. Overall, 28-day survival was significantly superior in the TPE group (91.1%), 95% CI 78.33–97.76; as compared to PS-matched controls (61.5%), 95% CI 51.29–78.76 (log rank 0.002), p&lt;0.001. Median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the TPE treated group (10 days vs 15 days) (p&lt; 0.01). CRS resolution time was also significantly reduced in the TPE group (6 days vs. 12 days) (p&lt; 0.001). In 71 patients who underwent TPE, the mortality was 0 (n = 43) if TPE was done within the first 12 days of illness while it was 17.9% (deaths 5, n = 28 who received it after 12 th day (p = 0.0045). Conclusion An earlier use of TPE was associated with improved overall survival, early CRS resolution and time to discharge compared to SOC for COVID-19 triggered CRS in this selected cohort of PS-matched male patients from one major hospital in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3118616268,"The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test whether a commercially available, mindfulness meditation mobile app, (i.e., Calm app), was effective in reducing fatigue (primary outcome), pre-sleep arousal, and daytime sleepiness (secondary outcomes) in adults with sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index Score &gt;10) as compared to a wait-list control group. Associations between the use of the Calm app (i.e., adherence to the intervention) and changes in sleep quality was also explored in the intervention group only. Adults with sleep disturbance were recruited (N = 640). Eligible and consenting participants (N = 263) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 124) or a wait-list control (n = 139) group. Intervention participants were asked to meditate using the Calm app ≥10 minutes/day for eight weeks. Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, mid- (4-weeks) and post-intervention (8-weeks) in both groups, whereas sleep quality was evaluated only in the intervention group. Findings from intent-to-treat analyses suggest the use of the Calm app for eight weeks significantly decreased daytime fatigue (p = .018) as well as daytime sleepiness (p = .003) and cognitive (p = .005) and somatic (p &lt; .001) pre-sleep arousal as compared to the wait-list control group. Within the intervention group, use of the Calm app was associated with improvements in sleep quality (p &lt; .001). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the Calm app can be used to treat fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance. Given that the Calm app is affordable and widely accessible, these data have implications for community level dissemination of a mobile app to improve sleep-related symptoms associated with sleep disturbance.

https://openalex.org/W3121123283,"The current pandemic outbreak of the novel COVID-19, which originated from Wuhan in China in late 2019, has eventually spread to six continents with a rising toll of death cases. No vaccine has yet been developed for COVID-19. The compliance of the general public with the advice and regulations of the health authorities and the adoption of effective health behavior regimens are currently the only weapons to effectively cope with the disease. Here we report the results of a worldwide survey (n = 953) conducted between March 2 and March 14, 2020 that sought (a) to identify critical proximal predictors of health behavior relevant to the current situation, (b) to examine their relationships to various demographic characteristics of the population, (c) and to provide a model of health behavior specific to COVID-19. We found that the perceived severity of the disease and susceptibility to it, emotional reactions, and attitudes toward COVID-19 predicted one-third of the preventive behavior variance. Various demographic variables influenced these predictors. Based on the data collected, we constructed, using path analysis, a theoretical model of health behavior. Our results emphasize the need to consider the impact of antecedent variables on actual precautionary behavior and the influence of demographic factors on these antecedent variables. Understanding the complex interplay of these precursors in health behavior will maximize their beneficial role, eliminate maladaptive prevention patterns, and facilitate the eradication of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3120982794,"Rangelands cover around half of the planet’s land mass and provide vital ecosystem services to over a quarter of humanity. The Himalayan rangelands, part of a global biodiversity hotspot is among the most threatened regions in the world. In rangelands of many developing nations policies banning grazing in protected areas is common practice. In 1998, the Indian state of Sikkim, in the Eastern Himalaya, enacted a grazing ban in response to growing anthropogenic pressure in pastures and forests that was presumably leading to degradation of biodiversity. Studies from the region demonstrate the grazing ban has had some beneficial results in the form of increased carbon stocks and regeneration of some species of conservation value but the ban also resulted in negative outcomes such as reduced household incomes, increase in monocultures in lowlands, decreased manure production in a state that exclusively practices organic farming, spread of gregarious species, and a perceived increase in human wildlife conflict. This paper explores the impact of the traditional pastoral system on high elevation plant species in Lachen valley, one of the few regions of Sikkim where the grazing ban was not implemented. Experimental plots were laid in along an elevation gradient in grazed and ungrazed areas. Ungrazed areas are part of pastures that have been fenced off (preventing grazing) for over a decade and used by the locals for hay formation. I quantified plant species diversity (Species richness, Shannon index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) and ecosystem function (above ground net primary productivity ANPP). The difference method using movable exlosure cages was used in grazing areas to account for plant ANPP eaten and regrowth between grazing periods). The results demonstrate that grazing significantly contributes to greater plant species diversity (Species richness, Shannon index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) and ecosystem function (using above ground net primary productivity as an indicator). The multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) pointed to significant differences in plant species assemblages in grazed and ungrazed areas. Further, ecosystem function is controlled by grazing, rainfall and elevation. Thus, the traditional transhumant pastoral system may enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function. I argue that a complete restriction of open grazing meet neither conservation nor socioeconomic goals. Evidence based policies are required to conserve the rich and vulnerable biodiversity of the region."
https://openalex.org/W3118930884,"Fruit quality attributes are important factors for designing a market for agricultural goods and commodities. Support vector regression (SVR), MLR, and ANN models were established to predict the mass of ber fruits (Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk.) based on the axial dimensions of the fruit from manual measurements of fruit length, minor fruit diameter, and maximum fruit diameter of four ber cultivars. The precision and accuracy of the established models were assessed given their predicted values. The results revealed that using the validation dataset, the developed ANN (R 2 = 0.9771; root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.8479 g) and SVR (R 2 = 0.9947; RMSE = 1.8814 g) models produced better results when predicting ber fruit mass than those obtained by the MLR model (R 2 = 0.4614; RMSE = 11.3742 g). In estimating ber fruit mass, the established SVR and ANN models produced more precise prediction values than those produced by the MLR model; however, the performance differences between the SVR and ANN models were not clear."
https://openalex.org/W3118604430,"Background Anaemia is a significant public health problem in most South-Asian countries, causing increased maternal and child mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with anaemia in women of reproductive age in Bangladesh, Maldives, and Nepal. Methods We used the nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys Program data collected from women of reproductive age (15–49 years) in 2011 in Bangladesh (n = 5678), 2016 in Maldives (n = 6837), and 2016 in Nepal (n = 6419). Anaemia was categorized as mild (haemoglobin [Hb] of 10.0–10.9 g/dL for pregnant women and 11.0–11.9 g/dL for non-pregnant women), moderate (Hb of 7.0–9.9 g/dL for pregnant women and 8.0–10.9 g/dL for non-pregnant women), and severe (Hb &lt;7.0 g/dL for pregnant women and &lt; 8.0 g/dL for non-pregnant women). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with anaemia. Results The prevalence of anaemia was 41.8% in Bangladesh, 58.5% in Maldives, and 40.6% in Nepal. In Bangladesh, postpartum amenorrhoeic, non-educated, and pregnant women were more likely to have moderate/severe anaemia compared to women who were menopausal, had secondary education, and were not pregnant, respectively. In Maldives, residence in urban areas, underweight, having undergone female sterilization, current pregnancy, and menstruation in the last six weeks were associated with increased odds of moderate/severe anaemia. In Nepal, factors associated with increased odds of moderate/severe anaemia were having undergone female sterilization and current pregnancy. Conclusion Anaemia remains a significant public health issue among 15-49-year-old women in Bangladesh, Maldives, and Nepal, which requires urgent attention. Effective policies and programmes for the control and prevention of anaemia should take into account the unique factors associated with anaemia identified in each country. In all three countries, strategies for the prevention and control of anaemia should particularly focus on women who are pregnant, underweight, or have undergone sterilization."
https://openalex.org/W3120909841,"Background The clinical efficiency of laser treatments is limited by the low penetration of visible light used in certain procedures like photodynamic therapy (PDT). Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) PDT is an innovative technique to overcome this limitation that enables the use of Near Infrared (NIR) light instead of visible light. NIR frequency bands present an optical window for deeper penetration into biological tissue. In this research, we compare the penetration depths of 405 and 808 nm continuous wave (CW) lasers and 808 nm pulsed wave (PW) laser in two different modes (high and low frequency). Methods Increasing thicknesses of beef and chicken tissue samples were irradiated under CW and PW lasers to determine penetration depths. Results The 808 nm CW laser penetrates 2.3 and 2.4 times deeper than the 405 nm CW laser in beef and chicken samples, respectively. 808 nm PW (pulse frequency—500 Hz) penetrates deeper than CW laser at the same wavelength. Further, increasing the pulse frequency achieves higher penetration depths. High frequency 808 nm PW (pulse frequency—71.4 MHz) penetrates 7.4- and 6.0-times deeper than 405 nm CW laser in chicken and beef, respectively. Conclusions The results demonstrate the higher penetration depths of high frequency PW laser compared to low frequency PW laser, CW laser of the same wavelength and CW laser with half the wavelength. The results indicate that integrating SHG in the PDT process along with pulsed NIR light may allow the treatment of 6–7 times bigger tumours than conventional PDT using blue light."
https://openalex.org/W3118271640,"Background &amp; aims Limited understanding of the role for specific macrophage subsets in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury is a barrier to advancing medical therapy. Macrophages have previously been implicated in both the mal-adaptive and protective responses in obstructive cholestasis. Recently two macrophage subsets were identified in non-diseased human liver; however, no studies to date fully define the heterogeneous macrophage subsets during the pathogenesis of cholestasis. Here, we aim to further characterize the transcriptional profile of macrophages in pediatric cholestatic liver disease. Methods We isolated live hepatic immune cells from patients with biliary atresia (BA), Alagille syndrome (ALGS), and non-cholestatic pediatric liver by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence, we characterized cholestatic macrophages. We next compared the transcriptional profile of pediatric cholestatic and non-cholestatic macrophage populations to previously published data on normal adult hepatic macrophages. Results We identified 3 distinct macrophage populations across cholestatic liver samples and annotated them as lipid-associated macrophages, monocyte-like macrophages, and adaptive macrophages based on their transcriptional profile. Immunofluorescence of liver tissue using markers for each subset confirmed their presence across BA (n = 6) and ALGS (n = 6) patients. Cholestatic macrophages demonstrated reduced expression of immune regulatory genes as compared to normal hepatic macrophages and were distinct from macrophage populations defined in either healthy adult or pediatric non-cholestatic liver. Conclusions We are the first to perform single-cell RNA sequencing on human pediatric cholestatic liver and identified three macrophage subsets with distinct transcriptional signatures from healthy liver macrophages. Further analyses will identify similarities and differences in these macrophage sub-populations across etiologies of cholestatic liver disease. Taken together, these findings may allow for future development of targeted therapeutic strategies to reprogram macrophages to an immune regulatory phenotype and reduce cholestatic liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W3118902860,"In this study, we created a dataset of a continuous three-year 18S metabarcoding survey to identify eukaryotic parasitoids, and potential connections to hosts at the Long-Term Ecological Research station Helgoland Roads. The importance of parasites and parasitoids for food web dynamics has previously been recognized mostly in terrestrial and freshwater systems, while marine planktonic parasitoids have been understudied in comparison to those. Therefore, the occurrence and role of parasites and parasitoids remains mostly unconsidered in the marine environment. We observed high abundances and diversity of parasitoid operational taxonomic units in our dataset all year round. While some parasitoid groups were present throughout the year and merely fluctuated in abundances, we also detected a succession of parasitoid groups with peaks of individual species only during certain seasons. Using co-occurrence and patterns of seasonal occurrence, we were able to identify known host-parasitoid dynamics, however identification of new potential host-parasitoid interactions was not possible due to their high dynamics and variability in the dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3119269435,"Background Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most important tick-borne viral disease in Eurasia and causes disease in humans and in a number of animals, among them dogs and horses. There is still no good correlation between tick numbers, weather conditions and human cases. There is the hypothesis that co-feeding due to simultaneous occurrence of larvae and nymphs may be a factor for the increased transmission of the virus in nature and for human disease. Based on long-term data from a natural TBEV focus, phylogenetic results and meteorological data we sought to challenge this hypothesis. Methods Ticks from an identified TBE natural focus were sampled monthly from 04/2009 to 12/2018. Ticks were identified and pooled. Pools were tested by RT-qPCR. Positive pools were confirmed by virus isolation and/or sequencing of additional genes (E gene, NS2 gene). Temperature data such as the decadal (10-day) mean daily maximum air temperature (DMDMAT) were obtained from a nearby weather station and statistical correlations between tick occurrence and minimal infection rates (MIR) were calculated. Results In the study period from 04/2009 to 12/2018 a total of 15,530 ticks (2,226 females, 2,268 males, 11,036 nymphs) were collected. The overall MIR in nymphs over the whole period was 77/15,530 (0.49%), ranging from 0.09% (2009) to 1.36% (2015). The overall MIR of female ticks was 0.76% (17/2,226 ticks), range 0.14% (2013) to 3.59% (2016). The overall MIR of males was 0.57% (13/2,268 ticks), range from 0.26% (2009) to 0.97% (2015). The number of nymphs was statistically associated with a later start of spring/vegetation period, indicated by the onset of forsythia flowering. Conclusion There was no particular correlation between DMDMAT dynamics in spring and/or autumn and the MIR of nymphs or adult ticks detected. However, there was a positive correlation between the number of nymphs and the number of reported human TBE cases in the following months, but not in the following year. The hypothesis of the importance of co-feeding of larvae and nymphs for the maintenance of transmission cycle of TBEV in nature is not supported by our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3119627509,"Introduction Dengue fever is the most prevalent arboviral disease in the Brazilian Amazon and places a major health, social and economic burden on the region. Its association with deforestation is largely unknown, yet the clearing of tropical rainforests has been linked to the emergence of several infectious diseases, including yellow fever and malaria. This study aimed to explore potential drivers of dengue emergence in the Brazilian Amazon with a focus on deforestation. Methods An ecological study design using municipality-level secondary data from the Amazonas state between 2007 and 2017 (reported rural dengue cases, incremental deforestation, socioeconomic characteristics, healthcare and climate factors) was employed. Data were transformed according to the year with the most considerable deforestation. Associations were explored using bivariate analysis and a multivariate generalised linear model. Results During the study period 2007–2017, both dengue incidence and deforestation increased. Bivariate analysis revealed increased incidences for some years after deforestation (e.g. mean difference between dengue incidence before and three years after deforestation was 55.47 cases per 100,000, p = 0.002), however, there was no association between the extent of deforestation and dengue incidence. Using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for socioeconomic, climate and healthcare factors, deforestation was not found to be related to dengue incidence. Access to healthcare was found to be the only significant predictor of dengue incidence. Discussion Previous research has shown that deforestation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases. However, no significant dose-response relationships between dengue incidence and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonas state were found in this study. The finding that access to healthcare was the only significant predictor of dengue incidence suggests that incidence may be more dependent on surveillance than transmission. Further research and public attention are needed to better understand environmental effects on human health and to preserve the world’s largest rainforest."
https://openalex.org/W3119723952,"Purpose COVID-19 pandemic has multifaceted presentations with rising evidence of immune-mediated mechanisms underplay. We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. Materials and methods Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. Results Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds."
https://openalex.org/W3120801029,"Social isolation has affected a large number of people and may lead to impairment of physical and mental health. Although stress resulting from social isolation may increase cancer progression, its interference on tumorigenesis is poorly known. In this study, we used a preclinical model to evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on chemically induced oral carcinogenesis. Sixty-two 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into isolated and grouped groups. After 90 days of age, the rats from both groups underwent oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) for 20 weeks. All rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior and euthanized for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis and measurement of inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Social isolation stress increased the OSCC occurrence by 20.4% when compared to control. Isolated rats also showed higher tumor volume and cachexia than the grouped rats. Social isolation did not induce changes in the depressive-like behavior after carcinogenic induction. Tumors from stressed rats had increased levels of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and MCP-1. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the large tumors from isolated animals. Higher tumor levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL1-beta and MCP-1 were positively correlated with OSCC growth. This study provides the first evidence that social isolation stress may facilitate OSCC occurrence and tumor progression, an event accompanied by increased local levels of inflammatory mediators."
https://openalex.org/W3120676157,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) allows individuals to control an external device by controlling their own brain activity, without requiring bodily or muscle movements. Performing voluntary movements is associated with the experience of agency (“sense of agency”) over those movements and their outcomes. When people voluntarily control a BMI, they should likewise experience a sense of agency. However, using a BMI to act presents several differences compared to normal movements. In particular, BMIs lack sensorimotor feedback, afford lower controllability and are associated with increased cognitive fatigue. Here, we explored how these different factors influence the sense of agency across two studies in which participants learned to control a robotic hand through motor imagery decoded online through electroencephalography. We observed that the lack of sensorimotor information when using a BMI did not appear to influence the sense of agency. We further observed that experiencing lower control over the BMI reduced the sense of agency. Finally, we observed that the better participants controlled the BMI, the greater was the appropriation of the robotic hand, as measured by body-ownership and agency scores. Results are discussed based on existing theories on the sense of agency in light of the importance of BMI technology for patients using prosthetic limbs."
https://openalex.org/W3118446228,"Miscanthus is a close relative of Saccharum and a potentially valuable genetic resource for improving sugarcane. Differences in flowering time within and between Miscanthus and Saccharum hinders intra- and interspecific hybridizations. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted over three years to determine how to synchronize flowering time of Saccharum and Miscanthus genotypes. We found that day length was an important factor influencing when Miscanthus and Saccharum flowered. Sugarcane could be induced to flower in a central Illinois greenhouse using supplemental lighting to reduce the rate at which days shortened during the autumn and winter to 1 min d -1 , which allowed us to synchronize the flowering of some sugarcane genotypes with Miscanthus genotypes primarily from low latitudes. In a complementary growth chamber experiment, we evaluated 33 Miscanthus genotypes, including 28 M . sinensis , 2 M . floridulus , and 3 M . ×giganteus collected from 20.9° S to 44.9° N for response to three day lengths (10 h, 12.5 h, and 15 h). High latitude-adapted M . sinensis flowered mainly under 15 h days, but unexpectedly, short days resulted in short, stocky plants that did not flower; in some cases, flag leaves developed under short days but heading did not occur. In contrast, for M . sinensis and M . floridulus from low latitudes, shorter day lengths typically resulted in earlier flowering, and for some low latitude genotypes, 15 h days resulted in no flowering. However, the highest ratio of reproductive shoots to total number of culms was typically observed for 12.5 h or 15 h days. Latitude of origin was significantly associated with culm length, and the shorter the days, the stronger the relationship. Nearly all entries achieved maximal culm length under the 15 h treatment, but the nearer to the equator an accession originated, the less of a difference in culm length between the short-day treatments and the 15 h day treatment. Under short days, short culms for high-latitude accessions was achieved by different physiological mechanisms for M . sinensis genetic groups from the mainland in comparison to those from Japan; for mainland accessions, the mechanism was reduced internode length, whereas for Japanese accessions the phyllochron under short days was greater than under long days. Thus, for M . sinensis , short days typically hastened floral induction, consistent with the expectations for a facultative short-day plant. However, for high latitude accessions of M . sinensis , days less than 12.5 h also signaled that plants should prepare for winter by producing many short culms with limited elongation and development; moreover, this response was also epistatic to flowering. Thus, to flower M . sinensis that originates from high latitudes synchronously with sugarcane, the former needs day lengths &gt;12.5 h (perhaps as high as 15 h), whereas that the latter needs day lengths &lt;12.5 h."
https://openalex.org/W3119593168,"Background Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100b have been used to assess neurological damage following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Cut-offs were derived from small normothermic cohorts. Whether similar cut-offs apply to patients treated with hypothermia remained undetermined. Methods We investigated 251 patients with OHCA treated with hypothermia but without routine prognostication. Neuromarkers were determined at day 3, neurological outcome was assessed after hospital discharge by cerebral performance category (CPC). Results Good neurological outcome (CPC≤2) was achieved in 41%. Elevated neuromarkers, older age and absence of ST-segment elevation after ROSC were associated with increased mortality. Poor neurological outcome in survivors was additionally associated with history of cerebrovascular events, sepsis and higher admission lactate. Mean NSE was 33μg/l [16–94] vs. 119μg/l [25–406]; p&lt;0.001, for survivors vs. non-survivors, and 21μg/l [16–29] vs. 40μg/l [23–98], p&lt;0.001 for good vs. poor neurological outcome. S-100b was 0.127μg/l [0.063–0.360] vs. 0.772μg/l [0.121–2.710], p&lt;0.001 and 0.086μg/l [0.061–0.122] vs. 0.138μg/l [0.090–0.271], p = 0.009, respectively. For mortality, thresholds of 36μg/l for NSE and 0.128μg/l for S-100b could be determined; for poor neurological outcome 33μg/l (NSE) and 0.123μg/l (S-100b), respectively. Positive predictive value for NSE was 81% (74–88) and 79% (71–85) for S-100b. Conclusions Thresholds for NSE and S-100b predicting mortality and poor neurological outcome are similar in OHCA patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia as in those reported before the era of hypothermia. However, both biomarkers do not have enough specificity to predict mortality or poor neurological outcome on their own and should only be additively used in clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3118336289,"The zoophytophagous mirid Nesidiocoris tenuis (Hemiptera: Miridae) is one of the biological control agents against the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a major pest of greenhouse crops. The successful establishment of a biological control agent and its co-occurrence with the target pests increases the efficacy of biological control programs in greenhouses. In this study, we explored the effects of different wavelengths of LED light on establishment of N . tenuis in laboratory condition, with the goal of enhancing the biological control of B . tabaci in greenhouse crops. Nesidiocoris tenuis was most strongly attracted by LED light at a wavelength of 385 nm. This same wavelength was also highly attractive to B . tabaci in Y-tube experiments with lights of specific wavelengths provided is each arm of the apparatus. In trials in growth chambers, we verified the attraction of N . tenuis to 385 nm wavelength. When LED light at a wavelength of 385 nm was used in a growth chamber for 6 hours out of 24 hours, it significantly increased the remaining number of N . tenuis in growth chamber and level of predation compared to treatment with white LED light or without LED light. In conclusion, UV-LED light at a wavelength of 385 nm attracts both B . tabaci and N . tenuis . Thus, it would be used for enhancing early establishment of this mirid bug, better spatial congruence of both mirid bug and whitefly, and better control of the whitefly."

The three Zr phthalocyanines bearing dehydroacetic acid residue ( PcZr(L1) 2 ) and its condensed derivatives ( PcZr(L2) 2 and PcZr(L3) 2 ) as out-of-plane ligands were synthesized and their influence on insulin fibril formation was studied by amyloid-sensitive fluorescent dye based assay, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescent and absorption spectroscopies. The presence of Zr phthalocyanines was shown to modify the fibril formation. The morphology of fibrils formed in the presence of the Zr phthalocyanines differs from that of free insulin and depends on the structure of out-of-plane ligands. It is shown that free insulin mostly forms fibril clusters with the length of about 0.3–2.1 μm. The presence of Zr phthalocyanines leads to the formation of individual 0.4–2.8 μm-long fibrils with a reduced tendency to lateral aggregation and cluster formation ( PcZr(L1) 2 ), shorter 0.2–1.5 μm-long fibrils with the tendency to lateral aggregation without clusters ( PcZr(L2) 2 ), and fibril-like 0.2–1.0 μm-long structures ( PcZr(L3) 2 ). The strongest influence on fibrils morphology made by PcZr(L3) 2 could be explained by the additional stacking of phenyl moiety of the ligand with aromatic amino acids in protein. The evidences of binding of studied Zr phthalocyanines to mature fibrils were shown by absorption spectroscopy (for PcZr(L1) 2 and PcZr(L2) 2 ) and fluorescent spectroscopy (for PcZr(L3) 2 ). These complexes could be potentially used as external tools allowing the development of functional materials on protein fibrils basis."
https://openalex.org/W3121078122,"This research proposes new perspectives accounting for the uncertainty on 50% effective rates ( ER 50 ) as interval input for species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analyses and evaluating how to include this uncertainty may influence the 5% Hazard Rate ( HR 5 ) estimation. We explored various endpoints (survival, emergence, shoot-dry-weight) for non-target plants from seven standard greenhouse studies that used different experimental approaches (vegetative vigour vs. seedling emergence) and applied seven herbicides at different growth stages. Firstly, for each endpoint of each study, a three-parameter log-logistic model was fitted to experimental toxicity test data for each species under a Bayesian framework to get a posterior probability distribution for ER 50 . Then, in order to account for the uncertainty on the ER 50 , we explored two censoring criteria to automatically censor ER 50 taking the ER 50 probability distribution and the range of tested rates into account. Secondly, based on dose-response fitting results and censoring criteria, we considered input ER 50 values for SSD analyses in three ways (only point estimates chosen as ER 50 medians, interval-censored ER 50 based on their 95% credible interval and censored ER 50 according to one of the two criteria), by fitting a log-normal distribution under a frequentist framework to get the three corresponding HR 5 estimates. We observed that SSD fitted reasonably well when there were at least six distinct intervals for the ER 50 values. By comparing the three SSD curves and the three HR 5 estimates, we shed new light on the fact that both propagating the uncertainty from the ER 50 estimates and including censored data into SSD analyses often leads to smaller point estimates of HR 5 , which is more conservative in a risk assessment context. In addition, we recommend not to focus solely on the point estimate of the HR 5 , but also to look at the precision of this estimate as depicted by its 95% confidence interval."
https://openalex.org/W3119263110,"Background Injury can have physical, psychological and social consequences. It is unclear which factors have an impact on patients’ wellbeing after injury. This study aimed to explore, using focus groups, patients’ experiences and wellbeing after injury and which factors, impede or facilitate patients’ wellbeing. Methods Trauma patients, treated in the shock room of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, the Netherlands, participated in focus groups. Purposive sampling was used. Exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years old, severe traumatic brain injury, dementia, and insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using coding technique open, axial, and selective coding, based on phenomenological approach. Results Six focus groups (3 to 7 participants) were held before data saturation was reached. In total, 134 patients were invited, 28 (21%) agreed to participate (Median age: 59.5; min. 18 –max. 84). Main reasons to decline were fear that the discussion would be too confronting or patients experienced no problems regarding the trauma or treatment. Participants experienced difficulties on physical (no recovery to pre-trauma level), psychological (fear of dying or for permanent limitations, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, cognitive dysfunction), social (impact on relatives and social support) wellbeing. These are impeding factors for recovery. However, good communication, especially clarity about the injury and expectations concerning recovery and future perspectives could help patients in surrendering to care. Patients felt less helpless when they knew what to expect. Conclusions This is the first study that explored patients’ experiences and wellbeing after injury. Patients reported that their injury had an impact on their physical, psychological, and social wellbeing up to 12 months after injury. Professionals with the knowledge of consequences after injury could improve their anticipation on patients’ need."
https://openalex.org/W3120467274,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the 12-month surgical outcome and prognostic factors of stand-alone ab interno trabeculotomy. The changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP) and medication score and the success rate of the surgery were analyzed. Thirty-four eyes of 29 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n = 16) or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG; n = 18) with a 12-month follow-up period were included in the study. The decreases in IOP and medication score from the baseline to the all-time-point were statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.001). The surgical success rates were 97.1%, 76.5%, and 44.0% at 3 months (90 days), 6 months (180 days), and 12 months (365 days), respectively. A mixed effect Cox model revealed that the type of glaucoma (POAG) was significantly associated with surgical failure ( P = 0.044). Furthermore, the surgical success rate was significantly higher in eyes with PEG than it was in those with POAG ( P = 0.019). Stand-alone ab interno trabeculotomy significantly lowered both the IOP and the medication score in patients with glaucoma, although almost one quarter of the cases needed additional glaucoma surgeries. The surgical success rate was significantly higher in eyes with PEG than it was in those with POAG."

Objective To determine molecular epidemiology of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in an indigenous population through Spoligotyping and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 23 indigenous communities of Puerto Nariño-Amazonas, Colombia. Recovered clinical isolates were genotyped. For genotyping analyzes global SITVIT2 database and the MIRU-VNTRplus web portal were used. Results 74 clinical isolates were recovered. Genotyping of clinical isolates by spoligotyping determined 5 different genotypes, all of them belonged to Euro-American lineage. By MIRU-VNTR typing, a total of 14 different genotypes were recorded. Furthermore, polyclonal infection was found in two patients from the same community. The combination of the two methodologies determined the presence of 19 genotypes, 8 formed clusters with 63 clinical isolates in total. Based on epidemiological information, it was possible to establish a potential chain of active transmission in 10/63 (15.9%) patients. Conclusions High genomic homogeneity was determined in the indigenous population suggesting possible chains of active transmission. The results obtained showed that specific genotypes circulating among the indigenous population of Colombia are significantly different from those found in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3119778598,"Background The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory features of Formononetin, an isoflavone constituent extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, have been reported. The present study investigated that whether Formononetin plays a benefit on hyperoxic ALI. Methods C57BL/6 mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 72 h to produce experimental hyperoxic ALI model. Formononetin or vehicle was administrated intraperitoneally. Samples from the lung were collected at 72 h post hyperoxia exposure for further study. Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from the lung of C57BL/6 mice were used for in vitro study. Results Formononetin pretreatment notably attenuated hyperoxia-induced elevating pulmonary water content, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine levels and increasing infiltration of neutrophil in the lung. Western blot analyses showed that Formononetin enhanced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which is a key transcription factor regulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Formononetin increased HO-1 expression and activity compared with vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, Formononetin reversed hyperoxia-caused the reduction of M2 macrophage polarization. However, pretreatment of a HO-1 inhibitor reduced the protective effect of Formononetin on hyperoxic ALI. Cell study showed that the Formononetin-induced upregulation of HO-1 was abolished when the Nrf2 was silenced. Conclusions Formononetin pretreatment reduces hyperoxia-induced ALI via Nrf2/HO-1-mediated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W3119920138,"In the present study, we evaluated adjuvant potential of Poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP) on the Th1-type immune responses of C57/BL6 mice against ovalbumin (OVA). We first determined the effect of PCP on maturation of murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), PCP significantly upregulated surface expression of MHCII, CD40, CD80, CD86 and enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-12p40. In addition, PCP affected receptor-mediated endocytosis, but not pinocytosis in BMDCs. Furthermore, OVA + PCP immunization induced specific cytotoxic CD8 + T cell killing of OVA (257–264) peptide pulsed cell. When mice were immunized subcutaneously in a week interval with OVA + PCP. Serum were collected for measuring OVA-specific antibody and splenocytes were harvested for analyzing CD69, IFN-γ ELISpot and cytokines production. The result indicated that OVA-specific IgG, IgG2a and IgG1 antibody levels in serum were significantly elevated by PCP compared with control. PCP increased OVA-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD8 + , CD4 + T cells, promoted CD8 + T cell proliferation and up-regulated Th-1 type (IFN-γ, IL-2) cytokine production. In conclusion, data suggest that PCP enhanced cellular immune response and possess potential as a vaccine adjuvant for Th1 immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3120882151,"The folds of the brain offer a particular challenge for the subarachnoid vascular grid. The primitive blood vessels that occupy this space, when the brain is flat, have to adapt to an everchanging geometry while constructing an efficient network. Surprisingly, the result is a non-redundant arterial system easily challenged by acute occlusions. Here, we generalize the optimal network building principles of a flat surface growing into a folded configuration and generate an ideal middle cerebral artery (MCA) configuration that can be directly compared with the normal brain anatomy. We then describe how the Sylvian fissure (the fold in which the MCA is buried) is formed during development and use our findings to account for the differences between the ideal and the actual shaping pattern of the MCA. Our results reveal that folding dynamics condition the development of arterial anastomosis yielding a network without loops and poor response to acute occlusions."
https://openalex.org/W3120015364,Genome wide association studies (GWAS) attempt to map genotypes to phenotypes in organisms. This is typically performed by genotyping individuals using microarray or by aligning whole genome sequencing reads to a reference genome. Both approaches require knowledge of a reference genome which hinders their application to organisms with no or incomplete reference genomes. This caveat can be removed by using alignment-free association mapping methods based on k-mers from sequencing reads. Here we present an improved implementation of an alignment free association mapping method. The new implementation is faster and includes additional features to make it more flexible than the original implementation. We have tested our implementation on an E. Coli ampicillin resistance dataset and observe improvement in execution time over the original implementation while maintaining accuracy in results. We also demonstrate that the method can be applied to find sex specific sequences.
https://openalex.org/W3120032965,"The use of inappropriate methods for estimating the effects of covariates in survival data with frailty leads to erroneous conclusions in medical research. This study evaluated the performance of 13 survival regression models in assessing the factors associated with the timing of complications in implant-supported dental restorations in a Swedish cohort. Data were obtained from randomly selected cohort (n = 596) of Swedish patients provided with dental restorations supported in 2003. Patients were evaluated over 9 years of implant loss, peri-implantitis or technical complications. Best Model was identified using goodness, AIC and BIC. The loglikelihood, the AIC and BIC were consistently lower in flexible parametric model with frailty (df = 2) than other models. Adjusted hazard of implant complications was 45% (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 1.449; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.153–1.821, p = 0.001) higher among patients with periodontitis. While controlling for other variables, the hazard of implant complications was about 5 times (aHR = 4.641; 95% CI: 2.911–7.401, p&lt;0.001) and 2 times (aHR = 2.338; 95% CI: 1.553–3.519, p&lt;0.001) higher among patients with full- and partial-jaw restorations than those with single crowns. Flexible parametric survival model with frailty are the most suitable for modelling implant complications among the studied patients."
https://openalex.org/W3120479033,"Stair descent is one of the most common forms of daily locomotion and concurrently one of the most challenging and hazardous daily activities performed by older adults. Thus, sufficient attention should be devoted to this locomotion and to the factors that affect it. This study investigates gender and age-related differences in balance control during and after stair descent on a foam mat. Forty-seven older adults (70% women) and 38 young adults (58% women) performed a descent from one step onto a foam mat. Anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) centre of pressure velocity (CoP) and standard deviation of the CoP sway were investigated during stair descent and restabilization. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed the main effects of age for the first 5 s of restabilization. Older women exhibited significantly higher values of CoP sway and velocity in both directions compared to the younger individuals (CoP SD AP5 , 55%; CoP SD ML5 , 30%; CoP V AP5 , 106%; CoP V ML5 , 75%). Men achieved significantly higher values of CoP sway and velocity only in the AP direction compared to their younger counterparts (CoP SD AP5 , 50% and CoP V AP5 , 79%). These findings suggest that with advancing age, men are at higher risk of forward falls, whereas women are at higher risk of forward and sideways falls."
https://openalex.org/W3121055603,"The colonization of broilers with extended-spectrum β-lactamase- (ESBL-) and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase- (pAmpC-) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been extensively studied. However, only limited data on intervention strategies to reduce the colonization throughout the fattening period are available. To investigate practically relevant management measures for their potential to reduce colonization, a recently published seeder-bird colonization model was used. Groups of 90 broilers (breed Ross 308) were housed in pens under conventional conditions (stocking of 39 kg/m 2 , no enrichment, water and feed ad libitum ). Tested measures were investigated in separate trials and included (I) an increased amount of litter in the pen, (II) the reduction of stocking density to 25 kg/m 2 , and (III) the use of an alternative broiler breed (Rowan x Ranger). One-fifth of ESBL- and pAmpC- negative broilers (n = 18) per group were orally co-inoculated with two E . coli strains on the third day of the trial (seeder). One CTX-M-15-positive E . coli strain (ST410) and one CMY-2 and mcr-1-positive E . coli strain (ST10) were simultaneously administered in a dosage of 10 2 cfu. Colonization of all seeders and 28 non-inoculated broilers (sentinel) was assessed via cloacal swabs during the trials and a final necropsy at a target weight of two kilograms (= d 36 (control, I-II), d 47 (III)). None of the applied intervention measures reduced the colonization of the broilers with both the ESBL- and the pAmpC- producing E . coli strains. A strain-dependent reduction of colonization for the ESBL- producing E . coli strain of ST410 by 2 log units was apparent by the reduction of stocking density to 25 kg/m 2 . Consequently, the tested management measures had a negligible effect on the ESBL- and pAmpC- colonization of broilers. Therefore, intervention strategies should focus on the prevention of ESBL- and pAmpC- colonization, rather than an attempt to reduce an already existing colonization."
https://openalex.org/W3119194455,"Background As the healthcare industry shifts toward patient-centered models, providers will need to fully understand patient satisfaction and how they affect their practices. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction towards the emergency medical care and factors associated with at Ayder specialized comprehensive hospital, Emergency room, Mekelle, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1–30, 2019. A systematic random sampling method was used to enroll 299 study participants. Data were collected using a standard Brief Emergency Department Patient Satisfaction Scale questionnaire by trained data collectors. Data was entered into EpiData 3.1 then exported and analyzed by SPSS version 22. Binary and multiple logistic regression were used to assess the factors associated with patient satisfaction. Where the p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 299 participants were enrolled in the study with a response rate of 99.3%. On overall patient satisfaction score majority (81.9%) of them were satisfied with the emergency medical care provided. The satisfaction rate towards emergency staff courtesy, emergency room environment, physician care satisfaction, general patient satisfaction, and patient family satisfaction was 80.3%, 37.5%, 75.9%, 70.9%, and 49.8% respectively. Those who arrived during the morning time of the day tend to be satisfied more with the emergency services (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI: 2.08, 11.4), while having low educational status (able to read and write) (AOR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.50) and waiting time till seen by a doctor (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.4) was found to affect patient satisfaction negatively. Conclusions The total patient satisfaction score towards emergency medical care was found to be good. The hospital management and emergency room staff should act on the identified factors especially on minimizing the patients waiting time to improve the quality of care in the emergency department."
https://openalex.org/W3119907519,"Objectives To examine the temporal patterns of hospitalizations with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the pediatric population and their associated fiscal impact. Methods The Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File was used to identify hospitalizations of state residents aged 1month-19 years with a primary diagnosis of DKA during 2005–2014. Temporal changes of population-adjusted hospitalization rates and hospitalization volumes were examined for the whole cohort and on stratified analyses of sociodemographic attributes. Changes in the aggregate and per-hospitalization charges were assessed overall and on stratified analyses. Results There were 24,072 DKA hospitalizations during the study period. The population-adjusted hospitalization rate for the whole cohort increased from 31.3 to 35.9 per 100,000 between 2005–2006 and 2013–2014. Hospitalization volume increased by 30.2% over the same period, driven mainly by males, ethnic minorities, those with Medicaid insurance and uninsured patients. The aggregate hospital charges increased from approximately $69 million to $130 million between 2005–2006 and 2013–2014, with 66% of the rise being due to increased per-hospitalization charges. Conclusions There was progressive rise in pediatric DKA hospitalizations over the last decade, with concurrent near-doubling of the associated fiscal footprint. Marked disparities were noted in the increasing hospitalization burden of DKA, born predominantly by racial and ethnic minorities, as well as by the underinsured and the uninsured. Further studies are needed to identify scalable preventive measures to achieve an equitable reduction of pediatric DKA events."
https://openalex.org/W3119957440,"Background Nurse-led monitoring of patients for signs and symptoms associated with documented ‘undesirable effects’ of medicines has potential to prevent avoidable harm, and optimise prescribing. Intervention The Adverse Drug Reaction Profile for polypharmacy (ADRe-p) identifies and documents putative adverse effects of medicines commonly prescribed in primary care. Nurses address some problems, before passing ADRe-p to pharmacists and prescribers for review, in conjunction with prescriptions. Objectives We investigated changes in: the number and nature of residents’ problems as recorded on ADRe-p; prescription regimens; medicines optimisation: and healthcare costs. We explored aetiologies of problems identified and stakeholders’ perspectives. Setting and participants In three UK care homes, 19 residents completed the study, December 2018 to May 2019. Two service users, three pharmacists, six nurses gave interviews. Methods This mixed-method process evaluation integrated data from residents’ ADRe-ps and medicines charts, at the study’s start and 5–10 weeks later. Results We recruited three of 27 homes approached and 26 of 45 eligible residents; 19 completed ADRe-p at least twice. Clinical gains were identified for 17/19 residents (mean number of symptoms 3 SD 1.67, range 0–7). Examples included management of: pain (six residents), seizures (three), dyspnoea (one), diarrhoea (laxatives reduced, two), falls (two of five able to stand). One or more medicine was de-prescribed or dose reduced for 12/19 residents. ADRe administration and review cost ~£30 in staff time. ADRe-p helped carers and nurses bring residents’ problems to the attention of prescribers. Implications ADRe-p relieved unnecessary suffering. It supported carers and nurses by providing a tool to engage with pharmacists and prescribers, and was the only observable strategy for multidisciplinary team working around medicines optimisation. ADRe-p improved care by: a) regular systematic checks and problem documentation; b) information transfer from care home staff to prescribers and pharmacists; c) recording changes.

https://openalex.org/W3120588563,"There are well-known associations between stress, poor sleep, and cognitive deficits, but little is known about their interactive effects, which the present study explored in a sample of mothers of toddlers. Since certain types of cognitive decline start during the 20s and continue into later ages, we also explored whether mothers’ age interacted with stress and sleep in the prediction of cognitive functioning. We hypothesized that poorer sleep [measured using one week of 24-hour wrist actigraphy data] and having more chronic stressors [e.g., life events, household chaos, work/family role conflict] would be linked with poorer cognitive performance [both executive function and standardized cognitive ability tasks], and that the interactive combination of poorer sleep and more stressors would account for the effect. We also explored whether this process operated differently for younger versus older women. In a socioeconomically and geographically diverse community sample of 227 women with toddler-age children [age, M = 32.73 yrs, SD = 5.15 yrs], poorer cognitive performance was predicted by greater activity during the sleep period, shorter sleep duration, and lower night-to-night consistency in sleep; it was not associated with higher levels of stress. The interactive effects hypothesis was supported for sleep activity [fragmented sleep] and sleep timing [when mothers went to bed]. The combination of more exposure to stressors and frequent night waking was particularly deleterious for older women’s performance. For younger women, going to bed late was associated with poorer performance if they were experiencing high levels of stress; for those experiencing low levels of stress, going to bed late was associated with better performance."
https://openalex.org/W3120797905,"Affective decoding is the inference of human emotional states using brain signal measurements. This approach is crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for psychiatric rehabilitation, such as affective neurofeedback protocols. To reduce the training duration and optimize the clinical outputs, an ideal clinical neurofeedback could be trained using data from an independent group of volunteers before being used by new patients. Here, we investigated if this subject-independent design of affective decoding can be achieved using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from frontal and occipital areas. For this purpose, a linear discriminant analysis classifier was first trained in a dataset (49 participants, 24.65±3.23 years) and then tested in a completely independent one (20 participants, 24.00±3.92 years). Significant balanced accuracies between classes were found for positive vs. negative (64.50 ± 12.03%, p&lt;0.01) and negative vs. neutral (68.25 ± 12.97%, p&lt;0.01) affective states discrimination during a reactive block consisting in viewing affective-loaded images. For an active block, in which volunteers were instructed to recollect personal affective experiences, significant accuracy was found for positive vs. neutral affect classification (71.25 ± 18.02%, p&lt;0.01). In this last case, only three fNIRS channels were enough to discriminate between neutral and positive affective states. Although more research is needed, for example focusing on better combinations of features and classifiers, our results highlight fNIRS as a possible technique for subject-independent affective decoding, reaching significant classification accuracies of emotional states using only a few but biologically relevant features."
https://openalex.org/W3190688323,"Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound, often occurs as a clinical sequela of auditory traumas. In an effort to develop an objective test and therapeutic approach for tinnitus, the present study was performed in blast-exposed rats and focused on measurements of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, and presynaptic ribbon densities on cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs). Although the exact mechanism is unknown, the “central gain theory” posits that tinnitus is a perceptual indicator of abnormal increases in the gain (or neural amplification) of the central auditory system to compensate for peripheral loss of sensory input from the cochlea. Our data from vehicle-treated rats supports this rationale; namely, blast-induced cochlear synaptopathy correlated with imbalanced elevations in the ratio of centrally-derived ABR wave V amplitudes to peripherally-derived wave I amplitudes, resulting in behavioral evidence of tinnitus. Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that the ABR wave V/I amplitude ratio served as a reliable metric for objectively identifying tinnitus. Furthermore, histopathological examinations in blast-exposed rats revealed tinnitus-related changes in the expression patterns of key plasticity factors in the central auditory pathway, including chronic loss of Arc/Arg3.1 mobilization. Using a formulation of N -acetylcysteine (NAC) and disodium 2,4-disulfophenyl- N -tert-butylnitrone (HPN-07) as a therapeutic for addressing blast-induced neurodegeneration, we measured a significant treatment effect on preservation or restoration of IHC ribbon synapses, normalization of ABR wave V/I amplitude ratios, and reduced behavioral evidence of tinnitus in blast-exposed rats, all of which accorded with mitigated histopathological evidence of tinnitus-related neuropathy and maladaptive neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3118892766,"Sexual violence against women and girls is a major public health problem globally and in South Africa. Although young men have been identified as an important risk group for prevention interventions, scant attention have been given to this age cohort in low and middle-income countries. There is strong evidence that perpetration starts early and increasing attention is being drawn to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) as settings for prevention interventions. The main objective of this study was to adapt the One Man Can Intervention for use with male university students in residences and develop materials for implementation. This paper presents the qualitative findings of the adaptation process of the One Man Can Intervention with 15 young male student leaders at a HEI in South Africa. The same participants who started in the study, participated throughout. Only five of the 15 participants were located and participated in the interviews six months post intervention. The results show the emergence of a six-hour session adapted intervention that addresses key drivers of violence against women and girls (VAWG). Critical engagement and dialogue on sexual violence is shown to shift key norms on gender equality, on being a man and reflection on their role in preventing sexual violence. This paper contributes to the field where much learning, refining and improvement of prevention interventions for VAWG are ongoing."
https://openalex.org/W3119843950,"We aimed to determine the significance of cytoplasmic antinuclear antibody (ANA) patterns using computer-aided immunofluorescence microscopy in patients with autoimmune liver diseases (AILD). ANA staining pattern was identified by treating cultured human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells with the sera of the patients. Medical records of patients with suspected AILD who had positive cytoplasmic ANA patterns between February 2017 and November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, laboratory, and immunological data. Cytoplasmic ANA patterns of AILD and non-AILD groups were compared. Further subgroup analysis of patients with AILD who had reticular or speckled cytoplasmic ANA patterns was conducted. We found that among the 196 patients with positive cytoplasmic ANA patterns, 113 (57.6%) were diagnosed with AILD. The percentage of reticular cytoplasmic pattern was higher in the AILD group than that in the non-AILD group (64.0% vs. 21.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, patients with AILD who exhibited a reticular ANA pattern demonstrated a higher positive rate for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (66.7% vs. 2.6%, p &lt; 0.001) than those who exhibited the speckled ANA pattern. Moreover, AILD patients with the reticular ANA pattern displayed a lower positive rate for anti-smooth muscle antibodies (0% vs. 45%, p &lt; 0.001) and nuclear ANA pattern (73.2% vs. 97.5%, p = 0.003) than those with the speckled ANA pattern. Therefore, cytoplasmic ANA patterns could be used to guide AILD characterization in suspected AILD cases, especially as the reticular ANA pattern is strongly associated with AILD. Thus, it is important to check cytoplasmic ANA patterns for AILD evaluation, even when nuclear ANA patterns are negative."

Apart from B . humptydooensis , specificity testing against other Burkholderia spp., as well as other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produced a negative result. The detection limit of the multiplex PCR in soil samples artificially spiked with known quantities of B . pseudomallei and B . thailandensis were 5 and 6 CFU/g soil, respectively. Furthermore, comparison between standard bacterial culture and the multiplex PCR to detect B . pseudomallei from 34 soil samples, collected from an endemic area of melioidosis, showed high sensitivity and specificity. This robust, sensitive, and specific PCR assay will be a useful tool for epidemiological study of B . pseudomallei and closely related members with pathogenic potential in soil."
https://openalex.org/W3118361644,"Most research on power assist suits (PASs) that concerned PAS-human interactions has used human physical reactions as criteria to evaluate the mechanical function, however, with minimal emphasis on human reactions in response to PASs. In this study, we focused on the physiological responses of the upper limbs including muscle activity of the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii, co-activation, force steadiness (CV) and rated perceived exertion (RPE) to various patterns of bilateral assistive force, such as unilateral assistance (L0% &amp; R67% [% = percentage of workload force, L = left arm, R = right arm], L67% &amp; R0%, L0% &amp; R33%, L33% &amp; R0%), symmetrical (L0% &amp; R0%, L33% &amp; R33%, L67% &amp; R67%) and asymmetrical bilateral assistance (L33% &amp; R67%, L67% &amp; R33%), during bilateral isometric force-matching tasks. The results showed a similar muscular response of the two arms to bilateral assistive conditions, and the muscle activity of the arm that was being observed decreased only when the assistive force that applied on itself increased, indicating that both arms may have adopted similar but independent motor control mechanisms to acclimate to the bilateral assistive forces. Comparison between the two unilateral assistances (L0% &amp; R33% and L33% &amp; R0%) and the two asymmetrical bilateral assistances (L33% &amp; R67%, L67% &amp; R33%) showed no significant differences in muscular responses, CV and RPE, indicating that bilateral assistances with bilateral interchanged assistive levels may be equally effective regardless of which arm the higher assistive force is applied to. Comparison between unilateral and symmetrical assistive conditions that have similar overall workloads (L67% &amp; R0%, L33% &amp; R33%, L0% &amp; R67%) showed a lower CV and RPE score at symmetrical assistance compared with unilateral assistance, suggesting that assisting both arms with the same level simultaneously improves task performances compared with applying the assistive force to only one arm."
https://openalex.org/W3118611363,"Medical cryopreservation is the speculative practice of using low temperatures and medical-grade cryoprotective agents to halt the decay of a recently-deceased person’s brain and body for the prospect of future resuscitation and restoration of function. We conducted a survey of 1,487 internet users in the United States to measure familiarity with, interest in, beliefs about, and attitudes towards cryopreservation. The majority of respondents (75%) had previously heard of the topic. Respondents tended to underestimate the cost of cryopreservation and number of previous cases but overestimate the number of providers. While many respondents expressed interest in signing up (20%) or had actively researched the topic (21%), a much smaller fraction have decided to be cryopreserved (6%). This level of interest is much greater than the number of previous preservation cases would indicate. We found that respondents’ attitudes towards death significantly correlated with their general sentiments towards the topic, with those expressing a desire for longer life or to see the future being more interested and positively inclined. Fear of death was not associated with interest in cryopreservation. Negative sentiments towards cryopreservation were less common than respondents perceived. For example, 14% of respondents believed that “most people” think cryopreservation should be illegal, but only 4% of respondents actually did. Many respondents (42%) were pessimistic regarding the likelihood of cryopreservation being successful, but the mean estimate of time until revival of cryopreserved bodies would be possible was 82 years."
https://openalex.org/W3118901486,"Epigenetics are known to be involved in various disorders, including neurobiological disorders like autism. Dietary factors such as folic acid can affect epigenetic marks using methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) to metabolize folic acid to a one-carbon methyl group. As MTHFR mutations are frequent, it is curious as to whether excess folic acid, with or without functioning MTHFR , could affect gene expression, epigenetics, and neuromorphology. Here, we investigated gene expression and activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, genome-wide DNA methylation, histone 3 modifications, and dendritic spine densities in SH-SY5Y cells with or without a knockdown of MTHFR and with or without an excess of folic acid. We found alterations to gene expression of epigenetic modifying enzymes, including those associated with disorders like autism. Grouping the epigenetic modifying enzymes by function indicated that gene expression was widely affected for genes that code for enzymes affecting DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, histone phosphorylation, and histone ubiquitination when excess folic acid treatment occurred with or without the knockdown of MTHFR . MTHFR was significantly reduced upon excess folic acid treatment whether MTHFR was knocked-down or not. Further, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 expression was significantly decreased with excess folic acid treatment with and without proper MTHFR expression. Global DNA methylation decreased due to the knockdown alone while global hydroxymethylated DNA increased due to the knockdown alone. TET2 expression significantly increased with the MTHFR knockdown alone. Excess folic acid alone induced a decrease in TET3 expression. Excess folic acid induced an increase in dendritic spines without the MTHFR knockdown, but folic acid induced a decrease in dendritic spines when MTHFR was knocked-down. The knockdown alone also increased the dendritic spines significantly. Histone 3 acetylation at lysine 18 was significantly increased when excess folic acid was applied to cells with the MTHFR knockdown, as was histone 3 phosphorylation at serine 10. Broadly, our results indicate that excess folic acid, even with functioning MTHFR , could have detrimental effects on cells."
https://openalex.org/W3119484191,"Low adherence in vaginal microbicide clinical trials for HIV prevention has impeded interpretation of trial results and hindered evaluation of potentially efficacious HIV prevention gels. Understanding the underlying reasons why women join trials and their barriers to product use can support identification of ways to improve adherence and its reporting. Eight focus group discussion workshops were conducted with 46 former microbicide trial participants in Durban, South Africa and Mwanza, Tanzania. Participants provided feedback on why women join trials, the barriers to using study gel and reporting adherence accurately, and how clinical trial design can be improved to support better adherence and its reporting. Women join microbicide trials for a number of important reasons such as healthcare and financial reimbursement. Fear of adverse effects from the investigational product was the most important reason why participants reported not using the gel. The key reason for inaccurate reporting of gel use was fear of removal from the trial. Participants made concrete suggestions for improving microbicide trial design such as applicator use testing and real time feedback, improving education to participants about how trials answer their research questions, and improving transparency and clarity about study procedures. Participants also gave feedback on an innovative trial design with a non-randomised arm. Identifying HIV prevention products for women requires better understanding of the lives of women asked to join these trials, and application of that understanding to microbicide trial design. This study has demonstrated that participants and research teams can work collaboratively to design clinical trials that meet needs of both the research and of participants."
https://openalex.org/W3120408680,"In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) the persistence of measles virus (MeV) may be related to the altered immune response. In this study, cytokine responses of lymphocytes and monocytes were evaluated in SSPE compared to controls with non-inflammatory (NICON) and inflammatory (ICON) diseases. Patients with SSPE (n = 120), 78 patients with ICON and 63 patients with NICON were included in this study. Phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been analyzed by flow cytometry. CD3 and CD28, and S . aureus Cowan strain I (SAC) stimulated and unstimulated cells were cultured and IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and IL-23 were detected in supernatants by ELISA. MeV peptides were used for MeV-specific stimulation and IFN-γ secretion of PBMC was measured by ELISPOT. Spontaneous and stimulated secretions of IL-10 were lower in SSPE compared to both control groups. T cell stimulation induced lower IFN-γ production than ICON group, but higher IL-2 than NICON group in SSPE. Stimulated PBMC produced lower IL-12p70 in SSPE and had decreased CD46 on the cell surface, suggesting the interaction with the virus. IFN-γ responses against MeV peptides were not prominent and similar to NICON patients. The immune response did not reveal an inflammatory activity to eliminate the virus in SSPE patients. Even IL-10 production was diminished implicating that the response is self-limited in controlling the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3120982925,"Children with Down syndrome have an approximately 10-fold increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and this risk is influenced by inherited genetic variation. Genome-wide association studies have identified IKZF1 as a strong acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility locus in children both with and without Down syndrome, with association signals reported at rs4132601 in non-Down syndrome and rs58923657 in individuals with Down syndrome (r 2 = 0.98 for these two loci). Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in non-Down syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines has demonstrated an association between the rs4132601 risk allele and decreased IKZF1 mRNA levels. In this study, we provide further mechanistic evidence linking the region encompassing IKZF1 -associated polymorphisms to pro-leukemogenic effects in both human lymphoblastoid cell lines and murine hematopoietic stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the region encompassing the rs17133807 major allele (r 2 with rs58923657 = 0.97) resulted in significant reduction of IKZF1 mRNA levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines, with a greater effect in Down syndrome versus non-Down syndrome cells. Since rs17133807 is highly conserved in mammals, we also evaluated the orthologous murine locus at rs263378223, in hematopoietic stem cells from the Dp16(1)Yey mouse model of Down syndrome as well as non-Down syndrome control mice. Homozygous deletion of the region encompassing rs263378223 resulted in significantly reduced Ikzf1 mRNA, confirming that this polymorphism maps to a strong murine Ikzf1 enhancer, and resulted in increased B-lymphoid colony growth and decreased B-lineage differentiation. Our results suggest that both the region encompassing rs17133807 and its conserved orthologous mouse locus have functional effects that may mediate increased leukemia susceptibility in both the Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome genetic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W3043858723,"As a novel ultrasonic technique, superb microvascular imaging (SMI) can quickly, simply and noninvasively observe the microvascular distribution in a tumor and evaluate the microvascular perfusion. Previous studies have shown that SMI can detect the blood flow signals of neovascularization in tumors and increase the sensitivity for detecting thyroid cancer. However, the results of these studies have been contradictory, and the sample sizes were too small. Therefore, the present meta-analysis will aim at evaluating the value of a thyroid imaging report and data system (TI-RADS) combined with SMI in distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules.We will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Chinese biomedical databases from their inceptions to the June 31, 2020. Two authors will independently carry out searching literature records; scanning titles, abstracts, and full texts; collecting data; and assessing risk of bias.

https://openalex.org/W3119167778,"Semantic drift is a well-known concept in distributional semantics, which is used to demonstrate gradual, long-term changes in meanings and sentiments of words and is largely detectable by studying the composition of large corpora. In our previous work, which used ontological relationships between words and phrases, we established that certain kinds of semantic micro-changes can be found in social media emerging around natural hazard events, such as floods. Our previous results confirmed that semantic drift in social media can be used to for early detection of floods and to increase the volume of ‘useful’ geo-referenced data for event monitoring. In this work we use deep learning in order to determine whether images associated with ‘semantically drifted’ social media tags reflect changes in crowd navigation strategies during floods. Our results show that alternative tags can be used to differentiate naïve and experienced crowds witnessing flooding of various degrees of severity."
https://openalex.org/W3119568586,"In recent years, machine learning methods have been applied to various prediction scenarios in time-series data. However, some processing procedures such as cross-validation (CV) that rearrange the order of the longitudinal data might ruin the seriality and lead to a potentially biased outcome. Regarding this issue, a recent study investigated how different types of CV methods influence the predictive errors in conventional time-series data. Here, we examine a more complex distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM), which has been widely used to assess the cumulative impacts of past exposures on the current health outcome. This research extends the DLNM into an artificial neural network (ANN) and investigates how the ANN model reacts to various CV schemes that result in different predictive biases. We also propose a newly designed permutation ratio to evaluate the performance of the CV in the ANN. This ratio mimics the concept of the R-square in conventional statistical regression models. The results show that as the complexity of the ANN increases, the predicted outcome becomes more stable, and the bias shows a decreasing trend. Among the different settings of hyperparameters, the novel strategy, Leave One Block Out Cross-Validation (LOBO-CV), demonstrated much better results, and the lowest mean square error was observed. The hyperparameters of the ANN trained by the LOBO-CV yielded the minimum number of prediction errors. The newly proposed permutation ratio indicates that LOBO-CV can contribute up to 34% of the prediction accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3120727523,"Background Patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) have very low levels of leptin and are described as having a voracious appetite. However, a direct comparison between CGL and eutrophic individuals is lacking, regarding both appetite parameters and acylated ghrelin, the hormone form that is active in acute food intake stimulation. The objective of the present study was to address whether and in what extent the subjective appetite parameters and acylated ghrelin response to a meal are affected in CGL individuals, in comparison to eutrophic individuals. Additionally, an obese group was included in the study, to allow the comparison between a leptin-resistant and a leptin-deficient condition on these aspects. Methods Eutrophic controls (EUT, n = 10), obese subjects (OB, n = 10) and CGL (n = 11) were fasted overnight and then received an ad libitum meal. Blood was collected and the visual analogue scale was applied before and 90 minutes after the meal. An additional blood sample was collected at 60 minutes for ghrelin determination. Results The CGL patients showed low fasting levels of leptin and adiponectin, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. The caloric intake was similar among the 3 groups. However, both CGL (p = 0.02) and OB (p = 0.04) had shorter satiation times than EUT. The CGL patients also had lower satiety time (p = 0.01) and their sensation of hunger was less attenuated by the meal (p = 0.03). Fasting acylated ghrelin levels were lower in CGL than in EUT (p = 0.003). After the meal, the levels tended to decrease in EUT but not in CGL and OB individuals. Conclusion The data indicate that, although not hyperphagic, the CGL patients present appetite disturbances in relation to eutrophic individuals. Their low fasting levels of acylated ghrelin and the absence of the physiological drop after meal intake suggest a role of these disturbances in hunger attenuation and satiety but not in acute satiation."
