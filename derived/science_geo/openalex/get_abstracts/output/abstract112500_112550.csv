https://openalex.org/W1665551917,"We have determined the structural organization of the human gene that encodes nuclear lamins A and C, intermediate filament proteins of the nuclear lamina. Sequencing and restriction mapping show that the coding region spans approximately 24 kilobases. The 5'-proximal promoter region contains several GC-rich stretches, a CCAAT box, and a TATA-like element of sequence TATTA. The lamin A/C gene contains 12 exons. Alternative splicing within exon 10 gives rise to two different mRNAs that code for pre-lamin A and lamin C. Consequently, two proteins are generated, only one of which, pre-lamin A, can be modified by isoprenylation. The intron positions in the human lamin A/C gene are generally conserved in the previously characterized genes for Xenopus lamin LIII and mouse lamin B2, but different from those in a Drosophila lamin gene. In the regions coding for the central rod domains, the intron positions are also conserved when compared with the intron positions in the genes for most cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins except those for nestin and neurofilaments. Analysis of the intron positions in these genes supports the hypothesis that the nuclear lamins and other intermediate filament proteins arose from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1270671049,"We have previously shown that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an antioxidant enzyme that can provide protection against a thiol-containing oxidation system but not against an oxidation system without thiol. This 25-kDa enzyme was thus named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA). We have now isolated and sequenced a yeast genomic DNA fragment that encodes TSA. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of TSA with those of conventional antioxidant enzymes, including catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, revealed no sequence homology. The 195-amino acid TSA sequence contains 2 cysteine residues. Southern blot analysis of petite yeast DNA, studies with protein synthesis inhibitors, and protein immunoblot analyses of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins suggest that TSA is a cytosolic protein encoded by nuclear DNA (chromosome XIII). The yeast TSA gene was selectively disrupted by homologous recombination. The haploid tsa mutant was viable under air, suggesting that TSA is not essential for cell viability. The growth rates of the tsa mutant and wild-type strains were identical under anaerobic conditions. However, under aerobic conditions, especially in the presence of methyl viologen or a peroxide (t-butyl hydroperoxide or H2O2), the growth rate of the mutant was significantly less than that of wild-type cells. This result suggests that TSA is a physiologically important antioxidant."
https://openalex.org/W1495373525,"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine and is most active in liver. A cDNA for this enzyme from a rat liver cDNA library has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in COS-1 cells, McArdle-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells, and Sf9 insect cells. The expressed protein was capable of converting phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine in intact COS-1 cells, which normally have very low methyltransferase activity. The calculated molecular mass of the methyltransferase protein is 22.3 kDa, which is equivalent to that of the pure protein isolated from rat liver. Comparison of the sequence of the cloned rat liver methyltransferase with the yeast phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase PEM2 gene product revealed 44% identical amino acids and 68% similarity in the two predicted protein sequences. A polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region of the enzyme and was affinity purified. The antibody recognized a single protein with a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa when either rat liver proteins or proteins derived from the transfected COS-1 cells were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Surprisingly, the antibody exhibited no reactivity with endoplasmic reticulum proteins, even though the major phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase activity resides on this subcellular organelle. Instead, the antibody specifically recognized a protein in a unique subcellular membrane fraction purified from a crude mitochondrial preparation on a Percoll gradient. Immunocytochemical examination by electron microscopy showed positive labeling only in unique regions of the hepatocytes. The data suggest that this phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase is a specific marker for this unique membrane fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1578241902,"TonB, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, couples cytoplasmic membrane protonmotive force to active transport across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. In vivo cross-linking studies were initiated to analyze TonB interactions with other cell envelope proteins. Four TonB-specific cross-linked complexes were detected with apparent molecular masses of 195, 77, 59, and 43.5 kDa. The 195-kDa complex was shown to contain both TonB and FepA, the outer membrane receptor for the siderophore enterochelin. The 195-kDa complex is absent in strains missing either TonB or FepA and can be detected by either TonB-specific or FepA-specific monoclonal antibodies. This is the first direct in vivo evidence that TonB can span the periplasmic space to interact physically with outer membrane receptors. Consistent with that observation, the outer membrane protease OmpT was shown to play a role in TonB turnover, both in the presence and absence of ExbB results in the rapid degradation of TonB. The absence of OmpT could be used to stabilize TonB in an exbB::Tn10 strain such that steady state levels of TonB protein are identical to a wild-type strain. Under those conditions, the absence of ExbB results in greatly reduced TonB activity, indicating that ExbB plays a direct role in energy transduction and probably secondarily protects TonB protein from proteolysis. The 59-kDa complex was absent in an exbB::Tn10 strain, suggesting either that ExbB is in the complex with TonB or that ExbB is required to form the 59-kDa complex. A tolQ nonsense mutation had no effect on the cross-linking profile observed, confirming that its participation in TonB-dependent phenomena is minor and most likely the result of evolutionary cross-talk."
https://openalex.org/W1582375112,"Hypoxic and ischemic stresses cause a series of well documented changes in myocardial cells and tissues, including increased anaerobic glycolysis, loss of contractility, changes in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and eventual irreversible membrane damage and cell death. In this article we describe changes in the expression and regulation of the proto-oncogenes fos and jun in cardiac myocytes exposed to severe hypoxia. The mRNAs encoding c-Fos, c-Jun, Jun-D, and Jun-B were induced within 1 h of exposure to hypoxia, increased 5-10-fold between 1 and 4 h and then declined. These inductions coincided with loss in myocyte contractility but occurred before there was irreversible cell damage or significant ATP loss. Immunostaining with anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies revealed the accumulation of these proteins in hypoxic cell nuclei. Pre-treatment of cells with protein kinase inhibitors significantly repressed the response at the mRNA level. We propose that hypoxic stress in these cells activates signal transduction pathways, possibly involving protein kinases, that result in the inductions of fos and jun gene families. Therefore AP1 may regulate myocardial adaptive responses to hypoxia in advance of energy depletion, cell damage, or reoxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W2123072024,"Neurofilaments are neuronal intermediate filaments that play an important role in the growth and maintenance of large myelinated axons. Mammalian neurofilaments are composed of three polypeptide subunits, designed as NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, all of which are phosphorylated. Here, we demonstrate by several criteria that neurofilament polypeptides are also modified by an abundant type of intracellular protein glycosylation in which single N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharides are O-glycosidically (O-GlcNAc) linked to serine or threonine residues. In purified neurofilament proteins, the O-GlcNAc modifications occur at a stoichiometry of approximately 0.1 and 0.15 mol of GlcNAc/mol of NF-L and NF-M, respectively. The predominant sites of O-GlcNAc attachment on NF-L and NF-M are identified using proteolysis, purification of the glycopeptides, and subsequent analysis by automated gas-phase sequencing, manual Edman degradation, and laser desorption mass spectrometry. For NF-L, both major sites of glycosylation (Thr21 and Ser27) are located at the NH2-terminal head domain. For NF-M, one major site (Thr48) lies within the NH2-terminal head domain, whereas the other (Thr431) is located at the tail domain. Deletions encompassing these sites have been shown previously to have a dominant detrimental effect upon neurofilament assembly, raising questions about the specific function(s) of the saccharide moieties at these sites. Specific identification of these O-GlcNAc attachment sites has set the stage for more detailed mutagenic analysis of O-GlcNAc functions on neurofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1491650478,"Epithelial glycoprotein 330 (gp330) is structurally similar to the multifunctional alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP), gp330 and alpha 2MR/LRP bind Ca2+ with high affinity, and both receptors bind and mediate endocytosis of alpha 2MR-associated protein (RAP). In the present report, we describe that affinity-purified gp330 from rabbit renal cortex binds plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) complexed with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). alpha 2M-methylamine, which binds with high affinity to alpha 2MR/LRP, did not bind to gp330. The apparent Kd for binding of uPA.PAI-1 complexes was about 0.8 nM at 4 degrees C. The binding was calcium-dependent and inhibited by recombinant RAP (rRAP) and tissue type plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complexes. Thin sections of rabbit renal proximal tubules bound 125I-labeled uPA.PAI-1 and rRAP in the apical part of proximal tubules corresponding to the localization of gp330. The binding of 125I-uPA.PAI-1 complexes in tubules was abolished by excess unlabeled rRAP, and a rRAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of labeled uPA.PAI-1 complexes was demonstrated by perfusion of isolated rabbit proximal tubules. The results establish an endocytotic function of gp330 and suggest that gp330 is an important component of the fibrinolytic system in gp330-containing epithelial as found in, for example, kidney and lung."
https://openalex.org/W1667965282,"We have used H2O2 as a pharmacologic agent to examine the effects of oxidizing conditions on lymphocyte signal pathways. Treatment of Ramos cells with 5-10 mM H2O2 gave rapid and strong tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins and activation of p72syk to levels equal to or greater than that observed upon surface Ig cross-linking. Strong Ca2+ signals that could be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A were also observed under these conditions. However, there was no increase in activity for the Src family kinases p56lck, p59fyn, or p56/p53lyn. Our findings that the p72syk tyrosine kinase responds to H2O2 treatment of cells suggest that this kinase is likely to contribute to cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium signaling induced by oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, H2O2 may be useful as a pharmacologic agent to distinguish the effects of p72syk-related kinases from those of Src family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1593116251,"The study of osteoclast integrins has been previously hampered by the lack of a source of large numbers of purified osteoclasts. Osteoclastoma, a human giant cell tumor of bone, supplied a rich source of osteoclasts within a tissue containing many diverse cell types. Osteoclastoma integrin immunostaining confirmed the presence of the integrin alpha v beta 3 complex and the alpha 2 and beta 1 integrin subunits on osteoclasts. However, weak integrin expression, for example with alpha v beta 5, was difficult to interpret. Purification with magnetic beads coated with vitronectin receptor monoclonal antibody (13C2) enabled osteoclast membranes to be isolated with high purity and yield (57%) from osteoclastoma tissue. Positively (osteoclast-enriched) selected membranes were biochemically assessed for integrin expression by immunoprecipitation and visualization by non-radioactive enhanced chemiluminescence. alpha 1, alpha 4, alpha 6, alpha 8, alpha M, alpha X, gpIIb, beta 4, beta 6, and beta 8 integrin chains were undetectable at a sensitivity of 1 ng. alpha 3, alpha 5, alpha L, beta 2, and alpha v beta 5 were found in the negatively selected osteoclastoma tissue but not in the positively purified osteoclast membranes. The presence of alpha v beta 1 and alpha 2 beta 1 dimers was demonstrated biochemically on the immunoisolated osteoclast membranes. Osteoclast alpha v beta 3 isolation by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) affinity chromatography for NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed that the osteoclast vitronectin receptor was identical to that previously characterized on other cell types. In situ hybridization using human alpha v riboprobes in osteoclasts from human and rodent bone further demonstrated the high level and specificity of expression of alpha v vitronectin receptor in osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W123322873,"RNA helicase A is an abundant nuclear enzyme of HeLa cells that unwinds double-stranded RNA in a 3' to 5'direction (Lee, C. G., and Hurwitz, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4398-4407). A complementary DNA (cDNA) clone expressing RNA helicase A was isolated by screening a human cDNA library with polyclonal antibodies produced against the purified protein. The deduced amino acid sequence from this clone showed that RNA helicase A is a member of the DEAH family of proteins thought to be helicases. Sequence comparison among all known proteins of the DEAH family revealed that the highest homology was between RNA helicase A and the maleless protein (MLE) of Drosophila. There was 49% identity and 85% similarity throughout the overall primary sequences of both proteins, suggesting that RNA helicase A is the human counterpart of Drosophila MLE. Polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila MLE recognized RNA helicase A in crude nuclear extracts of HeLa cells as well as the purified protein. A recombinant RNA helicase A containing 6 histidine residues at the NH2 terminus was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector. The protein isolated from insect cells and the enzyme purified from HeLa cells exhibited identical RNA helicase and RNA-dependent ATPase activities."
https://openalex.org/W115477762,"The potent vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II (ang II) has been shown to promote growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that VSMC synthesize insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), an important autocrine/paracrine growth factor. Exposure of quiescent VSMC to ang II caused a marked increase in IGF I mRNA levels, peaking at 6 h (199 +/- 26% above control) and sustained for at least 24 h. This increase was completely inhibited by actinomycin D. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that ang II stimulated IGF I gene transcription 3.6-fold. Protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide increased basal IGF I mRNA levels but blocked ang II-induced IGF I expression. Immunoreactive IGF I levels in VSMC-conditioned medium were increased by 2.7-fold 24 h following ang II exposure. Measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that ang II caused a 117% increase in DNA synthesis at 24 h that was almost completely inhibited in the presence of an anti-IGF I antibody. Thus, ang II regulates transcription of the IGF I gene in VSMC and IGF I is required for ang II-induced DNA synthesis. These findings suggest a potentially important role for IGF I as a mediator of the vascular growth responses induced by activation of the renin-angiotensin system in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1541177965,"The structural gene for the lactococcal lantibiotic lacticin 481 (lct) has been identified and cloned using a degenerated 20-mer DNA oligonucleotide based on the amino-terminal 7 amino acid residues of the purified protein. The transcription of the lct gene was analyzed, and its promoter was mapped. DNA sequence analysis of the lct gene revealed an open reading frame encoding a peptide of 51 amino acids. Comparison of its deduced amino acid sequence with the amino-terminal sequence and the amino acid composition of lacticin 481 indicates that the 51-residue peptide is prelacticin 481, containing a 27-residue carboxyl-terminal propeptide and a 24-residue amino-terminal leader peptide which lacks the properties of a typical signal sequence and which is significantly different from the leaders of other lantibiotics. The predicted amino acid sequence of prolacticin 481 contains 3 cysteines, 2 serines, and 2 threonines which were not detectable in amino acid analyses of mature lacticin 481. Based on these results and on characterization by two-dimensional NMR techniques, a structural model is proposed in which 2 cysteine residues are involved in lanthionine and one in beta-methyllanthionine formation, and a 4th threonine residue is dehydrated. This model predicts a molecular mass for lacticin 481 of 2,901, which is in excellent agreement with that obtained from mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W1550775209,"An apparent paradox in smooth muscle biology is the ability of unphosphorylated myosin to maintain a filamentous structure in the presence of ATP in vivo, whereas unphosphorylated myosin filaments are depolymerized in vitro in the presence of ATP. This suggests that additional uncharacterized factors are required for the stabilization of myosin filaments in the presence of ATP. We report here that an abundant smooth muscle protein forms sedimentable complexes with unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin, partially reverses the depolymerizing effect of ATP on unphosphorylated myosin, and promotes the assembly of minifilaments as revealed by electron microscopy. This protein is called kinase-related protein (KRP) because it is derived from a gene within the gene for myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and has an amino acid sequence identical to the carboxyl-terminal domain of MLCK. Consistent with the results with purified KRP, deletion of the KRP domain within MLCK results in a diminished ability of MLCK to interact with unphosphorylated myosin. KRP binds to the heavy meromyosin fragment of myosin but not to myosin rod or fragments lacking the hinge region and light chains. Altogether, these results suggest that KRP may play a critical role in stabilizing unphosphorylated myosin filaments and that the KRP domain of MLCK may be important for subcellular targeting to filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1558896136,"The cell surface proteoglycan N-syndecan (syndecan 3) was isolated from neonatal rat brain. Purified brain N-syndecan had biochemical properties very similar to N-syndecan previously identified in Schwann cells: it contained mainly, if not exclusively, heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and had a core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. We examined the interactions between purified N-syndecan and extracellular ligands using a solid phase binding assay. It was found that among all proteins tested, including a variety growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules, only basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) exhibited significant N-syndecan binding. N-syndecan binding to bFGF was saturable and exhibited a KD = 0.5 nM. Soluble bFGF effectively competed with immobilized bFGF for binding to N-syndecan, indicating that these two proteins also interact in solution. Heparin and heparan sulfate, but not chondroitin sulfate, inhibited N-syndecan-bFGF binding. Isolated N-syndecan core protein did not exhibit significant binding to bFGF. Thus, the heparan sulfate chains of N-syndecan, rather than its core protein, appear to be responsible for binding to bFGF. Interestingly, acidic fibroblast growth factor, which is structurally similar to bFGF, did not exhibit significant N-syndecan binding. N-syndecan also did not bind to several other heparin-binding proteins used in this study, indicating a high degree of specificity for the N-syndecan-bFGF interaction. Both N-syndecan and bFGF are abundant in neonatal brain, suggesting that N-syndecan may function as a co-receptor for bFGF during nerve tissue development."
https://openalex.org/W1484742591,"Prolylcarboxypeptidase, a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase, cleaves COOH-terminal amino acids linked to proline, as in angiotensin II and III and [des-Arg9] bradykinin. About 25% of the enzyme protein was sequenced, and the complete sequence was deduced from its human kidney cDNA. The cDNA insert contained an open reading frame of 1488 base pairs coding for a protein of 496 residues. The authentic NH2-terminal sequence matched the deduced protein sequence starting with residue 46, suggesting the presence of both a signal and propeptide. The mature enzyme (451 residues) has a calculated M(r) = 51,043, whereas the M(r) of the purified glycoprotein is 58,000, indicating 12% carbohydrate. The overall sequence identity with serine peptidases is low (10-18%), but sequences around residues of the putative catalytic triad (Ser134, Asp333, His411) are similar (30-67%) to both the serine carboxypeptidases (e.g. deamidase or lysosomal protective protein, yeast carboxypeptidase Y, and KEX1 gene product) and the prolylendopeptidase family. Thus, prolylcarboxypeptidase links these two families, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. It is inhibited (Ki = 2.6 x 10(-7) M) by benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-prolinal, a specific inhibitor of prolylendopeptidase, another angiotensin metabolizing enzyme. Prolylcarboxypeptidase contains serine or threonine residues repeated as the 26th residue 7 out of 9 times, with identical or similar amino acids in other positions in the repeats. The KEX1 gene product contains a similar motif, with serine or threonine as every 27th residue. The importance of prolylcarboxypeptidase is strongly suggested by its presence in various organs and cells and by the substrates it cleaves."
https://openalex.org/W1556916009,"As the sole protein component of low density lipoproteins, apolipoprotein B (apoB) plays an important role in cholesterol metabolism. Previously, we found that the proximal promoter region of apoB (-81 to -52 relative to the start site) played a critical role in hepatocyte-specific gene expression and that that region contained overlapping binding sites for nuclear factors AF-1 (-81 to -62) and C/EBP (-69 to -52) (Metzger, S., Leff, T., and Breslow, J. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9978-9983). In this study, we show that HNF-4, a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, binds the AF-1 site on the apoB promoter and through it activates transcription in transient transfection assays in both liver and non-liver cell lines, HepG2 and HeLa, respectively. Mutational analysis of the AF-1/HNF-4 binding site indicated a correlation of HNF-4 binding and transcriptional activity. In addition, transient co-transfection experiments with HNF-4 and C/EBP alpha expression vectors showed that the two factors can synergistically activate transcription to levels more than 3-fold above the sum of either factor alone. Finally, using gel retardation analysis we show that purified HNF-4 and C/EBP proteins can concurrently occupy their overlapping binding sites on the apoB promoter in vitro. However, since the same system showed a lack of cooperative binding, we argue that an alternative mechanism is responsible for the synergistic effect of HNF-4 and C/EBP alpha on apoB gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1509504914,"Partial assembly of the peripheral and integral membrane sectors of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase has been detected in mutants lacking one subunit of the enzyme. Assembled complexes of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase could be immunoprecipitated from biosynthetically labeled wild-type cells using monoclonal antibodies specific for the 69- and 60-kDa subunits of the enzyme, and assembled membrane (V0) sectors could be immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the 100-kDa subunits. Parallel immunoprecipitations from mutant cells lacking one subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase revealed different degrees of assembly depending on the subunit that was missing. Partially assembled complexes of the peripheral subunits could also be detected in a soluble, cytoplasmic fraction from wild-type and mutant cells following glycerol gradient fractionation. The results indicate that the peripheral (V1) sector and integral membrane (V0) sectors of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase can assemble independently. The 69-, 60-, and 27-kDa subunits all appear to be necessary for any assembly of the V1 sector to occur, but these subunits and the 32-kDa subunit can assemble into a complex in the absence of the 42-kDa peripheral subunit. The implications of the results for the structure and assembly of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1507156025,"The single-stranded nucleocapsid protein that coats the RNA genome of human immunodeficiency virus within the virion core has been produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The mature 55-amino acid protein, normally generated from the gag polyprotein precursor by HIV protease-catalyzed processing of both its amino and carboxyl termini, was produced in E. coli with authentic termini directly, without the need for processing. The protein was purified 30-fold to apparent homogeneity, as determined by both amino acid analysis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sequencing of each terminus of the purified protein indicated that no proteolytic degradation occurred. A molar extinction coefficient (epsilon 280 = 8350 cm-1 M-1) was determined. The purified nucleocapsid protein binds tightly to single-stranded RNA as judged by a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. A binding constant (Kw) of 1 x 10(8) M-1 was calculated. Using fluorescence quenching of nucleocapsid protein upon RNA binding as an assay, a binding site size of seven nucleotides was determined. These results contrast to a larger 15-nucleotide site measured by others for a larger form of nucleocapsid protein-containing sequences from its immature precursor. The possible relevance of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607224521,"Proteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid precursor proteins (APP) is required for release of the beta/A4 protein and its deposition into the amyloid plaques characteristic of aging and Alzheimer's disease. We have examined the involvement of acidic intracellular compartments in APP processing in cultured human cells. The use of acidotropic agents and inhibitors to a specific class of lysosomal protease, coupled with metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed that APP is degraded within an acidic compartment to produce at least 12 COOH-terminal fragments. Nine likely contain the entire beta/A4 domain and, therefore, are potentially amyloidogenic. Treatment with E64 or Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 irreversibly blocked activities of the lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L but did not inhibit the lysosomal aspartic protease cathepsin D and did not alter the production of potentially amyloidogenic fragments. Instead, the inhibitors prevented further degradation of the fragments. Thus, large numbers of potentially amyloidogenic fragments of APP are routinely generated in an acidic compartment by noncysteine proteases and then are eliminated within lysosomes by cysteine proteases. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that chronic cysteine protease inhibition leads to accumulation of potentially amyloidogenic APP fragments in lysosomes. The results provide further support for the hypothesis that an acidic compartment may be involved in amyloid formation and begin to define the proteolytic events that may be important for amyloidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1509603461,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the dual active amylopullulanase of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus 39E (formerly Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum) was determined. The structural gene (apu) contained a single open reading frame 4443 base pairs in length, corresponding to 1481 amino acids, with an estimated molecular weight of 162,780. Analysis of the deduced sequence of apu with sequences of alpha-amylases and alpha-1,6 debranching enzymes enabled the identification of four conserved regions putatively involved in substrate binding and in catalysis. The conserved regions were localized within a 2.9-kilobase pair gene fragment, which encoded a M(r) 100,000 protein that maintained the dual activities and thermostability of the native enzyme. The catalytic residues of amylopullulanase were tentatively identified by using hydrophobic cluster analysis for comparison of amino acid sequences of amylopullulanase and other amylolytic enzymes. Asp597, Glu626, and Asp703 were individually modified to their respective amide form, or the alternate acid form, and in all cases both alpha-amylase and pullulanase activities were lost, suggesting the possible involvement of 3 residues in a catalytic triad, and the presence of a putative single catalytic site within the enzyme. These findings substantiate amylopullulanase as a new type of amylosaccharidase."
https://openalex.org/W1589850033,"On screening 440 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, a mutant strain SE5312 which accumulated apolipoprotein (ALP) at 42 degrees C was identified. In vitro assay of apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase activity indicated that the mutant cell envelope contained reduced activity as compared to the wild-type strain. Transduction with a Mud-P22 mapping set placed the ts mutation to 14-17 min region of the S. typhimurium chromosome. P22 transduction using transposon insertions in this region revealed a linkage of the ts mutation to cobD (6%), nag (8%), and corC68 (99%). The ts phenotype was complemented by a 2.3-kilobase EcoRI subclone derived from lambda-phage 170 of Kohara's bank of Escherichia coli. Restriction enzyme analysis of the cloned DNA revealed that this 2.3-kilobase EcoRI fragment included the copper transport (cutE) gene in E. coli. The mutant strain SE5312 was copper-sensitive at 30 degrees C, and the complementing clone conferred copper resistance and restored the ALP N-acyltransferase activity in the mutant cell. Wild-type strain of S. typhimurium harboring this clone exhibited elevated levels of ALP N-acyltransferase activity. These results suggest that the cloned gene encodes the ALP N-acyltransferase. Upon shift to the non-permissive temperature, the viability of the mutant cells decreased, and the mutant cells assumed anomalous morphology. Temperature-resistant revertants could be readily isolated, and a subset of tr revertants contained no detectable lipoprotein. A lpp::Tn10 derivative of the mutant SE5312 was also temperature-resistant. These observations suggest that ALP N-acyltransferase is essential for the growth and viability of S. typhimurium, and this requirement is decreased in the absence of major outer membrane lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1510480381,"A homogenate of epidermal cells isolated from human skin converted arachidonic acid to 12S-hydroxy-5, 8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and 15-hydroxy-5, 8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid as the main lipoxygenase products. The production of these hydroxy acids was not stimulated by the addition of 1 mM NADPH required for cytochrome P-450 reaction, but inhibited by 65-75% with 40 microM nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a nonspecific lipoxygenase inhibitor. In addition to these lipoxygenase products, the epidermal cell homogenate converted arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 together with minor amounts of prostaglandins D2 and F2a and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid. Thromboxane B2 was not detected. This finding rules out the possible contamination of platelet 12-lipoxygenase in the epidermal cells. After subcellular fractionation of the epidermal cell homogenate, the 12-lipoxygenase activity was found in the 164,000 x g supernatant, the 164,000 x g pellet, and the 10,000 x g pellet. The cytosolic enzyme and the enzymes solubilized from the two pellets produced 12S-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid as the primary product in contrast to cytochrome P-450 which produces primarily hydroxy acids. The 12-lipoxygenase in the 164,000 x g supernatant and the solubilized enzymes from the 164,000 x g pellet and 10,000 x g pellet were precipitable by antibodies raised against human platelet 12-lipoxygenase, but not by antibodies against porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase. The immunoprecipitated 12-lipoxygenase from each fraction was almost inactive with linoleic acid as substrate, characteristic of 12-lipoxygenase of platelet-type. Furthermore, 12-lipoxygenase mRNA in the epidermal cells could be reverse-transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the primers specific for human platelet 12-lipoxygenase cDNA, but not with those for porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase cDNA. Thus, the 12-lipoxygenase of human epidermal cells is similar to human platelet 12-lipoxygenase in terms of immunogenicity, catalytic property, and primary structure, and distinct from leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1607085392,"The relationship between the cholesterol ester (CE) transfer activity of lipid transfer protein (LTP) and its affinity with lipid and lipoprotein particles was investigated. The study of the effects of chemical modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) amino groups and carboxyl groups on the CE transfer activity showed that the maximal activity is obtained upon succinylation or acetylation of approximately 7% of LDL amino groups. Further increases in the extent of modification progressively reduced the transfer activity. The treatment of LDL with fatty acids gave results comparable to the chemical modification of LDL amino groups. The addition of low concentrations of fatty acids was stimulatory, while that of high concentrations was inhibitory. Although increases in the positive charges of LDL by the carboxyl group modification did not appreciably influence the CE transfer, the addition of cationic detergents gave a profound effect on the CE transfer. A maximal CE transfer activity was obtained upon addition of very small amounts of the detergents, with the higher concentrations sharply reducing the transfer activity. We also studied the effects of the concentrations of phosphate buffer and various salts on the CE transfer as well as the affinity of LTP for very low density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins 3, and high density lipoproteins 2. It appeared that the affinity of LTP for various lipoproteins is governed by a delicate balance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Optimal degrees of the interaction of LTP with both donor and acceptor particles seem to be required for the maximal degree of CE transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1664968680,"To gain direct insight into the action of the second messenger Ca2+ on transcriptional regulation, we have developed an intact cell model in which the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can be measured, set, and varied at any level within the physiological range and in which the expression of early response genes is assayed in parallel. Using promyelocytic HL-60 cells, we have observed an exquisite sensitivity to Ca2+ of c-fos, c-jun, and zif268 mRNA accumulation, since early and maximal inductions were observed at 200-300 nM [Ca2+]i. At early times (10-20 min), the [Ca2+]i dose dependence of c-fos transcription and mRNA accumulation displayed a bell shape since c-fos expression was barely modified at high (700-1,250 nM) [Ca2+]i. The threshold [Ca2+]i concentration for prolonged (60 min) c-fos mRNA accumulation was greater than 200 nM. This indicates that the quantitative effects of Ca2+ on a given gene can vary markedly as a function of both the [Ca2+]i concentration and the duration of stimulation. Strikingly, a [Ca2+]i perturbation of only 1 min was sufficient for full induction of c-fos and zif268 transcripts. This demonstrates that a transient perturbation of [Ca2+]i has long term effects on gene expression. The half-life of c-fos mRNA (16 min) was unaltered by Ca2+. Nuclear run-on analysis of the distribution of RNA polymerase II along the c-fos locus indicated that Ca2+ promotes a small increase in transcriptional initiation and a pronounced relief of a block to transcriptional elongation beyond intron 1. The extreme sensitivity to [Ca2+]i, in terms of both the length of time and the dose of [Ca2+]i required for maximal gene induction, demonstrates that Ca2+ is a major physiological regulator of early response gene expression. In addition, the results indicate that a c-fos intragenic element is the main target of Ca(2+)-regulated transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1503487629,"Foreign secretory pathway proteins are often produced in surprisingly low amounts in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. One possible reason for this is that heterologous signal peptides might be inefficiently recognized by the insect cell protein translocation machinery. This idea was supported by a recent study showing that secretion of a plant protein in the baculovirus system was enhanced when its signal peptide was replaced with an insect-derived signal peptide (Tessier, D. C., Thomas, D. Y., Khouri, H. E., Laliberte, F., and Vernet, T. (1991) Gene (Amst.) 98, 177-183). We have extended these observations by measuring the effects of different signal peptide and signal peptide-prosequence combinations on baculovirus-mediated expression and secretion of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Replacement of the native prepropeptide with signal peptides from a lepidopteran insect secretory protein (cecropin B), a major baculovirus structural glycoprotein (64K), or an abundant, highly conserved lumenal protein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (GRP78/BiP, a 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein/immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), had no significant effect on t-PA expression or secretion. The same results were obtained with the signal peptide from honeybee prepromellitin, which was able to enhance secretion of plant propapain (Tessier et al., 1991 (above)). Similar results were obtained when heterologous signal peptides were combined with the native prosequence or when the intact cecropin B preprosequence was used. Translational initiation at an upstream, in-frame ATT, which could functionally inactivate any signal peptide, did not explain the low efficiency of t-PA secretion. Finally, deletion of the native signal peptide, prosequence, or both, failed to increase t-PA production. These results showed that insect-derived signal peptides and/or prosequences cannot always enhance the expression and/or secretion of foreign secretory pathway proteins in the baculovirus system. They also suggested that the inability of insect cells to recognize the processing signals in human t-PA efficiently is probably not the major factor preventing its high level production in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1784523242,"In the mouse keratinocyte line HEL-30 the epidermal mitogen transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) stimulated the rapid release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The liberation of arachidonic acid was due to the activation of a Ca(2+)-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The activation mechanism critically depended on a functionally active epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and occurred independently of phospholipase C-mediated increases in cellular diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentrations and protein kinase C activation. The activation included an increase in cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) activity and an association of the enzyme with the membrane fraction. Both activation steps apparently occurred in the presence of basal cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Moreover, cPLA2 or a closely associated protein was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine upon TGF-alpha challenge of the cells. The data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the TGF-alpha-induced activation of cPLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1573847134,"Although purified proteins will refold and assemble in vitro, it is not known if cellular factors change the mechanisms of these processes. Based on the gel migration of folding intermediates, the kinetic relationships between these intermediates, and on the order of formation of six disulfide bonds, we have found that the in vitro folding pathway of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit (hCG-beta) is indistinguishable from the intracellular folding pathway. The same rate-limiting event was found in both folding environments; however, the t1/2 for this step in a cell is 4 min, whereas in vitro the t1/2 was > or = 80 min. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) increased the in vitro rate of this event (t1/2 = 25 min) without changing the order of disulfide bond formation. PDI also catalyzed the in vitro rate of assembly of hCG subunits. In intact cells, assembly of the alpha beta heterodimer occurs before all of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of beta are formed. In vitro, assembly was increased after reduction of two of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide bonds of hCG-beta by PDI. These results strongly suggest that both in intact cells and in vitro, partially unfolded hCG-beta is more assembly-competent than is fully folded hCG-beta. The comparison of in vitro and intracellular hCG-beta folding and hCG subunit assembly which is shown in this report indicates that the assisted folding and assembly pathway that occurs in cells, where proteins such as PDI play a role, differs only in rate but not in the order of disulfide bond formation or in the precursor-product relationships among the folding intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1580786676,We have obtained genomic DNA encoding the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible IFP 53/tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Comparison with several different IFP 53 cDNA clones revealed a complex pattern of alternatively spliced 5'-untranslated regions. The interferon-responsive region within the IFP 53 promoter was found to contain a gamma-interferon activation site (GAS) but not the interferon-stimulated response element and to bind the gamma-interferon activation factor (GAF). GAF.GAS complexes contained the IFN-regulated 91-kDa protein. Competition experiments defined the GAS boundaries and showed that GAF binding to the IFP 53 GAS could be prevented by an excess of the IFN-gamma response regions of several other IFN-gamma-inducible genes. We thus provide evidence for a central role of GAS.GAF in gene transcription mediated by IFN-gamma and suggest a consensus sequence defining more precisely the requirements for GAF binding to DNA.
https://openalex.org/W6664855,"The ubiquitous cytoplasmic phosphoprotein stathmin was proposed to play a general role as an intracellular relay integrating diverse signals regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and functions of cells (Sobel, A. (1991) Trends Biol. Sci. 16, 301-305). It was originally identified in mammalian cells and tissues, but antibodies directed against the mammalian protein also recognized a stathmin-like 19-kDa protein in all vertebrate classes. The immunoreactive protein in Xenopus laevis displayed, like mammalian stathmin, several nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated heat-soluble forms with distinct migration on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Screening of Xenopus oocyte and brain cDNA libraries with a rat stathmin cDNA probe allowed us to isolate several stathmin-related cDNA clones, among which clone XO35 encodes the Xenopus homologue of stathmin whose deduced amino acid sequence is 79% identical to and displays most of the characteristic structural features of the mammalian protein. In particular, one of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the two ""proline-directed"" kinase-specific sites known to be phosphorylated in rat stathmin are also present in the Xenopus protein. Furthermore, two other sets of clones coding for related proteins belonging to the stathmin gene family were also isolated; clone SC15 encodes the Xenopus homologue of SCG10, a rat protein specifically related to neuronal differentiation; clone XB3 encodes a protein which, as SCG10 or SC15, possesses a stathmin-like domain and an additional N-terminal extension but is more distant from SCG10 than SC15. Interestingly, the mRNA transcripts of Xenopus stathmin (XO35) appear ubiquitous, like stathmin in mammals, whereas the SC15 and XB3 mRNAs appeared as markers of the nervous tissue in Xenopus. During Xenopus oogenesis, stathmin accumulates and remains stable as a maternal product throughout early development. Concurrently, its phosphorylation is regulated from essentially unphosphorylated forms to highly phosphorylated ones in the mature egg, which are then progressively dephosphorylated again from the midblastula to the tailbud stage. Altogether, our results demonstrate the high evolutionary conservation of stathmin together with the members of its related gene family, not only at the level of their molecular structures, but also of their biochemical and biological regulation. These observations are thus further in favor of a very general and likely essential role of stathmin in the normal control of cells throughout development and in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W1563975346,"A temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of Salmonella typhimurium that accumulated unmodified murein prolipoprotein at 42 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C was identified. In vivo and in vitro studies of the biosynthesis of Braun's lipoprotein revealed that this mutant (SE5221) was defective in the glyceryl modification of prolipoprotein. The ts mutation was mapped to 60.6 min of the S. typhimurium chromosome and was linked to argA and cysH. A clone with a 1.4-kilobase S. typhimurium DNA insert that complemented the ts mutation and restored the prolipoprotein modification activity both in vivo and in vitro was isolated. DNA sequencing of the complementing region revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with 291 amino acids lacking NH2-terminal signal sequence. This open reading frame is immediately 5' to the thyA gene and is allelic to umpA of Escherichia coli. Wild-type strains harboring the cloned gene exhibited elevated levels of prolipoprotein modification activity. At the non-permissive temperature, the mutation affected both growth and viability, and the mutant cells exhibited anomalous cell morphology. The ts phenotype was suppressed by the introduction of a lpp::Tn10 mutation. These results suggest that the cloned gene encodes prolipoprotein glyceryl transferase (lgt), and in the wild-type background, this prolipoprotein modification enzyme is essential for the growth and viability of S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1581227689,"phi 29 DNA polymerase shares with other alpha-like DNA polymerases several regions of amino acid similarity. Among them, the conserved region characterized by the amino acid motif Kx3NSxYG has been proposed to form part of the polymerization active site of alpha-like DNA polymerases. Mutants in phi 29 DNA polymerase residue Tyr390 of this conserved motif had been previously described to be affected in DNA-dependent dNTP binding. In this paper, the functional significance of this conserved motif is further studied by the analysis of mutants in conserved residues Asn387, Ser388, and Gly391. Residue Phe393 of phi 29 DNA polymerase has also been selected as target for site-directed mutagenesis because of its conservation within the group of alpha-like DNA polymerases from genomes that replicate by a protein-priming mechanism. Mutant N387Y was shown to be affected both in initiation and polymerization reactions, showing 3-fold higher Km value for dATP and more than 11-fold lower Vmax value than the wild-type enzyme in the initiation reaction; moreover, it was affected in enzyme-DNA translocation. Mutant S388G retained initiation and polymerization activities; interestingly, this mutation significantly increased the efficiency of dNTP incorporation in non-templated reactions. Mutation Gly391 to Asp abolished template-primer binding as shown by gel retardation assays; this mutant was drastically affected in template-dependent dNTP incorporation both in initiation and polymerization reactions, but the efficiency of the non-templated phi 29 terminal protein-deoxynucleotidylation was higher than with the wild-type protein. Mutation Phe393 to Tyr severely decreased initial binding to template-primer DNA molecules, resulting in a reduced activity in DNA primer-dependent polymerization reactions but not in phi 29 terminal protein-dependent ones."
https://openalex.org/W1487225701,"We constructed a library of 512 kinds of Fv fragment, derivatives of a monoclonal antibody, D1.3, specific for hen egg-white lysozyme, in which a total of nine of the original amino acids were replaced by closely related amino acids at positions in the complementarity-determining regions of the H chain. More than 80% of the clones in the library produced Fv fragments in Escherichia coli. Two wild-type and 13 mutant Fv fragments were prepared in large quantities and subjected to analysis by differential titration calorimetry. The association constants of the 15 Fv fragments with hen egg-white lysozyme were distributed between 0.12 x 10(7) and 1.59 x 10(8) M-1. The changes in delta H0 and -T delta S0 caused by one-point mutation at each position did not have intrinsic values for each change. The same changes at one position had different effects on KA, delta H0, and -T delta S0 when differences had been introduced in other regions. The delta(delta G0) caused by a single-point mutation ranged from -0.56 to 1.56 kcal/mol. By contrast, the delta(delta H0) and delta(-T delta S0) caused by a single-point mutation ranged from -3.5 to 3.4 and from -3.8 to 3.4 kcal/mol, respectively. When antibodies gain the binding energy contributed by the effects of enthalpy, they lose the binding energy contributed by the effects of entropy and vice versa. In general, changes in entropy compensate for changes in enthalpy."
https://openalex.org/W1520184049,"Dolichyl-phosphate-mannose synthase is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the formation of dolichyl phosphate mannose from dolichyl phosphate and GDP-mannose. It is an essential enzyme for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and, like other enzymes that utilize some form of the lipid as substrate, dolichyl-phosphate-mannose synthase contains a putative dolichol recognition in the predicted membrane-spanning domain. To investigate the importance of this sequence in particular and the hydrophobic region in general, a series of mutants of dolichyl-phosphate-mannose synthase were constructed that contained successive deletions or mutations of the hydrophobic region, and their in vivo functions and in vitro activities were examined. While all of the mutant proteins exhibited decreased transferase activities in vitro compared to the wild-type enzyme, the sequence was not essential for growth or for protein glycosylation in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, although deletion of the entire hydrophobic region resulted in a soluble protein, mutant proteins containing 3 or 8 hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl terminus were still membrane-associated. These mutant proteins could be released from membranes by treatment with sodium carbonate, indicating peripheral associations."
https://openalex.org/W1552897748,"A lux-specific DNA-binding protein was purified to homogeneity from Vibrio harveyi by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, DNA-cellulose, Superose 12, and Mono Q. A single polypeptide of M(r) = 23,000 was found on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an amino-terminal sequence corresponding to that predicted for luxR, a gene that causes a shift in the transcriptional start site from position -123 to -26 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon of luxC in the V. harveyi lux operon and is required for high expression of lux mRNA in recombinant Escherichia coli. Identification of the DNA-binding protein as LuxR was confirmed by showing its absence in V. harveyi luxR-mutants and its synthesis in recombinant E. coli containing V. harveyi luxR. The LuxR protein was shown to bind to two specific (A + T)-rich regions of DNA upstream of the V. harveyi luxC gene: region A, -290 to -253 base pairs, and region B, -170 to -116 base pairs. Synthetic poly(dA-dT) but not poly(dA)-poly(dT) competed with the lux DNA for binding to LuxR suggesting that this protein may be a novel poly(dA-dT)-binding protein in prokaryotes. The LuxR protein inhibited transcription from the -123 promoter in vitro; however, transcription from the -26 promoter was not reconstituted suggesting the possible requirement for other factors in lux gene regulation. LuxR shared sequence identity with two proteins linked to the regulation of enzymes involved in electron transport indicating that it may be a member of a family of regulators of metabolic functions responsible for diverting electrons from the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W1547424797,"We have proposed that the antifreeze activity of an alanine-rich alpha-helical antifreeze polypeptide (AFP) is due in part to side-by-side hydrophobic interactions of AFP molecules bound on the ice surface (Wen, D., and Laursen, R. A. (1992b) Biophys. J. 63, 1659-1662). To test this hypothesis and to assess the importance of a hydrophobic surface on the outward facing (non-ice-binding) portions of the helix, we synthesized several AFP analogs with up to four Ala-->Gln or Ala-->Leu replacements and determined the effect of these changes on antifreeze activity and helix stability. Although Gln replacements caused some helix destabilization and resultant reduction of antifreeze activity, they were in general well tolerated, suggesting that the bulk hydrophobicity of the non-ice-binding faces of the AFP, per se, is probably not a major factor determining AFP activity. However, placement of either Gln or Leu in position 17 on one side of the helix completely abolished activity, demonstrating that the specific location of bulky groups can dramatically alter activity. We conclude from molecular modeling studies that the effect seen by placing bulky groups in position 17 is due to steric hindrance that prevents effective association or packing of AFP molecules on the ice surface, in support of our hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W42380194,"A mutant human insulin receptor that lacked the 82 amino acids of the COOH terminus of the beta-subunit (del82) was studied. Both the wild type insulin receptor (HIR) and the mutant receptor were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by stable transfection. Autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activities toward exogenous substrates of solubilized and partially purified del82 were severely impaired. When CHO cells transfected with del82 (CHO-del82) were stimulated with insulin, autophosphorylation was decreased to a great extent compared with cells expressing HIR (CHO-HIR). Nevertheless, tyrosine phosphorylation of an endogenous substrate, pp185, and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in CHO-del82 was comparable with that in CHO-HIR. Insulin-stimulated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in CHO-del82 was also equivalent to that in CHO-HIR. Moreover, CHO-del82 exhibited the same insulin sensitivity as CHO-HIR with respect to 2-deoxyglucose uptake and thymidine incorporation into DNA. Insulin-induced internalization in CHO-del82 was decreased by 46% as compared with that in CHO-HIR. These data suggest that: 1) the COOH-terminal domain of the insulin receptor may play an inhibitory role in the phosphorylation of pp185 and IRS-1; and 2) phosphorylation of substrates such as pp185 and IRS-1, rather than autophosphorylation of the receptor per se, correlates better with certain biological effects that were mediated by insulin, suggesting that phosphorylation of the substrates might be sufficient for transducing signals downstream."
https://openalex.org/W1604797839,"The major pathological change in Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of 39-42-amino acid beta-amyloid peptide (BAP) in the brain. Since BAP begins at the aspartate residue (Asp1, or codon 672 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)770 transcript), the ability of several proteases to cleave the peptide bond methionine-Asp1 (M/D) was evaluated by using peptides and recombinant APP molecules as substrates. Cathepsin G and chymotrypsin cleave the synthetic peptide HSEVKMDAEF at M/D under acidic conditions, whereas cleavage at lysine-methionine (K/M) predominates when the pH is alkaline. Trypsin and cathepsins B, D, and L are unable to cleave the synthetic peptide at M/D. Peptide SEVNLDAEF, representing the mutation found in early onset Alzheimer's disease families from Sweden, is cleaved by cathepsin G and chymotrypsin at leucine-aspartate (L/D). Incubation of cathepsin G with soluble protease nexin-2 obtained from recombinant APP (APP-REP) derivatives resulted in proteolytic cleavage at or near the amino terminus of BAP. Cathepsin G-mediated cleavage was also observed in the domain representing the amino terminus of BAP when mature plasma membrane-associated APP-REP molecules were used as substrates. Our results strongly suggest the involvement of a chymotrypsin-like serine protease in the generation of the amino terminus of BAP beginning at Asp1."
https://openalex.org/W1529637757,"Abstract DNA photolyases catalyze the light-dependent repair of pyrimidine dimers in DNA. We have utilized chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis to probe the interactions involved in substrate recognition by the yeast photolyase Phr1. Lys517 was protected from reductive methylation in the presence of substrate, but not in its absence, and the specific and nonspecific association constants for substrate binding by Phr1 (Lys517-->Ala) were decreased 10-fold. These results establish a role for Lys517 in substrate binding. Mutations at Arg507, Lys463, and Trp387 reduced both the overall affinity for substrate and substrate discrimination. Sites of altered interactions in ES complexes were identified by methylation and ethylation interference techniques. Interaction with the base immediately 3' to the dimer was altered in the Phr1(Lys517-->Ala). DNA complex, whereas interactions with the phosphate and base immediately 5' to the dimer were reduced when Phr1(Arg507-->Ala) bound substrate. Multiple interactions 5' and 3' to the dimer were perturbed in complexes containing Phr1(Trp387-->Ala) or Phr1(Lys463-->Ala). In addition the quantum yield for dimer photolysis by Phr1(Trp387-->Ala) was reduced 3-fold. The locations of these mutations establish that a portion of the DNA binding domain is comprised of residues in the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal half of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1574699660,"The transgenic mouse models expressing beta s-globin genes do not fully exhibit the sickling phenotype, primarily as a result of the inhibition of beta s-chain-dependent polymerization by the mouse alpha-chains. The mouse alpha-chain differs from the human alpha-chain at 19 sequence locations. Of these, only alpha 78 and alpha 116 are the known hemoglobin (Hb) S polymer contact sites. To define whether the inhibition of polymerization by the mouse alpha-chain is solely a consequence of the differences at these two sites or additional sites of sequence differences are also involved, we have constructed chimeric alpha-chains by employing the alpha-globin semisynthetic reaction (Sahni, G., Cho, Y. J., Iyer, K. S., Khan, S. A., Seetharam, R., and Acharya, A. S. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 5456-5461). Mouse alpha 1-30 was spliced with human alpha 31-141 using endoproteinase Glu-C to generate a chimeric alpha-globin (alpha MH) containing eight of the 19 sequence differences of mouse alpha-globin. Similarly, human alpha 1-30 was spliced with mouse alpha 31-141 to generate another chimeric alpha-globin (alpha HM) containing 11 sequence differences. The respective chimeric globins were purified, reconstituted with heme and beta s-chain into tetrameric hemoglobin, and the tetramers were purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The inhibitory potential of the chimeric alpha MH-chain on the polymerization is 10-fold lower than that of the mouse alpha-chain. The absence of the alpha 31-141 region of the mouse alpha-chain relieves only a portion of the inhibition. The inhibitory potential of alpha MH contributed by the mouse alpha 1-30 segment is significant although none of the sequence differences in this segment are located at any of the implicated polymer contact sites. The chimeric alpha HM-chain also inhibits the polymerization, but the extent of inhibition is again lower (4-fold) than that of the full-length mouse alpha-chain. The results demonstrate that the inhibitory potential of mouse alpha-chains involves the sequence differences from both the alpha 1-30 and alpha 31-141 regions. Besides, since the sum of the inhibitory potential of either of these chimeric alpha-chains is lower than that of the intact mouse alpha-chains, we speculate that conformational changes that require the copresence of sequence differences in both portions of the mouse alpha-chain also contribute to the inhibitory propensity of the mouse alpha-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1517754460,"Protein-tyrosine kinases play crucial roles in the activation and transformation of T lymphocytes. In this study, we have identified a variant of the fyn kinase at 70-72 kDa (termed p72fyn-R) that can preferentially associate with the TcR/CD3 complex in certain T cells. Phosphoamine acid analysis revealed that the CD3-associated p72fyn-R is labeled on both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. TcR/CD3-associated p72fyn-R could be specifically reprecipitated using anti-fyn antisera to both the N and C terminus of p59fyn. In addition, two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide map patterns of TcR/CD3-associated p72fyn and anti-fyn-precipitable p72 were identical. By contrast, a comparison of p72fyn-R and p62fyn showed similarities and differences. p72fyn-R possesses a peptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site that migrates in the same position as found for p59/62fyn. However, p72fyn-R possessed at least four novel phosphorylated sites labeled on serine and threonine residues that are absent in the p62fyn pattern. Phosphatase digestion experiments indicated that p72fyn-R is more resistant to dephosphorylation than p59/62fyn. Two-dimensional phosphotryptic analysis indicated that the novel serine/threonine phosphorylation sites were responsible for the resistance to phosphatase digestion. Although the exact nature of the relationship between p72fyn-R and p59/62fyn remains undetermined, these data indicate that TcR/CD3 may utilize novel variants of src-related kinases in the generation of signals which regulate T-cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1540669915,"Oxidation of many prostaglandins at C-15 results in the formation of 15-keto metabolites, which have reduced biological activity. This reaction is catalyzed by NAD(+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. Using the photoaffinity analog of NAD+, [alpha-32P]nicotinamide-2-azidoadenine dinucleotide, we have identified a peptide in the adenine ring binding domain of the NAD+ binding site of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. The specificity of photolabeling was demonstrated by saturation and protection experiments. Saturation of photolabeling was observed at approximately 45-50 microM with an apparent Kd of 8-10 microM. Approximately 90% of photolabeling could be protected by 200 microM NAD+ when the protein was photolyzed in the presence of 10 microM probe. The photolabeled protein was digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 or chymotrypsin, and the photolabeled peptides were purified by either boronate affinity chromatography or Fe+3 chelate chromatography followed by reverse phase HPLC. The photolabeled peptide region was identified to be Val32-Glu40."
https://openalex.org/W95494611,"Several analogs of an alanine-rich alpha-helical antifreeze polypeptide were synthesized and studied to evaluate the role of charged amino acids on structure and activity. alpha-Helix content and thermal stability were assessed by circular dichroism spectrometry and antifreeze activity by freezing point depression (thermal hysteresis) and ice crystal growth rate measurements. Rearrangement, deletion and replacement of charged amino acids resulted in reduced helicity and antifreeze activity in some cases, but the effects were not dramatic. We conclude that the i+4 ion pair Lys18/Glu22 helps to stabilize the alpha-helix but is not absolutely essential for activity. NH2-terminal Asp does not contribute significantly to helix stability or activity, but the COOH terminus is sensitive to modification, since replacement of Arg37 can lead to reduced helix content and activity. In general, factors which reduce alpha-helix content also reduce antifreeze activity."
https://openalex.org/W1546237539,"To understand the interaction between elastin and elastase, elastin from human aorta was incubated with human leukocyte elastase under conditions favoring proteolysis. Low molecular weight species were separated from the protein fraction by a small centrifuged gel filtration column. The only product of the elastin digest detected on acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was a single band of slower cathodal mobility than human leukocyte elastase alone. This band cross-reacts with antibody to human elastase, indicating that the slow migrating band contains elastase. The putative human leukocyte elastase-elastin-derived peptide complex was treated with hydroxylamine to cleave any possible acyl-enzyme complexes and was then measured for amidolytic activity. Analysis of the amino acid composition of elastin-derived peptide indicates the presence of alanine, glycine, and richness in hydrophobic residues, suggesting that these residues are involved in elastase interaction(s). Incubation of the elastase-elastin-derived peptide with alpha 1-protease inhibitor causes dissociation of the complex and formation of an elastase-alpha 1-protease inhibitor complex. Our results suggest that, locally at the site of proteolysis, elastase activity may be regulated by elastin-derived peptide(s) during elastinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1550645517,"A temperature-sensitive mutant defective in DNA replication, tsFT5, has been isolated from the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line FM3A. DNA synthesis in tsFT5 cells at a restrictive temperature (39 degrees C) has been characterized in detail. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine decreased rapidly after an increase in temperature to 39 degrees C and the incorporation was less than 20% and 10% of the initial level after 4 and 8 h, respectively. Analysis by DNA fiber autoradiography revealed that the initiation of DNA replication at the origin of the replicons was impaired in tsFT5 cells but that the DNA chain elongation rate of the mutant cells did not decrease at the nonpermissive temperature. tsFT5 cells were confirmed to belong to the complementation group which includes ts85 cells arrested mainly in the G2 phase at the nonpermissive temperature. It has been observed that the amount of ubiquintin-conjugated histone H2A (uH2A) in ts85 cells decreases at the nonpermissive temperature (Marunouchi, T., Yasuda, H., Matsumoto, Y., and Yamada, M. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 95, 126-131). The amount of uH2A in tsFT5 cells also decreased rapidly at 39 degrees C. This decrease occurred at the same time as or slightly preceding to reduction in DNA synthesis, and the reappearance of uH2A was followed by the restoration of DNA synthesis after the temperature was reduced. A similar temporal relationship between decrease in the amount of uH2A and reduction in DNA synthesis was observed in ts85 cells cultured at 39 degrees C. However, the rates of the decrease of uH2A and of the reduction in DNA synthesis in ts85 cells were slower than those observed in tsFT5 cells. A comparison of the thermolability of purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1s revealed that the E1 from ts85 cells had a thermolability intermediate between those of the E1 from tsFT5 cells and of the wild-type cells. A reduction in the phosphorylation of histone H1 was observed in tsFT5 cells cultured at 39 degrees C, but the reduction occurred several hours after the decrease in uH2A and the reduction in DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1906175594,"A mouse cDNA clone for the ethanol-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P450IIE1) was obtained by screening a liver cDNA library with an oligonucleotide representing a consensus sequence found in the orthologous rat, human, and rabbit sequences. The protein sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence had an identity of 93% to rat, 81% to rabbit, and 76% to human orthologous sequences. The highest levels of P450IIE1 mRNA were found in liver of both sexes, and male kidney. Developmentally, C57BL/6 female liver P450IIE1 mRNA was detectable 1 day postpartum and reached steady-state levels in animals approximately 16-20 days of age. Kidney and adrenal gland P450IIE1 mRNA was found to be induced 25-50-fold and 4-fold by testosterone treatment, respectively, and the level in both tissues reached maximum levels between 12 h and 2 days after treatment. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that testosterone treatment for 24-48 h resulted in a slight transcriptional activation of the P450IIE1 gene in the kidney. However, the increase in transcription rate was far below the increase in mRNA level, suggesting that much of the induction occurs by posttranscriptional mechanisms. This process requires the androgen receptor since mutant Tfm mice lacking receptor are not inducible."
https://openalex.org/W1579782214,"The binding of winged bean basic agglutinin (WBA I) to 4-methylumbelliferyl (MeUmb) galactosides was examined by extrinsic fluorescence titration and stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry. Upon binding to WBA I, MeUmb alpha-galactosides show quenching in fluorescence intensity, decrease in UV absorbance with a concomitant blue shift, and decrease in fluorescence excited-state lifetimes. However, their beta-analogues show enhancement in fluorescence intensity, increase in UV absorbance with a red shift, and an increase in fluorescence excited-state lifetimes. This implies that the umbelliferyl groups of alpha- and beta-galactosides experience non-polar and polar microenvironments, respectively, upon binding to WBA I. Replacement of the anomeric hydroxyl group of galactose by 4-methylumbelliferyl moiety increases the affinity of resulting saccharides. Substitution of C-2 hydroxyl of galactose by an acetamido group leads to increased affinity due to a favorable entropy change. This suggests that acetamido group of MeUmb-alpha/beta-GalNAc binds to a relatively non-polar subsite of WBA I. Most interestingly, this substitution also reduces the association rate constants dramatically. Inspection of the activation parameters reveals that the enthalpy of activation is the limiting factor for the differences in the forward rate constants for these saccharides and the entropic contribution to the activation energy is small"
https://openalex.org/W1595233564,"L-Proline and L-glutamine were used to probe the inverse relationship between glycogenesis and ureagenesis in isolated, perfused livers from 48-h fasted rats. Both amino acids may provide nitrogen in the form of NH+4 for carbamyl-P synthesis. However, one molecule of glutamine may provide additionally for the synthesis of one molecule of the urea cycle substrate L-aspartate, but proline can provide for the synthesis of a molecule of NH+4 or one molecule of aspartate on an either/or basis only. In all perfusates, glucose was initially 30 mM (to favor phosphotransferase activity of glucose-6-phosphatase) and 0.5 mM 3-mercaptopicolinate was present (to inhibit glyconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, from the added amino acids, and via the indirect pathway). Glycogenesis from glucose, perfusate and hepatic urea formation, and levels of hepatic glucose-6-P, citrulline, PPi, and carbamyl-P were measured. The addition of glutamine to the perfusate markedly stimulated the urea cycle, but not glycogenesis. Hepatic urea level, perfusate urea concentration, and hepatic citrulline and PPi increased while carbamyl-P content decreased. In contrast, proline stimulated glycogenesis from glucose, but not ureagenesis. In the proline-supplemented compared with glutamine group, hepatic glycogenesis and carbamyl-P content increased; hepatic glucose-6-P levels showed a tendency toward increase; and hepatic urea formation, hepatic citrulline, and PPi levels were decreased. These observations are interpreted to support an hepatic mechanism whereby the relative availability of carbamyl-P to the urea cycle and as a substrate for glucose phosphorylation via phosphotransferase activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase system preliminary to glycogenesis from glucose is a major metabolic determinant."
https://openalex.org/W33835727,"Abstract The substrate specificity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been assessed with peptides bearing threoninol diastereomers. The threoninol residue contains both a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol, either of which may serve as a site of phosphorylation. The enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation of Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-(2R,3R)-threoninol furnishes a Km of 498 +/- 39 microM and a Vmax of 7.8 +/- 0.2 mumol/min-mg, whereas the phosphorylation of Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-(2S,3S)-threoninol provides a Km of 16.3 +/- 0.8 microM and a Vmax of 16.0 +/- 0.4 mumol/min-mg. Mass spectral analysis of the phosphopeptide reaction products revealed that each species is phosphorylated only once. 1H-coupled 31P NMR experiments unequivocally demonstrated that the (2R,3R)-isomer is specifically phosphorylated at the secondary alcohol, whereas the (2S,3S)-isomer is exclusively phosphorylated at the primary alcohol. This regiospecificity appears to be a consequence of the stereochemistry at C-2 in the threoninol residues. The structural attributes of the protein kinase that appear to be responsible for the observed differentiation between the C-2 stereoisomers is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2340687218,"Nuclear extracts from P1798 lymphoma cells support transcription from the adenovirus major late promotor (AdMLP) and the human histone H4 promoter. Nuclear extracts prepared from P1798 cells treated with 1 microgram/ml cyclosporine A for 24 h fail to support transcription from AdMLP, whereas transcription from the histone H4 promoter is unimpaired. Both control and cyclosporine-treated extracts contain proteins that interact with synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides that correspond to the CAAT box, TATA box, and upstream stimulatory element of AdMLP. Cyclosporine had no discernible qualitative or quantitative effect upon such DNA-protein interactions, as observed by gel mobility shift assays. Analysis of 5' deletion mutants of AdMLP indicates that deletion of sequences upstream of the TATA box reduces AdMLP transcription by only 50%. This observation suggests that cyclosporine A, which inhibits AdMLP transcription by > 90%, is unlikely to act through changes in the amount or activity of upstream activators such as upstream stimulatory factor- or CAAT box-binding proteins. On the other hand, deletion of TATA box sequences between -50 and -11 base pairs virtually eliminates transcription from AdMLP in vitro. A partially purified TFIID fraction was obtained from control P1798 nuclear extracts. The TFIID fraction reconstitutes transcription from AdMLP when added to extracts from cyclosporine A-treated cells. Recombinant TATA box-binding protein also reconstitutes transcription from AdMLP in cyclosporine A-treated extracts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclosporine A regulates the activity of a subset of general transcription factors which are required for initiation from some promoters (such as AdMLP) but not from others (such as histone H4)."
https://openalex.org/W1563232494,"Transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermanii is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the reversible transfer of a carboxyl group from methylmalonyl-CoA to pyruvate. The central hexameric 12 S subunit of the enzyme associates with six 6 S subunits in the complete enzyme complex. We have constructed a series of cloned genes which encode COOH-terminal truncations of the 12 S subunit. Five of these subunits, which remained soluble following expression in Escherichia coli and were missing from 39 to 97 COOH-terminal amino acids, were purified and compared to the full-length subunit after enzyme complexes were assembled in vitro. All of the truncated subunits were 90% as active in the transcarboxylase reaction as wild type except the reaction containing the shortest complex, TC-12 S (1-507), which had 54% of the wild type activity (TC-12 S-WT). The reduced activity was not due to a lack of CoA ester binding sites or the Km for substrate. However, TC-12 S (1-507) was slower to form than TC-12 S-WT and had more incomplete complexes as judged by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration profiles and electron microscopy. Isolated TC-12 S (1-507) was 70-80% as active as TC-12 S-WT. We also noted that the truncated form was heat-labile compared to wild type. We conclude that the COOH-terminal region of the 12 S subunit plays a role in assembly and stability of the hexamer and also affects the binding of 6 S subunits to form enzyme complexes. Once complexes do form, the catalytic capacity of TC-12 S (1-507) is almost the same as TC-12 S-WT."
