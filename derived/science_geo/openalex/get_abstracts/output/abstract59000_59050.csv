Competition for the opiate receptor by various opiates and their antagonists closely parallels their pharmacological potency. The opiate receptor is confined to nervous tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1614755592,"Arguments based on elastic stability and flexure, as opposed to the more conventional ones based on yield strength, require that living organisms adopt forms whereby lengths increase as the ⅔ power of diameter. The somatic dimensions of several species of animals and of a wide variety of trees fit this rule well. It is a simple matter to show that energy metabolism during maximal sustained work depends on body cross-sectional area, not total body surface area as proposed by Rubner ( 1 ) and many after him. This result and the result requiring animal proportions to change with size amount to a derivation of Kleiber's law, a statement only empirical until now, correlating the metabolically related variables with body weight raised to the ¾ power. In the present model, biological frequencies are predicted to go inversely as body weight to the ¼; power, and total body surface areas should correlate with body weight to the ⅝ power. All predictions of the proposed model are tested by comparison with existing data, and the fit is considered satisfactory. In The Fire of Life, Kleiber ( 5 ) wrote ""When the concepts concerned with the relation of body size and metabolic rate are clarified, . . . then compartive physiology of metabolism will be of great help in solving one of the most intricate and interesting problems in biology, namely the regulation of the rate of cell metabolism."" Although Hill ( 23 ) realized that ""the essential point about a large animal is that its structure should be capable of bearing its own weight and this leaves less play for other factors,"" he was forced to use an oversimplified ""geometric similarity"" hypothesis in his important work on animal locomotion and muscular dynamics. It is my hope that the model proposed here promises useful answers in comparisons of living things on both the microscopic and the gross scale, as part of the growing science of form, which asks precisely how organisms are diverse and yet again how they are alike."
https://openalex.org/W2094572802,In a rare myopathy muscle fibers contained myriad lipid-filled vacuoles. Homogenates of the patient's muscle oxidized fatty acids more slowly than normal (11 controls). Addition of carnitine increased the oxidation rate with the patient's muscle to the level attained by the controls with carnitine. In five separate muscle samples from the patient the mean carnitine level was less than 20 percent of that observed in 42 controls. Carnitine palmityl transferase and palmityl thiokinase levels in the patient's muscles were not depressed. The present case represents the first recognized instance of carnitine deficiency in human skeletal muscle.
https://openalex.org/W1559154670,"Abstract Optimum conditions for translating ovalbumin messenger RNA in a cell-free, protein-synthesizing system derived from rabbit reticulocytes were similar to those for endogenous globin messenger RNA. At suboptimal conditions the translation of ovalbumin messenger RNA was usually inhibited more than globin messenger RNA. Hemin prolonged the synthesis of both proteins, and Q, an inhibitor of initiation formed during incubation, inhibited the translation of both messengers. The rates of elongation on ovalbumin and globin messenger RNA were nearly identical at 0.86 amino acid per s at 26°, and were maintained for at least an hour. After 10 min of incubation, ovalbumin was synthesized on polysomes composed of 9 ribosomes (75% of the maximum size possible), corresponding to a rate of initiation of about 1.1 ribosomes per min at 26°. The size of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes gradually fell to 3 during a 70-min incubation. The rate of initiation on globin messenger RNA was about 30% faster than on ovalbumin messenger RNA, but there was a corresponding decrease in this rate during incubation. Ovalbumin messenger RNA was not degraded in the proteinsynthesizing system. These results suggest that protein synthesis stops in this system due to a failure of polypeptide initiation. The efficiency of messenger RNA translation was estimated by two independent methods. Both methods indicate that each globin messenger RNA was translated about 70 times during a 90-min incubation. Each ovalbumin messenger RNA was translated about 45 times according to one method, but only up to 18 times by the other. The ratio of the values obtained by these two methods is a means of estimating the percentage of active messenger in an RNA preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2002269082,"Monoamine oxidase activity in blood platelets was measured, with [14C]tryptamine as substrate, in 13 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and in 23 normal volunteers. The monoamine oxidase activity of both schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic co-twins was significantly lower than it was for the normals, and it was highly correlated between twins. In addition, there was a significant inverse correlation between a measure of the degree of the schizophrenic disorder and the monoamine oxidase activity. These data suggest, but do not prove, that reduced platelet monoamine oxidase activity may provide a genetic marker for vulnerability to schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2116867180,"Abstract Procedures are described for the quantitative assay of ovalbumin mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein-synthesizing system. A technique for rapid and efficient separation of labeled immunoprecipitated ovalbumin from nonspecific radioactivity is presented. The capacity of the lysate system for total de novo protein synthesis, determined with the use of aurintricarboxylic acid, was found to be correlated with the capacity for ovalbumin mRNA translation. Hemin, a compound that stimulates hemoglobin synthesis in reticulocyte lysates, also stimulates ovalbumin synthesis. The yield of ovalbumin mRNA activity was used as a criterion in choosing optimal conditions for the isolation of undegraded nucleic acid from oviduct. Phenol extraction of total oviduct homogenate yielded only one-third as much activity as isolation by sodium dodecyl sulfate sucrose gradient. When high concentrations of heparin were used to inhibit ribonuclease, the degradation rate of ovalbumin mRNA activity after homogenization could be slowed enough (half-life = 6.4 hours) to permit nearly quantitative recovery of activity in subcellular fractions. No translation of mRNA fragments could be detected in partially degraded nucleic acid preparations. Seventy-one per cent of the total ovalbumin mRNA activity sedimented with polysomes with only 5% in the 27,000 x g pellet. Administration of estrogen to immature chicks induced ovalbumin mRNA activity, and continued hormone treatment was necessary for the maintenance of activity. In vivo administration of actinomycin D to chicks led to a 65% increase in the rate of ovalbumin synthesis in culture with no change in total or polysomal mRNA levels, providing direct evidence that this drug increases the rate of ovalbumin mRNA translation."

Concentrations of this metabolite in spinal fluid were significantly lower in depressed patients than in controls or manic patients. These low values may occur secondary to depressive phenomena such as reduced psychomotor activity, or they may reflect a primary change in norepinephrine metabolism in depressive illness."

Incorporation of this cholesterol photooxidation product into normal red blood cells leads to increased osmotic fragility and eventual hemolysis. These results may be relevant to photohemolysis associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria.
https://openalex.org/W1565198178,"Abstract Post-heparin plasma in the rat contains triglyceride lipase activity of both hepatic and extrahepatic origin. The lipase released into rat hepatic perfusate by heparin has been characterized in an assay containing Triton X-100, albumin, and [14C]triolein. Fatty acid release was linear for 120 min over a wide range of enzyme concentrations at 27° and 37°. The pH optimum was 9.5. Enzymatic activity was g80% inhibited by prior incubation with 0.5 m NaCl or 750 µg of protamine per ml. The apparent Km was 1.28 mm. The enzyme was localized in rat liver cell fractions. Cell fractions were checked for purity by marker enzymes and electron microscopy. Activity inhibited by NaCl or protamine was found in plasma membranes, microsomes, and cytosol, having pH optima of 9.5, 9.0, and 8.0, respectively. A different triglyceride lipase not affected by NaCl or protamine and having a pH optimum at 4.4 was found in lysosomes. The plasma membrane-bound lipase had a specific activity 10 times that in liver homogenate. Addition of heparin to the plasma membrane fractions in a concentration as low as 1 unit per ml effected the release of the enzyme into the medium. The plasma membrane-released lipase had the same apparent Km. A 360-fold enhancement of plasma membrane lipase activity over that in whole liver homogenate was achieved by heparin affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1503859252,"Abstract We have previously reported that weanling rats fed a 20% wheat gluten diet, limiting in lysine and containing no detectable carnitine, have significantly lower levels of carnitine in skeletal and heart muscle than rats receiving adequate dietary lysine. Rats on 20% wheat gluten diets were administered appropriate levels of dl-[6-14C]lysine, l-[methyl-3H]methionine, e-N-[methyl-3H]trimethyl-l-lysine, or [carboxy-14C]γ-butyrobetaine. Carnitine was subsequently isolated by ion exchange chromatography from a number of tissues and examined for radioactivity. In most trials about 0.1% of administered dl-[6-14C]lysine or l-[methyl-3H]methionine was incorporated into tissue carnitine. Dietary lysine significantly decreased the utilization of dl-[6-14C]lysine for carnitine synthesis. Radioactivity following administration of dl-[2-14C]lysine was not detected in biosynthesized tissue carnitine. e-N-[methyl-3H]Trimethyl-l-lysine and [carboxy-14C]γ-butyrobetaine were converted in high yield to carnitine, e.g. 23 and 45% of administered dose per 100 g of skeletal muscle. Radioactive carnitine was also detected in the urine in these latter instances. It was shown that e-N-trimethyllysine is converted to γ-butyrobetaine in the rat. These data support the thesis that lysine is a precursor of carnitine in the rat, which together with similar labeling studies in Neurospora suggest the following transformations: lysine → e-N-trimethyllysine → γ-butyrobetaine → carnitine."
https://openalex.org/W2055027352,"Patients with spinal cord transection had normal concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and low concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid. The presence or absence of spinal fluid block in these patients did not affect concentrations of either amine metabolite. However, the concentration of homovanillic acid was lower in patients with spinal fluid block than in those without block. The results suggest that the spinal cord contributes to concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol and possibly 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, but contributes little to that of homovanillic acid in the lumbar spinal fluid of man."

https://openalex.org/W1551682115,"Abstract Two electrophoretic hemoglobin patterns occur in hemolysates from the American eel, Anguilla rostrata. Type I hemolysates have two major components, I-F and I-S. Type II hemolysates have three major components, II-F, II-M, and II-S. Each kind of hemolysate also has at least one minor electrophoretic component. Amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide patterns of the isolated polypeptide chains indicate that no polypeptide chains are common to the S components and to either the F or the M component. The β chains of the three major components of the type II hemolysate are all different; the II-F β and II-M β chains are similar but differ by at least one peptide. Both differ greatly from the II-S β chain. The α chains of Components II-F and II-M appear either to be identical or very similar and to differ greatly from the α chain of II-S. These results are most compatible with the assumption that the β chains of the anodal Components F and M are controlled by two nonallelic loci. The globin of Component I-F yielded two α chains, one of which appeared identical or very similar to the α chains of II-F and II-M, whereas the other I-F α chain differed by at least one peptide. The oxygen equilibria of Components II-F and II-M appear to be identical. In the absence of phosphate they are characterized by a very large Bohr effect below pH 7: Δ log P50/Δ pH ≅ -1.6 in the pH interval, 6.5 to 6.8. The Hill coefficient, n, decreases from 1.3 to 1.4 above pH 7 to about 0.9 near pH 6.5. The oxygenation properties of Component II-S are entirely different from those of Components F or M. A substantial reversed Bohr effect is present in the absence of phosphate between pH 6.8 and 8.4; Δlog P50/ΔpH = +0.3. Addition of 6 moles of ATP per mole of hemoglobin (tetramer) causes a large pH-dependent decrease in oxygen affinity and a substantial rise in apparent cooperativity. The Hill coefficient, n, rises from 1.6 to 1.8 to about 2.4 to 2.8 depending on the pH. The magnitude of the Bohr effect decreases to close to zero upon ATP addition. Carbon dioxide increases the reversed Bohr effect in the absence of phosphate: Δlog P50/ΔpH becomes +0.75. The COOH-terminal histidyl residue of the β chains of mammalian hemoglobin is believed to play a decisive role in the mechanism of the Bohr effect (Perutz, M. F. (1970) Nature 228, 726–739). Component F has the COOH-terminal sequence -Tyr-His, but the corresponding sequence in Component S is -Gln-Tyr-Phe This difference may largely account for the different behavior of the two hemoglobins. The Component S β chain has only 2 histidyl residues, whereas all other eel hemoglobin chains examined have 5 to 6 histidines per chain."
https://openalex.org/W1563899085,"Abstract The cholesterol ester hydrolase with a pH optimum of 6.6, that we previously reported in rat brain, consists of two distinct cholesterol ester hydrolases, one localized in microsomes and the other in the myelin sheath. The microsomal hydrolase has a pH optimum of 6.0 and is highly activated by both sodium taurocholate and Triton X-100. The myelin hydrolase has a pH optimum of 7.2 and is activated by taurocholate but slightly inhibited by Triton X-100. Standard assay systems for these enzymes have been developed. A differential assay system which permits determination of either of the two cholesterol ester hydrolases in a mixture of both has been established. Of the total activity of the myelin cholesterol ester hydrolase in the starting homogenate, 70 to 80% was recovered in the purified myelin fraction with a relative specific activity of 10. Gray matter, 7-day-old rat whole brain, and brains of myelin-deficient mutant mice, Jimpy and Quaking, all contained much less activities of the myelin cholesterol ester hydrolase compared to white matter, adult rat whole brain, or brains of the control littermates of the mutant mice. The activities of the microsomal cholesterol ester hydrolase were similar in all of these samples. These findings strongly indicate that the taurocholate-activated, Triton X-100-inhibited cholesterol ester hydrolase with the pH optimum of 7.2 is highly localized in the myelin sheath. This is the second enzyme found to be myelin-specific, the first one being cyclic 2',3'-nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase. Together with the most acidic cholesterol ester hydrolase localized in the crude mitochondrial fraction, we have demonstrated three distinct cholesterol ester hydrolases in rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W2061657867,Swallowing was measured in fetal sheep by using electromagnetic flowmeter heads chronically implanted in the fetal esophagus. The fetus swallows 20 to 200 milliliters of amniotic fluid in two to seven discrete episodes per day. The episodes are 1 to 9 minutes in duration and occur at seemingly random intervals. Swallowing is influenced by the condition of the fetus and may be the first manifestation of eating and drinking behavior.
https://openalex.org/W2016364936,Radiant heat stimulation was applied to volunteers and rating scale responses were obtained to assess the analgesic properties of 33 percent nitrous oxide. The methodology of signal detection theory was applied to the data to demonstrate that nitrous oxide reduces both sensitivity to pain and willingness to report pain. This method is superior to threshold estimation for the evaluation of analgesics.
https://openalex.org/W1535091147,"Abstract Dihydrotestosterone acts synergistically with estrogen to stimulate the growth of the magnum portion of the chick oviduct which synthesizes the egg white proteins, but it is inactive when administered alone. The stimulation of growth is attributable to an increased number of magnum cells and an increased rate of protein synthesis per cell. The mechanisms by which protein synthesis could be enhanced were investigated. There was no significant change in the rate of polypeptide elongation or initiation when dihydrotestosterone was administered along with estrogen. There was, however, an increase in the amount of ribosomes and messenger RNA per cell; an increase in ovalbumin mRNA per cell was shown directly using a cell-free protein-synthesizing system. The relative rates of synthesis of ovalbumin, conalbumin, and lysozyme were similar after treatment with either estrogen and dihydrotestosterone or estrogen alone, suggesting that the concentrations of these mRNAs were increased proportionately; however, there was a 2-fold increase in the relative rate of ovomucoid synthesis. Dihydrotestosterone did not affect the rate of ovalbumin or ovomucoid mRNA degradation. Thus, we conclude that dihydrotestosterone stimulates some aspect of mRNA transcription, maturation, or transport to the cytoplasm. Ribosomal RNA synthesis was shown to be enhanced by dihydrotestosterone as well. Nuclei isolated from the magnum of chicks treated with estrogen and dihydrotestosterone had a higher rate of RNA synthesis than those from chicks treated with estrogen alone. The activity of both the A and B forms of RNA polymerase was enhanced, and this was not due to differential RNase activity or differences in nucleotide pool sizes. The rate of RNA chain elongation was found to be similar in both nuclear preparations, and there was negligible initiation of RNA chains in either preparation as judged by the use of rifampicin AF/013. Thus, the different RNA polymerase activities probably reflect the number of transcribing polymerase molecules. Dihydrotestosterone did not affect the total extractable RNA polymerase activity (Form A or B), suggesting that this enzyme is not rate-limiting. We conclude that dihydrotestosterone probably stimulates the rate of RNA polymerase initiation on genes activated by estrogen."

About 70% of the phosphorus is present as two aminophosphonic acids: 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid and 1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonic acid, a previously unknown compound. Each of these accounts for about 0.5 µmole of phosphorus per mg dry weight and together they account for about 13% of the mass of the macromolecule."

https://openalex.org/W1542485898,"Abstract Association of lysozyme with the following ligands was measured at 0.1 ionic strength, using absorbance and fluorescence procedures: (a) the β(1 → 4)-linked trimer of N-acetylglucosamine, at pH 0 to 9 and 8–60°; (b) the dimer, at pH 0 to 9 and 30° and at 9–60° and pH 5.3; (c) N-acetylglucosamine, at 9–60° and pH 5.3. The complex-free protein difference spectrum varied with temperature and pH. Analysis of the association data indicated that trimer binding perturbs the pK of three ionizations, glutamic 35, 6.1 to 6.4; aspartic 101, 4.3 to 3.4; aspartic 66, 1.9 to 1.5. Since aspartic 66 does not interact directly with the saccharide, its pK shift presumably reflects the change in conformation that has been seen in crystallographic analysis (Blake, C. C. F., Mair, G. A., North, A. C. T., Phillips, D. C., and Sharma, V. R. (1967) Proc. Roy. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 167, 365; Blake, C. C. F., Johnson, L. N., Mair, G. A., North, A. C. T., Phillips, D. C., and Sharma, V. R. (1967) Proc. Roy Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 167, 378) and involves this carboxyl. Aspartic 66 is buried as a carboxylate that is not part of an ion pair. The enthalpy of association increases by 5.9 kcal between pH 5 and 2 and is compensated by a nearly equal increase in entropy. This behavior may be related to desolvation of aspartic 101 in complex formation. The apparent average enthalpy of hydrogen-bond formation in the trimer complex is -1.5 kcal."
https://openalex.org/W1633456411,"Abstract The specific binding of d-glucose to the isolated luminal cell membrane of the renal proximal tubule, the brush border, was studied. The initial interaction of d-glucose with this membrane was rapid; saturable; dependent on the concentrations of the sugar and the membrane; reversible; selectively influenced by the ionic environment; sensitive to temperature and pH; inhibited by phloridzin, phloretin, and sulfhydryl reagents; and stereospecific. Examination of the relationship between the concentration of d-glucose and the binding of the sugar indicated the presence of two distinct classes of receptor sites for d-glucose in the brush border membrane. One system, having a high affinity class of binding sites, was saturated at about 1 µm, half-saturated at 0.67 µm, and 1.4 x 10-3 nmoles of d-glucose interacted with 1 mg of membrane protein. The other system, having a low affinity class of binding sites, required 50 mm for saturation, and had an affinity for d-glucose at least four-orders of magnitude less than that of the high affinity receptor sites. The time courses of binding of d-glucose in the high and low affinity regions were similar, in both cases approximately 50% of the maximal bindings occurred in the 1st min of incubation and steady state levels were achieved in about 3 min. The specific bindings of d-glucose at both receptor sites were completely reversible. Neither system of binding required Na+. The initial interaction of d-glucose with the brush border membranes was inhibited by Tris ions, but Li+ and choline ions substituted for Na+. Binding of d-glucose to the brush border membrane was markedly dependent on the presence of Ca2+. Binding at the high affinity classes of sites was more sensitive to the removal of Ca2+ than was the binding at the low affinity classes. The deletion of Mg2+ caused a moderate decrease in the binding at both affinity regions. High concentrations of phosphate inhibited binding at the low affinity classes of binding sites. Glutamine was also inhibitory. Phloridzin was found to be a potent inhibitor of the interaction of d-glucose with the receptors on the renal brush border membrane. Kinetics typical of competitive inhibition were observed at the high affinity region of d-glucose binding. The apparent Ki was 2 x 10-4 m. The kinetics of inhibition at the low affinity classes of binding sites were not consistent with competitive inhibition. The inhibition by phloretin at the high affinity sites was noncompetitive. The sulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and mersalyl, blocked the binding of d-glucose at both the high and low affinity sites. The binding of d-glucose was found to differ from that of l-glucose. Neither the binding of d- or l-glucose was affected by the presence of the other stereoisomer. When incubated together, the total sugar bound was the sum of the d-glucose bound alone plus the l-glucose bound alone. The interaction of l-glucose was insensitive to phloridzin. d-Galactose, a competitive inhibitor of d-glucose binding, did not influence the binding of l-glucose. l-Glucose, in contrast to d-glucose, did not reverse the binding of d-glucose. The l-glucose sequestered by the luminal membranes was not releasable by d- or l-glucose. These notable differences between the interactions of d- and l-glucose with the brush border membranes strongly indicated that the two stereoisomers did not share the same carrier transport system on the proximal tubule luminal membrane. It is proposed that the binding of d-glucose to the isolated brush border membranes, as characterized in this report, represents the initial reaction in the active transport of the sugar by the renal tubule."

In comparison with rats that had urine and feces removed twice daily from such pans, rats kept over Kimpak bedding or over Litter Green, changed twice daily, also showed reduced drug-metabolizing activity in hepatic microsomes, but to a lesser degree than the dirty rats. Placement of a filter top on cages for 1 week also decreased drug-metabolizing activity. These experiments suggest that the relative cleanliness of an animal's environment can influence hepatic microsomal drug metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1608262032,"Abstract Soluble P-450 cytochromes were obtained from hepatic microsomes from rats treated with either phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene using the nonionic detergent action of Triton N-101 and the stabilizing effect of glycerol. Ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and alumina gel-Cγ adsorption were employed to give concentrations of cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats, and cytochrome P1-450 from 3-methyl-cholanthrene-treated rats, about 4-fold greater than those seen in the microsomes from which the preparations were derived. The spectral characteristics of cytochrome P-450 and P1-450 were very similar, but both qualitative and quantitative differences were observed. Differences were also observed in their carbon monoxide and ethyl isocyanide difference spectra. Type I and type II drug-binding spectra were seen with the solubilized cytochrome P-450, but cytochrome P1-450 gave only the type II binding spectrum. The absolute spectrum of oxidized cytochrome P1-450, and studies which employed tritiated 3-methylcholanthrene, showed that cytochrome P1-450 is not a complex of 3-methylcholanthrene or its metabolites with cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1508488851,"Fructose and lactate markedly stimulated fatty acid synthesis from [1-14C]acetate in isolated cells prepared from the livers of unfed neonatal chicks (21 or 22 days of incubation). In liver cells obtained from unhatched chicks (19 days of incubation) fructose and lactate had very small stimulatory effects on fatty acid synthesis. The increase in fructose- and lactate-stimulated fatty acid synthesis during hatching was about 20-fold. Pulmonary respiration began on the 20th day and the chicks were hatched by the 21st day. Fatty acid synthesis from [1-14C]acetate (plus citrate) or [1,5-14C]-citrate in a cytosol fraction of liver increased about 20-fold during the hatching period. Concomitantly, there were 6.5- and 4-fold increases in the total activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase, respectively. The effect of hatching on the total activity of fatty acid synthetase could be mimicked by incubating 18-day-old embryos in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen for 24 hours. The oxygen treatment did not affect the total activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or the rate of fatty acid synthesis in isolated hepatocytes (plus or minus fructose). Injecting glucose or fructose into 18-day-old embryos had no effect on the total activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or fatty acid synthetase. Feeding the neonatal chicks increased the total activities of both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. If the neonatal chicks were not fed, the total activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase did not change for at least 3 days. In contrast, the total activity of fatty acid synthetase continued to increase during those 3 days of fasting. The total activities of both enzymes were increased when unfed neonatal chicks were given a single glucose or fructose injection. The effect was not observed until 6 hours after administration of the sugar despite the fact that the rate of fatty acid synthesis was stimulated by more than 5-fold at 1½ hours after the injection. The results suggest that acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase are not part of an “operon” or its eukaryote equivalent, and that changes in their total activities did not initiate changes in the rate of fatty acid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2066815287,"Virgin rats were ovariectomized and tested for induction of maternal behavior by being housed with neonatal young. A postoperative interval of 8 weeks yielded an average latency for the onset of maternal behavior significantly lower than that for intact controls or for virgin females ovariectomized 4 weeks before testing. Replacement of estrogen in the group ovariectomized for 8 weeks or injection of the estrogen antagonist ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) in the group ovariectomized for 4 weeks changed the average latencies accordingly. Parallel results were obtained for males that were castrated 4 or 8 weeks before testing. It is concluded (i) that maternal behavior is under gonadal control and that this control is normally inhibitory; and (ii) that only after long-term removal of the gonads, resulting presumably in the complete clearance of estrogen and testosterone, is the maternal mediating system finally released from steroid suppression."

The passage occurs through cytoplasmic pores which are not gaps at the junction of two endothelial cells but perforations within the endothelium. Enucleation occurs because the pores are of relatively fixed size. Whereas the cytoplasm is flexible and squeezes through the pore, the nucleus is rigid and cannot conform to the pore size. It is, thus, caught, and the red cell becomes enucleated."

This extent of conversion is ten times greater than that in control studies with killed cells. Conversion is evident within 10 minutes and appears to be maximal within 1 hour. Greater net triiodothyronine formation results if greater amounts of exogenous thyroxine are added to the system, with no plateau evident even at very high thyroxine concentrations. The addition of high concentrations of nonradioactive triiodothyronine resulted in no evident inhibition of the conversion."

https://openalex.org/W1567563115,"Abstract A normal mash diet or a single glucose injection stimulates fatty acid synthesis and increases the total activities of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, and malic enzyme in the livers of neonatal chicks. Feeding and glucose injection caused a decrease in the concentration of free fatty acids and fatty acyl-CoA and an increase in α-glycerophosphate and free CoA. These concentration changes are appropriate for intermediates which may regulate both the rate of fatty acid synthesis and the concentration of the lipogenic enzymes. The hepatic concentrations of citrate and acetyl-CoA were unaffected by feeding or glucose injection. During the hatching process, total activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase in the liver increased but the rate of fatty acid synthesis did not. Concomitantly, free stearate in the liver decreased, but none of the other metabolites indicated above were affected. Fatty acid synthetase increased and hepatic free stearate decreased when embryos were incubated in 100% oxygen. Stearate or a metabolite derived from stearate is a potential negative regulator of the concentration of fatty acid synthetase in chick liver. Injection of glucose into 18-day-old embryos markedly increased the α-glycerophosphate content of the liver but had no effect on the total activities of the lipogenic enzymes. Hence, α-glycerophosphate is not a direct regulator of the total activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or fatty acid synthetase in embryonic chicks."
https://openalex.org/W1513050143,"Abstract Isolated rat liver mitochondria are capable of incorporating labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates into DNA. The reaction is linear from 1 to 2 hours, is sensitive to high concentrations of actinomycin D, and requires oxidative phosphorylation and Mg2+. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates serve as better precursors than monophosphates, and a partial dependency on all four triphosphates is demonstrated. That the labeled product is DNA is shown by its complete lability to DNase, its complete resistance to RNase and alkali, its proper buoyant density in CsCl, and its increase and then decrease in buoyant density upon being subjected to denaturing and then reannealing conditions. That the labeled DNA is mitochondrial in origin is shown by the occurrence of the incorporation process in the virtual absence of bacteria, the absence of nuclei or nuclear membranes in the mitochondrial preparation, and the failure of added DNase to inhibit significantly the incorporation process. Moreover, the buoyant density of the denatured and reannealed labeled product is identical with that of similarly treated authentic mitochondrial DNA in contrast to nuclear DNA. That the incorporation process leads to genuine mitochondrial DNA, i.e. DNA of ordered structure, is suggested by the labeling being internal rather than solely at the 3'-OH end and by the results of nearest neighbor frequency analysis. Controls on the latter procedure show that added dGTP is rapidly broken down in mitochondria, which accounts for the particularly low incorporation of dGTP. Isolation of closed circular DNA from the total DNA labeled by the isolated mitochondria indicates that label is associated with this form of DNA."

Both enantiomers inactivate the enzyme. Similar concentrations for half-maximal rates of inactivation are found, but maximum Vinact is 10-fold larger for d-glycidol-P than for l-glycidol-P. The same glutamate residue of the protein is esterified by addition to the C1 carbon of both d- and l-glycidol-P. The Vinact difference is explained in terms of the active site stereospecificity. Both isomers show little alkylation rate dependence over the pH range 5.5 to 10. Enolase is also shown to be inactivated by both enantiomers of glycidol-P."
https://openalex.org/W1577531395,Abstract Trihexosylceramide biosynthesized in vitro from lactosylceramide and UDP-galactose in the presence of a galactosyltransferase from rat spleen microsomes or bone marrow was shown by methylation to have the structure galactopyranosyl-α-(1 → 3)-galactopyranosyl-β-(1 → 4)-glucopyranosyl-β-(1 → 1)-ceramide. It is thus different from trihexosylceramide isolated from several natural sources in which the two galactoses are linked 1 → 4. This emphasizes the need for establishing by unequivocal means the structure of glycolipids biosynthesized in vitro. The method described permits this to be done on the very small amounts of material usually available from biosynthetic experiments.
https://openalex.org/W1585781640,"Abstract Human serum albumin was labeled with N-bromoacetyl-l-tryptophan (attached at the 3 position of a histidyl residue), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (attached to the e-amino group of lysyl residues) and 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (attached to e-lysyl and tyrosyl-OH residues). Binding studies with these preparations were conducted with N-acetyl-l-tryptophan to determine the extent of blockage of the indole binding site by these reagents. At labeling conditions of 1:1 molar ratio of labeling agents to albumin, 25 to 65% blockage of the indole binding site occurred. When labeling was conducted in the presence of indolepropionate, the labeling was much reduced at the indole binding site, confirming the specificity of the labeling agents. Following the procedures used by McMenamy, Dintzis, and Watson for unlabeled human serum albumin ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4744) CNBr fragmentation of the labeled albumins was conducted and the three major fragments were isolated. Sixty-five per cent or more of the attached labels in each preparation were found in Fragment C (mol wt, ∼18,000). At least one of the labeled positions in this fragment (but not all) was effective in blocking the indole binding site. A tyrosyl-OH group, which was located in Fragment A (mol wt, ∼33,000) and which reacted to a limited extent with 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride also influenced binding at the indole site. The diversity of the labeling agents, the diversity of the groups to which the labels were attached, and other physical-chemical considerations lead to the conclusion that the site is very flexible and adaptable. The evidence supports the positioning of the indole binding site between Fragments A and C as they exist in whole albumin. The dominance of the labeling positions in Fragment C also leads to the conclusion that this fragment is the major locus for ligand binding in albumin."

https://openalex.org/W2038914914,This article disusses ecology and its contribution to population studies. The primary contribution is the formulation of the population-environment problem in organizational terms; adaptation is necessarily an organizational process. The bioecologist might ignore this approach from time to time without getting into serious difficulty and the social scientist may set it aside for certain analytical purposes; however neither will gain a very full understanding of population change and structure apart from the organizational context in which they occur. Thus human ecology although it may start with an interest in the similarities among all life forms converges upon and becomes identified with social science. It becomes however a synthetic social science; that is the nature of the ecological problem is of such breadth that it cannot be adequately treated from the standpoint of sociology economics political science or any other similar abstraction. Human ecology constitutes a different abstraction 1 that pertains to the interrelations among institutions rather than to a single class of institutional behavior. As a synthetic social science human ecology seems well suited to population study for population belongs to no 1 discipline.(AUTHORS MODIFIED)
https://openalex.org/W1551823776,"Abstract 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida crystallizes from ammonium sulfate at pH 3.5 in the cubic system with unit cell dimensions of 103.1 ± 0.2 A in the space group P213 which has 12 equivalent positions. From variable equilibrium density measurements and the salt-free density determination, the molecular weight per unit cell was calculated to be 326,000 or 27,200 ± 2,000 per asymmetric unit, in good agreement with other chemical and physical data. Consideration of the mass per asymmetric unit, the symmetry elements of P213, and the results of chemical and physical solution studies suggest that the molecules are assemblages of trimers in the crystal with the subunits related by a 3-fold rotation axis."
https://openalex.org/W1597091372,"Abstract The binding of succinate and perfluorosuccinate to the supernatant and mitochondrial isoenzymes of aspartate transaminase has been studied using 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as probes. The binding was measured for the pyridoxal (El) and pyridoxamine (Em) forms of the holoenzyme, the apoenzyme, and the pyridoxal form after reduction of the internal Schiff's base with NaBH4 (reduced holoenzyme). The NMR parameters studied were band broadening or chemical shift changes upon dicarboxylic acid binding to the enzyme. The dissociation constant values of succinate and perfluorosuccinate for the active forms of each isozyme, El and Em, are in the 1 to 4 mm range. Kd values of the inactive forms of the supernatant transaminase for perfluorosuccinate are 18.3 mm, reduced form, and 12.0 mm, apoenzyme form. Anions are competitive with dicarboxylic acid binding and, because of mutual exclusion, do not alter the correlation time, τc of bound succinate. This competition allows for the calculation of the chloride affinity of the pyridoxal, Kd = 9 mm (supernatant), 3 mm (mitochondrial), and pyridoxamine forms, Kd = 5 mm (supernatant), 1.6 mm (mitochondrial), of each isoenzyme. Because amino acids and glutarate also compete with perfluorosuccinate binding in the El, Em, and apoenzyme forms, it is concluded that dicarboxylic acids bind to these forms of the enzyme and that amino acids can form complexes with the pyridoxamine form. The correlation time of bound dicarboxylic acid shows an increase, i.e. more restricted segmental motion of succinate, with decreasing pH and is particularly critical in the pH 5 and pH 8 regions. The fastest correlation time of perfluorosuccinate (greatest segmental motion) corresponds to that bound to the reduced holoenzyme. The above effects agree with the competition-pH dependence between dicarboxylic acids and anions. Since there is evidence of the active center histidyl residue as the anion binding site (Cheng, S., and Martinez-Carrion, M. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6597–6602) and of the Schiff's base nitrogen as the low pH ligand of a carboxyl group in glutaric acid (Jenkins, W. T., and D'Ari, L. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 5667), a proposal for the binding of dicarboxylic acids is made. Dicarboxylic acids inhibit because they form a bridge between the active center histidyl residue and the pyridoxal phosphate internal aldimine with the e-amino group of a lysyl residue. Thus, the binding subsites for a competitive inhibitor such as succinate, although structurally similar to the substrates, differ from the productive mode of binding of the amino or keto acids which form covalent enzyme-substrate complexes."

Presumably the lactone inhibits incorporation of the labeled galactose into pathways which do not require galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity. Definite differences between the galactosemic and nongalactosemic condition can be demonstrated with as few as 100 to 1000 cells. This approach may be useful in facilitating prenatal detection of several kinds of inborn errors of metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1548637180,"Abstract Homogenates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa (strain 7-11-05) contain an organic, low molecular weight (l 1000), heat stable, acid-soluble, Norit A adsorbable compound required for the in vitro stability of aspartate transcarbamylase. Dilution of these homogenates or removal of the stabilizer by either ultrafiltration, gel filtration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, or sucrose density gradient centrifugation resulted in the rapid first order decay of enzyme activity even at 0–3°. The apparent feedback inhibitor, UMP, was the only nucleotide effective as an in vitro stabilizer within physiological concentrations. Although carbamyl phosphate could stabilize the enzyme in vitro, it was eliminated as the possible endogenous stabilizer because carbamyl phosphate is heat labile. The other substrate, aspartate, was ineffective as a stabilizer. In cell cycle studies with synchronous cells of Chlorella, the pattern of aspartate transcarbamylase was observed to parallel the periodic DNA pattern except for a period of gradual enzyme accumulation immediately prior to the step increase in DNA level. Prior to the period of gradual enzyme accumulation, the enzyme level remained constant with a steady state existing between enzyme synthesis and breakdown. The structural gene of the enzyme appeared to be continuously transcribed and the enzyme continuously synthesized so that the enzyme increased from one steady state level to another during the period of gene replication. The gradual increase in activity prior to the step increase in DNA is proposed to be caused by the accumulation of an endogenous stabilizer (e.g. UMP) which reduces the rate of enzyme degradation. This inference is supported by the accumulation of total nucleotide-P and of an endogenous inhibitor of enzyme activity, and by the decreased rate of breakdown of the enzyme in vivo and also in cell homogenates from this period of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1518360443,"Abstract The distribution of the isoenzymes of aspartate transaminase has been followed during organogenesis of heart and liver tissues in chicken. The content of the supernatant (cytoplasmic) and mitochondrial isoenzymes of aspartate transaminase was measured by precipitation from tissue extracts with their respective antibodies. Heart shows a steady increase in aspartate transaminase specific activity from early stages of development to adulthood. The ratio supernatant to mitochondrial isoenzyme remains constant. Liver also shows an increase in over-all transaminase specific activity, but displays a less regular pattern. The near-equal distribution of the isoenzymes during the early stages of organogenesis is altered between the 14th and 18th days of egg incubation in the form of an excess of supernatant enzyme. The isoenzymes return to a near-equal distribution in the young adult liver. These findings are consistent with postulates which implicate the supernatant enzyme with glucogenesis. The presence of multiple forms within each isozyme was detected by starch gel electrophoresis. The multiple forms present in the supernatant and mitochondrial isoenzymes from adult chicken heart or liver are also detectable in extracts of embryonic chicken heart or liver. The rates of synthesis and degradation of the isoenzymes were examined by following the decay in specific radioactivity in the enzyme after a single injection of uniformly labeled l-[14C]leucine and l-[guanidino-14C]arginine. The relative rates of degradation were measured by monitoring the radioactivity of the respective isoenzymes after injections of the young chick with 14C- and 3H-labeled l-leucine or l-arginine, or both. Young chicken heart shows a mean half-life of 3.8 days for the supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminases. The half-life of these isozymes in young chicken liver is 2.8 days. The relative rates of degradation as tested by the double isotope technique also show a greater turnover by the liver enzyme. On the other hand, the apparent rate of synthesis is greater for the liver than for the heart isoenzymes. These rates are based on uncorrected values for as yet unknown variations in the reutilization of the radioactive amino acids in chicken heart or liver. These results indicate that the genes coding the two isoenzymes of aspartate transaminase tend to express themselves simultaneously within a given tissue. However, their regulation may vary among the tissues and, in the case of liver, also during the organogenesis of the tissue to accommodate or trigger physiological needs, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1584156165,"Abstract A glycoprotein present in low amounts was isolated from bovine aorta by extraction with NaCl, precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and fractionation by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The purified material was found to be homogeneous by ultracentrifugal criteria and by orthogonal gel electrophoresis. Galactose, glucose, fucose, glucosamine, and sialic acid were found in an approximate proportion of 6:1:1:4:2. After removal of sialic acid by mild acid hydrolysis and subsequent hydrolysis with pronase, two glycopeptides were obtained. One was found in approximately twice the amount of the other. A sequence of -Phe-Thr-Gly-Asn-Leu- was found for the major glycopeptide, and its carbohydrate unit consisted of N-acetylglucosamine and galactose. A disaccharide was obtained after mild acid hydrolysis; further study indicated this to be 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucosamine. The other glycopeptide contained glucose, galactose, and fucose. Mild acid hydrolysis released fucose from the glycopeptide, and further hydrolysis yielded glucose and galactose. These results suggest that fucose occupies the terminal position, and glucose and galactose are in the inner part of the oligosaccharide unit. -Leu-(Gln-Ser)-Gly- composed the amino acid chain of the peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1556456574,"Abstract We had shown previously that the isotope concentration in 6β-hydroxyestr-4-ene-3,17-dione, obtained from incubation of 7β-deuterated or 7β-tritiated estr-4-ene-3,17-dione with the respiring mold Botryodiplodia malorum, was significantly increased over that of substrate. This did not occur in another metabolite, 1β-hydroxyestr-4-ene-3,17-dione, or in recovered substrate. We now report that the hydrogen isotope also was concentrated in another product, estr-4-ene-3,11,17-trione. In addition, incubation of estr-4-ene-3,17-dione, labeled with deuterium or tritium equally at C-6β and C-7β, gave the major product, 7β-hydroxyestr-4-ene-3,17-dione, in which there was a much greater than 50% loss of label. In the same experiment there was the expected 50% decrease in the concentration of label in 6β-hydroxyestrenedione and there was a large increase in the concentration of label in the C-11 ketone and in newly-isolated 11α-hydroxyestr-4-ene-3, 17-dione. When 6β-deuterated estrenedione was incubated there was no change in label content in 7β-hydroxyestrenedione, while there was a significant decrease in the amount of 6β-hydroxyestrenedione formed as compared to that obtained with unlabeled substrate. The results indicate that a positive isotope effect is operating during 7β-hydroxylation. It is postulated that the increase in the concentration of label in other hydroxylation products is due to the resultant diversion of enzyme-bound labeled substrate to production of these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2002846165,"It has been proposed that equilibration of nitrous oxide with blood plasma increases osmotic pressure and thereby causes hemodilution. However, calculations show that the 250-torr osmotic gradient produced by 0.7 atmosphere of nitrous oxide dissolved in blood plasma (separated from the other body fluids by a membrane permeable only to water) would be eliminated by a water shift which would dilute the plasma by only 4 percent. Permeability of the membrane to nitrous oxide would further reduce the shift. In vivo measurements confirmed the smallness of any osmotically induced shifts by demonstrating no significant transient changes in hematocrit value when 0.7 atmosphere of nitrous oxide was added to or removed from an inhaled anesthetic mixture in man. These results cast doubt on the suggestions that gas-induced osmosis is an important factor in dysbarism or in clinical anesthesia."
