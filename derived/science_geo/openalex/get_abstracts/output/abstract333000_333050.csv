https://openalex.org/W1972972958,"A new polymorph of carbon, hexagonal diamond, has been discovered in the Canyon Diablo and Goalpara meteorites. This phase had been synthesized recently under specific high-pressure conditions in the laboratory. Our results: provide strong evidence that diamonds found in these meteorites were produced by intense shock pressures acting on crystalline graphite inclusions present within the meteorite before impact, rather than by disintegration of larger, statically grown diamonds, as some theories propose."
https://openalex.org/W2092118067,By using as sources supersonic jets of hydrogen or helium containing small concentrations of heavier molecules we have been able to obtain molecular beams with kinetic energies of the heavy molecules well into the range above 1 electron volt. A variety of molecules have been successfully accelerated. Intensities of 1016 to 1017 heavy molecules per steradian-second have been achieved at these high energies.

Interpretation of the data shows that (i) the equilibration temperatures were of the order of 850 degrees C, and (ii) the olivineorthopyroxene partition does not reflect ideal behavior. This equilibration temperature is much lower than previous estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1990219058,"A number of crystalline compounds isolated from peel of tangerines resistant to ""mal secco"" were characterized and tested for fungistatic activity toward Deuterophoma tracheiphila. Nobiletin exhibited strong fungistatic activity, tangeritin was weakly active, and hesperidin slightly stimulated fungal growth. Rough lemon seedlings, inoculated with the pathogenic fungus, rapidly developed the symptoms of mal secco, whereas continuous infusion of the inoculated seedlings with nobiletin solution largely prevented appearance of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2037036868,Geochemical studies of Wyoming Precambrian graywackes derived from continental crust older than 3.2 x 10(9) years indicate that their source area was at least as highly differentiated as most younger Precambrian crust. The composition of this early crust (approximately that of calcium-rich granite) is not unlike that of the 2.5 to 3.2 x 10(9) year old North American crust. Limited geochemical data suggest that the composition of North America may not have changed significantly during the last 3.0 to 3.5 x 10(9) years.
https://openalex.org/W2019975470,"The potassium:argon age of the metal phase of Weekeroo Station iron meteorite, determined by neutronactivation analysis, is about 1010 years; it is similar to ages previously measured for other iron meteorites, but distinctly disagrees with a strontium: rubidium age of 4.7 Ã— 109 years measured by other workers on silicate inclusions in this meteorite."

https://openalex.org/W1988074563,"Fossil actinomycetes and other bacteria have been found in sulfide minerals from ""varved"" argillites in the middle Precambrian Cobalt Series of Canada. The fossils consist of branched and unbranched nonseptate hyphae and chains of rod-shaped cells. The presence of actinomycetes is consistent with the theory that the argillites are lacustrine desposits."

https://openalex.org/W2094555227,"Late-Paleozoic red beds in the western United States indicate that Earth's magnetic field was reversed for a period of the order of 50 x 10(6) years. This finding agrees with similar results from igneous rocks in Australia, indicating, that the long period of reversal in the magnetic field was worldwide. The rocks on the two continents appear to be essentially equivalent in time, suggesting early magnetization of the red beds. The time spectrum of reversals is irregular in geologic time, but present evidence suggests reversals characterized by time scales of 10(4) or 10(5), 10(6), and 50 x 10(6) years. The 50 x 10(6) year period of steady reversed field is found in the late Paleozoic and is termed the Kiaman magnetic interval."

https://openalex.org/W2045309092,"New ostracod ""living fossils"" have been discovered in samples of Recent marine sediment collected from several Pacific islands. The finds include a male anatomy having several primitive features which, in conjunction with primitive features in the shell, necessitate reconsideration of current opinions on the phylogeny of freshwater ostracods."

https://openalex.org/W2040792376,"In this preliminary note we describe the results obtained by inoculation of the skin of the scrotum of four black rabbits with serous fluid expressed from an initial pinta lesion. The inoculation was made intradermally, as superficially as possible, with serous fluid rich in treponemata and diluted with normal salt solution. A papule appeared at the point of inoculation in one of the four rabbits on the 105th day. One hundred and fifteen days after inoculation the papule presented a circular erosion on an indurated base. The serous fluid expressed from this lesion contained numerous treponemata on dark-field examination, and these were easily impregnated by the Fontana-Tribondeau method. A volunteer inoculated with serous fluid expressed from the rabbit's lesion developed a typical initial pinta lesion at the point of inoculation, thus proving that the scrotal lesion of the rabbit was produced by Treponema carateum or Treponema herrejoni, the causal agent of pinta, mal del pinto or carate."

https://openalex.org/W2073689587,"Measurements made between December 1957 and January 1966 of the gravity difference between the McMurdo Sound pendulum station, which is on bedrock, and the South Pole station, which is on the Antarctic ice sheet, show a gravity increase at the South Pole of 0.11 milligals per year. The most likely hypothesis for the increase is that it was caused by ice flowing downslope across a gravity gradient and by the sinking of the South Pole station as a result of accumulation of ice. An alternate hypothesis that the gravity increase was caused by a decrease in ice thickness, of about 40 centimeters per year, is theoretically possible but is not supported by direct evidence."
