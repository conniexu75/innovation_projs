https://openalex.org/W1487060942,"The apparent solubilities of various proteins (14,000 to 670,000 daltons) were measured in the presence of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different sizes. All of the solubility curves, determined by measuring the protein concentration in the supernate of centrifuged mixtures, exhibited the characteristic linear dependence of log S (g/liter) on PEG concentration (%, w/v). For human albumin in PEG-4000 at pH 4.5, this linearity extended over a 1,000-fold range of solubility, even though the appearance of the sedimented phase changed from a viscous fluid to a white amorphous solid. The slope, beta, decreased from 0.27 to 0.09 with decreasing Mr of PEG from 20,000 to 400, but was insensitive to changes in solution conditions (pH, T, salts), suggesting the absence of specific chemical interactions between protein and polymer. This conclusion was supported by the observation that concentrations of PEG up to 30% (w/v) had no significant effect on the melting temperature of ribonuclease A. Furthermore, equilibrium dialysis measurements, as well as various spectral measurements, provided no evidence for such interactions. Using a steric exclusion model (Edmond, E., and Ogston, A. G. (1968) Biochem. J. 109, 569-576) and assuming that the chemical potential of the solid phase is constant, beta can be related to interaction coefficients calculated from co-volumes using the equivalent sphere radii of PEG (r2) and protein (r3). Although good agreement was obtained for albumin in PEG-20,000, the predicted dependence of beta on r3 was greater than observed and the predicted dependence of beta on r2 was of opposite direction to that observed. However, the interaction coefficient determined from the equilibrium dialysis measurements of albumin and PEG-1000 agreed with the predicted value. Thus, the exclusion of low concentrations of PEG by albumin can be explained by a simple excluded volume model, whereas the exclusion of protein out of solution by PEG appears to be more complex."
https://openalex.org/W1589586351,"The reactions of human hemoglobin with sodium nitrite and ethyl nitrite in deoxygenated media have been examined in kinetic detail. Nitrous acid has been identified from kinetic pH dependence studies as the principal oxidant of hemoglobin in reactions with sodium nitrite. Nitrosylhemoglobin is produced concurrently with methemoglobin as a result of reductive release of nitric oxide from nitrous acid. However, oxidation of hemoglobin by nitric oxide competes with association, and this process is proposed to arise from the action of the nitric oxide dimer on hemoglobin. Ethyl nitrite, which serves as a model for nitrous acid, reacts with hemoglobin at rates that are at least 10 times slower than those extrapolated for nitrous acid, and hydrolysis of the alkyl nitrite is not competitive with oxidation of hemoglobin. The composite experimental results are interpreted to describe alkyl nitrite, and, presumably, nitrous acid association with hemoglobin followed by rate-limiting electron transfer resulting in nitric oxide and alkoxide (or hydroxide) production. Proton transfer resulting in alcohol (or water) formation occurs subsequent to the rate-limiting step as do reactions of hemoglobin with nitric oxide."
https://openalex.org/W1584368644,"The mechanism of the growth-promoting action of 2-mercaptoethanol on mouse lymphoma L1210 cells in vitro has been studied. The normal line of L1210 is deficient in its capacity to take up cystine, and this limits the growth of the cells in normal culture media containing cystine. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the cells obtain a high capacity to utilize cystine in the medium. The reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol with cystine produces a mixed disulfide of 2-mercaptoethanol and cysteine. The mixed disulfide is taken up by the cells mainly via the L system, a transport system for neutral alpha-amino acids such as leucine. The mixed disulfide within the cells is rapidly reduced to produce cystine and 2-mercaptoethanol which escapes rapidly into the medium and reacts with cystine again. With the aid of this cyclic action of 2-mercaptoethanol, the cells are able to utilize cystine constantly."
https://openalex.org/W1554328811,"An inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities has been identified in the plasmas of several animal species. The inhibitor in human plasma has been separated from lipid transfer protein by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and CM-cellulose. The inhibitor is characterized as a protein with Mr approximately 35,000 and an isoelectric point of 4 or less. The inhibitor protein decreased the transfer of both triglyceride and cholesteryl ester between all pairs of very low, low, and high density lipoproteins. Although under most conditions the inhibition of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer was similar, the degree of inhibition of lipid transfer was dependent on the lipoprotein pair studied."
https://openalex.org/W1559604507,"SC-1 cells infected with reovirus continue to synthesize host proteins at a nearly normal rate for at least 12 h postinfection. The relative translational efficiencies of reovirus and host mRNAs were determined at various times during this interval. Analysis was performed by determining the sensitivity of individual mRNA translation rates to inhibition by low doses of cycloheximide, by measuring polysome sizes, and by quantitatively comparing mRNA concentration with protein synthesis rates. Treatment of infected cells with low doses of cycloheximide actually stimulates the synthesis of some of the major reovirus protein, whereas host protein synthesis is inhibited. An analysis of the polysomes encoding two reovirus proteins (microNS and sigma 3; synthesis of both is stimulated by cycloheximide) shows that these proteins are synthesized on polysomes smaller than those producing host proteins of comparable size. Reovirus mRNAs accumulate to unusually high levels during the first 8 h of infection, accounting for 30% to 45% by weight of the total mRNA in the cell. We interpret these results as indicating that viral and host mRNAs must compete for a message-discriminatory component prior to their binding to the 40 S ribosomal complex and that this component is limiting in reovirus-infected cells. Moreover, a hierarchy must exist among mRNAs in terms of their affinity for this component, host mRNAs in general having greater affinities than reovirus mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1509345947,"Glycosylation of N-linked glycoproteins has been stimulated in hen oviduct and bovine pancreas tissue slices by supplementing the tissue culture media with concentrations of dolichylphosphate from 1-100 micrograms/ml. In oviduct, overall incorporation of radioactive sugars into alkali-stable, hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material (N-linked glycoproteins) is stimulated approximately 2-fold in dolichylphosphate-supplemented tissues although no stimulation in protein synthesis is observed. Rather, the elevation in glycosylation seems to be a general one involving many protein acceptors. In vitro analysis of microsomal preparations derived from control or dolichylphosphate-supplemented oviduct tissue slices demonstrated a similar enhancement in glycosylation activities that appears to be attributable to an enhanced level of endogenous dolichylphosphate in the microsomes from supplemented tissues. Additionally, when bovine pancreas tissue slices are preincubated with dolichylphosphate and then doubly labeled with [3H]mannose and 14C-labeled amino acids, a 4-fold increase in the ratio of [3H-mannose to 14C-amino acids in secreted ribonuclease is observed relative to the nonsupplemented control. Furthermore, while only 12% of the ribonuclease secreted from control tissue slices specifically binds to concanavalin A-Sepharose, more than 90% of that secreted by dolichylphosphate-supplemented tissue slices binds to the lectin. These data support the notion that dolichylphosphate availability is a limiting factor in the in vivo glycosylation of proteins in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2110673482,"somal cytochrome P-450 (P-450~~) with aromatic hydroperoxides and peracids two transient spectral intermediates are produced reversibly: Complex C, which is directly involved in the hydroxylation pathway, and Complex D, which is formed in a nonproductive side reaction. In the present study the broad substrate specificity of P-450~~ was exploited to examine the effect of structural changes on the reaction Toluene + cumene hydroperoxide -j benzyl alcohol + cumyl alcohol Determination of Complexes C and D by stopped flow spectrophotometry and measurement of the initial rate of benzyl alcohol formation in the presence of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide and alcohol dehydrogenase indicated that a number of m- and p-substituted toluenes and cumene hydroperoxides could be used in place of the parent compounds. The rate-limiting decay of Complex C was found to be dependent on the structure of both the peroxy compound and the hydroxylatable substrate. These results are compatible with a homolytic mechanism of oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage but not with the heterolytic formation of a common iron-oxo intermediate from the various peroxides."
https://openalex.org/W1549034966,"Antibody prepared against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase of rat liver can be shown to inhibit this enzyme in extracts prepared from cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. The molecular weight (53,000) of the HMG-CoA reductase subunits of rat liver and Chinese hamster liver is identical with a [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptide that can be precipitated from CHO-K1 lysates by this antibody used in conjunction with protein A Sepharose. It is shown that 25-hydroxycholesterol which lowers HMG-CoA reductase activity in cultured fibroblasts blocks the incorporation of labeled methionine into this polypeptide. Furthermore, the antibody immune precipitates two other polypeptides with molecular weights of 127,000 and 60,000. The latter polypeptide responds to 25-hydroxycholesterol in the same fashion as the 53,000-dalton polypeptide. In a dominant 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant mutant of the CHO-K1 cell, 25-hydroxycholesterol did not inhibit incorporation of labeled methionine into either the 53,000- or 60,000-dalton polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1535694102,"A kinetic model of protein synthesis is presented, primarily designed to analyze the accompanying data (Brendler, T., Godefroy-Colburn, T., Carlill, R. D., and Thach, R. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11747-11754; Walden, W. E., Godefroy-Colburn, T., and Thach, R. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11739-11746). Our model treats initiation as a multistep process in which mRNA must bind to a prior to its recognition by the native 40 S subunit. Interaction with the latter is followed by an irreversible rearrangement which yields the functional 40 S initiation complex capable of binding the 60 S ribosome with release of all the factors. Elongation is simply treated as a series of irreversible steps with a single rate constant. The model takes into account the recycling of ribosomal subunits, initiation factors, discriminatory factor, and message initiation site. We can thus mimic the simultaneous translation of several messages, each with its own concentration, size, binding constants, and rate constants. The only limit to the number of messages is the capacity of the computer (3 kilobytes of accessible memory is sufficient for 5 messages). Thus, we are able to evaluate quantitatively the effect of each parameter on the rate of synthesis of individual polypeptides, on polysome size, and on the repartition of message species between the untranslated and the polysomal pools. Several applications are considered: (i) competitive translation of alpha- and beta-globin in vitro (Kabat, D., and Chappel, M. R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2684-2690); (ii) determination of the relative affinities of reoviral messages for the discriminatory factor in vitro (Brendler, T., Godefroy-Colburn, T., Carlill, R. D., and Thach, R. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11747-11754); (iii) effect of elongation inhibitors on the translation of reoviral and cellular messages in SC-1 fibroblasts (Walden, W. E., Godefroy-Colburn, T., and Thach, R. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11739-11746); and (iv) effect of the growth state on the initiation efficiency of Vero cell messages (Lee, G. T.-Y., and Engelhardt, D. L. (1979) J. Mol. biol. 129, 221-233). In each case we find that the experimental data are consistent with the notion that mRNAs compete for a discriminatory factor independent of the ribosome. This factor has a high enough affinity for mRNAs to ensure nearly quantitative binding. When present in a limiting amount (with respect to the message pool but not necessarily with respect to the rest of the translation apparatus), the discriminatory factor selects against those messages for which its affinity is lowest, thereby modulating their initiation efficiency. When the factor is present in excess, on the other hand, all the messages are translated at maximum efficiency. This form of translational control could be remarkably efficient as an on-off switch for the synthesis of a few key proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551475724,"An electrophoretically homogeneous high molecular weight form (640,000) of HeLa cell DNA polymerase alpha was shown to catalyze DNA synthesis with a variety of di- and oligoriboadenylates and oligodeoxyriboadenylates as primers with poly(dT) as template. Diadenosine 5',5'-P1,p4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) can be utilized as a primer with poly(dT) as template and was found to be covalently attached to the 5'-end of the poly(dA) product. An Ap4A binding protein is tightly associated with the high molecular weight form of DNA polymerase alpha. This protein which exhibits high affinity, noncovalent binding of Ap4A is resolved from the multiprotein DNA polymerase alpha complex, along with other accessory proteins, by hydrophobic affinity chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose columns."
https://openalex.org/W1558208511,"The fluorescence quenching of acridine orange has been used to study the formation and dissipation of acid interior pH gradients in brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbit renal cortex. Acidic interior pH gradients were produced by 1) outwardly directed gradients of Na+ or K+, and 2) the addition of vesicles equilibrated at pH 6.0 to 7.5 buffer. The rate of pH gradient dissipation was stimulated 6.3-fold by the replacement of tetramethylammonium gluconate by tetramethylammonium chloride. A further increase, of 2-fold, was seen upon the addition of carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazine, demonstrating the existence of a Cl- conductance pathway. In the presence of valinomycin, the replacement of tetramethylammonium gluconate by K gluconate increased the rate of delta pH dissipation by 11-fold, demonstrating the existence of a conductive pathway for protons. This pathway for protons was also shown by the formation of an acidic interior space by an outwardly directed K gradient in the presence of valinomycin. The parallel conductive pathways for H+ and Cl- may dissipate pH and chloride gradients across the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule."

https://openalex.org/W1517103636,"The L-glutamine- and N-acetyl-L-glutamate-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III present in liver of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) has been purified to a high state of purity. The purified enzyme has a Mr congruent to 160,000 and is subject to self-association which is facilitated by the presence of MgATP, L-glutamine, and N-acetyl-L-glutamate. The enzyme exhibits hysteretic properties. The time course of the reaction is characterized by a lag or a burst in activity, depending upon preincubation conditions, which can last up to 30 min. The lag period can be eliminated by preincubating the enzyme at 26 degrees C (but not at 4 degrees C) in the presence of the above three ligands. Mg2+ in excess of that required to complex ATP as MgATP and N-acetyl-L-glutamate are both required for full activity. The requirement of K+ for activity can be replaced by NH4+, but not by Na+. Ammonia can act as a substrate in place of L-glutamine, but the maximal rate is much less than that which can be obtained with L-glutamine. The glutamine-dependent activity is inhibited by ammonia. Apparent Km values under optimal conditions for N-acetyl-L-glutamate, L-glutamine, MgATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia are 0.013 mM, 0.16 mM, 0.35 mM, 1.7 mM, and 2 mM, respectively. The apparent Km for N-acetyl-L-glutamate decreases when the concentration of L-glutamine increases, and vice versa. The apparent Km values for these two ligands are increased when urea is present at normal physiological concentrations (0.4 M), and the activity of the enzyme is significantly affected by changes in urea concentration. Compounds known to act as allosteric effectors on other glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetases had little or no effect on this enzyme. The properties of the enzyme are consistent with the view that the function of this carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III is related to the synthesis of urea which is retained in these species as a mechanism for osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1549635189,"Antithrombin III is of potential value for replacement therapy in patients with acquired or congenital deficiencies. Pasteurization of the purified inhibitor for 10 h at 60 degrees C can reduce the risk of transfusion hepatitis. Addition of appropriate stabilizers can largely prevent the loss of antithrombin activity which otherwise occurs during pasteurization. Studies of the mechanism of denaturation and stabilization have been facilitated by the use of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate which binds weakly to the inhibitor and whose fluorescence undergoes a sigmoidal response to increasing temperature. The extent of the increase in 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence correlates roughly with the loss of antithrombin activity and with the extent of protein aggregation as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The midpoint, Td, of the thermal denaturation curve increases by 13 degrees C and 19 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 M and 1.0 M sodium citrate, respectively. Phosphate, sulfate, and EDTA are also strong stabilizers while the chaotropic anions, iodide and thiocyanate are potent destabilizers. Heparin at 10 mg/ml increases Td by 7 degrees C, presumably through a direct binding mechanism; chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid have no effect. Samples pasteurized for 10 h at 60 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 M and 1.0 M citrate retain essentially full activity but exhibit evidence of minor alterations in their interaction with heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1570673679,"The complete amino acid sequence of the beta subunit of phycocyanin from the unicellular rhodophyte Cyanidium caldarium, has been determined by automated sequential degradation of cyanogen bromide, tryptic, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease peptides. The beta subunit contains 172 amino acids with methionine and glutamine the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids, respectively. The calculated molecular weight of the protein, based on the sequence, is 19,572. Two phycocyanobilin chromophores are covalently attached by cysteinyl thioether linkages to residues 82 and 153. A third cystine (residue 109) occurs in the beta subunit, but it is not attached to phycocyanobilin. Comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of the beta subunit of C. caldarium phycocyanin with the sequences of the phycocyanin beta subunits from two cyanobacteria, shows that the sequence homology previously noted at the NH2 terminus of phycobiliproteins from distantly related organisms extends along the entire polypeptide chain. The amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta subunits of C. caldarium phycocyanin are also similar, and by proper alignment of the sequences it can be shown that the beta subunit contains a 12-residue insertion where the second phycocyanobilin chromophore is covalently attached. A matrix comparing the alpha and beta subunits of phycobiliproteins for which the complete sequences are known has been determined, and based on these data, a scheme is proposed for evolution of the family of phycobiliproteins in living cyanobacteria and red algae from a protein precursor which gave rise initially to a beta-type allophycocyanin subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2113395930,"Cytochrome P-450 from cholate-solubilized liver microsomes prepared from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated genetically responsive C57BL/6N mice (Ahb/Ahb) was partially purified by aminooctyl-Sepharose 4B column chromatography with an elution buffer that included Emulgen 911, followed by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The P-450 was separated into 16 fractions: 15 fractions principally associated with the Ahb allele and induction by 3-methylcholanthrene and 1 fraction not associated with the Ahb allele, i.e. predominantly constitutive form(s) of P-450. The metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene, 7-ethoxycoumarin, biphenyl, ethoxyresorufin, acetanilide, 2-acetylaminofluorene, phenacetin, estradiol-17 beta, and testosterone was investigated. With these nine substrates, we examined the rates of formation of 17 products, i.e. 17 P-450-mediated reconstituted monooxygenase 'activities, in each of the 16 fractions. Differing reductase/cytochrome and lipid/cytochrome requirements were observed for each activity; the reasons for these empirical differences are not known. By two-factor analysis of variance our data for 17 catalytic activities can be explained by a minimum of 19 unique groups of monooxygenase activities: 12 induced by 3-methylcholanthrene and 7 control (endogenous). At least one of these distinctly different 3-methylcholanthrene-induced groups and at least one of these constitutive groups is associated with a marked blue spectral shift (approximately 2.0 nm) in the Soret peak of the reduced hemoprotein.CO complex, suggesting multiple forms of inducible and control P-448. Almost every reconstituted monooxygenase activity therefore appears to be unique and probably represents the aggregate activity from numerous forms of P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1583768205,"Inherited abnormal fibrinogens that exhibit altered behavior in one or more of the steps in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin should be useful for determining structure-function relationships important in the final stages of blood coagulation. In this work, we show that the inherited dysfibrinogenemia, fibrinogen Petoskey, is due to an Arg --* His replacement at residue 16 in the Aa chain of fibrinogen. This mutation involves the aminoacyl residue that provides the carbonyl portion of the peptide bond cleaved in the thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Thrombin treatment of fibrinogen from patients with fibrinogen Petoskey, followed by high performance liquid chromatography, indicated that equal amounts of normal and an abnormal fibrinopeptide A were liberated from the patients’ fibrinogen. This result indicates that the patients studied are heterozygotes with respect to their fibrinogen, which is consistent with the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance observed for their phenotypic prolonged thrombin clotting time. Amino acid analysis and carboxypeptidase Y digestion of the fibrinopeptides established the Arg + His interconversion for fibrinogen Petoskey. Our observation that thrombin catalyzes the hydrolysis of a histidyl peptide bond in the abnormal hrinogen is the first report of a thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of a peptide bond other than at an arginyl or lysyl residue, and suggests that the arginyl residue in fibrinogen can bind to the active site of thrombin with its side chain extended in a conformation similar to that of a histidyl side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1544197713,"Several lines of investigation were pursued to understand mechanisms involved in the in vivo depression of rat hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase by cyclophosphamide, an important anti-cancer and immunosuppressive agent. Essentially exclusive metabolism-dependent binding to microsomal proteins of 14C from [4-14C]cyclophosphamide, compared with 3H from [chloroethyl-3H]cyclophosphamide, suggests the binding of the metabolite acrolein. Of the various metabolites and analogs of cyclophosphamide tested (which did not contain a peroxy or a hydroperoxy group), only acrolein and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (which releases acrolein in solution) caused denaturation of microsomal cytochrome P-450 in vitro; this denaturation was identical with that produced by sulfhydryl reagents. Of the various chemicals tested, only those which contained either a free amino group (except lysine) and/or a free sulfhydryl group (e.g. semicarbazide, cysteine, glycine, glucosamine) effectively blocked (40-80%) the binding of 14C as well as protected against acrolein-induced denaturation of cytochrome P-450. These data further suggested interaction of cyclophosphamide metabolite with free amino and/or free sulfhydryl groups in proteins. However, comparison with [3H]aflatoxin B2a which interacts with free protein amino groups via the formation of Schiff bases, clearly attributed the preferential binding of 14C to cysteine sulfhydryl groups in these proteins. Studies on chemical models derived from reaction between acrolein and cysteine also supported this suggestion. When microsomes isolated from incubations metabolizing [4-14C]cyclophosphamide were subjected to gel electrophoresis, the major radioactive band detected by autoradiography was associated with a cytochrome P-450 band at 55,000 daltons, the major band induced by phenobarbital in the rat. All these results taken together strongly point to the possibility that acrolein is the cyclophosphamide metabolite responsible for the depression of the mixed function oxidase activities. Acrolein most likely produces this effect by alkylation of the sulfhydryl group(s) in the active site of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1501646674,"This paper examines the reaction pathway in which Fe2+ is bound by apotransferrin and subsequently oxidized by O2 to yield Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-). The time course of the reaction follows a curved first order function suggesting somewhat different reactivities of the two transferrin binding sites. The initial velocity of the oxidation reaction follows saturation kinetics with regard to apotransferrin, Fe2+, and NaHCO3. We suggest an equilibrium between these components and Fe2+-transferrin-CO3(2-). The initial velocity is a linear function of O2 concentration. This is consistent with the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction being the oxidation of the Fe2+-transferrin-CO3(2-). A second order rate constant of approximately 4 X 10(3) M-1 s-1 was estimated for the oxidation of Fe2+-transferrin-CO3(2-) by O2. Oxidation by H2O2 is about 30 times faster. The reaction velocity increases with increasing pH between pH 6.0 and 7.5 Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes are formed by the binding and oxidation of Fe2+ iun the presence of O2 and synergistic anions. The anion is found to have a strong effect on the reaction rate and provides additional evidence for the proposed reaction route. The presence of chelating agents also strongly affects the rate of Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-) formation. EDTA and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid severely depress the rate, while other chelating reagents have a moderately inhibiting effect. Thioglycolate is found to enhance the reaction by a factor of 9. The formation of a quaternary complex consisting of thioglycolate-Fe2+-transferrin-CO3(2-) is suggested. The results are correlated with an earlier study on the reductive release of iron from transferrin (Kojima, N., and Bates, G. W. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8847-8854)."

Procedures have been devised which provide maximum sensitivity with minimum potential for artifact. These procedures produce data that can be analyzed quantitatively to obtain numerical constants characteristic of a given mRNA's intrinsic initiation efficiency or, more precisely, competitive efficiency.

The effects of potassium chloride concentration and magnesium acetate concentration on mRNA competitive efficiencies have been studied using these procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1544325679,"Abstract Studies with the intact liver have suggested that newly synthesized heme exists transiently in a small pool before its incorporation into tissue heme proteins. The same or a closely related pool may regulate synthesis of heme and serve as the precursor of early peak bilirubin. To delineate this postulated pool by a direct approach, we have utilized primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. Cultures pulse-labeled with delta-amino[3H]levulinic acid at various time points were fractionated into 105,000 X g supernatant and pellet. Labeled heme appeared within 1 to 2 min in the cytosol fraction, followed by transfer to the pellet. The kinetics of heme formation and transfer and of labeled bilirubin production were analyzed by computer simulation utilizing the least squares method. The experimental findings conformed best to a four-compartment model that includes a second cytosolic heme compartment exchanging with the initially labeled compartment but not serving as a direct precursor of bilirubin. Calculation of apparent rate coefficients indicated that, in cultured hepatocytes, 20% of newly formed heme is converted directly to bile pigment, whereas 80% is utilized for formation of cellular heme proteins (64% in the pellet, 16% in the second cytosol compartment). This experimental approach has provided direct evidence for a rapidly formed cytosolic heme fraction which appears to be identical with the previously postulated regulatory or unassigned heme pool of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1600731439,"Human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) were deuterated in the phospholipid headgroup region by exchange with phosphatidylcholine-N(CD3)3-apolipoprotein A complexes. The exchange was associated with a net transfer of phosphatidylcholine to LDL leading to an increase in total phospholipid content by 27%. Practically all of the endogenous phosphatidylcholine including lysophosphatidylcholine, and about one-third of the sphingomyelin pool was found to be exchangeable. Immunochemically, deuterated LDL was identical with native LDL. The hydrodynamic and ultrastructural properties were closely similar for the two particle species apart from a slight increase in overall particle size by about 2%. Both native and deuterated LDL were investigated by neutron small angle scattering at several representative contrasts in H2O/D2O buffers. Subtraction of the scattering amplitudes of native from deuterated LDL resulted in a radius of gyration of 103 +/- 5 A for the N(CD3)3 groups, and in a structure factor resembling that of a thin, spherical shell. Evaluation of the contrast variation experiments in combination with previous data from x-ray small angle scattering (Laggner, P., and Mueller, K. (1978) Q. Rev. Biophys. 11, 371-425) indicates that the phospholipids form a spherical monolayer shell in the radial range between 75 A and 103 A around the core of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. For the protein moiety, a radius of gyration of 110 A was calculated, indicating that it is located, on average, 5 to 10 A from the polar phospholipid headgroups toward the aqueous environment."

L. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 2407-2411) not present in any of the other 11 cell lines. Biochemical characterization of the variant protein included determination of its subcellular location, partial amino acid composition, behavior on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) versus SDS/urea gels, and partial proteolytic digestion patterns. All of these methods showed that Cytosk:12 is related to Cytosk:11. Both proteins are located in the cytoskeleton, contain little cysteine or proline and no detectable tryptophan, shift together to a higher apparent molecular weight when electrophoresed in the presence of SDS and 8 M urea versus SDS alone, and have identical products after partial proteolysis according to Cleveland et al. (Cleveland, D. W., Fischer, S. G., Kirschner, M. W., and Laemmli, U. K. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1102-1106). Preparation of nonmuscle tropomyosin resulted in the partial purification of both Cytosk:11 and :12. The data suggest that Cytosk:11 is fibroblast nonmuscle tropomyosin and that Cytosk:12 in cell line 1493 is a charge variant of that protein."
https://openalex.org/W1557465373,"The intracellular site of uptake and degradation of globin-haptoglobin, the protein moiety of hemoglobin-haptoglobin, in rat liver cells was investigated in vivo. Hemoglobin-haptoglobin, administered intravenously to rats, is cleared from circulation and incorporated exclusively into liver parenchymal cells through the receptor specific for the molecule (Kino, K., Tsunoo, H., Higa, Y., Takami, M., Hamaguchi, H., and Nakajima, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9616-9620). Intrahepatocellular distribution of radioactivity was determined after intravenous administration of (125I-hemoglobin)-haptoglobin or hemoglobin-(125I-haptoglobin) to rats. The 125I-labeled hemoglobin-haptoglobin was incorporated first in organelles of low density (density range, 1.05-1.07 g/ml) recovered in Golgi subfractions of the liver cells in a substantially intact form. The organelles progressively acquired a higher density, presumably through fusion with primary lysosomes. In the resulting organelles of high density (density range, 1.07-1.15 g/ml), which are probably secondary lysosomes, hemoglobin-haptoglobin first dissociated symmetrically to yield two 82,000-dalton subunits by a limited proteolysis, and further digestion of the constituent polypeptide chains seemed to proceed thereafter in the organelles during the transport process across the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1906995665,"Five peptide analogs of the actomyosin ATPase inhibitory region of troponin I (Tn-I) have been synthesized by the solid-phase method. One analog was constructed with a sequence identical to that found in species of Tn-I isolated from chicken fast, rabbit fast and rabbit slow skeletal muscle. A second peptide was made identical to the sequence of the homologous inhibitory region of Tn-I from rabbit cardiac muscle. The remaining three analogs were hybrids of the two sequences. We have verified that rabbit skeletal fast Tn-I was a better inhibitor than rabbit cardiac Tn-I in a rabbit skeletal actomyosin assay system and extended these studies to show that the same results were found in an assay system which used rabbit cardiac actomyosin. Our skeletal fast muscle peptide analog was also a better inhibitor in both assay systems than the cardiac Tn-I peptide analog. The hybrid peptides indicated that the changing of proline 110 to a threonine residue had no effect and suggested that position 110 was not essential to inhibition. The other amino acid change, the replacement of arginine 113 by a leucine residue, was shown to be the crucial difference and resulted in lower activity. Thus, th differences in relative inhibitory activity of rabbit skeletal fast and cardiac Tn-I can be at least partially and possibly solely explained by the single amino acid substitution at position 113. Short active sequences of proteins, like the Tn-I inhibitory region are potentially of enormous value as probes of structure-function relationships."

MbO2 was reduced by hydrated electrons to form the hydrogen peroxide-induced compound, the so-called ferryl Mb. On the other hand, the oxyform of diacetydeuteroperoxidase was also reduced by hydrated electrons to form Compound I of this enzyme. Both reactions are found to follow second order kinetics with rate constants of 4 X 10(10) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.4, without detection of intermediates, i.e. 1-electron reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1566818065,"Dietary methyl-2-hexadecynoate appeared to inhibit fatty acid elongation in intact animals (Wood, R., Lee, T., and Gershon, H. (1980) Lipids 15, 141-150). Data from the present in vitro studies indicate that the microsomal elongation system is inhibited preferentially to the mitochondrial system. A series of metabolic acyl-CoA thioester intermediates has been isolated, characterized, and identified from microsomal and mitochondrial incubations with the 2-hexadecynoic acid (16 identical to 1 delta 2). The data support the following conclusions: 1) 16 identical to 1 delta 2 is activated to the CoA ester; 2) 16 identical to 1 delta 2 is acted on by an isomerase to produce a 2,3-allene; 3) either 16 identical to 1 delta 2 or the allene, or both, are hydrated to yield a beta-keto-CoA thioester after rearrangement; 4) the beta-keto ester is reduced to the beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA; 5) dehydration of the beta-hydroxy ester gives rise to trans-delta 2-hexadecenoate which accumulates; and 6) accumulation of the latter results from the inhibition of enoyl-CoA reductase by the 2,3-allene. The occurrence of cis and trans delta 3-hexadecenoates indicates the allene is reduced, after which the delta 3 monoene isomer may be isomerized to the delta 2 monoene by the acetylene isomerase or a different enzyme. Indirect evidence suggests that the fatty acid elongation systems may also be inhibited at another site."

https://openalex.org/W1607776312,"Abstract A number of temperature-sensitive conditional thymidine auxotrophs were isolated from mutagenized mouse FM3A cells. Upon temperature shift from 33.5 degrees C to 39.5 degrees C, the mutant cells rapidly lost thymidylate synthase activity with concomitant decrease in intracellular dTTP and changes in other dNTP pools. Thymidylate synthase obtained from these mutants was inactivated in a manner following first order kinetics by heat treatment, which did not affect the parental enzyme. When bound covalently to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-[32P]monophosphate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, the enzyme of one mutant migrated slower than the parental enzyme on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas it did not do so on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Spontaneous prototrophic revertants were isolated from most of the mutant lines. In some revertants, the enzyme regained the heat resistance of the wild type completely or partially. In other revertants, the enzyme was overproduced, but its heat-sensitive nature was unaltered. The results demonstrate unequivocally that the conditional thymidine auxotrophy in the mutants was caused by thermosensitive thymidylate synthase due, at least in one particular line, to a missense mutation in its structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1619633988,"Substituted 4-aminobutanoic acids were studied as potential irreversible inactivators of purified pig brain gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid. It was found that unlike the related 4-amino-5-halopentanoic acids (Silverman, R. B., and Levy, M. A. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1197), the 4-amino-3-halobutanoic acids were substrates for this enzyme, undergoing exclusive elimination to succinic semialdehyde and producing no inactivation. The hydroxy analogue, however, underwent exclusive transamination and no succinic semialdehyde was detected. These results are discussed in terms of the nature of the substituents, the structure of the active site of gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase, and the design of mechanism-based inactivators."
https://openalex.org/W1500610729,"Proton magnetic resonance studies have been made of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I. This protein contains a low potential 3Fe-3S center (Emp = -424 mV) and a high potential 4Fe-4S center (Emp = +320 mV). A series of five single proton resonances are visible downfield of 11 ppm in the isolated form of the protein. On reduction of the protein the three most downfield resonances are no longer visible and no new resonances are observed. These resonances are assigned to alpha-CH cysteinyl protons on residues 8, 20, and 49 which coordinate the 3Fe center. The two remaining downfield resonances are altered on oxidation of the protein, and are assigned to beta-CH2 cysteinyl protons on residues bound to the high potential 4Fe center. Comparison of the reported NMR spectrum of Desulfovibrio gigas ferredoxin II (Moura, J. J. G., Xavier, A. V., Bruschi, M., and Le Gall, J. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 459, 278-289) to that of A. vinelandii ferredoxin I is made. The 3Fe centers found in D. gigas ferredoxin Ii exhibit a reduction potential almost 300 mV more positive than the 3Fe center in A. vinelandii ferredoxin I. Evidence is presented that the 3Fe centers in the two proteins are not co-ordinated identically, and arguments are made which suggest that a small noncysteinyl ligand, modeled as a nonprotein oxygen atom in the x-ray structure A. vinelandii ferredoxin I, may be replaced in D. gigas ferredoxin II by a glutamyl epsilon-oxygen linkage to an iron atom. Further, it is noted that such a change could be responsible for the significant difference in reduction potential observed between the 3Fe centers in these two proteins."

Chem. 252, 4330-4336), we showed that immature chick oviduct membranes could not transfer [14C]mannose from GDP-[14C]Man to endogenous oligosaccharide pyrophosphoryl dolichol or protein. Estrogen treatment of chicks however, stimulated [14C]mannose transfer to those acceptors. In order to determine whether the oligosaccharide transfer responsible for N-glycosylation of oviduct proteins is present in immature oviduct membranes exogenous carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin and radiolabeled oligosaccharide-lipid were added to oviduct membranes. Because purity of the oligosaccharide-lipid is essential for consistent transfer of oligosaccharide to carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin a high pressure liquid chromatography procedure has been developed for oligosaccharide-lipid purification. The data obtained indicate that immature chick oviduct membranes do have an enzyme capable of oligosaccharide transfer and that the activity is enhanced 3- to 4-fold by estrogen treatment of chicks. A Glc-oligosaccharide is transferred approximately 3-fold more effectively than the nonglycosylated Man-oligosaccharide by membrane preparations from immature chicks, estrogen-treated chicks, and mature hens."
https://openalex.org/W1579254321,"Ribosomal subunits from the chloroplasts of Alaskan peas have been studied by immunoelectronmicroscopy. Electron micrographs of negatively stained small and large ribosomal subunits show particles of similar size and in the same characteristic projections described for the ribosomal subunits of Escherichia coli (Lake, J. A. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 105, 131-159), although minor structural differences are apparent. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis shows the modified nucleoside N6,N6-dimethyladenosine is conserved in chloroplast 16 S ribosomal RNA, presumably as two successive residues near the 3' end. Antibodies directed against N6,N6-dimethyladenosine were allowed to react with chloroplast 30S ribosomal subunits. Electron microscopy showed individual subunit-antibody complexes and pairs of ribosomal subunits cross-linked by a single antibody. In 94% of the complexes observed, antibody contact was consistent with a dimethyladenosine localization near the end of the small subunit platform, in an area of subunit contact in the 70 S ribosome. This localization is analogous to the placement of N6,N6-dimethyladenosine in the E. coli ribosome (Politz, S. M., and Glitz, D. G. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 1468-1472)."
https://openalex.org/W1574562810,"Abstract We have developed a coupled enzyme system composed of hexokinase, glucose, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase which is able to rapidly convert GTP at the exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin to GDP. Using this method, we have studied the dynamic properties of microtubules and tubulin subunits in the presence of GDP. Conversion of GTP to GDP causes microtubules to change to a new, somewhat lower steady state level; dilution studies show that subunits disassemble from microtubules at steady state in the presence of GDP at a rate comparable to that in the presence of GTP; in reactions of existing microtubules with tubulin-GDP subunits it was found that tubulin-GDP subunits do not participate in net microtubule elongation. From these observations we conclude that in the presence of tubulin-GDP the microtubule steady state has an unusual property; in spite of the fact that the microtubule is continuously undergoing rapid subunit loss, but not subunit addition, a nearly constant steady state level of microtubule mass is maintained. This must mean that tubulin-GDP subunits, although unable to participate in a net addition, can participate in additions each of which compensates for the dissociation of a single subunit from the microtubule. This is equivalent to the existence of an isoenergetic exchange of a tubulin-GDP in solution for a subunit which had been lost from the end of a microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W1529690197,"We have established the presence of two distinct forms of dihydrofolate reductase in methotrexate-resistant L5178Y lymphoma cells. It was previously found that one of the reductases (Form II) was approximately 100,000-fold more resistant to methotrexate inhibition than Form I. In this report, the two forms of dihydrofolate reductase have been partially purified and their properties have been compared. The two forms were found to differ markedly in their heat stability, isoelectric points, and sensitivity to p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate. There were, in addition, minor differences in their Km and Vmax for folic acid, their pH optima, and their molecular weights. The loss of sensitivity to methotrexate inhibition by the Form II reductase is associated with significant alteration in the physical and chemical properties of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1525372983,"It has previously been shown that the partial reaction between fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA substrate is pH-dependent (larger rate constants at basic pH) and shows a biphasic rate profile indicative of formation of an initial charge transfer complex between the C-2 anion of substrate and enzyme. The present investigation indicates that the complete reaction between acyl-CoA and electron transfer flavoprotein shows a pH profile dependent upon ionization of a single basic group with pKa = 7.7. these facts are consistent with electron transfer which occurs through an obligatory charge transfer complex between the C-2 anion of substrate and oxidized FAD at the enzyme active site. The anion of acetoacetyl-CoA forms a charge transfer complex with enzyme which serves as a model for the putative catalytically active complex mentioned above. Resonance Raman investigation of this acetoacetyl-CoA-enzyme complex indicates that the 1586 cm-1 band is coupled strongly to the charge transfer electronic transition. Since this vibrational band is associated with vC=N at N-5, C-4a of the flavin ring, we suggest that electron transfer takes place at this site."
https://openalex.org/W1555586224,"The sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) from crayfish has in its dimer form two calcium-specific and four Ca-Mg sites. The conformations of this protein in the calcium- (SCP2 *Cas), magnesium- (SCP2 -Mg4), and metal-free forms as well as in intermediary states have been studied by circular dichroism (CD) in the far and near-ultraviolet regions, tryptophan fluorescence, sulfhydryl reactivity, and trypsin susceptibility. SCP appears to contain eight a helical segments (per subunit), each consisting of about 10 amino acid residues. Three of these helices require eaz+ to be formed and are stable even in the presence of 8 M urea provided SCP is saturated by calcium. This is not the case for the remaining five helical segments. One of the three calcium-sensitive helices is unaffected by Mg+, and is formed upon ea2+ binding to the Ca-specific site. In the calcium-saturated SCP, 8 to 9 Phe residues out of 13 (per monomer) are immobilized in a helical segments. Two Phe side chains are present in the Ca-sensitive helix adjacent to the Ca-specific site. Some of the Tyr chromophores are located in the metal-sensitive helices flanking both the calcium-specific and the Ca-Mg sites, contrary to the Trp residues, which are not included in these a helical segments. Two thiols out of three (per monomer) display a marked decrease in reactivity when SCP binds Ca2+ or M8+, and are less accessible to 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the calciumthan in the magnesium-form of the protein. In the presence of physiological levels of Mg+, Ca2+ induces major structural changes (SCPz-Mg, -+ SCPZ*C~~) which involve the calcium-specific sites rather than the Ca-Mg sites. This contrasts sharply with the situation prevailing in vertebrate SCP (parvalbumin) as the latter has no calcium-specific sites and displays very limited conformational changes upon Ca-Mg exchange."

After removal of all readily exchangeable tritium, the products were obtained in 32-83% yields with specific radioactivities of 18-856 Ci/mol. The products were carefully characterized, shown to be chemically pure, and to have complete biological activity. Simple tritium hydrogen exchange accounts for at least 82% of the reaction pathway with proteins and for 100% of the reaction with the peptide aldehydes.

The enzymatic activity increases proportionally, over a given range, with increasing concentrations of both substrates and of enzyme. The apparent Km of the enzyme for galactosyldiacylglycerol is 130 microM, and for CMP-NeuNAc, 780 microM. The reaction proceeds optimally at pH 6.2. The product of the enzymatic reaction was characterized as a lipid which contained galactosyldiacylglycerol and N-acetylneuraminic acid. 14C-labeled lipid, synthesized from [14C]N-acetylneuraminic acid, and 3H-labeled lipid, synthesized from [3H]galactosyldiacylglycerol, ran with identical RF values when chromatographed on thin layers of silica gel. The water-soluble products, obtained by mild alkaline deacylation of these two labeled lipids, migrated the same when electrophoresed on paper. The ratio 14C/3H was calculated as 0.83 for doubly labeled lipid, [14C]sialosyl-[3H]galactosyldiacylglycerol. Degradation of this doubly labeled lipid by mild alkaline deacylation, followed by mild acid hydrolysis, yielded products that cochromatographed with standards galactosylglycerol and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Analysis of the products resulting from periodate oxidation of the 3H-labeled lipid demonstrated that the N-acetylneuraminic acid is linked to carbon 3 of the galactose."
https://openalex.org/W1505894849,"The visible absorption changes upon addition of 1-methylimidazole to ferric protohemin(2-methylimidazole)2 were examined in dimethylsulfoxide at 21 degrees C. The formation of the mixed ligand complex, protohemin(1-methylimidazole)(2-methylimidazole), was confirmed with the equilibrium constant of 5.50 +/- 0.41. The absorption changes accompanied with a rise of the high spin bands and a fall of the low spin bands were interpreted to reflect the structural change of the iron-imidazole bond in going from the strained to unstrained states. The calculated difference spectrum between the mixed ligand complex and protohemin(2-methylimidazole)2 exhibited peaks at 420, 500, 540, 560, and 620 nm. These peak positions were in good agreement with those reported for imidazole methemoglobin upon addition of inositol of hexaphosphate (IHP). The proton NMR observation for 1-methylimidazole-ligated methemoglobin showed that IHP induces a structural change in the globin of the ligand bound methemoglobin. This proton NMR observation and the visible difference spectral similarity between imidazole methemoglobin and its model complex suggest that IHP imposes a proximal strain of 300 +/- 50 cal/mol in imidazole methemoglobin. Consideration on the strain energy and the sixth ligand affinity in the model system suggests that the changes in the noncovalent interactions between the globin and the porphyrin or ligand are important to regulate the imidazole affinity of imidazole methemoglobin bound with IHP."

The purification scheme involved fractionation of bovine thyroid homogenates successively on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and Sephadex G-200. Activity was determined as ability to stimulate phosphocellulose-purified tubulin assembly measured turbidimetrically. Purification of stimulatory activity resulted in the selective enrichment to near homogeneity of a 40,000-45,000-dalton protein. The molecular weight was estimated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein stimulated both the rate and the extent of assembly of thyroid and brain tubulin. In the turbidity assay which contained 4 M glycerol, the threshold for assembly of brain tubulin (at 1.7 mg/ml) was 0.01 mg/ml for the thyroid stimulator. Brain and thyroid microtubules assembled with thyroid stimulator appeared normal in diameter and shape by electron microscopy. Thyroid stimulator activity was destroyed by trypsinization or boiling.
