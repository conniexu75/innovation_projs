https://openalex.org/W1994143276,"THE existence of ‘incomplete’ forms of antibodies active against human erythrocytes and detectable by means of the Coombs test1 is now widely recognized. Rh antibodies are commonly present in this form, and so are some at least of the recently recognized rarer immune antibodies2, such as anti-Kell and anti-S. The fact that the iso-antibodies anti-A and anti-B may similarly exist in incomplete forms is also being increasingly realized3."

https://openalex.org/W2082701165,"WHEN considering a chromatographic method for separating a complex mixture, it is desirable to choose an adsorbent which functions through only one type of adsorption mechanism. Most adsorbents in use to-day lack this desirable property, so that the displacement chromatographic technique of Tiselius is not always applicable. It is the purpose of this communication to describe a novel chromatographic method of using ion-exchange resins so that only one of two possible adsorption mechanisms associated with their use can function."
https://openalex.org/W2018856921,FROM a large number of investigations it is known that the appearance of the symptoms of polyneuritis in animals fed on an aneurin-deficient diet is accelerated by increasing the amounts of carbohydrate fed and delayed by replacing carbohydrate by fat1. This has led to the formulation of the so-called ‘sparing action of fat on vitamin B1’ 2.

In 1915 Kylin3 stated that he had hydrolysed it with malt diastase; but he has recently withdrawn this claim4, and in this Laboratory also it has been found that malt diastase is without action on laminarin."

https://openalex.org/W2045440519,"FOLLOWING the suggestion of Dewar1, it is now generally accepted that the mould metabolic products, stipitatic acid, puberulic acid and puberulonic acid are derivatives of tropolone2. Erdtman and Gripenberg3 have shown that α-, β- and γ-thujaplicins from Thuja plicata, the western red cedar tree, are, respectively, α-, β- and γ-isopropyltropolones. γ-Thujaplicin was found to possess fungicidal activity; when spores of Pullularia pullulans were suspended in a 0.02 per cent solution, 100 per cent survived after 1 hr., 11 per cent after 3 hr. and none after 6 hr. and 24 hr. exposure. Two of us (J. W. C. and A. R. S.) have recently described a synthesis of 3 : 4-benztropolone4."

https://openalex.org/W2077505962,"WORKERS in Europe1–4 have maintained that the common earwig, Forficula auricularia L., is single-brooded in Europe, whereas American researchers5–9 have recorded that this species in America has two broods a year. Recently, Bolwig10 reported from Denmark that F. auricularia is single-brooded, and laid a second batch only if the first eggs were destroyed. However, while studying the life-history of F. auricularia in the Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, I found the earwig to be double-brooded. The first or winter batch of eggs is laid between late November and March. During May–June some of the females die, and the others lay a second or spring batch of eggs. A detailed account of the investigations will appear elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2009767425,"THE first of the two possible D—D reactions has long been used as a source of mono-energetic neutrons. To use it as a standard source of neutrons requires either the counting of all the neutrons, using, for example, a water-tank method, or the counting of the helium-3 particles, which is difficult because of their very short range. But if, with given conditions, the ratio of the number of helium-3 particles to the number of hydrogen-3 or hydrogen-1 particles from the second reaction is once found, then the neutron flux may afterwards be determined merely by counting the number of hydrogen particles, which is much easier owing to their greater range."

https://openalex.org/W1984172853,"THERE has been much discussion about the existence of re-trapping (electronic recapture) in phosphorescence1. One of my experiments seems to demonstrate the existence of re-trapping: electrons leave the deep traps and get into the short-life traps. I used a calcium sulphide, (bismuth activator) phosphor of very long afterglow. This sulphide was strongly excited by ultra-violet radiations of about 0.36 µ from a mercury vapour arc; it was then heated up to 135° C. until complete extinction was reached. When the sulphide had cooled down to room temperature, it was submitted to the infra-red radiations of a 300-W. electric lamp filtered by a black manganese–iron glass with transparent range of 0.8 µ–4µ with some peaks between 1 µ and 4 µ."

(Hemiptera–Aphididae) sent in for identification to the British Museum (Natural History) in 1939 showed deviation from the typical form. Progeny from the specimens submitted showed marked variation. In one case a single apterous viviparous female was observed to produce two quite different larvae, which afterwards developed into forms exhibiting accentuated differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2080930676,"ATTENTION has recently been devoted in this Department to the development of a growth cabinet in which the environment can be controlled, eventually for use in pasture research in New Zealand. For this purpose the critical requirement is high light intensity with the quality of daylight, over an area large enough for adequate replication of the experimental plants. It is the experience of plant physiologists that it is difficult to obtain such lighting without the complications caused by excessive radiation. The following note may therefore be of interest."

https://openalex.org/W2162131863,"THE water metabolism of newly born mammals differs from that of adult animals. This difference is due to the fact that the former cannot increase their tubular re-absorption of water under conditions of dehydration to the same extent as adult animals1. The reason for this difference lies in the neurohypophysis of newly born mammals, which is morphologically and functionally immature2. I have tried to ascertain whether the water metabolism of newly born rats develops continuously, or whether there is a jump in its development. I have investigated whether there is a correlation between the functional development of the organ of sight and the quality of the water metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2078254092,"CERTAIN considerations based on the principles of quantum mechanics lead to the view that the process of localization of a particle in space and time is subject to quantization. Thus if the world line of a particle of rest mass m0 is considered, it has no physical meaning to subdivide it into elements of length less than h/m0c, or, what is the same thing, to associate with the particle intervals of proper time less than h/m0c2 1. This has been expressed as a principle of elementary indeterminacy by Ruark2 and by Furth3."

Recently, Schreiner, Lindsley and Magoun1 and others have suggested that the reticulo-spinal mechanism is more likely to be implicated. In this connexion the following observations upon an anuran, Bufo marinus, are of interest."

https://openalex.org/W2326325091,"A REVISION of the marine Myxophyceæ of New Zealand has resulted in the addition of many species, none new, to the flora. A similar revision of the Chlorophyceæ has revealed the fact that even in this well-known group the flora of the South Pacific is probably the most profitable field for phycologists. The new discoveries include a new genus of the Ulvales with five species, three of which are restricted to Stewart Island and the southern Antarctic dependencies. In this remarkable new genus the cells, which are small in surface view, are commonly in pairs (hence it is proposed to call the genus Gemina) and are excessively elongated vertically. They are also extruded very readily from the matrix of the lamina. The other interesting feature is the manner in which the species simulate other genera of the Ulvales. Thus one species has the appearance of an Enteromorpha, two have the appearance respectively of orbicular and lanceolate species of Ulva and a fourth is like a Letterstedtia."
