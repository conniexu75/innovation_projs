https://openalex.org/W3136588845,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, designated variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 by Public Health England1, was first identified in the UK in late summer to early autumn 20202. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing for COVID-19 show an extremely rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during autumn 2020, suggesting that it has a selective advantage. Here we show that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that B.1.1.7 has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if it has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with cases of B.1.1.7 including a larger share of under 20-year-olds than non-VOC cases. We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers for B.1.1.7 and co-circulating lineages using SGTF and genomic data. The best-supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups, but all analyses agreed that B.1.1.7 has a substantial transmission advantage over other lineages, with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number. Genetic and testing data from England show that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.1.7 has a transmission advantage over other lineages."
https://openalex.org/W3137107306,"Despite signs of infection-including taste loss, dry mouth and mucosal lesions such as ulcerations, enanthema and macules-the involvement of the oral cavity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the human minor salivary glands and gingiva (9 samples, 13,824 cells), identifying 50 cell clusters. Using integrated cell normalization and annotation, we classified 34 unique cell subpopulations between glands and gingiva. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry factors such as ACE2 and TMPRSS members were broadly enriched in epithelial cells of the glands and oral mucosae. Using orthogonal RNA and protein expression assessments, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the glands and mucosae. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and sustained SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acellular and cellular salivary fractions from asymptomatic individuals were found to transmit SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples displayed distinct viral shedding dynamics, and salivary viral burden correlated with COVID-19 symptoms, including taste loss. Upon recovery, this asymptomatic cohort exhibited sustained salivary IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these data show that the oral cavity is an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and implicate saliva as a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."

Hui et al. report an alternative route in which vertically aligned lead iodide thin films are grown from the ionic liquid methylamine formate. Nanoscale channels in the films lower the barrier to permeation of formamidinium iodide and enable transformation to α-FAPbI 3 , even at high humidity and room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W3137913212,"Background e-learning was underutilized in the past especially in developing countries. However, the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the entire world to rely on it for education. Objectives To estimate the university medical staff perceptions, evaluate their experiences, recognize their barriers, challenges of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate factors influencing the acceptance and use of e-learning as a tool teaching within higher education. Methods Data was collected using an electronic questionnaire with a validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for exploring factors that affect the acceptance and use of e-learning as a teaching tool among medical staff members, Zagazig University, Egypt. Results The majority (88%) of the staff members agreed that the technological skills of giving the online courses increase the educational value of the experience of the college staff. The rate of participant agreement on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and acceptance of e-learning was (77.1%, 76.5%, and 80.9% respectively). The highest barriers to e-learning were insufficient/ unstable internet connectivity (40%), inadequate computer labs (36%), lack of computers/ laptops (32%), and technical problems (32%). Younger age, teaching experience less than 10 years, and being a male are the most important indicators affecting e-learning acceptance. Conclusion This study highlights the challenges and factors influencing the acceptance, and use of e-learning as a tool for teaching within higher education. Thus, it will help to develop a strategic plan for the successful implementation of e-learning and view technology as a positive step towards evolution and change."
https://openalex.org/W3136546688,"Selective protein degradation platforms have afforded new development opportunities for therapeutics and tools for biological inquiry. The first lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) targeted extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation by bridging a target protein to the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR). Here, we developed LYTACs that engage the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a liver-specific lysosome-targeting receptor, to degrade extracellular proteins in a cell-type-specific manner. We conjugated binders to a triantenerrary N-acetylgalactosamine (tri-GalNAc) motif that engages ASGPR to drive the downregulation of proteins. Degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by GalNAc-LYTAC attenuated EGFR signaling compared to inhibition with an antibody. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a LYTAC consisting of a 3.4-kDa peptide binder linked to a tri-GalNAc ligand degrades integrins and reduces cancer cell proliferation. Degradation with a single tri-GalNAc ligand prompted site-specific conjugation on antibody scaffolds, which improved the pharmacokinetic profile of GalNAc-LYTACs in vivo. GalNAc-LYTACs thus represent an avenue for cell-type-restricted protein degradation. Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) based on glycan ligands of the asialoglycoprotein receptor facilitate the cell-specific targeting and turnover of proteins by lysosomal enzymes, expanding the scope of LYTAC-mediated targeted protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3138817412,"Accurate quantification of the proteome remains challenging for large sample series and longitudinal experiments. We report a data-independent acquisition method, Scanning SWATH, that accelerates mass spectrometric (MS) duty cycles, yielding quantitative proteomes in combination with short gradients and high-flow (800 µl min-1) chromatography. Exploiting a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window to assign precursor masses to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment traces, Scanning SWATH increases precursor identifications by ~70% compared to conventional data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods on 0.5-5-min chromatographic gradients. We demonstrate the application of ultra-fast proteomics in drug mode-of-action screening and plasma proteomics. Scanning SWATH proteomes capture the mode of action of fungistatic azoles and statins. Moreover, we confirm 43 and identify 11 new plasma proteome biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, advancing patient classification and biomarker discovery. Thus, our results demonstrate a substantial acceleration and increased depth in fast proteomic experiments that facilitate proteomic drug screens and clinical studies."

https://openalex.org/W3139535723,"Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell-type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair."
https://openalex.org/W3136283807,"Heteroaromatics lured into cycloadditions The Diels-Alder reaction is widely used to produce six-membered carbon rings from alkenes and dienes. Heteroaromatics such as quinolines resemble dienes in principle, but in practice their pairs of double bonds are inert toward cycloadditions because of aromatic stabilization. Ma et al. report that by using an iridium photosensitizer, they could excite quinolines and related azaarenes to triplet states, thereby disrupting the aromaticity and enabling intermolecular, Diels-Alder–like reactivity toward alkenes (see the Perspective by Schmidt). The reactions proceeded exclusively at the flanking carbons outside the nitrogen-containing ring. Science , this issue p. 1338 ; see also p. 1313"
https://openalex.org/W3137813344,"Current serology tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies mainly take the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays or lateral flow assays, which are either laborious, expensive or lacking sufficient sensitivity and scalability. Here we present the development and validation of a rapid, low-cost, solution-based assay to detect antibodies in serum, plasma, whole blood and to a lesser extent saliva, using rationally designed split luciferase antibody biosensors. This new assay, which generates quantitative results in 30 min, substantially reduces the complexity and improves the scalability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody tests. This assay is well-suited for point-of-care, broad population testing, and applications in low-resource settings, for monitoring host humoral responses to vaccination or viral infection.

https://openalex.org/W3137846905,"Neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are among the most promising approaches against COVID-191,2. A bispecific IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) has been developed on the basis of C121 and C135, two antibodies derived from donors who had recovered from COVID-193. Here we show that CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable spike binding to the cellular receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonal antibodies. We also found that in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, the simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, and combines the advantages of antibody cocktails with those of single-molecule approaches."

Levin et al. sampled the feces of 184 wild animals, including fish, birds, and mammals, from four different continents to survey the diversity of gut bacteria (see the Perspective by Lind and Pollard). They discovered more than 1000 previously undescribed bacterial species and identified factors that correlate with the composition, diversity, and functional content of the microbiota. Supporting the association of specific bacteria with animal lifestyle, they identified proteases, some previously undescribed, from the gut of griffon vultures that can break down toxins that may be present in their carrion diet.

The cause of this wildlife disease has eluded scientists for decades while its occurrence has continued to spread throughout freshwater reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacuolar myelinopathy is induced by consumption of the epiphytic cyanobacterial species Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on aquatic vegetation, primarily the invasive Hydrilla verticillata Here, we describe the identification, biosynthetic gene cluster, and biological activity of aetokthonotoxin, a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid that is produced by the cyanobacterium A. hydrillicola We identify this cyanobacterial neurotoxin as the causal agent of vacuolar myelinopathy and discuss environmental factors-especially bromide availability-that promote toxin production."
https://openalex.org/W3139001736,"The pathways that lead to the development of tissue-resident lymphocytes, including liver type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s), remain unclear. We show here that the adult mouse liver contains Lin-Sca-1+Mac-1+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from the fetal liver. This population includes Lin-CD122+CD49a+ progenitors that can generate liver ILC1s but not conventional natural killer cells. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by the liver ILC1s themselves promotes the development of these cells in situ, through effects on their IFN-γR+ liver progenitors. Thus, an IFN-γ-dependent loop drives liver ILC1 development in situ, highlighting the contribution of extramedullary hematopoiesis to regional immune composition within the liver."
https://openalex.org/W3139160981,"Cells organize biochemical processes into biological condensates. P-bodies are cytoplasmic condensates that are enriched in enzymes important for mRNA degradation and have been identified as sites of both storage and decay. How these opposing outcomes can be achieved in condensates remains unresolved. mRNA decapping immediately precedes degradation, and the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping complex is enriched in P-bodies. Here, we show that Dcp1/Dcp2 activity is modulated in condensates and depends on the interactions promoting phase separation. We find that Dcp1/Dcp2 phase separation stabilizes an inactive conformation in Dcp2 to inhibit decapping. The activator Edc3 causes a conformational change in Dcp2 and rewires the protein–protein interactions to stimulate decapping in condensates. Disruption of the inactive conformation dysregulates decapping in condensates. Our results indicate that the regulation of enzymatic activity in condensates relies on a coupling across length scales ranging from microns to ångstroms. We propose that this regulatory mechanism may control the functional state of P-bodies and related phase-separated compartments. Alterations in the interactions driving phase separation of the mRNA decapping complex led to conformational rearrangements in its active site, providing a mechanism to control whether substrate mRNA is stored or decapped in condensates."

The capuchino seedeaters, a group of South American birds, include a number of species that, in the field, are often discernable only through male plumage and song. Turbek et al. used genomes and behavioral experiments to identify potential isolating factors in two members of this group and found that, though entirely sympatric, females mated only with conspecific males and that only a few genes differed between the species (see the Perspective by Jarvis). Thus, a small reshuffling of genes and reinforcement through mate choice has driven divergence in these overlapping and very similar species. Science , this issue p. eabc0256 ; see also p. 1312"

Finally, GWASs have identified associations of AKT3 with specific psychiatric-disorder-relevant intermediate phenotypes in the general population, including risk-taking behavior, educational attainment, and key aspects of cognitive ability (Karlsson Linnér et al., 2019Karlsson Linnér R.

Akt1–Akt3 activity fosters the inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 (TSC1/2), and TSC1/2 inhibition, in turn, facilitates Rheb small-GTPase-mediated activation of mTOR. It is through these mechanisms that Akt activity commonly culminates in the activation of mTOR. mTOR occurs in two distinct protein complexes referred to as mTORC1 and mTORC2, dictated in part by the interaction of mTOR with the Raptor (mTORC1) or Rictor (mTORC2) proteins (Dibble and Cantley, 2015Dibble C.C.

Notably, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation converts phospholipid PIP2 to PIP3, resulting in translocation of Akt1–Akt3 to the cellular membrane, where it can be phosphorylated at the T308 residue by PDK1 (Dibble and Cantley, 2015Dibble C.C.

The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Although T308 phosphorylation is sufficient to activate Akt1–Akt3, phosphorylation of the S473 residue further augments Akt kinase activity. Akt S473 phosphorylation is mediated not by PDK1 but rather by feedback phosphorylation from the mTORC2 (and not mTORC1) complex (Dibble and Cantley, 2015Dibble C.C. Cantley L.C.

Despite genomic associations of AKT with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, few to no studies have assessed possible alterations in the protein activity of the Akt-mTOR pathway in the bipolar disorder or schizophrenia forebrain. Knowledge of this is important given that although no single AKT variant is likely to contribute to the majority of cases, it is possible that alterations in the protein activity of the Akt pathway are prevalent within individual forebrain regions in bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia subjects. Further, only protein profiling studies can assess changes in Akt pathway activity, thus having a direct link to functional consequences. To this end, we assessed the activity of the Akt pathway in two prefrontal cortical regions in a large cohort of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unaffected control subjects. Our findings identify a reduction in Akt-mTOR prefrontal cortical signaling in bipolar disorder subjects without psychosis, and we demonstrate that this reduction is sufficient to contribute to key neural and behavioral hallmarks of bipolar disorder. First, we assessed PI3K and Akt activity levels in DLPFC homogenates (Brodmann area 46) from 35 schizophrenia, 32 bipolar disorder, and 35 control subjects from the Stanley Medical Research Institute via SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting (see Table S1 for cohort details). We performed separate male and female analyses for each condition, and bipolar disorder homogenates were divided into those with psychosis (BP-psychosis) and those without psychosis (BP-no psychosis). Protein phosphorylation levels in human homogenates were normalized to GAPDH, which did not itself differ between diagnostic groups. PI3K activity is increased by phosphorylation of the Y199 residue (Yu et al., 2009Yu Y. Anjum R. Kubota K. Rush J. Villen J. Gygi S.P. A site-specific, multiplexed kinase activity assay using stable-isotope dilution and high-resolution mass spectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 11606-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in male subjects, levels of phospho-PI3K Y199 (p-PI3K Y199) in BP-psychosis and schizophrenia did not differ from unaffected controls. However, p-PI3K Y199 levels were significantly decreased in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls and relative to male BP-psychosis, with no corresponding alterations in female subjects (Figures 1A–1C and S1A–S1C). We found nearly identical changes in levels of phospho-Akt T308 (p-Akt T308) (Figures 1D and S1A–S1C). Further, while direct comparisons revealed a decrease in p-Akt S473 in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls and male BP-psychosis, these differences did not survive multiple comparison corrections (Figures 1E and S1A–S1C). Finally, total levels of Akt did not differ between any groups (Figures 1F and S1A–S1C). Rheb activity resulting from upstream Akt-mediated inhibition of TSC1/2 results in the phosphorylation of the mTOR S1261 residue. Phosphorylation at this residue, in turn, fosters mTOR’s kinase activity to a variety of downstream effectors (Acosta-Jaquez et al., 2009Acosta-Jaquez H.A. Keller J.A. Foster K.G. Ekim B. Soliman G.A. Feener E.P. Ballif B.A. Fingar D.C. Site-specific mTOR phosphorylation promotes mTORC1-mediated signaling and cell growth.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4308-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We found that mTOR S1261 phosphorylation was decreased in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls. While direct comparison between male BP-no psychosis and male BP-psychosis revealed a significance difference, this effect was not maintained following multiple comparison correction. No changes between female diagnostic groups and controls were detected for p-mTOR S1261 levels (Figures 1G and S1A–S1C). mTOR activity is also commonly assessed by examining levels of phosphorylation at the S2448 residue (Hoeffer and Klann, 2010Hoeffer C.A. Klann E. mTOR signaling: at the crossroads of plasticity, memory and disease.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar; Rosner et al., 2010Rosner M.

Phosphorylation at this site occurs as a feedback loop from downstream mTOR kinase targets such that when activated by mTOR, these kinases augment phosphorylation at this S2448 site (Chiang and Abraham, 2005Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) at Ser-2448 is mediated by p70S6 kinase.J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26089-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We found a significant decrease in mTOR S2448 phosphorylation in male BP-no psychosis subjects relative to male controls and relative to male BP-psychosis, with no differences between male schizophrenia and male controls. Again, no analogous differences were detected in female BP-no psychosis subjects (Figures 1H and S1A–S1C). Finally, no differences in total mTOR levels survived multiple comparison correction between any groups among male or female subjects (Figures 1I and S1A–S1C). When activated, mTOR controls the activity of numerous kinases, including ULK1, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), via established phosphorylation sites (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR Signaling in Growth, Metabolism, and Disease.Cell. 2017; 169: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Starting first with ULK1, we assessed two phosphorylation sites, one of which is mediated by mTOR activation (S757) and one which is independent of mTOR (S777) (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Kundu M. Viollet B. Guan K.L. AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy through direct phosphorylation of Ulk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). We found a significant decrease in levels of ULK1 phosphorylated at the S757 site in male BP-no psychosis relative to male BP-psychosis. While direct comparison between male BP-no-psychosis and male controls revealed a significant deficit, this effect did not retain significance following multiple comparison corrections (Figures 2A–2C and S2A–S2C). No significant differences in phosphorylation at the S777 site survived multiple comparison, although direct comparison revealed a deficit in male BP-no psychosis relative to BP-psychosis (Figures 2D and S2A–S2C). No corresponding differences in either S757 or S777 phosphorylation were detected in female subjects (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A–S2C), and no differences in total ULK1 were detected in male or female diagnostic groups (Figures 2E and S2A–S2C). Next, we examined the phosphorylation status of the T421/S424 and T389 residues of p70S6K, which represent mTOR-independent (T421/S424) and mTOR-dependent (T389) means of facilitating p70S6K activation (Burnett et al., 1998Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. RAFT1 phosphorylation of the translational regulators p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The principal target of rapamycin-induced p70s6k inactivation is a novel phosphorylation site within a conserved hydrophobic domain.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we detected no differences in any diagnostic groups relative to controls for phosphorylation at the T421/S424 or T389 residues (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2A–S2C). Of note, we detected a significant reduction in total p70S6K in male BP-no psychosis relative to male control and male BP-psychosis; no such differences were detected in homogenates from female subjects (Figures 2H and S2A–S2C). We also examined the activity of 4E-BP1 by examining phosphorylation levels at the T37/T46 residues (Gingras et al., 1999Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation: a novel two-step mechanism.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and detected no differences between any groups or in total 4E-BP1 (Figures 2I, 2J, and S2A–S2C). In addition to the mTOR pathway, Akt activity regulates the function of multiple additional pathways, most notably GSK3. Akt inhibits GSK3α and GSK3β via direct phosphorylation of the S21 and S9 residues, respectively (Doble and Woodgett, 2003Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. GSK-3: tricks of the trade for a multi-tasking kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while we detected a slight yet significant decrease in the GSK3α and GSK3β phosphorylation in male BP-no psychosis relative to male BP-psychosis, no changes relative to male controls were detected (Figures S3A–S3G). These findings suggest that alterations in mTOR phosphorylation rather than GSK3 signaling are more closely associated with the deficient Akt signaling in male BP-no psychosis. To determine if the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is altered among these diagnostic groups in other prefrontal cortical regions, we also examined the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC; Brodmann area 45) in the same cohort of subjects. In VLPFC homogenate, we detected a significant decrease in p-PI3K Y199, p-Akt T308, and p-Akt S473 in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls, and these Akt phosphorylation alterations were also significantly reduced relative to male BP-psychosis (Figures 3A–3E and S4A–S4C). Interestingly, we also detected a slight, albeit significant, decrease in total Akt levels in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls (Figures 3F and S4A–S4C). For phospho-mTOR in the VLPFC, we detected a significant reduction in S2448 phosphorylation in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls, with no corresponding change in S1261 phosphorylation (Figures 3G, 3H, and S4A–S4C). Finally, no differences in total mTOR were detected in any other diagnostic groups (Figures 3I and S4A–S4C). In examining the activity level of downstream mTOR targets in VLPFC homogenates, no alterations in phospho- or total ULK1 between groups remained significant following multiple comparisons (Figures 4A–4E and S5A–S5C). Conversely, male BP-no psychosis VLPFC homogenates exhibited reductions in the phosphorylation status of the p70S6K T421/S424 and T389 residues relative to male controls and, in the case of T421/T424, also relative to male BP-no psychosis (Figures 4F, 4G, and S5A–S5C). Further, male BP-no psychosis also showed a reduction in total p70S6K relative to male controls (Figures 4H and S5A–S5C). Finally, pertaining to 4E-BP1, we detected a significant reduction in T37/T46 phosphorylation in male BP-no psychosis relative to male controls and male BP-psychosis (Figures 4I and S5A–S5C). No changes in in total 4E-BP1 were detected between bipolar disorder subjects and controls; however, we detected a significant total 4E-BP1 reduction in male schizophrenia subjects (Figures 4J and S5A–S5C). Finally, we found no differences that survived multiple comparisons between any diagnostic group and control subjects for GSK3α and GSK3β phosphorylation levels in the VLPFC (Figures S6A–S6G). Similar to our DLPFC findings, the lack of major alterations in GSK3 activity in the VLPFC further highlights the specificity of altered mTOR pathway activity as a key downstream consequence of aberrant Akt activity in male BP-no psychosis. The lack of differences in the phosphorylation status of Akt or mTOR in BP-psychosis and schizophrenia could potentially be due to the greatly increased lifetime intake of antipsychotic medication in these groups relative to subjects with BP-no psychosis (Table S1). However, DLPFC and VLPFC regression analysis failed to detect significant relationships between antipsychotic intake and Akt or mTOR phosphorylation status in schizophrenia or BP-psychosis (Table S2). This lack of relationship suggests that antipsychotic intake is not masking disease-related changes in Akt or mTOR phosphorylation in BP-psychosis or schizophrenia. Next, we wanted to determine if disrupti"

Influenza A virus (IAV) causes severe pulmonary pathology and is a recurrent threat to human health. Innate immune sensing of IAV triggers a complex chain of host responses. IAV has adapted to evade host defense mechanisms, and the host has coevolved to counteract these evasion strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the balance between host defense and viral immune evasion is poorly understood. Here, we show that the host protein DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X) is critical to orchestrate a multifaceted antiviral innate response during IAV infection, coordinating the activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, assembly of stress granules, and type I interferon (IFN) responses. DDX3X activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to WT IAV, which carries the immune evasive nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). However, in the absence of NS1, DDX3X promoted the formation of stress granules that facilitated efficient activation of type I IFN signaling. Moreover, induction of DDX3X-containing stress granules by external stimuli after IAV infection led to increased type I IFN signaling, suggesting that NS1 actively inhibits stress granule–mediated host responses and DDX3X-mediated NLRP3 activation counteracts this action. Furthermore, the loss of DDX3X expression in myeloid cells caused severe pulmonary pathogenesis and morbidity in IAV-infected mice. Together, our findings show that DDX3X orchestrates alternate modes of innate host defense which are critical to fight against NS1-mediated immune evasion strategies during IAV infection.

IAV infection is sensed by innate immune receptors that activate type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory responses (5Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S. Innate immunity to influenza virus infection.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). These responses are critical for controlling viral titers and spread in the lung and also to induce long-lasting adaptive immune responses (5Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S.

Inflammasome control of viral infection.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2015; 12: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Acute activation of innate immune responses against IAV facilitates the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells including neutrophils and monocytes, which further establish the inflammatory milieu to clear virus-infected and dead cells to subsequently initiate lung tissue repair responses (5Iwasaki A.

These observations indicate that robust but balanced activation of the innate immune response against IAV is crucial for host protective defense, whereas aggressive induction of these responses may compromise host lung function and ultimately lead to mortality. Thus, understanding the fundamental mechanisms orchestrating innate immune responses during IAV infection is critical to target IAV-induced pathogenesis and develop effective antiviral approaches. Type I IFNs are primarily induced by sensing of viral RNAs by innate immune receptors, including retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to exert host-induced antiviral activities (5Iwasaki A.

Host defense is also mediated by ribonucleoprotein aggregates called stress granules (SGs) during IAV infection, which are formed in the absence of the IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) (18Thulasi Raman S.N.

The antiviral activity of SGs is predominantly achieved through the restriction of translation or viral protein synthesis (19Khaperskyy D.A. Hatchette T.F. McCormick C.

Although type I IFNs, SGs, and the NLRP3 inflammasome are required for host defense responses during viral infections, the mechanisms regulating coordination of these responses to ultimately exert protection during IAV infection are not clear. IAV has also evolved to use immune evasion strategies to neutralize protective host defense mechanisms (11Garcia-Sastre A.

The NS1-mediated host immune evasion suppresses antiviral defense mechanisms, which enables efficient replication of IAV (11Garcia-Sastre A.

Innate immune evasion strategies of influenza viruses.Future Microbiol. 2010; 5: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). NS1 is also implicated in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting this protein has adapted to control a variety of innate immune activation mechanisms (25Nogales A. Martinez-Sobrido L. Topham D.J. DeDiego M.L. Modulation of innate immune responses by the influenza A NS1 and PA-X proteins.Viruses. 2018; 10: 708Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that the IAV-mediated immune evasion strategies might have exerted selective pressure on the host immune system during virus–host interactions. This counter adaptation of host defense mechanisms may help fight viral immune evasion. However, the complex relationship between antiviral activities and their functional regulation in the presence of IAV-mediated immune evasion are not clear. Here, we found a critical role for the host protein DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X) in regulating a complex network of host defense responses by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, formation of SGs, and type I IFNs during IAV infection. The IAV-induced SGs inhibited activation and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. DDX3X performed two mutually exclusive functions, driving IAV-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or inducing the formation of SGs, and this function was dependent on the presence of the immune-evasive NS1 protein. Lack of DDX3X expression led to severe pathology and IAV spread in the lung, compromising survival in infected mice. Thus, DDX3X is a central regulator of host defense responses against IAV infection and perhaps evolved to counteract IAV immune evasions strategies. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in limiting IAV infection-induced lung pathology in mice (14Thomas P.G. Dash P. Aldridge Jr., J.R. Ellebedy A.H. Reynolds C. Funk A.J. Martin W.J.

The IAV NS1 protein inhibits the type I IFN response to evade the host innate immune response and enable IAV replication and spread (22Hale B.G. Albrecht R.A. Garcia-Sastre A. Innate immune evasion strategies of influenza viruses.Future Microbiol. 2010; 5: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Nogales A. Martinez-Sobrido L. Topham D.J. DeDiego M.L. Modulation of innate immune responses by the influenza A NS1 and PA-X proteins.Viruses. 2018; 10: 708Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the absence of NS1, IAV infection leads to a stronger type I IFN response, but the NLRP3 inflammasome is not activated. The molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between these two host antiviral responses to counteract immune evasion by IAV remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we examined how IAV infection modulated the host innate immune response in the presence and absence of NS1. First, we infected primary bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT and Nlrp3−/− mice with IAV/A/WSN/33/H1N1 (called IAV henceforth) and its NS1 deletion mutant (called IAV–ΔNS1 henceforth) (26Zheng M. Wang P. Song W. Lau S.Y. Liu S. Huang X. Mok B.W. Liu Y.C. Chen Y. Yuen K.Y. Chen H. An A14U substitution in the 3' noncoding region of the M segment of viral RNA supports replication of influenza virus with an NS1 deletion by modulating alternative splicing of M segment mRNAs.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 10273-10285Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for NS1 protein confirmed the lack of NS1 in IAV–ΔNS1–infected BMDMs, and levels of viral nucleoprotein (NP) indicated a reduced replication or infection rate after IAV–ΔNS1 infection compared with WT IAV infection (Fig. 1A). The reduced replication rate of IAV–ΔNS1 is in line with observations from the study describing the generation of the IAV–ΔNS1 strain, which also reported a reduced replication rate (26Zheng M. Wang P. Song W. Lau S.Y. Liu S. Huang X. Mok B.W. Liu Y.C. Chen Y. Yuen K.Y. Chen H. An A14U substitution in the 3' noncoding region of the M segment of viral RNA supports replication of influenza virus with an NS1 deletion by modulating alternative splicing of M segment mRNAs.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 10273-10285Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We then assessed the effect of the ΔNS1 mutation on immune activation. IAV infection in BMDMs induced cleavage of caspase-1 (CASP1), which is a measure of IAV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This cleavage was observed in WT BMDMs but not in Nlrp3−/− BMDMs, suggesting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically (Fig. 1A). IAV–ΔNS1 infection, however, did not lead to CASP1 activation in WT BMDMs, suggesting that the lack of NS1 protein in IAV abolished activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. 1A). Release of NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, was also significantly reduced in IAV–ΔNS1–infected WT BMDMs compared with IAV-infected cells (Fig. 1B). This further indicates that the deletion of NS1 results in a loss of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in BMDMs. The protein expression levels of inflammasome components (NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [ASC]) were comparable in BMDMs infected with IAV and IAV–ΔNS1, suggesting that reduced NLRP3 activation in IAV–ΔNS1–infected BMDMs was not due to defects in priming of the inflammasome (Fig. 1C). To further investigate the role of priming in the reduced NLRP3 activation in response to IAV–ΔNS1, we infected BMDMs with IAV–ΔNS1 and then stimulated the BMDMs with TLR ligands (Pam3Csk4 or poly(I:C)) or IFN-β. None of these stimulations rescued NLRP3 inflammasome activation in IAV–ΔNS1–infected cells (Fig. S1A), which further suggests that inhibition of NLRP3 activation by IAV–ΔNS1 was not due to defects in the priming of inflammasome activation. Finally, we used IAV infection as the priming signal followed by ATP or nigericin treatment for NLRP3 inflammasome activation to test the effect of NS1 loss (Fig. S1, B and C). We observed decreased CASP1 cleavage in IAV–ΔNS1–infected BMDMs, suggesting that loss of NS1 was inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome even with canonical triggers. In addition, the IAV NS1 protein is a robust type I IFN antagonist (22Hale B.G. Albrecht R.A. Garcia-Sastre A. Innate immune evasion strategies of influenza viruses.Future Microbiol. 2010; 5: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IAV–ΔNS1 infection in BMDMs induced elevated IFN-β secretion compared with that induced by IAV, further confirming the role of NS1 in restricting type I IFN responses (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the expression of NS1 promotes both IAV replication and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inhibits the type I IFN response. SGs are membraneless cytoplasmic aggregates of RNA–protein complexes which arrest translation and also carry out other cellular functions during stress conditions (20Tsai W.C. Lloyd R.E. Cytoplasmic RNA granules and viral infection.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Protter D.S.W. Parker R. Principles and properties of stress granules.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 668-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). SGs play an important role in virus–host interactions by driving antiviral responses or promoting viral replication in some cases (20Tsai W.C. Lloyd R.E.

Antiviral innate immunity and stress granule responses.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). IAV infection efficiently inhibits formation of SGs via its NS1 protein to promote translation of viral mRNAs (19Khaperskyy D.A. Hatchette T.F. McCormick C. Influenza A virus inhibits cytoplasmic stress granule formation.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Tsai W.C. Lloyd R.E.

McCormick C. Influenza a virus host shutoff disables antiviral stress-induced translation arrest.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10e1004217Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Specifically, the IAV NS1 protein inhibits dsRNA binding by protein kinase R and further phosphorylation of eIF2α (P-eIF2α), which are essential for SG assembly (20Tsai W.C. Lloyd R.E. Cytoplasmic RNA granules and viral infection.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We observed increased amounts of P-eIF2α and robust induction of SGs in BMDMs infected with IAV–ΔNS1 compared with WT IAV infection (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, the dramatic increase in NP expression observed with WT IAV from 6 to 9 h after infection was much less notable with IAV–ΔNS1, suggesting that in addition to the replication defect of this virus, SGs were also exerting antiviral effects (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which is a measure of its activation by type I IFN signaling, was also increased in BMDMs infected with IAV–ΔNS1 compared with WT IAV, suggesting NS1 plays a role in restricting both SGs and type I IFN responses (Fig. 1C). However, in spite of high IFN-β levels, there was reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cells infected with IAV–ΔNS1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Previous studies have reported both inhibition and promotion of NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated by type I IFN signaling (5Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S.

MDVs are involved in mitochondrial quality control and their formation is enhanced with stress and may, therefore, play a potential role in mitochondrial-cellular communication. However, MDV proteomic cargo has remained mostly undefined. In this study, we strategically used an in vitro MDV budding/reconstitution assay on cardiac mitochondria, followed by graded oxidative stress, to identify and characterize the MDV proteome. Our results confirmed previously identified cardiac MDV markers, while also revealing a complete map of the MDV proteome, paving the way to a better understanding of the role of MDVs. The oxidative stress vulnerability of proteins directed the cargo loading of MDVs, which was enhanced by antimycin A (Ant-A). Among OXPHOS complexes, complexes III and V were found to be Ant-A-sensitive. Proteins from metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, along with Fe-S cluster, antioxidant response proteins, and autophagy were also found to be Ant-A sensitive. Intriguingly, proteins containing hyper-reactive cysteine residues, metabolic redox switches, including professional redox enzymes and those that mediate iron metabolism, were found to be components of MDV cargo with Ant-A sensitivity. Last, we revealed a possible contribution of MDVs to the formation of extracellular vesicles, which may indicate mitochondrial stress. In conclusion, our study provides an MDV proteomics signature that delineates MDV cargo selectivity and hints at the potential for MDVs and their novel protein cargo to serve as vital biomarkers during mitochondrial stress and related pathologies."

These immune responses mediate replication arrest of SIV in 50 to 60% of monkeys. We show that the peptide VMAPRTLLL (VL9) embedded within the RhCMV protein Rh67 promotes intracellular MHC-E transport and recognition of RhCMV-infected fibroblasts by MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells. Deletion or mutation of viral VL9 abrogated MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell priming, resulting in CD8+ T cell responses exclusively targeting MHC-II-restricted epitopes. These responses were comparable in magnitude and differentiation to responses elicited by 68-1 vectors but did not protect against SIV. Thus, Rh67-enabled direct priming of MHC-E-restricted T cells is crucial for RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3137023767,"In many biological applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an integrated analysis of data from multiple batches or studies is necessary. Current methods typically achieve integration using shared cell types or covariance correlation between datasets, which can distort biological signals. Here we introduce an algorithm that uses the gene eigenvectors from a reference dataset to establish a global frame for integration. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that this approach, called Reference Principal Component Integration (RPCI), consistently outperforms other methods by multiple metrics, with clear advantages in preserving genuine cross-sample gene expression differences in matching cell types, such as those present in cells at distinct developmental stages or in perturbated versus control studies. Moreover, RPCI maintains this robust performance when multiple datasets are integrated. Finally, we applied RPCI to scRNA-seq data for mouse gut endoderm development and revealed temporal emergence of genetic programs helping establish the anterior–posterior axis in visceral endoderm. Integration of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets is improved by creating a common reference space using a new algorithm."

The precise role for the WRC in immunity has not been established, although recent work has implicated WRC components such as HEM1 in certain human immunodeficiencies. Liu et al. characterized mice with a conditional knockout of the WRC constituent WAVE2 (see the Perspective by Hambleton). These mice exhibited progressive severe autoimmune and inflammatory disease associated with the activation and accelerated differentiation of T cells. WAVE2's suppression of T cell activation was not mediated by the T cell receptor but rather by its inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) binding to RAPTOR and RICTOR. Accordingly, the autoimmune phenotype of these mice could be ameliorated by pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR signaling. Science , this issue p. eaaz4544 ; see also p. 1309"

https://openalex.org/W3139432092,"Regulation of the heat- and capsaicin-activated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel by phosphoinositides is complex and controversial. In the most recent TRPV1 cryo-EM structure, endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) was detected in the vanilloid binding site, and phosphoinositides were proposed to act as competitive vanilloid antagonists. This model is difficult to reconcile with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] being a well-established positive regulator of TRPV1. Here we show that in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in excised patches, PtdIns, but not PtdIns(4)P, partially inhibited TRPV1 activity at low, but not at high capsaicin concentrations. This is consistent with PtdIns acting as a competitive vanilloid antagonist. However, in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns partially stimulated TRPV1 activity. We computationally identified residues, which are in contact with PtdIns, but not with capsaicin in the vanilloid binding site. The I703A mutant of TRPV1 showed increased sensitivity to capsaicin, as expected when removing the effect of an endogenous competitive antagonist. I703A was not inhibited by PtdIns in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2, but it was still activated by PtdIns in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 indicating that inhibition, but not activation by PtdIns proceeds via the vanilloid binding site. In molecular dynamics simulations, PtdIns was more stable than PtdIns(4,5)P2 in this inhibitory site, whereas PtdIns(4,5)P2 was more stable than PtdIns in a previously identified, nonoverlapping, putative activating binding site. Our data indicate that phosphoinositides regulate channel activity via functionally distinct binding sites, which may explain some of the complexities of the effects of these lipids on TRPV1."

Endothelial cells are the cornerstone of the generation of new lymphatic vessels. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is the most abundant one of NADPH oxidases in endothelial cells and the most studied one in relevance with cancer. Our purpose is to analyze the relationship between Nox4 and lymphangiogenesis and find out whether the newborn lymphatic vessels lead to cancer metastasis. We first explored the expression of Nox4 in lymphatic endothelial cells of primary invasive breast tumors and human normal mammary glands using GEO databases and found that Nox4 was upregulated in primary invasive breast tumors samples. In addition, its high expression correlated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients. Nox4 could increase the tube formation and lymphatic vessel sprouting in a three-dimensional setting. In vivo, inhibition of Nox4 in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice could significantly decrease the tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Nox4 may increase tumor lymphangiogenesis via ROS/ERK/CCL21 pathway and attract CCR7-positive breast cancer cells to entry lymphatic vessels and distant organs. In conclusion, our results show that Nox4 is a factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis and is a potential target of antitumor metastasis."

We sought to investigate the general public's views to inform policy and practice in the UK.We performed two anonymous online surveys of members of the UK public, sampled to be representative for key demographic characteristics (n = 509). Participants were given a scenario of a hypothetical terminally ill patient with one week of life left. We sought views on the acceptability of providing titrated analgesia, gradual sedation, terminal anaesthesia, and euthanasia. We asked participants about the intentions of doctors, what risks of sedation would be acceptable, and the equivalence of terminal anaesthesia and euthanasia.Of the 509 total participants, 84% and 72% indicated that it is permissible to offer titrated analgesia and gradual sedation (respectively); 75% believed it is ethical to offer TA. Eighty-eight percent of participants indicated that they would like to have the option of TA available in their EOLC (compared with 79% for euthanasia); 64% indicated that they would potentially wish for TA at the end of life (52% for euthanasia). Two-thirds indicated that doctors should be allowed to make a dying patient completely unconscious. More than 50% of participants believed that TA and euthanasia were non-equivalent; a third believed they were.These novel findings demonstrate substantial support from the UK general public for the use of sedation and TA in EOLC. More discussion is needed about the range of options that should be offered for dying patients."

https://openalex.org/W3118322458,"The accurate retrieval of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins during endocytosis is essential for the maintenance of neurotransmission. Synaptophysin (Syp) and synaptobrevin-II (SybII) are the most abundant proteins on SVs. Neurons lacking Syp display defects in the activity-dependent retrieval of SybII and a general slowing of SV endocytosis. To determine the role of the cytoplasmic C terminus of Syp in the control of these two events, we performed molecular replacement studies in primary cultures of Syp knockout neurons using genetically encoded reporters of SV cargo trafficking at physiological temperatures. Under these conditions, we discovered, 1) no slowing in SV endocytosis in Syp knockout neurons, and 2) a continued defect in SybII retrieval in knockout neurons expressing a form of Syp lacking its C terminus. Sequential truncations of the Syp C-terminus revealed a cryptic interaction site for the SNARE motif of SybII that was concealed in the full-length form. This suggests that a conformational change within the Syp C terminus is key to permitting SybII binding and thus its accurate retrieval. Furthermore, this study reveals that the sole presynaptic role of Syp is the control of SybII retrieval, since no defect in SV endocytosis kinetics was observed at physiological temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3136176876,"Previous literature has indicated that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A (CDKN2A) is upregulated, while the Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 (PIAS1) is downregulated in the liver tissues of obese mice. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between CDKN2A and PIAS1 in the lipogenesis of fatty liver disease. In the C57BL/6J db/db mouse model and hepatocyte model of fatty liver, the expression pattern of CDKN2A, PIAS1, Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) was characterized by RNA quantitative and Western blot analysis. The lipogenesis-related genes (Srebp1c and Fas) in the liver tissues and cells were employed in the assessment of lipogenesis in response to gain- or loss-of-function of CDKN2A, PIAS1, PRMT1, and CFLAR, while triglyceride and fat content were evaluated in relation to fat accumulation. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, while the ubiquitination of CFLAR and SUMOylation of PIAS1 was examined by immunoprecipitation. PIAS1 and CFLAR were downregulated, while CDKN2A, PRMT1, and phosphorylation of JNK was elevated in the tissues and cells of the fatty liver models. Our results suggested that CDKN2A enhanced the SUMOylation of PIAS1 to reduce the expression of PIAS1. PRMT1 downregulated CFLAR by triggering its ubiquitination, while CFLAR repressed phosphorylation of JNK. The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that CDKN2A silencing prevented lipogenesis and fat accumulation by impairing the PRMT1-dependent ubiquitination of CFLAR and blocking the phosphorylation of JNK. Taken together, the central observations of our study demonstrate that targeting CDKN2A contributes to the suppression of lipogenesis and fat accumulation in fatty liver disease. The findings of our study highlight the potential of CDKN2A as a promising target against fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W3137645651,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a fundamental signaling pathway that regulates cell fate decisions in response to external stimuli. Several scaffold proteins bind directly to kinase components of this pathway and regulate their activation by growth factors. One of the best studied MAPK scaffolds is kinase suppressor of Ras1 (KSR1), which is induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to translocate to the plasma membrane where it activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). While Ca2+ has been shown to modulate MAPK signaling, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ alters MAPK activity at least in part via KSR1. Using several approaches, including fusion proteins, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a cell-permeable chemical inhibitor, we investigated the functional interaction between KSR1 and calmodulin. In vitro analysis with pure proteins reveals that calmodulin binds directly to KSR1. Moreover, endogenous calmodulin and KSR1 co-immunoprecipitate from mammalian cell lysates. Importantly, Ca2+ is required for the association between calmodulin and KSR1, both in vitro and in cells. The cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B significantly reduced activation of ERK by EGF in mouse embryo fibroblasts that overexpress KSR1, but not in control cells. Moreover, CGS9343B impaired the ability of EGF to induce KSR1 translocation to the plasma membrane and to stimulate formation of KSR1-ERK and KSR1-pERK (phosphorylated ERK) complexes in cells. Collectively, our data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the scaffold protein KSR1 couples Ca2+ and calmodulin signaling to the MAPK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2980955005,"Air-conditioning systems make the most significant part of energy consumption in the residential sector. There is no denying that it is essential to produce a comfortable indoor thermal environment for residents in a building. The actual goal is to achieve thermal comfort level without putting too much cost on the ecological system by trying to conserve the amount of energy consumed. An effective way to help achieve such a goal is by incorporating thermal insulation in buildings. Thermal insulations help reduce thermal energy gained during the implementation of a desired thermal comfort level. This study aims to use an environmentally friendly nanoparticle of date pits to create thermal insulations that can be used in buildings. Different ratios of the nanoparticle of the date pits and sand composite were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the new materials. The material with nanoparticles of date pits and 50% by-volume epoxy provided good thermal insulation with thermal conductivity of 0.26 W⁄mK that could be used in the existing buildings. This has the potential to reduce the overall energy consumption by 4,494 kWh and thereby reduce CO 2 emissions of a 570 m 2 house by 1.8 tons annually. In conclusion, the future of using nanoparticles of date pits in construction is bright and promising due to their promising results."
https://openalex.org/W3135914851,"Eph receptors are the largest group amongst the receptor tyrosine kinases and are divided into two subgroups, A and B, based on ligand binding specificities and sequence conservation. Through ligand-induced and ligand-independent activities, Ephs play central roles in diverse biological processes, including embryo development, regulation of neuronal signaling, immune responses, vasculogenesis, as well as tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. The Eph extracellular regions (ECDs) are constituted of multiple domains, and previous structural studies of the A class receptors revealed how they interact with ephrin ligands and simultaneously mediate Eph-Eph clustering necessary for biological activity. Specifically, EphA structures highlighted a model, where clustering of ligand-bound receptors relies on two distinct receptor/receptor interfaces. Interestingly, most unliganded A class receptors also form an additional, third interface, between the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the fibronectin III domain (FN3) of neighboring molecules. Structures of B-class Eph ECDs, on the other hand, have never been reported. To further our understanding of Eph receptor function, we crystallized the EphB6-ECD and determined its three-dimensional structure using X-ray crystallography. EphB6 has important functions in both normal physiology and human malignancies and is especially interesting because this atypical receptor innately lacks kinase activity and our understanding of the mechanism of action is still incomplete. Our structural data reveals the overall EphB6-ECD architecture and shows EphB6-LBD/FN3 interactions similar to those observed for the unliganded A class receptors, suggesting that these unusual interactions are of general importance to the Eph group. We also observe unique structural features, which likely reflect the atypical signaling properties of EphB6, namely the need of co-receptor(s) for this kinase-inactive Eph. These findings provide new valuable information on the structural organization and mechanism of action of the B-class Ephs, and specifically EphB6, which in the future will assist in identifying clinically relevant targets for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3138656478,"With an estimated 440,000 active cases occurring each year, medical device associated infections pose a significant burden on the US healthcare system, costing about $9.8 billion in 2013. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of these device-associated infections, which typically involve isolates that are multi-drug resistant and possess multiple virulence factors. S . epidermidis is also frequently a benign contaminant of otherwise sterile blood cultures. Therefore, tests that distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic isolates would improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prevent overuse/misuse of antibiotics. Attempts to use multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) with machine learning for this purpose had poor accuracy (~73%). In this study we sought to improve the diagnostic accuracy of predicting pathogenicity by focusing on phenotypic markers ( i . e ., antibiotic resistance, growth fitness in human plasma, and biofilm forming capacity) and the presence of specific virulence genes ( i . e ., mecA , ses1 , and sdrF ). Commensal isolates from healthy individuals (n = 23), blood culture contaminants (n = 21), and pathogenic isolates considered true bacteremia (n = 54) were used. Multiple machine learning approaches were applied to characterize strains as pathogenic vs non-pathogenic. The combination of phenotypic markers and virulence genes improved the diagnostic accuracy to 82.4% (sensitivity: 84.9% and specificity: 80.9%). Oxacillin resistance was the most important variable followed by growth rate in plasma. This work shows promise for the addition of phenotypic testing in clinical diagnostic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3137250111,"In eukaryotes, various alternative translation initiation mechanisms have been unveiled for the translation of specific mRNAs. Some do not conform to the conventional scanning-initiation model. Translation initiation of histone H4 mRNA combines both canonical (cap-dependent) and viral initiation strategies (no-scanning, internal recruitment of initiation factors). Specific H4 mRNA structures tether the translation machinery directly onto the initiation codon and allow massive production of histone H4 during the S phase of the cell cycle. The human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), composed of 13 subunits (a-m), was shown to selectively recruit and control the expression of several cellular mRNAs.

This is the case for viruses that have developed simplified systems to improve translation efficiency, allowing also hijacking of the host translation machinery for their own mRNA.

H4 mRNA contains specific RNA structures that tether the translation machinery directly on the AUG initiation codon. A double stem-loop structure called eIF4E-sensitive element (4E-SE) binds eIF4E without the need of the cap, and a three-way junction (TWJ) sequesters the m7G cap and facilitates direct 80S ribosomes positioning to the cognate AUG start codon (17Martin F.

Due to the presence of several RNA-binding domains, eIF3 offers multiple opportunities of interactions with its targets. Here we report that eIF3 binds to a stem-loop structure located in the coding region of H4 mRNA downstream of the 4E-SE. Combining cross-linking and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RNP IP) in vivo and in vitro, we found that eIF3 interacts with H4 and also with H1, H2A, H2B, and H3 histone mRNAs. We demonstrate a direct interaction of H4 mRNA with eIF3c, d, e and g subunits and suggest the existence of different interaction patterns for the different histone mRNAs. After having inactivated eIF3 in vivo by siRNA interference in G1/S synchronized cells, we selectively monitored histone neosynthesis by [35S] pulse labeling. These experiments reveal that eIF3 could act as a modulator of histones translation particularly in metabolic conditions where eIF3 comes to be limiting. It was previously established that human translation initiation factor eIF3 can target mRNAs in a transcript-specific manner and can function as an activator or repressor of translation (19Lee A.S.Y.

Kranzusch P.J. Doudna J.A. Cate J.H.D. eIF3d is an mRNA cap-binding protein that is required for specialized translation initiation.Nature. 2016; 536: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Pulos-Holmes M.C. Srole D.N. Juarez M.G. Lee A.S.-Y. McSwiggen D.T. Ingolia N.T. Cate J.H. Repression of ferritin light chain translation by human eIF3.Elife. 2019; 8e48193Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The majority of the mRNAs identified contain a single eIF3-binding site predominantly located within 5’UTR RNA structural elements (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). By PAR-CLIP a 25 nt H4 mRNA sequence was identified among eIF3 mRNA targets interacting with eIF3 (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). By contrast, this sequence is located in the coding region of H4 mRNA between nucleotides 294 and 319 (Fig. 1A) in a region adjacent to previously characterized structural elements, namely the TWJ and the 4E-SE (17Martin F. Barends S. Jaeger S. Schaeffer L. Prongidi-Fix L. Eriani G. Cap-assisted internal initiation of translation of histone H4.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We determined the secondary structure of H4 mRNA around the potential eIF3-binding site using chemical probing and selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) (Fig. 1B). Chemical probing and SHAPE revealed that the potential eIF3-binding site maps to the 3’ strand of a 70 nt long stem-loop structure named hereafter eIF3-binding site (eIF3-BS). The primer extension pattern revealed the presence of a large central bulge encompassing nts (261–269 and 299–306) in addition to the two small bulges (ΔG = −28.6 kcal/mol at 37 °C, from nts 250 to 320 (28Zuker M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar)). Fourteen nts of the sequence identified by PAR-CLIP (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were found in the double-stranded part of the motif (Fig. 1B) in agreement with an interaction of eIF3 occurring in the context of an RNA secondary structure. To evaluate the importance of eIF3-BS, RNA-electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using purified full-length H4 mRNA (H4 FL) and three truncated radiolabeled H4 RNA fragments (H4 1–137, H4 137–241, and H4 241–375) generated by in vitro transcription. H4 1 to 137 contains the TWJ, H4 137 to 241 the 4E-SE, and H4 241 to 375 contains the eIF3-BS. Prior to complex formation RNAs were heat denaturated and refolded to promote formation of secondary and tertiary structures. Purified eIF3 complex directly interacted with H4 FL with an estimated Kd of 4 μM. eIF3 moderately interacted with H4 241 to 375 (eIF3-BS) but also with H4 1 to 137 (TWJ) and shifted 39% and 28% of the RNAs respectively at high concentrations of eIF3 (Fig. 1C). In the same conditions only a weak 14% band shift was observed for H4 137 to 241 (Fig. 1C). No retarded complex was obtained in the presence of BSA, used as a negative control. The major eIF3-binding site therefore seems to reside in the eIF3-BS fragment but weaker eIF3 binding can also occur in the H4 1 to 137 fragment, which includes the TWJ. Optimal eIF3 binding therefore seems to require the full-length mRNA. Altogether these results confirm that eIF3 interacts in vitro with the histone H4 mRNA and that the PAR-CLIP defined sequence belongs to the eIF3-BS stem-loop structure. To determine if eIF3 is capable of interacting with all histone mRNAs, we immunoprecipitated eIF3-RNA complexes from HEK293FT cells. Formaldehyde cross-linking was used to stabilize transient interactions and minimize RNP complexes rearrangements (29Hayek H. Gross L. Schaeffer L. Alghoul F. Martin F. Eriani G. Allmang C. Immunoprecipitation methods to isolate messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNP).in: Vega C. Advanced Technologies for Protein Complex Production and Characterization, Advances in Experimental Medecine and Biology. Vol. 2. Springer, Switzerland2020Google Scholar). The full endogenous eIF3 complex thus stabilized was immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against the eIF3b subunit (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Jivotovskaya A.V. Valášek L. Hinnebusch A.G. Nielsen K.H. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and eIF2 can promote mRNA binding to 40S subunits independently of eIF4G in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1355-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Western blotting revealed that 11 of the 13 eIF3 subunits (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l) were specifically co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2A). No interaction was detected for GAPDH used as a negative control. The RNAs associated with eIF3 were determined by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B). The c-JUN mRNA is a target of eIF3 in PAR-CLIP experiments and was used as positive control (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The housekeeping, nonhistone mRNAs GAPDH, HPRT, PGK1, ACTB, and LDHA undergo canonical cap-dependent translation (20Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Doudna J.A. Cate J.H.D. eIF3d is an mRNA cap-binding protein that is required for specialized translation initiation.Nature. 2016; 536: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The spliceosomal U2 snRNA was used as a negative control. On average 5% of the housekeeping mRNAs were retained in the anti-eIF3b immunoprecipitation, whereas only 0.2% of U2 snRNA was detected, reflecting the general role of eIF3 in mRNA translation. The relative mRNA enrichment in the eIF3b IP was normalized against that obtained for LDHA mRNA. As expected c-JUN mRNA was co-immunoprecipitated by eIF3 and enriched 4.5 times in the IP compared with LDHA, whereas this is not the case for GAPDH, HPRT, PGK1, and ACTB control mRNAs; this is in accordance with previous results (19Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that all histone mRNAs are significantly enriched in the anti-eIF3b immunoprecipitation. The binding of histone H4 mRNA is the highest with sixfold while histones H1, H2A, H2B, and H3 are enriched between 1.7- and 3-fold (Fig. 2B). On average these results are similar to those observed for c-JUN and confirm that histone mRNAs are prime targets of eIF3. Different modes of interaction between the eIF3 complex and its RNA targets have been established. RNA-binding domains have been identified in the eIF3a, b, and g subunits (31Sun C. Todorovic A.

A. 2011; 108: 20473-20478Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) while eIF3d is capable to bind the cap of several mRNAs by a dedicated cap-binding domain (20Lee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Doudna J.A. Cate J.H.D. eIF3d is an mRNA cap-binding protein that is required for specialized translation initiation.Nature. 2016; 536: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Only the eIF3a, b, and c subunits bind IRES elements (1Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 32Cai Q. Todorovic A. Andaya A. Gao J. Leary J.A. Cate J.H.D.

Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell proliferation mRNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In order to precisely identify the subunits of the eIF3 complex in direct interaction with the H4 mRNA, we performed UV cross-linking experiments using a uniformly radiolabeled ThioU-H4 mRNA transcript in the presence of purified eIF3 complex (Fig. 3). After RNase A digestion, only radioactive mRNA fragments protected against degradation because of their interaction with eIF3 remained cross-linked to eIF3 subunits. Separation of the cross-linked products by denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed radiolabeling of at least four different eIF3 subunits with apparent molecular weights of 110, 65, 50, and 45 kDa (Fig. 3A). Several eIF3 subunits share similar molecular weight. This is the case for the subunits eIF3a, b, and c (110 kDa), eIF3d and l (65 kDa) as well as eIF3e, f, and g (45 kDa). To identify the radiolabeled eIF3 subunits, cross-linked products were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-gel) (Fig. 3B) followed by western blot analysis using antibodies directed against 11 of the 13 eIF3 subunits (Fig. 3, C and D). Our results show cross-linking signals between the subunits eIF3c, d, e, and g (Fig. 3C) and H4 mRNA for which radioactivity and western blot signals overlay. eIF3 subunits undergo numerous posttranslational modifications (34Damoc E. Fraser C.S. Zhou M. Videler H. Mayeur G.L. Hershey J.W.B. Doudna J.A. Robinson C.V. Leary J.A. Structural characterization of the human eukaryotic initiation factor 3 protein complex by mass spectrometry.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1135-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), this is reflected by the dotted migration profile on the 2D-gel, each dot corresponding to the different levels of modifications, and thus isoelectric charge of the protein (Fig. 3, C–E). The migration profile of the proteins is partially shifted upon cross-linking and spreads over a wide range of pH due to the presence of the additional charges coming from the cross-linked RNA moiety (Fig. 3E). By contrast, the western blot signals of the eIF3 subunits b, f, h, i, k do not overlap with the radioactivity signals, showing that they do not interact with H4 mRNA (Fig. 3D). The four subunits eIF3c, d, e, and g that we have identified in interaction with H4 mRNA play important roles in the formation and positioning of the eIF3 complex in the 80S ribosome. eIF3c and e subunits belong to the structural core of eIF3. Only eIF3g has an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (35ElAntak L. Tzakos A.G. Locker N. Lukavsky P.J.

https://openalex.org/W3139415192,"Osteoporosis is the most common age-related metabolic bone disorder, which is characterized by low bone mass and deterioration in bone architecture, with a propensity to fragility fractures. The best treatment for osteoporosis relies on stimulation of osteoblasts to form new bone and restore bone structure, however, anabolic therapeutics are few and their use is time restricted. Here, we report that Syndecan-3 increases new bone formation through enhancement of WNT signaling in osteoblasts. Young adult Sdc3-/- mice have low bone volume, reduced bone formation, increased bone marrow adipose tissue, increased bone fragility, and a blunted anabolic bone formation response to mechanical loading. This premature osteoporosis-like phenotype of Sdc3-/- mice is due to delayed osteoblast maturation and impaired osteoblast function, with contributing increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Indeed, overexpressing Sdc3 in osteoblasts using the Col1a1 promoter rescues the low bone volume phenotype of the Sdc3-/- mice, and also increases bone volume in WT mice. Mechanistically, SDC3 enhances canonical WNT signaling in osteoblasts through stabilization of Frizzled 1, making SDC3 an attractive target for novel bone anabolic drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3136089706,"Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies are approved for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, only 15% of CRC patients respond to EGFR inhibition. Here, we show that colorectal cancers (CRC) can initiate and grow faster through an EGFR-independent mechanism, irrespective of the presence of EGFR, in two different mouse models using tissue-specific ablation of Egfr. The growth benefit in the absence of EGFR is also independent of Kras status. An EGFR-independent gene expression signature, also observed in human CRCs, revealed that anergy-inducing genes are overexpressed in EGFR-independent polyps, suggesting increased infiltration of anergic lymphocytes promotes an accelerated growth rate that is partially caused by escape from cell-mediated immune responses. Many genes in the EGFR-independent gene expression signature are downstream targets of interleukin 10 receptor alpha (IL10RA). We further show that IL10 is detectable in serum from mice with EGFR-independent colon polyps. Using organoids in vitro and Src ablation in vivo, we show that IL10 contributes to growth of EGFR-independent CRCs, potentially mediated by the well-documented role of SRC in IL10 signaling. Based on these data, we show that the combination of an EGFR inhibitor with an anti-IL10 neutralizing antibody results in decreased cell proliferation in organoids and in decreased polyp size in pre-clinical models harboring EGFR-independent CRCs, providing a new therapeutic intervention for CRCs resistant to EGFR inhibitor therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3138405452,"Precise assessment of the impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on ecosystem structure and functions is paramount for implementing appropriate management and restoration strategies. Here we investigated the impacts of Leucanthemum vulgare (ox-eye daisy), an aggressive invader in Kashmir Himalaya, on species diversity and primary productivity. We also evaluated bunch of strategies for the ecological restoration of the habitats invaded by this species. We found that uninvaded plots harbored on an average of 6.11 (±2.92) more species per 1m 2 of quadrat than invaded plots. At multivariate scale, the ordination (nMDS) and ANOSIM exhibited significant differences between invaded and uninvaded plots with R = 0.7889 and p &lt; 0.001. The decrease in diversity indices in invaded as compared to uninvaded plots was associated with more productive plant communities due to Leucanthemum invasion. Higher altitude Gulmarg site was more affected by Leucanthemum invasion than lower altitude Drung site. We tested different approaches for restoration and management of invaded habitats that include herbicide treatment at seedling stage, herbicide treatment before and after flowering stage, mowing and herbicide treatment together, joint mowing, digging and herbicide treatment and Leucanthemum uprooting. Among these treatments, uprooting and combined digging, mowing and herbicide treatment proved to be most effective in controlling Leucanthemum invasion. The implications of these results for effective management of ecologically sensitive and socio-culturally important landscapes are discussed."
