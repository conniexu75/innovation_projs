https://openalex.org/W2796301411,"Substantial evidence indicates that the brain uses principles of non-linear dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations. In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing."
https://openalex.org/W2897403793,"The discovery of the highly efficient site-specific nuclease system CRISPR–Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes has galvanized the field of gene therapy1,2. The immunogenicity of Cas9 nuclease has been demonstrated in mice3,4. Preexisting immunity against therapeutic gene vectors or their cargo can decrease the efficacy of a potentially curative treatment and may pose significant safety issues3–6. S. pyogenes is a common cause for infectious diseases in humans, but it remains unclear whether it induces a T cell memory against the Cas9 nuclease7,8. Here, we show the presence of a preexisting ubiquitous effector T cell response directed toward the most widely used Cas9 homolog from S. pyogenes (SpCas9) within healthy humans. We characterize SpCas9-reactive T cells within the CD4/CD8 compartments for multi-effector potency, cytotoxicity, and lineage determination. In-depth analysis of SpCas9-reactive T cells reveals a high frequency of SpCas9-reactive regulatory T cells that can mitigate SpCas9-reactive effector T cell proliferation and function in vitro. Our results shed light on T cell–mediated immunity toward CRISPR-associated nucleases and offer a possible solution to overcome the problem of preexisting immunity. T cells that react to SpCas9 are observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy humans. These findings may have implications for CRISPR–Cas9 therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2950958620,"Mendelian randomization, a method to infer causal relationships, is confounded by genetic correlations reflecting shared etiology. We developed a model in which a latent causal variable mediates the genetic correlation; trait 1 is partially genetically causal for trait 2 if it is strongly genetically correlated with the latent causal variable, quantified using the genetic causality proportion. We fit this model using mixed fourth moments [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] of marginal effect sizes for each trait; if trait 1 is causal for trait 2, then SNPs affecting trait 1 (large [Formula: see text]) will have correlated effects on trait 2 (large α1α2), but not vice versa. In simulations, our method avoided false positives due to genetic correlations, unlike Mendelian randomization. Across 52 traits (average n = 331,000), we identified 30 causal relationships with high genetic causality proportion estimates. Novel findings included a causal effect of low-density lipoprotein on bone mineral density, consistent with clinical trials of statins in osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2898716605,"The surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition with deep learning approach plays an increasingly important role in human-computer interaction. Existing deep learning architectures are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which captures spatial information of electromyogram signal. Motivated by the sequential nature of electromyogram signal, we propose an attention-based hybrid CNN and RNN (CNN-RNN) architecture to better capture temporal properties of electromyogram signal for gesture recognition problem. Moreover, we present a new sEMG image representation method based on a traditional feature vector which enables deep learning architectures to extract implicit correlations between different channels for sparse multi-channel electromyogram signal. Extensive experiments on five sEMG benchmark databases show that the proposed method outperforms all reported state-of-the-art methods on both sparse multi-channel and high-density sEMG databases. To compare with the existing works, we set the window length to 200ms for NinaProDB1 and NinaProDB2, and 150ms for BioPatRec sub-database, CapgMyo sub-database, and csl-hdemg databases. The recognition accuracies of the aforementioned benchmark databases are 87.0%, 82.2%, 94.1%, 99.7% and 94.5%, which are 9.2%, 3.5%, 1.2%, 0.2% and 5.2% higher than the state-of-the-art performance, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2897970825,"The promoters of mammalian genes are commonly regulated by multiple distal enhancers, which physically interact within discrete chromatin domains. How such domains form and how the regulatory elements within them interact in single cells is not understood. To address this we developed Tri-C, a new chromosome conformation capture (3C) approach, to characterize concurrent chromatin interactions at individual alleles. Analysis by Tri-C identifies heterogeneous patterns of single-allele interactions between CTCF boundary elements, indicating that the formation of chromatin domains likely results from a dynamic process. Within these domains, we observe specific higher-order structures that involve simultaneous interactions between multiple enhancers and promoters. Such regulatory hubs provide a structural basis for understanding how multiple cis-regulatory elements act together to establish robust regulation of gene expression."

Neonatal gut microbiomes are colonized with maternal and environmental flora and mature toward a stable composition over 2-3 years3,4. To study pre- and postnatal determinants of infant microbiome development, we analyzed 402 fecal metagenomes from 60 infants aged 0-8 months, using longitudinal generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Distinct microbiome signatures correlated with breastfeeding, formula ingredients, and maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). Amino acid synthesis pathway accretion in breastfed microbiomes complemented normative breastmilk composition. Prebiotic oligosaccharides, designed to promote breastfed-like microflora5, predicted functional pathways distinct from breastfed infant microbiomes. Soy formula in six infants was positively associated with Lachnospiraceae and pathways suggesting a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-rich environment, including glycerol to 1-butanol fermentation, which is potentially dysbiotic. GWG correlated with altered carbohydrate degradation and enriched vitamin synthesis pathways. Maternal and postnatal antibiotics predicted microbiome alterations, while delivery route had no persistent effects. Domestic water source correlates suggest water may be an underappreciated determinant of microbiome acquisition. Clinically important microbial pathways with statistically significant dietary correlates included dysbiotic markers6,7, core enterotype features8, and synthesis pathways for enteroprotective9 and immunomodulatory10,11 metabolites, epigenetic mediators1, and developmentally critical vitamins12, warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2896535333,"Tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins accumulate along neuronal circuits in Alzheimer’s disease. Unraveling the genetic background for the regional vulnerability of these proteinopathies can help in understanding the mechanisms of pathology progression. To that end, we developed a novel graph theory approach and used it to investigate the intersection of longitudinal Aβ and tau positron emission tomography imaging of healthy adult individuals and the genetic transcriptome of the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We identified distinctive pathways for tau and Aβ accumulation, of which the tau pathways correlated with cognitive levels. We found that tau propagation and Aβ propagation patterns were associated with a common genetic profile related to lipid metabolism, in which APOE played a central role, whereas the tau-specific genetic profile was classified as ‘axon related’ and the Aβ profile as ‘dendrite related’. This study reveals distinct genetic profiles that may confer vulnerability to tau and Aβ in vivo propagation in the human brain. Cross-sectional and longitudinal PET imaging of amyloid beta and tau in the human brain is combined with gene expression profiles to define the interactions between Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology propagation and brain-region-specific vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2898278445,"Chemical probes of epigenetic 'readers' of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have become powerful tools for mechanistic and functional studies of their target proteins in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. Here we report the development of the first class of chemical probes of YEATS domains, newly identified 'readers' of histone lysine acetylation (Kac) and crotonylation (Kcr). Guided by the structural analysis of a YEATS-Kcr complex, we developed a series of peptide-based inhibitors of YEATS domains by targeting a unique π-π-π stacking interaction at the proteins' Kcr recognition site. Further structure optimization resulted in the selective inhibitors preferentially binding to individual YEATS-containing proteins including AF9 and ENL with submicromolar affinities. We demonstrate that one of the ENL YEATS-selective inhibitors, XL-13m, engages with endogenous ENL, perturbs the recruitment of ENL onto chromatin, and synergizes the BET and DOT1L inhibition-induced downregulation of oncogenes in MLL-rearranged acute leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2897683294,"Vesicular acidification and trafficking are associated with various cellular processes. However, their pathologic relevance to cancer remains elusive. We identified transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) as a vesicular acidification regulator. TMEM9 is highly upregulated in colorectal cancer. Proteomic and biochemical analyses show that TMEM9 binds to and facilitates assembly of vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase), a vacuolar proton pump, resulting in enhanced vesicular acidification and trafficking. TMEM9-v-ATPase hyperactivates Wnt/β-catenin signalling via lysosomal degradation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Moreover, TMEM9 transactivated by β-catenin functions as a positive feedback regulator of Wnt signalling in colorectal cancer. Genetic ablation of TMEM9 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo mouse models. Moreover, administration of v-ATPase inhibitors suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis of APC mouse models and human patient-derived xenografts. Our results reveal the unexpected roles of TMEM9-controlled vesicular acidification in hyperactivating Wnt/β-catenin signalling through APC degradation, and propose the blockade of TMEM9-v-ATPase as a viable option for colorectal cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2899428416,"House mice, like many tetrapods, produce multielement calls consisting of individual vocalizations repeated in rhythmic series. In this study, we examine the multielement ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male C57Bl/6J mice and specifically assess their temporal properties and organization. We found that male mice produce two classes of USVs which display unique temporal features and arise from discrete respiratory patterns. We also observed that nearly all USVs were produced in repetitive series exhibiting a hierarchical organization and a stereotyped rhythmic structure. Furthermore, series rhythmicity alone was determined to be sufficient for the mathematical discrimination of USVs produced by adult males, adult females, and pups, underscoring the known importance of call timing in USV perception. Finally, the gross spectrotemporal features of male USVs were found to develop continuously from birth and stabilize by P50, suggesting that USV production in infants and adults relies on common biological mechanisms. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the temporal organization of multielement mouse USVs is both stable and informative, and we propose that call timing be explicitly assessed when examining mouse USV production. Furthermore, this is the first report of putative USV classes arising from distinct articulatory patterns in mice, and is the first to empirically define multielement USV series and provide a detailed description of their temporal structure and development. This study therefore represents an important point of reference for the analysis of mouse USVs, a commonly used metric of social behavior in mouse models of human disease, and furthers the understanding of vocalization production in an accessible mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2898979213,"Osteoporosis can result from the loss of sex hormones and/or aging. Abaloparatide (ABL), an analog of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP(1–36)), is the second osteoanabolic therapy approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration after teriparatide (PTH(1–34)). All three peptides bind PTH/PTHrP receptor type 1 (PTHR1), but the effects of PTHrP(1–36) or ABL in the osteoblast remain unclear. We show that, in primary calvarial osteoblasts, PTH(1–34) promotes a more robust cAMP response than PTHrP(1–36) and ABL and causes a greater activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB). All three peptides similarly inhibited sclerostin (Sost). Interestingly, the three peptides differentially modulated two other PKA target genes, c-Fos and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl), and the latter both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) 2 and 3 and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3), indicated that all three are part of the pathway that regulates osteoblastic Rankl expression. We also show that the peptides differentially regulate the nuclear localization of CRTC2 and CRTC3, and that this correlates with PKA activation. Moreover, inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/PP2A) activity revealed that they play a major role in both PTH-induced Rankl expression and the effects of PTH(1–34) on CRTC3 localization. In summary, in the osteoblast, the effects of PTH(1–34), PTHrP(1–36), and ABL on Rankl are mediated by differential stimulation of cAMP/PKA signaling and by their downstream effects on SIK2 and -3, PP1/PP2A, and CRTC3."
https://openalex.org/W2897657971,"Cells must cope with toxic or reactive intermediates formed during metabolism. One coping strategy is to sequester reactions that produce such intermediates within specialized compartments or tunnels connecting different active sites. Here, we show that propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS), an ∼ 400-kDa homodimer, three-domain fusion protein and the key enzyme of the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for CO2 fixation, sequesters its reactive intermediate acrylyl-CoA. Structural analysis showed that PCS forms a multicatalytic reaction chamber. Kinetic analysis suggested that access to the reaction chamber and catalysis are synchronized by interdomain communication. The reaction chamber of PCS features three active sites and has a volume of only 33 nm3. As one of the smallest multireaction chambers described in biology, PCS may inspire the engineering of a new class of dynamically regulated nanoreactors. Structural and biochemical analysis of propionyl-CoA synthase reveals that it forms a reaction chamber containing three active sites, which sequesters the reactive intermediate acrylyl-CoA during the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2899284947,"Objective Although there are substantial data linking thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) and infertility, data regarding assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes and TAI markers in follicular fluid (FF) of women undergoing ART are scarce. Objective of the study was to assess the association of the levels of thyroid autoantibodies in FF and ART outcome expressed as the achieved pregnancies. Methods This study enrolled 52 women undergoing ART (26 TAI positive subjects and 26 age and body mass index matched TAI negative controls). Blood samples were drawn before the initiation of protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation, and thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) levels were measured. TSH, fT4, TPOAbs, TgAbs and progesterone levels were also measured in FF. Results There were no significant differences between the groups regarding mean levels of FF TSH and FF fT4. Statistically significant correlation was discovered regarding the levels of serum and FF TPOAbs (0,961, p<0.001 in TAI positive, 0,438, p = 0.025 in TAI negative group) and TgAbs (0,945, p<0.001 in TAI positive, 0,554, p = 0.003 in TAI negative group). Pregnancies rates per initiated cycle and per embryotransfer cycle were significantly different between TAI positive and TAI negative group, (30.8% vs 61.5%), p = 0.026 and (34.8% vs 66.7%), p = 0.029, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that TAI positive women had less chance to achieve pregnancy (p = 0.004, OR = 0.036, 95% CI 0.004–0.347). Conclusions Higher levels of thyroid autoantibodies in FF of TAI positive women are strongly correlated with serum levels and may have effect on the post-implantation embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W2899455321,"Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) reverse ubiquitination and regulate virtually all cellular processes. Defined noncatalytic domains in USP4 and USP15 are known to interact with E3 ligases and substrate recruitment factors. No such interactions have been reported for these domains in the paralog USP11, a key regulator of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. We hypothesized that USP11 domains adjacent to its protease domain harbor unique peptide-binding sites. Here, using a next-generation phage display (NGPD) strategy, combining phage display library screening with next-generation sequencing, we discovered unique USP11-interacting peptide motifs. Isothermal titration calorimetry disclosed that the highest affinity peptides (KD of ∼10 μm) exhibit exclusive selectivity for USP11 over USP4 and USP15 in vitro Furthermore, a crystal structure of a USP11-peptide complex revealed a previously unknown binding site in USP11's noncatalytic ubiquitin-like (UBL) region. This site interacted with a helical motif and is absent in USP4 and USP15. Reporter assays using USP11-WT versus a binding pocket-deficient double mutant disclosed that this binding site modulates USP11's function in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. The highest affinity USP11 peptide binder fused to a cellular delivery sequence induced significant nuclear localization and cell cycle arrest in S phase, affecting the viability of different mammalian cell lines. The USP11 peptide ligands and the paralog-specific functional site in USP11 identified here provide a framework for the development of new biochemical tools and therapeutic agents. We propose that an NGPD-based strategy for identifying interacting peptides may be applied also to other cellular targets."
https://openalex.org/W2898761572,"Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a member of the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes that catalyze mono-oxygenase reactions. Although constitutive Cyp1b1 expression is limited in hepatocytes, its expression and function in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) remains unknown. Here we determined the impact of Cyp1b1 expression on LSEC properties prepared from Cyp1b1+/+ and Cyp1b1-/- mice. LSEC expressed PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and B4 lectin similar to EC from other mouse tissues. Cyp1b1 +/+ LSEC constitutively expressed significant levels of Cyp1b1, while Cyp1b1-/- LSEC lacked Cyp1b1 expression. LSEC also expressed VEGFR3, PROX-1, and LYVE-1, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as other cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) receptors, CD36 and CD47. However, the expression of PV-1 and stabilin (fenestration markers), and endoglin were limited in these cells. The Cyp1b1-/- LSEC showed limited fenestration, and decreased levels of VEGF and BMP6. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC also showed a decrease in the levels of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 impacting adherens and gap junction formation. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC were significantly more apoptotic, proliferated at a faster rate, and were less adherent and more migratory. These changes were attributed, in part, to decreased amounts of TSP1 and increased AKT and ERK activation. The expressions of integrins were also altered by the lack of Cyp1b1, but the ability of these cells to undergo capillary morphogenesis was minimally affected. Furthermore, Cyp1b1-/- LSEC expressed lower levels of inflammatory mediators MCP-1 and TNF-α. Thus, Cyp1b1 expression has a significant impact on LSEC angiogenic and inflammatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W2898944808,"Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into linker-oligonucleosome assemblies, providing compaction of genomic DNA and contributing to gene regulation and genome integrity. To define minimal requirements for initial steps in the transition of compact, closed chromatin to a transcriptionally active, open state, we developed a model in vitro system containing a single, unique, nucleosome in the center of a 25-nucleosome array and evaluated the accessibility of the linker DNA adjacent to this target nucleosome. We found that condensation of H1-lacking chromatin results in ∼60-fold reduction in linker DNA accessibility and that mimics of acetylation within all four core histone tail domains of the target nucleosome synergize to increase accessibility ∼3-fold. Notably, stoichiometric binding of histone H1 caused >2 orders of magnitude reduction in accessibility that was marginally diminished by histone acetylation mimics. Remarkably, a nucleosome-free region (NFR) in place of the target nucleosome completely abrogated H1-dependent restriction of linker accessibility in the immediate vicinity of the NFR. Our results suggest that linker DNA is as inaccessible as DNA within the nucleosome core in fully condensed, H1-containing chromatin. They further imply that an unrecognized function of NFRs in gene promoter regions is to locally abrogate the severe restriction of linker DNA accessibility imposed by H1s."
https://openalex.org/W2899016263,"The trend towards faster acquisition protocols in whole-body positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) arises the question of whether short PET data acquisition protocols in a whole-body multi-station context allow for reduced PET acquisition times while providing adequate PET image quality and accurate quantification parameters. The study goal is to investigate how reducing PET acquisition times affects PET image quality and quantification in whole-body PET/MR in patients with oncologic findings.Fifty-one patients with different oncologic findings underwent a clinical whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MR examination. PET data was reconstructed with 4, 3, 2, and 1 min/bed time intervals for each patient to simulate the effect of reduced PET acquisition times. The 4-minute PET reconstructions served as reference standard. All whole-body PET data sets were analyzed regarding image quality, lesion detectability, PET quantification and standardized uptake values.A total of 91 lesions were detected in the 4-minute PET reconstructions. The same number of congruent lesions was also noticed in the 3 and 2 minutes-per-bed (mpb) reconstructed images. A total of 2 lesions in 2 patients was not detected in the 1 minute PET data reconstructions due to poor image quality. Image noise in the blood pool increased from 22.2% (4 mpb) to 42.1% (1 mpb). Signal-to-noise ratio declined with shorter timeframes from 13.1 (4 mpb) to 9.3 (1 mpb). SUVmean and SUVmax showed no significant changes between 4 and 1 mpb reconstructed timeframes.Reconstruction of PET data with different time intervals has shown that 2 minutes acquisition time per bed position instead of 4 minutes is sufficient to provide accurate lesion detection and adequate image quality in a clinical setting, despite the trends to lower image quality with shorter PET acquisition times. This provides latitude for potential reduction of PET acquisition times in fast PET/MR whole-body examinations."
https://openalex.org/W2899026776,"RNASeq or double-stranded RNA based approaches allowed the reconstruction of a total of 9 full-length or near full-length genomes of the recently discovered grapevine virus T (GVT). In addition, datamining of publicly available grapevine RNASeq transcriptome data allowed the reconstruction of a further 14 GVT genomes from five grapevine sources. Together with four GVT sequences available in Genbank, these novel sequences were used to analyse GVT diversity. GVT shows a very limited amount of indels variation but a high level of nucleotide and aminoacid polymorphism. This level is comparable to that shown in the closely related grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV). Further analyses showed that GVT mostly evolves under conservative selection pressure and that recombination has contributed to its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analyses allow to identify at least seven clearly separated groups of GVT isolates. Analysis of the only reported PCR GVT-specific detection primer pair indicates that it is likely to fail to amplify some GVT isolates. Taken together these results point at the distinctiveness of GVT but also at the many points it shares with GRSPaV. They constitute the first pan-genomic analysis of the diversity of this novel virus."

https://openalex.org/W2899094417,"Lysophospholipid transporter (LplT) is a member of the major facilitator superfamily present in many Gram-negative bacteria. LplT catalyzes flipping of lysophospholipids (LPLs) across the bacterial inner membrane, playing an important role in bacterial membrane homeostasis. We previously reported that LplT promotes both uptake of exogenous LPLs and intramembranous LPL flipping across the bilayer. To gain mechanistic insight into this dual LPL-flipping activity, here we implemented a combination of computational approaches and LPL transport analyses to study LPL binding of and translocation by LplT. Our results suggest that LplT translocates LPLs through an elongated cavity exhibiting an extremely asymmetric polarity. We found that two D(E)N motifs form a head group–binding site, in which the carboxylate group of Asp-30 is important for LPL head group recognition. Substitutions of residues in the head group–binding site disrupted both LPL uptake and flipping activities. However, alteration of hydrophobic residues on the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains impaired LPL flipping specifically, resulting in LPLs accumulation in the membrane, but LPL uptake remained active. These results suggest a dual substrate-accessing mechanism, in which LplT recruits LPLs to its substrate-binding site via two routes, either from its extracellular entry or through a membrane-embedded groove between transmembrane helices, and then moves them toward the inner membrane leaflet.

https://openalex.org/W2899168734,"Endurance exercise is associated with a transient increase in neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Here we investigate the impact of intensified endurance exercise on the neutrophil compartment. We hypothesized that intensified endurance exercise leads to mobilization of neutrophil subsets, which are normally absent in the blood. Furthermore, we followed the potential build-up of neutrophil activation and the impact on overnight recovery of the neutrophil compartment during a seven-day cycling tour. The neutrophil compartment was studied in 28 healthy amateur cyclists participating in an eight-day strenuous cycling tour. Blood samples were taken at baseline, after 4 days and after 7 days of cycling. The neutrophil compartment was analyzed in terms of numbers and its phenotype by deep phenotyping of flow cytometry data with the multi-dimensional analysis method FLOOD. Repeated endurance exercise led to a gradual increase in total neutrophil counts over the days leading to a 1.26 fold-increase (95%CI 1.01–1.51 p = 0.0431) in the morning of day 8. Flow cytometric measurements revealed the appearance of 2 additional neutrophil subsets: CD16brightCD62Ldim and CD16dimCD62Lbright. A complex change in neutrophil phenotypes was present characterized by decreased expression of both CD11b and CD62L and marked increased expression of LAIR-1, VLA-4 and CBRM1/5. The changes in expression were found on all neutrophils present in the blood. Strikingly, in strong contrast to our findings during acute inflammation evoked by LPS challenge, these neutrophils did not upregulate classical degranulation markers. In fact, our FLOOD analysis revealed that the exercise induced neutrophil phenotype did not overlap with the neutrophil subsets arising upon acute inflammation. In conclusion, during multiple days of endurance exercise the neutrophil compartment does not regain homeostasis overnight. Thereby our study supports the concept of a build-up of inflammatory cues during repeated endurance exercise training, causing a prolonged change of the systemic neutrophil compartment."

To determine how caste differences in the honey bee occur during metamorphosis, a number of comparative analyses between castes were performed including comprehensive quantification of: levels of dopamine and its metabolite in the brain, the gene expression levels of enzymes involved in dopamine biosynthesis and conversion as well as expression levels of dopamine receptors and a dopamine transporter. Dopamine levels standardized to the protein contents of a whole brain at the day of eclosion in queens were 3.6-fold higher than those in workers. Dopamine levels increased until eclosion (7 days) in queens, whereas those in workers increased until 5–6 days before eclosion and then maintained until eclosion (10 days). These caste-specific dopamine dynamics in the brain were supported by the higher expression of genes (Amddc and Amth) encoding enzymes involved in dopamine synthesis in queens. The distribution of cells expressing Amddc in the brain revealed that soma clusters of dopaminergic cells were similar between castes at 7–8 days after pupation, suggesting the upregulation of Amddc expression in some cells in queens rather than addition of cell clusters. In contrast, genes encoding dopamine receptors were downregulated in queens or showed similar expression levels between castes. The expression of genes encoding dopamine transporters did not differ between castes. These results reveal the developmental process of caste-specific dopaminergic systems during metamorphosis in the honey bee, suggesting caste-specific behavior and division of reproduction in this highly eusocial species."
https://openalex.org/W2899015401,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and CD44 have been established as biomarkers for predicting the survival of many types of cancer patients. This study evaluated the expression and clinical significance of these putative cancer-cell markers in a series of tumor samples from endometrial cancer (EC) patients using tissue microarray. We examined 245 endometrial samples, including 132 (53.87%) pre-malignancy lesions and 113 (46.12%) malignant endometrial lesions from biopsies or hysterectomies. We examined the expression of CD44 and ALDH1 in these samples using immunohistochemistry staining. Correlations in the relative expression of these markers with clinicopathological parameters were also assessed. A high level of expression of ALDH1 was found in 44.25% (50/113) of the endometrial cancer samples, which was significantly correlated with a poor overall survival rate (p = 0.035). High-level CD44 expression was found in 35.4% (40/113) of the cases and was also correlated with a poor overall survival rate (p = 0.035). A simultaneous high expression of both markers was correlated with an extremely poor overall survival (p = 0.013). Our results show that tumors with higher expressions of both ALDH1 and CD44 were related to a poorer overall survival rate among EC patients. The combination of ALDH1 and CD44 could be a promising marker for developing additional targeted therapy for severe endometrial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2899258890,"The consumption of soybeans is known to have beneficial effects on osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, the effects of soybean fermentation on the bioavailability and the antiosteoporotic effect have not yet been elucidated. To address this question, we fed ovariectomized C57BL/6J mice with a 5% nonfermented raw soybean (RS)- or fermented soybean (FS)-supplemented diet. After 18 wk of treatment, microcomputed tomography showed that FSs significantly increased bone mineral density compared with RSs. This was because of the up-regulation of bone morphogenic protein 2 (Bmp2) and its downstream target osteopontin in bone tissues. We analyzed isoflavone metabolite profiles in the sera of RS- or FS-fed mice and observed that the levels of 19 isoflavone metabolites were significantly increased in the sera of FS-fed mice. Among these metabolites, we observed that both dihydrodaidzein (DHD) and 6-hydroxydaidzein (6-HD) increased osteogenesis via Bmp2 signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells and reduced receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand–induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells through the inhibition of NF-κB activation and MAPK phosphorylation. These data suggest that improved bioavailability of FSs resulted from the production of active metabolites such as DHD and 6-HD after consumption. DHD and 6-HD can be used as potential therapeutics for the amelioration of osteoporotic bone loss.—Kim, J.-S., Lee, H., Nirmala, F. S., Jung, C. H., Kim, M. J., Jang, Y.-J., Ha, T. Y., Ahn, J.

https://openalex.org/W2898905745,"Our aim is to describe variations in the incidence rates of glomerular disease diagnosed by renal biopsies performed in Uruguay over the last 25 years in relation to sex, age, clinical presentation and histological diagnosis. We analyzed all renal biopsies performed in Uruguay during the 25 years period and estimated incidence rates per million people per year (pmp/yr) for the population older than 14 years. Mann Kendall's trend analysis was used to assess incidence trends. In order to identify changes in trends, we compared annual incidence rates with the Joinpoint method. From 1990 to 2014, 3390 biopsies of native kidneys corresponding to glomerular disease were performed in patients older than 14 years. The average biopsy rate was 58 per pmp/yr. The glomerular disease incidence rate increased progressively over the period (p<0.05). Trends analysis over five-year periods demonstrated a progressive increase of IgA nephropathy (3.08 pmp/yr 1990–1994 to 12.53 pmp/yr 2010–2014 p<0.05), membranous nephropathy (2.38 pmp/yr 1990–1994 to 8.04 pmp/yr 2010–2014 p< 0.05) and lupus nephritis (4,23 pmp/yr 1990–1994 to 7,81 pmp/yr 2010–2014 p<0.05). There was a change in the trend of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) which increased until 1996 and decreased afterwards. The incidence rates of glomerular disease have doubled globally in the last quarter of a century in Uruguay, mainly related to the increase of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis. There was a change in the slope of the incidence rate of FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W2898721719,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide veterinary and public health concern, and well recognized infectious disease of horses. Seroprevalence rates vary with geography, but many studies have confirmed a high exposure rate. The correlation between seropositivity and shedding status has not been made in horses, however. The aims of this study were to use semi-nested PCR on urine from apparently healthy horses to determine period prevalence of leptospiral shedding and to correlate these findings with MAT results to establish associations with client based survey data regarding horse management and environment. Serum and free-catch urine were collected from 204 healthy horses between May 2016-December 2017. Serum was used to determine GGT, creatinine concentrations, and six serovar MAT. Urine samples were submitted for PCR testing of leptospiral 23S rRNA. Client consent and survey data were collected for all subjects. Potential risk factors included drinking water source, exposure to livestock and dogs, geographical location, season, and precipitation. Two horses were positive on urine PCR for leptospirosis (shedding prevalence 1%), yet only one had a high reciprocal MAT titer of ≥ 800. Both horses were negative on urine PCR one month later without treatment. Approximately 77% of horses (157/204) were seroreactive (MAT reciprocal titer ≥ 100) with titers to serogroup Australis detected more frequently than others (47.5%; (97/204)). Apparently healthy horses infrequently shed Leptospira spp. in urine, yet seroreactivity in clinically normal horses is high (77%), confirming high exposure rates to Leptospira spp. in the Central Midwest."
https://openalex.org/W2898886401,"This two-year study evaluates the effects of new management strategies directed at helping the recovery of Adriatic cuttlefish populations. The ability of three specially developed artificial spawning devices-seagrass collectors (SC; deployed on artificial reefs), longline collectors (LC; deployed at mussel farms), and trap collectors (TC; delivered to 19 professional and 54 recreational trap fishermen together with a dedicated logbook)-to attract egg deposition was tested. All devices were provided with a polyethylene floating rope 8 mm in diameter that served as a collector for egg deposition. Total rope length was 1,440 m in SC (2,880 segments of 0.5 m), 250 m in LC (500 segments of 0.5 m), and 250 m in TC (10 m per trap). Although the sites where SC and LC were deployed were sheltered from the action of destructive fishing gears, heavy winter storms destroyed the SC after a year. Most recreational fishermen and none of the professional fishermen provided detailed information on percent egg coverage on their collectors. The collectors attached to the three devices proved highly suitable for cuttlefish spawning, collecting more than 500,000 eggs on 2,440 m of rope. The analysis of egg diameter distribution suggested three laying events during the spawning season. The logbook data showed that egg number peaked in June. The present approach, combining habitat reconstruction and participatory research, has the potential to contribute to the recovery of cuttlefish stocks in the framework of a broader management plan."
https://openalex.org/W2899026183,"Information on disease process and pathogenicity mechanisms is important for understanding plant disease. Spring black stem and leaf spot caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis Malbr. & Roum causes large losses to alfalfa. However, till now, little is known about alfalfa-P. medicagnis interactions and the pathogenicity mechanisms of the pathogen. Here, alfalfa inoculated with P. medicaginis was subjected to GC-MS based metabolic profiling. The metabolic response in P. medicaginis-inoculated and mock-inoculated alfalfa leaves was assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26 and 28 days post inoculation. In total, 101 peaks were detected in the control and inoculated groups, from which 70 metabolites were tentatively identified. Using multivariate analysis, 16 significantly regulated compounds, including amino acids, nitrogen-containing compounds and organic acids, polyols, fatty acids, and sugars were tentatively identified (Variable importance values, VIP>1.0 and p <0.05). Among these metabolites, the levels of malate, 5-oxoproline, palmitic acid and stearic acid were increased significantly in P. medicaginis-infected alfalfa leaves compared to the controls. In contrast, the levels ofγ-aminobutyric acid and 2-pyrrolidinone were significantly decreased in infected leaves compared to the controls. Further metabolic pathway analysis of the 16 significantly regulated compounds demonstrated that glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and β-oxidation of fatty acids were significantly induced in the alfalfa leaves at later stages of P. medicaginis infection. The strong induction of tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways at later infection stages caused by the pathogen may induce senescence in the alfalfa leaves, leading to plant death. However, intermediate metabolites of these metabolic pathways, and inositol phosphate, glutathione, the metabolic pathways of some amino acids accumulated rapidly and strongly at early stages of infection, which may enhance the ability of alfalfa to resist necrotrophic P. medicaginis disease. Understanding metabolic pathways is essential for understanding pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2899338815,"Leishmaniases are a group of infectious diseases transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, and their distribution depends on the presence of vectors, parasites, reservoirs and susceptible hosts in the same environment. In the last decades, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has become urbanized and reached economically important cities in countries within the transmission zone. Our study was conducted in one of those cities-Ipatinga-in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, where the first autochthonous case of VL dates back to 2011. Since no data regarding the epidemiological triad of VL (etiological agent/vector/domestic reservoir) were available for this city, we characterized the local entomological fauna, identified the presence of specific Leishmania DNA in the captured phlebotomine sand flies, and assessed the incidence of canine and human VL. For the entomological survey, we set twenty light traps in ten districts of the city with reports of human and canine VL. The insect captures were performed monthly, during one year, starting in March 2015. A total of 1501 specimens of phlebotomine sand flies belonging to 16 distinct species were captured, with predominance (61.9%) of Lutzomyia longipalpis. Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in L. longipalpis and in Evandromyia cortelezzii test samples. A total of 9,136 dogs were examined, 1,355 of which (14.8%) were serologically positive for VL. The cases were georeferenced and the data were plotted in thematic maps, along with human cases of VL registered by the local Department of Health, during the study period. Our results confirm that the VL transmission cycle is active in Ipatinga, with the presence of vectors carrying Leishmania DNA, canine and human cases of the disease. Spatial analysis allowed for the observation of a positive relationship between canine and human cases of VL and the identification of areas with high priority for control actions in the city. The mapping of high-risk areas, together with an epidemiological study in urban areas, is fundamental to improve the efficacy of the Program for Surveillance and Control of VL (PSCVL) in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2898623168,"Rumination is the repeated process of regurgitation of a food bolus, followed by chewing, swallowing, and regurgitation, which enhance nutrient assimilation. Time spent in lateral recumbency (i.e., bedded, lying) has often been used as a proxy for time spent ruminating due to difficulties of observing detailed rumination behavior in the field. The actual proportion of time spent ruminating, or other activities, will in turn be affected by the age and sex of an individual but also with changes in food quality. We studied the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on time spent ruminating, bedding, proportion of bedding time spent ruminating, and grazing of individually marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Our results show that bighorn sheep spent more time ruminating and less time grazing in summer and autumn. Overall, females spent less time ruminating, and more time grazing than males. Bighorn sheep decreased their time spent ruminating with increasing acid detergent fiber (ADF) content in the forage. Age influenced the time spent grazing, bedded and proportion of bedded time spent ruminating. Older sheep not only increased their bedding time but also their time spent bedded without ruminating compared to younger individuals. The proportion of time spent grazing was also affected by age, with a decrease in the proportion of time spent grazing with increasing age. Our results suggest that these four behaviors are plastic and variable. We thus conclude that bedding time does not reflect time spent ruminating but that the latter is affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2898934323,"Introduced wasps (Vespula germanica and V. vulgaris) are costly invertebrate pests in New Zealand, with large impacts on the local ecology and economy. Wasps eat honeybees (Apis mellifera), which has potentially devastating effects on hive health, as well as agricultural and horticultural industries. Vespex bait, which contains fipronil in a proteinaceous carrier, has recently been introduced for wasp control. In over a decade of reported trials, honeybees have never been observed foraging on Vespex, likely because the bait contains no sugars to serve as a bee food source. However, the potential for the control agent fipronil to enter beehives has not been tested. Therefore, here, we investigated this using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry assay of fipronil and two of its environmental breakdown and metabolic derivatives, fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil sulfone. We did not detect fipronil in any of the worker bee, bee larva, honey or pollen samples (n = 120 per product) collected from 30 hives over a 2-year period. Furthermore, although we detected fipronil desulfinyl in one honeybee sample, this is thought to have originated from a single individual, representing a rare occurrence of intoxication, and there was no evidence that Vespex was the toxicant source. There was also no evidence of trophallactic transfer of fipronil or its derivatives in any of the hives sampled. Previous studies have reported the impairment of individual bee performance at fipronil doses similar to the detection limit of our study. However, our results provide confidence that if undetectable intoxication was occurring, it would involve an acute exposure for those few individuals affected, with minimal impairment to colonies. Therefore, we conclude that the use of Vespex in the vicinity of honeybees does not result in significant hive uptake while effectively reducing wasp pressure on honeybee colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2899066170,"Sucrose synthase (SuSy) is one key enzyme directly hydrolyzing sucrose to supply substrates for plant metabolism, and is considered to be a biomarker for plant sink strength. Improvement in plant sink strength could lead to enhanced plant growth and yield. Cultivated tomatoes are known to have a narrow genetic diversity, which hampers further breeding for novel and improved traits in new cultivars. In this study, we observed limited genetic variation in SuSy1, SuSy3 and SuSy4 in 53 accessions of cultivated tomato and landraces, but identified a wealth of genetic diversity in 32 accessions of related wild species. The variation in the deduced amino acid sequences was grouped into 23, 22, and 17 distinct haplotypes for SuSy1/3/4, respectively. Strikingly, all known substrate binding sites were highly conserved, as well as most of the phosphorylation sites except in SuSy1. Two SuSy1 and three SuSy3 protein variants were heterologously expressed to study the effect of the amino acid changes on enzyme kinetic properties, i.e. maximal sucrose hydrolyzing capacity (Vmax), affinity for sucrose (Km), and catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) at 25°C and 16°C. SuSy1-haplotype#3 containing phosphorylation site Ser-16 did not have an improvement in the kinetic properties compared to the reference SuSy1-haplotype#1 containing Arg-16. Meanwhile SuSy3-haplotype#9 from a wild accession, containing four amino acid changes S53A, S106I, E727D and K741E, showed an increase in Vmax/Km at 16°C compared to the reference SuSy3-haplotype#1. This study demonstrates that SuSy kinetic properties can be enhanced by exploiting natural variation, and the potential of this enzyme to improve sucrose metabolism and eventually sink strength in planta."

Compared to never users, ever users of any type of hormonal contraception had a relative risk (RR) of pancreatic cancer of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-1.19). No overall association between duration of hormonal contraceptive use and pancreatic cancer risk was found. Neither was long-term use of hormonal contraception associated with pancreas cancer, RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.47-1.50). The risk did not vary between users of combined and progestogen-only products. All models were adjusted for age, completed or ongoing education, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and among parous women; parity, age at first birth, smoking and body mass index.Compared to never users the risk of pancreatic cancer is not significantly higher among current and recent users of contemporary hormonal contraception and does not vary between users of combined and progestogen-only products.

https://openalex.org/W2950546838,"The obesity epidemic is developing into the most costly health problem facing the world. Obesity, characterized by excessive adipogenesis and enlarged adipocytes, promotes morbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Regulation of adipogenesis is critical to our understanding of how fat cell formation causes obesity and associated health problems. Thy1 (also called CD90), a widely used stem cell marker, blocks adipogenesis and reduces lipid accumulation. Thy1-knockout mice are prone to diet-induced obesity. Although the importance of Thy1 in adipogenesis and obesity is now evident, how its expression is regulated is not. We hypothesized that DNA methylation has a role in promoting adipogenesis and affects Thy1 expression. Using the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), we investigated whether DNA methylation alters Thy1 expression during adipogenesis in both mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse mesenchymal stem cells. Thy1 protein and mRNA levels were decreased dramatically during adipogenesis. However, 5-aza-dC treatment prevented that phenomenon. Methylation-sensitive pyrosequencing analysis showed that CpG sites at the Thy1 locus have increased methylation during adipogenesis, as well as increased methylation in adipose tissue from diet-induced obese mice. These new findings highlight the potential role of Thy1 and DNA methylation in adipogenesis and obesity.—Flores, E. M., Woeller, C. F., Falsetta, M. L., Susiarjo, M., Phipps, R. P.

https://openalex.org/W2899513431,"The unfolding dynamics of the vocal expression of emotions are crucial for the decoding of the emotional state of an individual. In this study, we analyzed how much information is needed to decode a vocally expressed emotion using affect bursts, a gating paradigm, and linear mixed models. We showed that some emotions (fear, anger, disgust) were significantly better recognized at full-duration than others (joy, sadness, neutral). As predicted, recognition improved when greater proportion of the stimuli was presented. Emotion recognition curves for anger and disgust were best described by higher order polynomials (second to third), while fear, sadness, neutral, and joy were best described by linear relationships. Acoustic features were extracted for each stimulus and subjected to a principal component analysis for each emotion. The principal components were successfully used to partially predict the accuracy of recognition (i.e., for anger, a component encompassing acoustic features such as fundamental frequency (f0) and jitter; for joy, pitch and loudness range). Furthermore, the impact of the principal components on the recognition of anger, disgust, and sadness changed with longer portions being presented. These results support the importance of studying the unfolding conscious recognition of emotional vocalizations to reveal the differential contributions of specific acoustical feature sets. It is likely that these effects are due to the relevance of threatening information to the human mind and are related to urgent motor responses when people are exposed to potential threats as compared with emotions where no such urgent response is required (e.g., joy)."

https://openalex.org/W2898987406,"Proteins are chains of amino acids which adopt a three-dimensional structure and are then able to catalyze chemical reactions or propagate signals in organisms. Without external influence, many proteins fold into their native structure, and a small number of Early Folding Residues (EFR) have previously been shown to initiate the formation of secondary structure elements and guide their respective assembly. Using the two diverse superfamilies of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), it is shown that the position of EFR is preserved over the course of evolution even when the corresponding sequence conservation is small. Folding initiation sites are positioned in the center of secondary structure elements, independent of aaRS class. In class I, the predicted position of EFR resembles an ancient structural packing motif present in many seemingly unrelated proteins. Furthermore, it is shown that EFR and functionally relevant residues in aaRS are almost entirely disjoint sets of residues. The Start2Fold database is used to investigate whether this separation of EFR and functional residues can be observed for other proteins. EFR are found to constitute crucial connectors of protein regions which are distant at sequence level. Especially, these residues exhibit a high number of non-covalent residue-residue contacts such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This tendency also manifests as energetically stable local regions, as substantiated by a knowledge-based potential. Despite profound differences regarding how EFR and functional residues are embedded in protein structures, a strict separation of structurally and functionally relevant residues cannot be observed for a more general collection of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2898750651,"Spontaneous blinking is one of the most frequent human behaviours. While attentionally guided blinking may benefit human survival, the function of spontaneous frequent blinking in cognitive processes is poorly understood. To model human spontaneous blinking, we proposed a leaky integrate-and-fire model with a variable threshold which is assumed to represent physiological fluctuations during cognitive tasks. The proposed model is capable of reproducing bimodal, normal, and widespread peak-less distributions of inter-blink intervals as well as the more common popular positively skewed distributions. For bimodal distributions, the temporal positions of the two peaks depend on the baseline and the amplitude of the fluctuating threshold function. Parameters that reproduce experimentally derived bimodal distributions suggest that relatively slow oscillations (0.11-0.25 Hz) govern blink elicitations. The results also suggest that changes in blink rates would reflect fluctuations of threshold regulated by human internal states."

Goodpasture antigen–binding protein (GPBP), a BM protein, was uniquely poised to play diverse roles in this transition owing to its multiple isoforms (GPBP-1, -2, and -3) with varied intracellular and extracellular functions (ceramide trafficker and protein kinase). We sought to determine the evolutionary origin of GPBP isoforms. Our findings reveal the presence of GPBP in unicellular protists, with GPBP-2 as the most ancient isoform. In vertebrates, GPBP-1 assumed extracellular function that is further enhanced by membrane-bound GPBP-3 in mammalians, whereas GPBP-2 retained intracellular function. Moreover, GPBP-2 possesses a dual intracellular/extracellular function in cnidarians, an early nonbilaterian group. We conclude that GPBP functioning both inside and outside the cell was of fundamental importance for the evolutionary transition to animal multicellularity and tissue evolution.

We sought to determine the evolutionary origin of GPBP isoforms. Our findings reveal the presence of GPBP in unicellular protists, with GPBP-2 as the most ancient isoform. In vertebrates, GPBP-1 assumed extracellular function that is further enhanced by membrane-bound GPBP-3 in mammalians, whereas GPBP-2 retained intracellular function. Moreover, GPBP-2 possesses a dual intracellular/extracellular function in cnidarians, an early nonbilaterian group. We conclude that GPBP functioning both inside and outside the cell was of fundamental importance for the evolutionary transition to animal multicellularity and tissue evolution. How evolution made the matrix punch at the multicellularity partyJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 3PreviewThe basement membrane is a specialized sheet-like form of the extracellular matrix that provides structural support to epithelial cells and tissues, while influencing multiple biological functions, and was essential in the transition to multicellularity. By exploring a variety of genomes, Darris et al. provide evidence that the emergence and divergence of a multifunctional Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP), a basement membrane constituent, played a role in this transition. These findings help to explain how GPBP contributed to the formation of these extracellular matrices and to more precisely define the transition to multicellular organisms. Full-Text PDF Open Access"

To improve the prediction accuracy and avoid over or under fitting, two techniques are adopted to select the appropriate structure of ELM. First, the inputs of the ELM are selected from the roll motion time series using Lipschitz quotient method. Second, the number of hidden layer nodes is determined via ℓ1 regularized technique. Finally, the ℓ1 regularized ELM is solved by least angle regression (LAR) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by ship roll motion prediction experiments based on the real measured ship roll motion time series."
https://openalex.org/W2898689051,"Hydraulic systems are equipment widely used in stationary industrial equipment and in moving agricultural equipment and construction machines. Currently, the rotation of the vibrating conveyor belt of the peanut digger-inverter is triggered by the tractor power take-off. Considering that for the equipment to operate at its optimal, the tractor engine needs to work at low rotation, responsible for the rotation of the power take-off, this work aimed at developing an electro-hydraulic system able to transmit varying work rotations to the vibrating conveyor belt of the digger-inverter, regardless the rotation of the power take-off and the speed used in the tractor. The electro-hydraulic system uses the oil of the auxiliary hydraulic system (remote control) and electric power of the tractor battery. The rotation of the hydraulic motor that drives the vibrating conveyor axis is controlled by a proportional flow control valve while the direction of rotation is determined by an electro-hydraulic directional valve, controlled by a Vcontrol Personal Device Assistant controller installed in the tractor cab. The electro-hydraulic system developed can be used to control the rotation of the vibrating conveyor belt of the peanut digger-inverter since it meets the torque and power requirements necessary to move the vibrating conveyor belt, with the respective rotation control."
https://openalex.org/W2899517061,"Background According to between-arms assessments, more than 50% of individuals with stroke have an impaired position sense. Our previous work, which employed a clinical assessment and slightly differing tasks, indicates that individuals who have a deficit on a between-forearms position-localization task do not necessarily have a deficit on a single-forearm position-localization task. Objective Our goal here was to, using robotics tools, determine whether individuals with stroke who have a deficit when matching forearm positions within an arm also have a deficit when mirroring forearm positions between arms, independent of the arm that leads the task. Methods Eighteen participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke and nine controls completed a single-arm position-matching experiment and between-arms position-mirroring experiment. For each experiment, the reference forearm (left/right) passively rotated about the elbow joint to a reference target location (flexion/extension), and then the participant actively rotated their same/opposite forearm to match/mirror the reference forearm’s position. Participants with stroke were classified as having a position-matching/-mirroring deficit based on a quantitative threshold that was derived from the controls’ data. Results On our single-arm task, one participant with stroke was classified as having a position-matching deficit with a mean magnitude of error greater than 10.7° when referencing their paretic arm. Position-matching ability did not significantly differ for the controls and the remaining seventeen participants with stroke. On our between-arms task, seven participants with stroke were classified as having a position-mirroring deficit with a mean magnitude of error greater than 10.1°. Position-mirroring accuracy was worse for these participants with stroke, when referencing their paretic arm, than the controls. Concluding remark Findings underscore the need for assessing within-arm position-matching deficits, in addition to between-arms position-mirroring deficits when referencing each arm, to comprehensively evaluate an individual’s ability to locate their forearm(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2898760024,"Emergent patterns in complex systems are related with many intriguing phenomena in modern science. One question that has sparked vigorous debates is if difficulties in the modelization of emergent behaviours are a consequence of ontological or epistemological limitations. To elucidate this question, we propose a novel approximation through constructive logic. Under this framework, experimental measurements will be considered conceptual building blocks from which we aim to achieve a description of the microstates ensemble mapping the macroscopic emergent observation. This procedure allow us to have full control of any information loss, thus making the analysis of different systems fairly comparable. In particular, we aim to look for compact descriptions of the constraints underlying a dynamical system, as a necessary a priori step to develop explanatory (mechanistic) models. We apply our proposal to a synthetic system to show that the number and scope of the system’s constraints hinder our ability to build compact descriptions, being those systems under global constraints a limiting case in which such a description is unreachable. This result clearly links the epistemological limits of the framework selected with an ontological feature of the system, leading us to propose a definition of emergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through the active intervention of the observer on the system, following the spirit of Granger causality. We think that our approximation clarifies previous discrepancies found in the literature, reconciles distinct attempts to classify emergent processes, and paves the way to understand other challenging concepts such as downward causation."
https://openalex.org/W2899049386,"The slipper limpet Crepipatella dilatata, native to Chile and Argentina, was introduced in Spain in 2005. The species was thought to inhabit the region of Rias Bajas, yet recently, putative C. dilatata populations have been documented on the coast of north-central Spain and in the Ebro Delta of the Spanish Mediterranean. Here we undertook a multidisciplinary approach to study the invasion biology of this species. Specifically, two geographically distant populations, one being a successfully established population from O Grove and the other a declining population from Gijon, were studied over the course of four years. Analyses of morphological and developmental traits as well as genetic information confirmed the presence of C. dilatata in these sites. The results revealed polymorphism in anatomical traits and shell shape. Shell shape polymorphism was unevenly distributed among sites and among sexes. Males were monomorphic, while females were polymorphic. Of the female morphotypes encountered, one was absent in the declining population from Gijón. Size at first female maturation and female size were greater in the declining population than in the established population. Reproductive success varied seasonally but not spatially among populations. In the established population, gregariousness was significantly greater; the size when sex changes was found to be plastic and socially controlled. The sex ratio of the declining population was female biased while in the established population the sex ratio changed during the study period from being balanced to being female biased. This change in sex ratio was probably due to higher male mortality. Molecular analyses pointed to the localities of Corral Bay in southern Chile and Puerto Madryn in southern Argentina as potential population sources. The intercontinental import of fresh mussels cultivated in Chilean farms is a likely source of this mussel in Spain. Comparison with available data of native populations of C. dilatata strongly indicate that ecophenotypic plasticity, socially controlled sex change, high gregariousness, increased nurse egg supply to viable larvae during the encapsulated developmental period, later maturation and larger female sizes altogether enhance establishment success of this non-indigenous species. Human-mediated factors like the intraregional mussel trade and transplantation are also likely secondary dispersal mechanisms favouring the spread of this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2899406407,"Understanding the sense of discourse relations between segments of text is essential to truly comprehend any natural language text. Several automated approaches have been suggested, but all rely on external resources, linguistic feature engineering, and their processing pipelines are built from substantially different models. In this paper, we introduce a novel system for sense classification of shallow discourse relations (FR system) based on focused recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In contrast to existing systems, FR system consists of a single end-to-end trainable model for handling all types and senses of discourse relations, requires no feature engineering or external resources, is language-independent, and can be applied at the word and even character levels. At its core, we present our novel generalization of the focused RNNs layer, the first multi-dimensional RNN-attention mechanism for constructing text/argument embeddings. The filtering/gating RNN enables downstream RNNs to focus on different aspects of the input sequence and project it into several embedding subspaces. These argument embeddings are then used to perform sense classification. FR system has been evaluated using the official datasets and methodology of CoNLL 2016 Shared Task. It does not fall a lot behind state-of-the-art performance on English, the most researched and supported language, but it outperforms existing best systems by 2.5% overall results on the Chinese blind dataset."
