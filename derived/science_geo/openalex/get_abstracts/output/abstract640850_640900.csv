https://openalex.org/W2979595830,"Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide and is characterized by extensive fibrosis. There are currently no effective antifibrotic therapies available. To obtain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and enable the discovery of therapeutic targets, here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 100,000 single human cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types that are found in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We identify a scar-associated TREM2+CD9+ subpopulation of macrophages, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define ACKR1+ and PLVAP+ endothelial cells that expand in cirrhosis, are topographically restricted to the fibrotic niche and enhance the transmigration of leucocytes. Multi-lineage modelling of ligand and receptor interactions between the scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and PDGFRα+ collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including TNFRSF12A, PDGFR and NOTCH signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides a conceptual framework for the discovery of rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2969240523,"Heat pumps based on magnetocaloric and electrocaloric working bodies—in which entropic phase transitions are driven by changes of magnetic and electric field, respectively—use displaceable fluids to establish relatively large temperature spans between loads to be cooled and heat sinks1,2. However, the performance of prototypes is limited because practical magnetocaloric working bodies driven by permanent magnets3–5 and electrocaloric working bodies driven by voltage6–16 display temperature changes of less than 3 kelvin. Here we show that high-quality multilayer capacitors of PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 display large electrocaloric effects over a wide range of starting temperatures when the first-order ferroelectric phase transition is driven supercritically (as verified by Landau theory) above the Curie temperature of 290 kelvin by electric fields of 29.0 volts per micrometre. Changes of temperature in the large central area of the capacitor peak at 5.5 kelvin near room temperature and exceed 3 kelvin for starting temperatures that span 176 kelvin (complete thermalization would reduce these values from 5.5 to 3.3 kelvin and from 176 to 73 kelvin). If magnetocaloric working bodies were to be replaced with multilayer capacitors of PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3, then the established design principles behind magnetocaloric heat pumps could be repurposed for better performance without bulky and expensive permanent magnets. High-quality multilayer capacitors of a perovskite oxide show that large electric-field-driven caloric effects could improve solid-state refrigeration technology and challenge today’s standard (based on magnetocaloric effects in gadolinium)."

https://openalex.org/W2980066052,"There is strong epidemiological evidence that poor diet is associated with depression. The reverse has also been shown, namely that eating a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish and lean meat, is associated with reduced risk of depression. To date, only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted with elevated depression symptoms being an inclusion criterion, with results showing that a diet intervention can reduce clinical levels of depression. No such RCTs have been performed in young adults. Young adults with elevated levels of depression symptoms and who habitually consume a poor diet were randomly allocated to a brief 3-week diet intervention (Diet Group) or a habitual diet control group (Control Group). The primary and secondary outcome measures assessed at baseline and after the intervention included symptoms of depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; CESD-R; and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale- 21 depression subscale; DASS-21-D), current mood (Profile of Mood States), self-efficacy (New General Self-Efficacy Scale) and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test). Diet compliance was measured via self-report questionnaires and spectrophotometry. One-hundred-and-one individuals were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the Diet Group or the Control Group. Upon completion of the study, there was complete data for 38 individuals in each group. There was good compliance with the diet intervention recommendations assessed using self-report and spectrophotometry. The Diet group had significantly lower self-reported depression symptoms than the Control Group on the CESD-R (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.65) and DASS-21 depression subscale (p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 0.75) controlling for baseline scores on these scales. Reduced DASS-21 depression subscale scores were maintained on follow up phone call 3 months later (p = .009). These results are the first to show that young adults with elevated depression symptoms can engage in and adhere to a diet intervention, and that this can reduce symptoms of depression. The findings provide justification for future research into the duration of these benefits, the impacts of varying diet composition, and their biological basis."
https://openalex.org/W2979491247,"Host infection by pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is facilitated by virulence factors that are secreted by type VII secretion systems1. A molecular understanding of the type VII secretion mechanism has been hampered owing to a lack of three-dimensional structures of the fully assembled secretion apparatus. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a membrane-embedded core complex of the ESX-3/type VII secretion system from Mycobacterium smegmatis. The core of the ESX-3 secretion machine consists of four protein components-EccB3, EccC3, EccD3 and EccE3, in a 1:1:2:1 stoichiometry-which form two identical protomers. The EccC3 coupling protein comprises a flexible array of four ATPase domains, which are linked to the membrane through a stalk domain. The domain of unknown function (DUF) adjacent to the stalk is identified as an ATPase domain that is essential for secretion. EccB3 is predominantly periplasmatic, but a small segment crosses the membrane and contacts the stalk domain. This suggests that conformational changes in the stalk domain-triggered by substrate binding at the distal end of EccC3 and subsequent ATP hydrolysis in the DUF-could be coupled to substrate secretion to the periplasm. Our results reveal that the architecture of type VII secretion systems differs markedly from that of other known secretion machines2, and provide a structural understanding of these systems that will be useful for the design of antimicrobial strategies that target bacterial virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2980178541,"The effect of age on intimate partner violence (IPV) against women has received little attention. The objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence, risk factors and health impact of current IPV in different life stages.We analyzed a sub-sample of 8,935 ever-partnered women aged 16 years and older from the Spanish Macrosurvey on Gender Violence of 2014. Main outcomes: current physical/ sexual IPV and current psychological-only IPV. The impact of IPV on health was analyzed using the variables self-perceived health, mental health and activity limitations. Risk factors were assessed using the prevalence ratio (PR) from Poisson regression models with robust variance. Analyses were stratified by age (young people, adults, and elderly people).Abuse in childhood increases the likelihood of IPV in any life stage. A higher education level decreases the probability of physical/sexual IPV across all ages. Unemployment increases the probability of IPV in adult women (physical/sexual-IPV, PR:1.7; psychological-IPV, PR:1.3). Being an immigrant increases the likelihood of physical/sexual IPV in adult women (PRwomen:1.91). Women exposed to current physical/sexual IPV have a greater likelihood of reporting poor self-perceived health (PRyoungpeople:2.59; PRadults:1.68; PRelderly:1.28), poor mental health (PRyoungpeople:3.10; PRadults:2.61; PRedlerly:2.17) and activity limitations (PRyoungpeople:2.44; PRadults:1.98). For psychological IPV only, there is an increase in the probability of poor self-perceived health (PRadults:1.37; PRelderly:1.19), poor mental health (PRyoungpeople:2.24; PRadults:2.16; PRelderly:1.69), and activity limitations (PRadults:1.30; PRelderly:1.18).We found both common factors and differential factors when looking at IPV by age group. This shows the need to link gender violence prevention with the social circumstances of the population across different life stages."
https://openalex.org/W2980019648,"Aquaculture of bivalve shellfish and seaweed represents a global opportunity to simultaneously advance coastal ecosystem recovery and provide substantive benefits to humanity. To identify marine ecoregions with the greatest potential for development of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture to meet this opportunity, we conducted a global spatial analysis using key environmental (e.g., nutrient pollution status), socioeconomic (e.g., governance quality), and human health factors (e.g., wastewater treatment prevalence). We identify a substantial opportunity for strategic sector development, with the highest opportunity marine ecoregions for shellfish aquaculture centered on Oceania, North America, and portions of Asia, and the highest opportunity for seaweed aquaculture distributed throughout Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. This study provides insights into specific areas where governments, international development organizations, and investors should prioritize new efforts to drive changes in public policy, capacity-building, and business planning to realize the ecosystem and societal benefits of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2980064426,"South Korea is ranked as 4th among 34 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with 102 deaths in road accidents per one million population. This paper aims to investigate the factors associated with road accidents in South Korea. The rainfall data of the Korea Meteorological Administration and road accidents data of Traffic Accident Analysis System of Korea Road Traffic Authority is analyzed for this purpose. In this connection, multivariate regression analysis and ratio analysis with the descriptive analysis are performed to uncover the catastrophic factors involved. In turn, the results reveal that traffic volume is the leading factor in road accidents. The limited road extension of 1.47% compared to the 4.14% per annum growth of the vehicles is resulting in road accidents at such a large scale. The increasing proportion of passenger cars accelerate road accidents as well. 56% of accidents occur by the infringement of safety driving violations. The drivers with higher driving experience tend to have a higher accident ratio. The collected data is analyzed in terms of gender, driver experience, type of violations and accidents as well as the associated time of the accidents when they happen. The results indicate that 36.29% and 53.01% of accidents happen by male drivers in the day and night time, respectively. 29.15% of crashes happen due to safety infringement and violations of 41 to 60 years old drivers. The results demonstrate that population density is associated with the accidents frequency and lower density results in an increased number of accidents. The necessity of the state-of-the-art regulations to govern the urban road traffic is beyond dispute, and it becomes even more crucial for citizens’ relief since in our daily lives road accidents are getting more diverse."
https://openalex.org/W2980227099,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver cancer. Although long-term survival of HB is generally favorable, it depends on clinical stage, tumor histology, and a variety of biochemical and molecular features. HB appears almost exclusively before the age of 3 years, is represented by seven histological subtypes, and is usually associated with highly heterogeneous somatic mutations in the catenin β1 (CTNNB1) gene, which encodes β-catenin, a Wnt ligand–responsive transcriptional co-factor. Numerous recurring β-catenin mutations, not previously documented in HB, have also been identified in various other pediatric and adult cancer types. Little is known about the underlying factors that determine the above HB features and behaviors or whether non-HB–associated β-catenin mutations are tumorigenic when expressed in hepatocytes. Here, we investigated the oncogenic properties of 14 different HB– and non-HB–associated β-catenin mutants encoded by Sleeping Beauty vectors following their delivery into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection. We show that all β-catenin mutations, as well as WT β-catenin, are tumorigenic when co-expressed with a mutant form of yes-associated protein (YAP). However, tumor growth rates, histologies, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic partitioning, and metabolic and transcriptional landscapes were strongly influenced by the identities of the β-catenin mutations. These findings provide a context for understanding at the molecular level the notable biological diversity of HB. Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver cancer.

CTNNB1 encodes β-catenin, a transcriptional co-activator that mediates signaling via the Wnt pathway. In quiescent cells, β-catenin resides in the cytoplasm in a transcriptionally inert form as a short-lived member of the APC complex wherein it is sequentially phosphorylated on several neighboring N-terminal serine and threonine residues and thus marked for rapid polyubiquitinylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (27Armengol C.

Extracellular Wnt ligand signaling recruits the APC complex to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, causing the release of unphosphorylated β-catenin that cannot be recognized by the degradation complex. The now stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with Tcf/Lef transcription factor family members, engages in transcriptional cross-talk with the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, and drives tumorigenesis by deregulating a large array of targets, including such well-known oncogenes as CCND1 and MYC (3Bell D.

Mutant forms of β-catenin, often involving one or more of its phosphorylation sites, prevent its association with the APC complex, its ubiquitination, and its proteasomal degradation. Instead, the now stabilized mutant β-catenin is constitutively redirected to the nucleus in a Wnt-independent manner. A small subset of HBs with WT β-catenin harbor acquired mutations in other APC complex components, including Axin1, Axin2, and APC itself, thus leading to the same failure of β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and rapid proteasomal turnover (2Czauderna P.

NLRP3, a pro-inflammatory molecule, is known to be involved in inflammasome activation associated with several diseases. Recently, the expression of NLRP3 in CD4+ T cells, as well as in myeloid cells, has been described; however, a role of T cell–intrinsic NLRP3 in Treg differentiation remains unknown. Here, we report that NLRP3 impeded the expression of Foxp3 independent of inflammasome activation in Tregs. NLRP3-deficient mice elevate Treg generation in various organs in the de novo pathway. NLRP3 deficiency increased the amount and suppressive activity of Treg populations, whereas NLRP3 overexpression reduced Foxp3 expression and Treg abundance. Importantly, NLRP3 interacted with Kpna2 and translocated to the nucleus from the cytoplasm under Treg-polarizing conditions. Taken together, our results identify a novel role for NLRP3 as a new negative regulator of Treg differentiation, mediated via its interaction with Kpna2 for nuclear translocation."

All clinical cases of C. auris infection diagnosed from 1997 to 2019 in Japan were non-invasive and sporadic otitis media cases. In the present study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of seven C. auris strains isolated from patients with otitis media in Japan, all of which belonged to clade II. Comparative genome analysis using the high-quality draft genome sequences JCM 15448T revealed that single nucleotide variations (SNVs), clade-specific accessory genes, and copy number variations (CNVs) were identified in each C. auris clade. A total of 61 genes involved in cell wall and stress response-related functions was absent in clade II, and the pattern of conserved CNVs in each clade was more stable in clade II than in other clades. Our data suggest that the genomic structural diversity is stable in C. auris isolated from each biogeographic location, and Japanese strains isolated from patients with otitis media might belong to an ancestral type of C. auris. One Japanese strain, TWCC 58362, with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole, exhibited no mutation in ergosterol biosynthesis-related genes (ERG). However, TWCC 58362-specific variations, including SNVs, indels, and CNVs were detected, suggesting that gene duplication events in C. auris might contribute to antifungal drug resistance. Taken together, we demonstrated that genomic structural variations in C. auris could correlate to geographical dissemination, epidemiology, lesions in the host, and antifungal resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2980215044,"Background The association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk remains unclear and published data are limited. Methods The analytic cohort included 99,798 women, free of cancer at baseline, from the California Teachers Study, a longitudinal cohort comprised of 133,477 female teachers and administrators who were active or recently retired members of the California State Teachers Retirement System in 1995. SSB consumption constituted caloric soft drinks, sweetened bottled waters and teas, and fruit drinks, derived from a self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Consumption was divided into four categories: Rare or never, >rare/never to <1 serving/week, ≥1 serving/week to <1 serving/day, and ≥1 serving/day. CRC endpoints were based on annual linkage with California Cancer Registry, defined as first diagnosis of CRC, and classified following the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program coding system. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for assessing the association between SSB consumption and incident CRC. Results A total of 1,318 incident CRC cases were identified over 20 years of follow-up (54.5% proximal colon and 45.5% distal colorectum). Compared with rare/never consumers, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1.14 (0.86, 1.53) for total CRC; 1.11 (0.73, 1.68) for proximal colon; and 1.22 (0.80, 1.86) for distal colorectum cancers among women consuming ≥ 1 serving/day of SSBs. Conclusion SSBs were not significantly associated with CRC risk. The biological effects of high SSB consumption make it important to continue to evaluate whether SSBs are associated with CRC. Additionally, future studies should further assess SSBs in large, racial/ethnically diverse cohorts of males and females, and, if feasible, address changes in SSB consumption over time."

Since both constructs have central importance for the aging process, it is surprising that to our knowledge no study so far comprehensively addressed their mutual connection over time. We used data from the ILSE study, a longitudinal study capturing personality and attitudes toward own aging at four measurement occasions, spanning 20 years and including two participant cohorts in midlife (n = 501; born 1950–52) and later life (n = 500; born 1930–32). Dual latent change score models showed that personality was longitudinally related to change in attitudes toward own aging: Lower Neuroticism, higher Conscientiousness, and higher Openness predicted more positive attitudes, whereas the direction of the effect for Extraversion varied by time. Furthermore, the role of personality seems to be confined to certain sensitive periods in midlife and early old age. Contrary to our expectations, attitudes toward own aging had only marginal longitudinal impact on the Big Five. Our results shed light on the developmental co-dynamics of personality and subjective perceptions of aging across the second half of the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2979470678,"Background One of the reported causes of high malnutrition rates in Burundi and Rwanda is children's inadequate dietary habits. The diet of children may be affected by individual characteristics and by the characteristics of the households and the communities in which they live. We used the minimum dietary diversity of children (MDD-C) indicator as a proxy of diet quality aiming at: 1) assess how much of the observed variation in MDD-C was attributed to community clustering, and 2) to identify the MDD-C associated factors. Methods Data was obtained from the 2010 Demographic and Health Surveys of Burundi and Rwanda, from which only children 6 to 23 months from rural areas were analysed. The MDD-C was calculated according to the 2007 WHO/UNICEF guidelines. We computed the intra-class coefficient to assess the percentage of variation attributed to the clustering effect of living in the same community. And then we applied two-level logit regressions to investigate the association between MDD-C and potential risk factors following the hierarchical survey structure of DHS. Results The MDD-C was 23% in rural Rwanda and 16% in rural Burundi, and a 29% of its variation in Rwanda and 17% in Burundi was attributable to community clustering. Increasing age and living standards were associated with higher MDD-C in both countries, and only in Burundi also increasing level of education of the mother's partner. In Rwanda alone, the increasing ages of the head of the household and of the mother at first birth were also positively associated with it. Despite the identification of an important proportion of the MDD-C variation due to clustering, we couldn't identify any community variable significantly associated with it. Conclusions We recommend further research using hierarchical models, and to integrate dietary diversity in holistic interventions which take into account both the household's and the community's characteristics the children live in."
https://openalex.org/W2980003473,"Objectives Aging is associated with low muscle mass and has been linked to adverse health outcomes. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were: (1) to describe anthropometry, body composition, appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI; appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height2), and prevalence of low ASMI in older people with normal nutritional status (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool score = 0); (2) to determine factors associated with ASMI, and odds ratios of having low ASMI. Methods SHIELD is a study of community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and above in Singapore. ASMI was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis and low ASMI was defined as <7.0 kg/m2 for males and <5.7 kg/m2 for females (Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, 2014). Results A total of 400 older people (183 males and 217 females) took part in this study. The overall prevalence of low ASMI was 20.6% (15.5% in males and 24.9% in females). Females had significantly lower ASMI than males (P < 0.0001), age was inversely associated with ASMI (P = 0.0024) while BMI and calf circumference were positively associated with ASMI (both P < 0.0001) in the total cohort. In addition, ASMI was positively associated with bone mass in both genders (both P < 0.0001). After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratios of having low ASMI with every 1 year and 10 years increase in age were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.20) and 3.36 (95% CI: 1.82, 6.21) respectively. Conclusions The high prevalence of low ASMI in community-dwelling older people with normal nutritional status highlights the need for early screening. There was a strong inverse association between age and ASMI while BMI, calf circumference and bone mass were positively associated with ASMI. These findings will give further weight to the importance and development of public health strategies in maintaining and improving muscle health in this population group."
https://openalex.org/W2979310388,"Thioredoxin (Trx) is a redox-responsive protein that modulates the activities of its target proteins mostly by reducing their disulfide bonds. In chloroplasts, five Trx isoforms (Trx-f, Trx-m, Trx-x, Trx-y, and Trx-z) regulate various photosynthesis-related enzymes with distinct target selectivity. To elucidate the determinants of the target selectivity of each Trx isoform, here we investigated the residues responsible for target recognition by Trx-f, the most well-studied chloroplast-resident Trx. As reported previously, we found that positively-charged residues on the Trx-f surface are involved in the interactions with its targets. Moreover, several residues that are specifically conserved in Trx-f (e.g. Cys-126 and Thr-158) were also involved in interactions with target proteins. The validity of these residues was examined by the molecular dynamics simulation. In addition, we validated the impact of these key residues on target protein reduction by studying (i) Trx-m variants into which we introduced the key residues for Trx-f and (ii) Trx-like proteins, named atypical Cys His-rich Trx 1 (ACHT1) and ACHT2a, that also contain these key residues. These artificial or natural protein variants could reduce Trx-f–specific targets, indicating that the key residues for Trx-f are critical for Trx-f–specific target recognition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ACHT1 and ACHT2a efficiently oxidize some Trx-f–specific targets, suggesting that its target selectivity also contributes to the oxidative regulation process. Our results reveal the key residues for Trx-f–specific target recognition and uncover ACHT1 and ACHT2a as oxidation factors of their target proteins, providing critical insight into redox regulation of photosynthesis.

In chloroplasts, five Trx isoforms (Trx-f, Trx-m, Trx-x, Trx-y, and Trx-z) regulate various photosynthesis-related enzymes with distinct target selectivity. To elucidate the determinants of the target selectivity of each Trx isoform, here we investigated the residues responsible for target recognition by Trx-f, the most well-studied chloroplast-resident Trx. As reported previously, we found that positively-charged residues on the Trx-f surface are involved in the interactions with its targets. Moreover, several residues that are specifically conserved in Trx-f (e.g. Cys-126 and Thr-158) were also involved in interactions with target proteins. The validity of these residues was examined by the molecular dynamics simulation. In addition, we validated the impact of these key residues on target protein reduction by studying (i) Trx-m variants into which we introduced the key residues for Trx-f and (ii) Trx-like proteins, named atypical Cys His-rich Trx 1 (ACHT1) and ACHT2a, that also contain these key residues. These artificial or natural protein variants could reduce Trx-f–specific targets, indicating that the key residues for Trx-f are critical for Trx-f–specific target recognition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ACHT1 and ACHT2a efficiently oxidize some Trx-f–specific targets, suggesting that its target selectivity also contributes to the oxidative regulation process. Our results reveal the key residues for Trx-f–specific target recognition and uncover ACHT1 and ACHT2a as oxidation factors of their target proteins, providing critical insight into redox regulation of photosynthesis.

In 2000, the whole-genome sequences of the green plant Arabidopsis thaliana were revealed (11Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana.Nature. 2000; 408 (11130711): 796-81510.1038/35048692Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar), and five chloroplast Trx isoforms (f-, m-, x-, y-, and z-type) were identified in the genome based on their sequence similarities.

These approaches explosively increased the number of Trx–targeted proteins. Chloroplast Trxs specifically recognize their targets.

However, the determinant of the target selectivity of Trx-f and the differences among the determinants of Trx isoforms are not known very well. The midpoint redox potentials (Em) of the redox-responsive cysteine pairs on Trx and its target molecules are some of the factors determining the direction of the reactions (20Ren G. Stephan D. Xu Z.

For example, Trx-f and Trx-m have similar Em values, but only Trx-f can efficiently reduce FBPase (18Yoshida K. Hara S. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin selectivity for thiol-based redox regulation of target proteins in chloroplasts.J. Biol.

These Trx-dependent reduction processes were found to be rate-limiting steps in the light-dependent activation of chloroplast enzymes (23Yoshida K. Hisabori T.

Thus, target selectivity might determine the activation rate of each enzyme and enable the sophisticated regulation of various chloroplast functions. To elucidate the determinant of the target selectivity of Trx-f, several mutational and kinetic analyses have been conducted (24de Lamotte-Guery F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M.

These previous studies were mostly based on only the differences among Trx-f and -m from spinach and Trx from Escherichia coli. In addition, other Trxs (Trx-x, Trx-y, and Trx-z) were not considered at that time because they were not identified before the A. thaliana whole-genome analysis (16Collin V. Issakidis-Bourguet E.

Thus, the determinants of the target selectivity of Trx isoforms have not been completely identified. To address this question, we studied the residues specifically conserved in Trx-f via comparisons of the amino acid sequences of chloroplast Trxs from various plants. Some of the conserved residues should be candidate residues that are involved in Trx-f–specific target recognition. We then adopted a recently-developed sensor protein that can detect the reduction of a targeted protein of Trx-f as a fluorescent signal. This Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensor protein, which is named “change in redox state of thioredoxin 1 (CROST1)” (31Sugiura K. Yokochi Y. Fu N. Fukaya Y. Yoshida K. Mihara S.

Using this new sensor protein and various site-directed mutants of Trxs, we could identify the key residues as the determinant of the target selectivity of Trx-f. We recently identified Trx-like 2 (TrxL2) as a critical protein for the oxidation process of Trx–targeted proteins in chloroplasts (32Yoshida K. Hara A. Sugiura K. Fukaya Y. Hisabori T.

In this study, we found that ACHT1 and ACHT2 also possess the key residues, which were identified on Trx-f, based on the sequence comparison. We then demonstrated the function of these residues during the target oxidation process. Ten chloroplast Trx isoforms, which were designated as Trx-f1, Trx-f2, Trx-m1, Trx-m2, Trx-m3, Trx-m4, Trx-x, Trx-y1, Trx-y2, and Trx-z, were found in A. thaliana (19Geigenberger P. Thormählen I.

The orthologs of these Trx genes were also identified in other plant genomes via sequence similarity–based surveys (34Meyer Y. Reichheld J.P. Vignols F. Thioredoxins in Arabidopsis and other plants.Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86 (16307307): 419-43310.1007/s11120-005-5220-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Chibani K. Wingsle G. Jacquot J.P.

To explore the residues potentially involved in the target selectivity of each type of Trxs, we first conducted an amino acid sequence comparison of Trxs from several plants that are well-annotated in the UniprotKB database. We also included well-studied Chlamydomonas Trxs, although the Trx system in Chlamydomonas is somewhat different from those of vascular plants (8Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Morisse S. Sparla F.

Consequently, 14 residues were identified as candidate residues responsible for the target selectivity of Trx-f (Fig. 1, A–C, highlighted in magenta). Notably, most of the specific residues for each type of Trxs were located on the surface of the molecule, which presumably can interact with target proteins (see residues highlighted in magenta or black and the Interaction interface line in Fig. 1A, as well as B–D). We then prepared various Trx-f1 mutants harboring mutations of Trx-f–distinctive residues (Fig. 1B). Five amino acid residues of Trx-f1 (Met-94, Thr-96, Asn-127, Leu-137, and Asn-151) were replaced by their counterparts in the other types of Trxs because they are mostly conserved as other amino acid residues in the other types of Trxs (Fig. 1A). Seven hydrophilic residues of Trx-f1 (Gln-97, Asp-118, Arg-131, Lys-135, Glu-156, Thr-158, and Lys-161) were substituted with Ala, and one hydrophobic residue (Val-141) was replaced by Ser. Cys-126 was substituted with both Ser and Ala. Because Val-142 is located at the cis-Pro−1 position (Fig. 1A, asterisk) and the amino acid at this position is reported to be important for the redox property of Trx-family proteins (20Ren G.

However, all residues at this position of chloroplast Trxs have a similar hydrophobic property. We therefore replaced Val-142 with Met because Met is found at this position in TrxL2 (35Chibani K.

Trx-f1 mutants expressed in E. coli were then purified to homogeneity, although the mutants for Met-94, Asp-118, and Leu-137 were not obtained as soluble proteins. To confirm the activity of the purified Trx-f1 mutants as reductants, we evaluated their Em values and insulin-reducing activities (36Holmgren A.

Indeed, half of WT Trx-f1 was reduced in the buffer with the redox potential −321 mV (Fig. 2A). In this redox buffer, the ratio of the reduced fractions of most of Trx-f1 mutants was around 0.5, indicating that their Em values are similar to that of WT Trx-f1. So far, the Em values of A. thaliana chloroplast Trx isoforms are reported to be within the range from −335 to −276 mV at pH 7.5 (18Yoshida K. Hara S. Hisabori T. Thioredoxin selectivity for thiol-based redox regulation of target proteins in chloroplasts.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2A, the ratio of the reduced fractions of all Trx-f1 mutants was higher than 0.5 at redox potential −335 mV and lower than 0.5 at redox potential −276 mV. These results clearly demonstrate that Em values of Trx-f1 mutants are in the range of those of typical chloroplast Trxs. Insulin-reducing activity measurement shows that all examined mutants retained more than 85% of the activity of WT Trx-f1 (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the residues of Trx-f1 examined in this study are not strongly involved in the redox properties of Trx, namely the reductase activity. Subsequently, we examined the reduction activities of these mutants using the typical f-type Trx-specific target enzyme FBPase. To confirm that the residues are important not only for FBPase recognition but also for other Trx-f–specific targets, we used the artificial Trx-f–specific target protein CROST1 as well. CROST1 is a FRET-based sensor protein constructed using cyan fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein, and the N-terminal region of CP12, a redox-sensitive regulator protein of the Calvin-Benson cycle. The reduction of CROST1 is easily assessed via its fluorescent signal, and the redox status of Trx-f was successfully monitored in vivo using this sensor protein (31Sugiura K. Yokochi Y. Fu N. Fukaya Y. Yoshida K. Mihara S. Fu N. Hisabori T. The thioredoxin (Trx) redox-state sensor protein can visualize Trx activities in the light-dark response in chloroplasts.J. Biol.

The reduction activities of Trx mutants were assessed by analyzing the rate constants of target protein reduction (see “Experimental procedures”). Consequently, most of the mutations in Trx-f1 significantly decreased their reduction activities, particularly for FBPase reduction (Fig. 3). One exception was the mutant N151G, which exhibited a similar ability to reduce target proteins as WT. Based on these results, we concluded that the Trx-f–distinctive residues shown in Fig. 1, A and B, excluding Met-94, Asp-118, Leu-137, and Asn-151 are the key residues for the target selectivity of Trx-f. To evaluate the validity of these key residues for target recognition, the interaction between Trx-f and FBPase was examined in a structural model of their complex. To explore a feasible complex structure, we generated a large number of protein/protein complex models by docking, and we selected reasonable models based on Cys residue distances followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Consequently, we could obtain a dynamic structural model of a Trx-f/FBPase complex (Movies S1–S3) and a representative structural model of the complex (Fig. 4A). Based on this structural model, minimum pairwise heavy atom distance between each of the Trx-f key residues and FBPase (dmin) was determined (Fig. 4B). Assuming that residues whose dmin values are less than 4 Å interact with FBPase, Thr-96, Arg-131, Val-141, and Val-142 almost constantly interact with FBPase, whereas dmin values of the other Trx-f–distinctive residues were found to oscillate significantly (Fig. 4B and Movies S1–S3). According to these results, most of the key residues for Trx-f are supposed to interact with a target protein concomitantly with continuous conformational changes. Next, we validated the impact of the key residues for Trx-f on Trx-f–specific target recognition using Trx-m"

This study evaluated the effects of bexarotene on pathological and electrophysiological changes in very old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD mice). Methods 24-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were treated with bexarotene (100 mg/kg/day for 30 days). The Morris water maze was used to evaluate spatial memory; immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to evaluate pathological changes; and in vivo electrophysiological recordings were used to evaluate basal transmission and plasticity in the commissural CA3-CA1 pathway. Results In addition to cognitive improvement, bexarotene-treated 3xTg-AD mice were found to have 1) reductions of astrogliosis and reactive microglia both in cortex and hippocampus; 2) increased ApoE expression restricted to CA1; 3) increased number of cells co-labeled with ApoE and NeuN; 4) recovery of NeuN expression, suggesting neuronal protection; and, 5) recovery of basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Discussion These results indicate that bexarotene-induced improvement in cognition is due to multiple changes that contribute to recovery of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2979960006,"DNA repair defects have been increasingly focused on as therapeutic targets. In hormone-positive breast cancer, XRCC1-deficient tumors have been identified and proposed as targets for combination therapies that damage DNA and inhibit DNA repair pathways. XRCC1 is a scaffold protein that functions in base excision repair (BER) by mediating essential interactions between DNA glycosylases, AP endonuclease, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, DNA polymerase β (POL β), and DNA ligases. Loss of XRCC1 confers BER defects and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. BER defects have not been evaluated in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), for which new therapeutic targets and therapies are needed. To evaluate the potential of XRCC1 as an indicator of BER defects in TNBC, we examined XRCC1 expression in the TCGA database and its expression and localization in TNBC cell lines. The TCGA database revealed high XRCC1 expression in TNBC tumors and TNBC cell lines show variable, but mostly high expression of XRCC1. XRCC1 localized outside of the nucleus in some TNBC cell lines, altering their ability to repair base lesions and single-strand breaks. Subcellular localization of POL β also varied and did not correlate with XRCC1 localization. Basal levels of DNA damage correlated with observed changes in XRCC1 expression, localization, and measure repair capacity. The results confirmed that XRCC1 expression changes indicate DNA repair capacity changes but emphasize that basal DNA damage levels along with protein localization are better indicators of DNA repair defects. Given the observed over-expression of XRCC1 in TNBC preclinical models and tumors, XRCC1 expression levels should be assessed when evaluating treatment responses of TNBC preclinical model cells."
https://openalex.org/W2979874078,"Social scientists have been interested in measuring the prosperity, well-being, and quality of life of nations, which has resulted in a multiplicity of country-level indicators. However, little is known about the factor structure of these indicators. We explored the structure of quality of life, using country-level data on tens of subjective and objective indicators. Applying factor analysis, we identified three distinct factors that exhibited both overlap and complementarity. This structure was replicated in data from previous years and with a partially different set of variables. The first factor, 'socio-economic progress', is dominated by socio-political and economic indicators but also includes life satisfaction, which thus appears to reflect objective living conditions. The second factor, 'psycho-social functioning', consists of subjective indicators, such as eudaimonic well-being and positive affective states. The third, 'negative affectivity', comprises negatively-valenced affective states. The three macro-factors of societal quality of life demonstrated moderate intercorrelations and differential associations with cultural and ecological variables, providing support for their discriminant validity. Finally, country and regional rankings based on the three societal factors revealed a complex picture that cautions against over-reliance on any single indicator such as life satisfaction. The results underline the need for a broadly-based approach to the measurement of societal quality of life, and provide an empirically-derived multidimensional framework for conceptualizing and measuring quality of life and well-being at country level. This study is thus an initial empirical step towards systematizing the multiple approaches to societal quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2979627951,"Background Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities is critical in the provision of safe and quality care. Poor WASH increases hospital-associated infections and contributes to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is therefore essential for governments and hospital managers to know the state of WASH in these facilities to set priorities and allocate resources. Methods Using a recently developed survey tool and scoring approach, we assessed WASH across four domains in 14 public hospitals in Kenya (65 indicators) with specific assessments of individual wards (34 indicators). Aggregate scores were generated for whole facilities and individual wards and used to illustrate performance variation and link findings to specific levels of health system accountability. To help interpret and contextualise these scores, we used data from key informant interviews with hospital managers and health workers. Results Aggregate hospital performance ranged between 47 and 71% with five of the 14 hospitals scoring below 60%. A total of 116 wards were assessed within these facilities. Linked to specific domains, ward scores varied within and across hospitals and ranged between 20% and 80%. At ward level, some critical indicators, which affect AMR like proper waste segregation and hand hygiene compliance activities had pooled aggregate scores of 45 and 35% respectively. From 31 interviews conducted, the main themes that explained this heterogenous performance across facilities and wards included differences in the built environment, resource availability, leadership and the degree to which local managers used innovative approaches to cope with shortages. Conclusion Significant differences and challenges exist in the state of WASH within and across hospitals. Whereas the senior hospital management can make some improvements, input and support from the national and regional governments are essential to improve WASH as a basic foundation for averting nosocomial infections and the spread of AMR as part of safe, quality hospital care in Kenya."

Anemia has an adverse effect on treatment outcome and it decreases the quality of life among adult HIV patients. This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among adult HIV positive patients in Wolaita Sodo University Teaching Referral Hospital. Method Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching Referral Hospital from 01 October to December 30, 2016. A randomly selected 411 adult people living with the human immunodeficiency virus were included in the study. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables with P-value ≤0.25 in the bivariable logistic regression model were taken into multivariable logistic regression analysis along with 95% confidence interval and Odds Ratio was used to examine the association between anemia and independent variables. P˗value ≤ 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Result Prevalence of anemia in this study was 36.5% with 95% CI (32%-41%). Factors associated with anemia among adult people living with HIV/AIDS were individuals who lived with HIV ≥9years (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI:-1.03–6.59),years lived with HIV 5–8 years (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI:-1.02–6.57),CD4 count <200cells/ul (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI:-2.03–8.67), CD4 count200-350cells/ul(AOR = 1.82,95%CI:-1.01–3.26),infection with intestinal parasites (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI:-1.06–3.95), Participants with BMI <18.5kg/m2 (AOR = 2.96, 95%CI:-1.37–6.390),BMI 18.5-25kg/m2(AOR = 1.98, 95%CI:-1.11–3.56) and being HAART naïve (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI:- 1.16–4.28). Conclusion Prevalence of anemia among this study participant was high. This may affect the treatment outcome, increases morbidity and mortality of the participants. So periodic screening of anemia, a routine checkup of nutritional status, CD4 count and examination for intestinal parasite are essential."
https://openalex.org/W2980213317,"DNA methylation through the activity of cytosine-5-methyltransferases (C5-MTases) and DNA demethylases plays important roles in genome protection as well as in regulating gene expression during plant development and plant response to environmental stresses. In this study, we report on a genome-wide identification of six C5-MTases (SmelMET1, SmelCMT2, SmelCMT3a, SmelCMT3b, SmelDRM2, SmelDRM3) and five demethylases (SmelDemethylase_1, SmelDemethylase_2, SmelDemethylase_3, SmelDemethylase_4, SmelDemethylase_5) in eggplant. Gene structural characteristics, chromosomal localization and phylogenetic analyses are also described. The transcript profiling of both C5-MTases and demethylases was assessed at three stages of fruit development in three eggplant commercial F1 hybrids: i.e. 'Clara', 'Nite Lady' and 'Bella Roma', representative of the eggplant berry phenotypic variation. The trend of activation of C5-MTases and demethylase genes varied in function of the stage of fruit development and was genotype dependent. The transcription pattern of C5MTAses and demethylases was also assessed in leaves of the F1 hybrid 'Nite Lady' subjected to salt and drought stresses. A marked up-regulation and down-regulation of some C5-MTases and demethylases was detected, while others did not vary in their expression profile. Our results suggest a role for both C5-MTases and demethylases during fruit development, as well as in response to abiotic stresses in eggplant, and provide a starting framework for supporting future epigenetic studies in the species."
https://openalex.org/W2980183718,"Food intake may limit the ability of browsing mammals to gain body mass during the growing season when the leaves and stems of woody plants are most abundant. Moose are highly productive browsers with high demands for energy and nutrients, particularly during lactation. Using an indigestible marker, we estimated dry matter intake of free ranging adult female moose with and without calves over three growing seasons. During the same period, we analyzed forage quality. Intakes were highest in late spring (280 ± 19 g·kg-0.75·d-1) when forage quality peaked; however, intakes declined by 39% throughout the summer as temperatures increased and as acid detergent fiber content of browse increased. Digestibility of dry matter declined over summer from 71% to 57% among browse. Intakes were similar for moose with and without calves. Heat loads may impair the ability of moose to consume sufficient energy and nutrients. Warming and habitat change can adversely affect browser populations when poor forage qualities and low dry matter intakes combine to suppress digestible intakes of energy and nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2979787518,"Cultivated watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is one of the most important food crops in the Cucurbitaceae family. Diversification after domestication has led cultivated watermelons to exhibit diverse fruit flesh colors, including red, yellow, and orange. Recently, there has been increased interest in red-fleshed watermelons because they contain the antioxidant cis-isomeric lycopene. We performed whole genome resequencing (WGRS) of 24 watermelons with different flesh colors to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to high lycopene content. The resequencing data revealed 203,894-279,412 SNPs from read mapping between inbred lines and the 97103 reference genome. In total, 295,065 filtered SNPs were identified, which had an average polymorphism information content of 0.297. Most of these SNPs were intergenic (90.1%) and possessed a transversion (Tv) rate of 31.64%. Overall, 2,369 SNPs were chosen at 0.5 Mb physical intervals to analyze genetic diversity across the 24 inbred lines. A neighbor-joining dendrogram and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) based on the 2,369 SNPs revealed that the 24 inbred lines could be grouped into high and low lycopene-type watermelons. In addition, we analyzed SNPs that could discriminate high lycopene content, red-fleshed watermelon from low lycopene, yellow or orange watermelon inbred lines. For validation, 19 SNPs (designated as WMHL1-19) were chosen randomly, and cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were designed. Genotyping of the above 24 lines and 12 additional commercial cultivars using WMHL1-19 CAPS markers resulted in match rates of over 0.92 for most validated markers in correlation with the flesh color phenotypes. Our results provide valuable genomic information regarding the high lycopene content phenotype of red-fleshed cultivated watermelons, and the identified SNPs will be useful for the development of molecular markers in the marker-assisted breeding of watermelons with high lycopene content."
https://openalex.org/W2980016365,"Notch signaling plays a complex role in carcinogenesis, and its signaling pathway has both tumor suppressor and oncogenic components. To identify regulators that might control this dual activity of NOTCH1, we screened a chemical library targeting kinases and identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as one of the kinases involved in arsenite-induced NOTCH1 down-modulation. As PLK1 activity drives mitotic entry but also is inhibited after DNA damage, we investigated the PLK1-NOTCH1 interplay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. Here, we found that PLK1 regulates NOTCH1 expression at G2/M transition. However, when cells in G2 phase are challenged with DNA damage, PLK1 is inhibited to prevent entry into mitosis. Interestingly, we found that the interaction between NOTCH1 and PLK1 is functionally important during the DNA damage response, as we found that whereas PLK1 activity is inhibited, NOTCH1 expression is maintained during DNA damage response. During genotoxic stress, cellular transformation requires that promitotic activity must override DNA damage checkpoint signaling to drive proliferation. Interestingly, we found that arsenite-induced genotoxic stress causes a PLK1-dependent signaling response that antagonizes the involvement of NOTCH1 in the DNA damage checkpoint. Taken together, our data provide evidence that Notch signaling is altered but not abolished in SCC cells. Thus, it is also important to recognize that Notch plasticity might be modulated and could represent a key determinant to switch on/off either the oncogenic or tumor suppressor function of Notch signaling in a single type of tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2979954049,"Since 2004, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has played a large role in Uganda's HIV/AIDS response. To better target resources to high burden regions and facilities, PEPFAR planned to withdraw from 29% of previously-supported health facilities in Uganda between 2015 and 2017.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 226 PEPFAR-supported health facilities in Uganda in mid-2017. The survey gathered information on availability, perceived quality, and access to HIV services before and after transition. We compare responses for facilities transitioned to those maintained on PEPFAR, accounting for survey design. We also extracted data from DHIS2 for the period October 2013-December 2017 on the number of HIV tests and counseling (HTC), number of patients on antiretroviral therapy (Current on ART), and retention on first-line ART (Retention) at 12 months. Using mixed effect models, we compare trends in service volume around the transition period.There were 206 facilities that reported transition and 20 that reported maintenance on PEPFAR. Some facilities reporting transition may have been in a gap between implementing partners. The median transition date was September 2016, nine months prior to the survey. Transition facilities were more likely to discontinue HIV outreach following transition (51.6% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001) and to report declines in HIV care access (43.5% vs. 3.1%, p<0.001) and quality (35.6% vs. 0%, p<0.001). However, transition facilities did not differ in their trends in HIV service volume relative to maintenance facilities.Transition from PEPFAR resulted in facilities reporting worsening patient access and service quality for HIV care, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest negative impacts on volume of HIV services. Facility respondents' perceptions about access and quality may be overly pessimistic, or they may signal forthcoming impacts. Unrelated to transition, declining retention on ART in Uganda is a cause for concern."
https://openalex.org/W2979573298,"Background Unsafe abortion contributes to maternal morbidities, mortalities as well as social and financial costs to women, families, and the health system. This study aimed to examine the factors associated with unsafe abortion practices in Nepal. Methods Data were derived from the 2011 and 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). A total of 911 women aged 15–49 years who aborted five years prior to surveys were included in the analysis. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to determine factors associated with unsafe abortion. Results Unsafe abortion rate was seven per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. This research found that women living in the Mountains (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.36; 95% CI 1.21, 4.60), or those who were urban residents (aOR 2.11; 95% CI 1.37, 3.24) were more likely to have unsafe abortion. The odds of unsafe abortion were higher amongst women of poor households (aOR 2.16; 95% CI 1.18, 3.94); Dalit women (aOR 1.89; 95% CI 1.02, 3.52), husband with no education background (aOR 2.12; 95%CI 1.06, 4.22), or women who reported agriculture occupation (aOR 1.82; 95% CI 1.16, 2.86) compared to their reference’s group. Regardless of knowledge on legal conditions of abortion, the probability of having unsafe abortion was significantly higher (aOR 5.13; 95% CI 2.64, 9.98) amongst women who did not know the location of safe abortion sites. Finally, women who wanted to delay or space childbirth (aOR 2.71; 95% CI 1.39, 5.28) or those who reported unwanted birth (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI 1.19, 4.56) were at higher risk of unsafe abortion. Conclusion Going forward, increasing the availability of safe abortion facilities and strengthening family planning services can help reduce unsafe abortion in Nepal. These programmatic efforts should be targeted to women of poor households, disadvantaged ethnicities, and those who reside in mountainous region."

The identification of factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) are important to increase the prevalence of EBF. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of EBF within the first six months and its associated factors in Kaiyuan, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kaiyuan, a middle-sized city of Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Mothers of infants under twelve months were randomly selected for a face to face interview in four towns (two in urban areas and two in rural areas) in Kaiyuan. A structured questionnaire was applied for collection of sociodemographic information, mothers’ and infants’ health, and breastfeeding information. A 24-hour food recall survey was used to collect infant feeding information. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants up to six months of age. The number of 417 mothers with infants under six months was interviewed. The prevalence of EBF at six months was 27.34%. Logistic regression indicated that EBF within six months was more likely to be practiced by mothers who had higher average household income per year (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.05–4.17 p = 0.037; OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04–3.28 p = 0.037), and mothers who received breastfeeding information (OR = 2.46, (95%CI: 1.45–4.18, p = 0.0009). The prevalence of EBF in Kaiyuan, Southwest China is considerably lower than national and international recommendations. Yearly household income, and mothers who received breastfeeding information are associated with higher EBF prevalence. Breastfeeding information should be given to mothers in order to increase the prevalence of EBF."
https://openalex.org/W2980144577,"Prior research has found that places and people that are more economically disadvantaged have higher rates and risks, respectively, of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Economic disadvantages at the level of places and people, however, are themselves influenced by economic policies. To enhance the policy relevance of STI research, we explore, for the first time, the relationship between state-level minimum wage policies and STI rates among women in a cohort of 66 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US spanning 2003–2015. Our annual state-level minimum wage measure was adjusted for inflation and cost of living. STI outcomes (rates of primary and secondary syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia per 100,000 women) were obtained from the CDC. We used multivariable hierarchical linear models to test the hypothesis that higher minimum wages would be associated with lower STI rates. We preliminarily explored possible socioeconomic mediators of the minimum wage/STI relationship (e.g., MSA-level rates of poverty, employment, and incarceration). We found that a $1 increase in the price-adjusted minimum wage over time was associated with a 19.7% decrease in syphilis rates among women and with an 8.5% drop in gonorrhea rates among women. The association between minimum wage and chlamydia rates did not meet our cutpoint for substantive significance. Preliminary mediation analyses suggest that MSA-level employment among women may mediate the relationship between minimum wage and gonorrhea. Consistent with an emerging body of research on minimum wage and health, our findings suggest that increasing the minimum wage may have a protective effect on STI rates among women. If other studies support this finding, public health strategies to reduce STIs among women should include advocating for a higher minimum wage."

The objective of this study was to compare rhizospheric microbial communities of A. sativa plants treated with a GBH relative to the mechanical suppression (mowing) in order to assess their differences and the potential implications for soil processes. Samples were obtained at 4, 10, 17 and 26 days post-suppression. Soil catabolic profiling and DNA-based methods were applied. At 26 days, higher respiration responses and functional diversity indices (Shannon index and catabolic evenness) were observed under glyphosate suppression and a neat separation of catabolic profiles was detected in multivariate analysis. Sarcosine and Tween 20 showed the highest contribution to this separation. Metabarcoding revealed a non-significant effect of suppression method on either alpha-diversity metrics or beta-diversity. Conversely, differences were detected in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Mesorhizobium sequences were detected in higher relative abundance in glyphosate-treated plants at the end of the experiment while the opposite trend was observed for Gaiella. Quantitative PCR of amoA gene from ammonia-oxidizing archaea showed a lower abundance under GBH suppression again at 26 days, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria remained lower at all sampling times. Broad host range plasmids IncP-1β and IncP-1ε were exclusively detected in the rhizosphere of glyphosate-treated plants at 10 days and at 26 days, respectively. Overall, our study demonstrates differential effects of suppression methods on the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, on the physiology and mobile genetic elements of microbial communities while no differences were detected in taxonomic diversity."

The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of ozenoxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined in quinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains including methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with different profile of mutation in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR). The MPC value of OZN for the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain susceptible to quinolones, without mutations in QRDR, was 0.05 mg/L, being 280-fold lower than that observed with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. In methicillin-susceptible and–resistant S. aureus strains with mutations in the gyrA or/and grlA genes the MPC of OZN went from 0.1 to 6 mg/L, whereas the MPC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was > 50 mg/L for the same strains. For methicillin-susceptible and–resistant S. epidermidis the results were similar to those abovementioned for S. aureus. According to our results, the MPC of OZN was far below the quantity of ozenoxacin achieved in the epidermal layer, suggesting that the in vivo selection of mutants, if it occurs, will take place at low frequency. Ozenoxacin is an excellent candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible and quinolone-resistant staphylococci isolated usually from skin infections."
https://openalex.org/W2980253192,"Mouse models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy recapitulate aspects of human epilepsy, which is characterized by neuronal network remodeling in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Observational studies suggest that this remodeling is associated with altered Wnt pathway signaling, although this has not been experimentally examined. We used the well-characterized mouse intrahippocampal kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy to examine associations between hippocampal neurogenesis and altered Wnt signaling after seizure induction. Tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, and gene expression analysis was performed by RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from anatomically micro-dissected dentate gyri. Seizures increased neurogenesis and dendritic arborization of newborn hippocampal dentate granule cells in peri-ictal regions, and decreased neurogenesis in the ictal zone, 2-weeks after kainate injection. Interestingly, administration of the novel canonical Wnt pathway inhibitor XAV939 daily for 2-weeks after kainate injection further increased dendritic arborization in peri-ictal regions after seizure, without an effect on baseline neurogenesis in control animals. Transcriptome analysis of dentate gyri demonstrated significant canonical Wnt gene dysregulation in kainate-injected mice across all regions for Wnt3, 5a and 9a. Intriguingly, certain Wnt genes demonstrated differential patterns of dysregulation between the ictal and peri-ictal zones, most notably Wnt5B, 7B and DKK-1. Together, these results demonstrate regional variation in Wnt pathway dysregulation early after seizure induction, and surprisingly, suggest that some Wnt-mediated effects might actually temper aberrant neurogenesis after seizures. The Wnt pathway may therefore provide suitable targets for novel therapies that prevent network remodeling and the development of epileptic foci in high-risk patients."

We used a Decision Tree Analysis using SPSS 23.0 program to explore predictors of suicide thoughts for 12,015 Korean adults aged 19-98 years. As a result, the most powerful predictor of suicidal ideation was the level of depression. Of people who suspected depression (CESD-11>16), 32.6% experienced suicidal ideation, which is 12 times higher than that of total subjects. The group with the highest rate of suicidal ideation was people who experienced financial difficulties in depression-suspected group and the rate of suicidal thoughts in this group was 56.7%, which was the highest rate. However, in the non-depressive group, the satisfaction of family relationship was the strongest predictor of suicidal ideation. In the non-depressive group, the rate of suicidal thoughts of people with high level of family relationship satisfaction and high level of health satisfaction was 0.6%, which was the lowest rate. The contribution of this study was that it provided the combination of variables to predict the risk groups of adult suicide. This study suggests that researchers and clinicians should consider comprehensively depressive symptoms, family relationships, economic difficulties, and health status to prevent the suicide of adults."
https://openalex.org/W2980253307,"Introduction Cervical cancer imposes a substantial health burden worldwide including in Australia and is caused by persistent infection with one of 13 sexually transmitted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding a nonavalent new Gardasil-9® (9vHPV) vaccine to the national immunisation schedule in Australia across three different delivery strategies. Materials and methods The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV vaccine introduction to prevent HPV infection. Academic literature and anecdotal evidence were included on the demographic variables, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, treatment costs, and vaccine delivery costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Analyses and data from international agencies were used in scenario analysis from the health system and societal perspectives. Results The 9vHPV vaccination was estimated to prevent 113 new cases of cervical cancer (discounted) during a 20-year period. From the health system and societal perspectives, the 9vHPV vaccination was very cost-effective in comparison with the status quo, with an ICER of A$47,008 and A$44,678 per DALY averted, respectively, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold level. Considering delivery strategies, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$47,605, A$46,682, and A$46,738 for school, health facilities, and outreach-based vaccination programs from the health system perspective, wherein, from the societal perspective, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$46,378, A$43,729, A$43,930, respectively. All estimates of ICERs fell below the threshold level (A$73,267). Conclusions This cost-effectiveness evaluation suggests that the routine two-dose 9vHPV vaccination strategy of preadolescent girls against HPV is very cost-effective in Australia from both the health system and societal perspectives. If equally priced, the 9vHPV option is the most economically viable vaccine. Overall, this analysis seeks to contribute to an evidence-based recommendation about the new 9vHPV vaccination in the national immunisation program in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2979685200,"Although there is good evidence to indicate a major role of intrinsic impairment of the contractile apparatus in muscle weakness seen in several pathophysiological conditions, the factors responsible for control of myofibrillar function are not fully understood. To investigate the role of mechanical load in myofibrillar function, we compared the skinned fiber force between denervated (DEN) and dexamethasone-treated (DEX) rat skeletal muscles with or without neuromuscular electrical stimulation (ES) training. DEN and DEX were induced by cutting the sciatic nerve and daily injection of dexamethasone (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, respectively. For ES training, plantarflexor muscles were electrically stimulated to produce four sets of five isometric contractions each day. In situ maximum torque was markedly depressed in the DEN muscles compared to the DEX muscles (-74% vs. -10%), whereas there was not much difference in the degree of atrophy in gastrocnemius muscles between DEN and DEX groups (-24% vs. -17%). Similar results were obtained in the skinned fiber preparation, with a greater reduction in maximum Ca2+-activated force in the DEN than in the DEX group (-53% vs. -16%). Moreover, there was a parallel decline in myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and actin content per muscle volume in DEN muscles, but not in DEX muscles, which was associated with upregulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and endothelial NOS expression, translocation of nNOS from the membrane to the cytosol, and augmentation of mRNA levels of muscle RING finger protein 1 (MuRF-1) and atrogin-1. Importantly, mechanical load evoked by ES protects against DEN- and DEX-induced myofibrillar dysfunction and these molecular alterations. Our findings provide novel insights regarding the difference in intrinsic contractile properties between DEN and DEX and suggest an important role of mechanical load in preserving myofibrillar function in skeletal muscle."

Aberrant expression of PRR14 is associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of lung cancer. However, its involvement in colon cancer remains unknown. Herein, we report the role of PRR14 in colon cancer.Colon cancer tissue microarray was used to analyze and compare the expression of PRR14 among some clinicopathological characteristics of colon cancer. HCT116 and RKO cells were transfected with siRNA to downregulate PRR14 expression. The roles of PRR14 in proliferation, migration and invasion of the cell lines were determined using cell counting kit-8, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assays respectively. The expression of PRR14 was measured using immunofluorescence, qRT- PCR and western blot. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined by western blot.PRR14 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and the expression level was correlated with tumor size, distant metastasis and Tumor Node Metastasis stages. Functional study revealed that downregulation of PRR14 inhibited colon cancer cells growth, migration and invasion. Furthermore, knockdown of PRR14 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, cell cycle-associated proteins expression and p-AKT level.PRR14 may promote the progression and metastasis of colon cancer, and may be a novel prognostic and therapeutic marker for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2980270807,"Hypoxia and angiogenesis are critical components in the progression of solid cancer, including gastric cancers (GCs). miR-382 has been identified as a hypoxia-induced miR (hypoxamiR), but the clinical significance in GCs has not been identified yet. To explore the clinical and prognostic importance of miR-382 in GCs, the surgical specimens of 398 patients with GCs in KNU hospital in Korea, the total of 183 patients was randomly selected using simple sampling methods and big data with 446 GCs and 45 normal tissues from the data portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) were analysed. Expression of miR-382 as well as miR-210, as a positive control hypoxamiR by qRT-PCR in histologically malignant region of GCs showed significantly positive correlation (R = 0.516, p<0.001). High miR-210 and miR-382 expression was significantly correlated with unfavorable prognosis including advanced GCs (AGC), higher T category, N category, pathologic TNM stage, lymphovascular invasion, venous invasion, and perinueral invasion, respectively (all p<0.05). In univariate analysis, high miR-210 expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.036) but not high miR-382. In paired 60 gastric normal and cancer tissues, miR-382 expression in cancer tissues was significantly higher than normal counterpart (p = 0.003), but not miR-210 expression. However, by increasing the patient number from the big data analysis, miR-210 as well as miR-382 expression in tumor tissues was significantly higher than the normal tissues. Our results suggest that miR-382, as novel hypoxamiR, can be a prognostic marker for advanced GCs and might be correlated with metastatic potential. miR-382 might play important roles in the aggressiveness, progression and prognosis of GCs. In addition, miR-382 give a predictive marker for progression of GCs compared to the normal or preneoplastic lesion."

However, cardiorespiratory factors related to the increase in [Formula: see text] during exercise in these individuals have not been examined using multivariate analysis. This study aimed to identify cardiorespiratory factors related to the increase in [Formula: see text] during a graded exercise in terms of respiratory function, cardiac function, and the ability of skeletal muscles to extract oxygen.Eighteen individuals with stroke (aged 60.1 ± 9.4 years, 67.1 ± 30.8 days poststroke) underwent a graded exercise test for the assessment of cardiorespiratory response to exercise. The increases in [Formula: see text] from rest to first threshold and that from rest to peak exercise were measured as a dependent variable. The increases in respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and arterial-venous oxygen difference from rest to first threshold and those from rest to peak exercise were measured as the independent variables.From rest to first threshold, the increases in arterial-venous oxygen difference (β = 0.711) and cardiac output (β = 0.572) were significant independent variables for the increase in [Formula: see text] (adjusted R2 = 0.877 p < 0.001). Similarly, from rest to peak exercise, the increases in arterial-venous oxygen difference (β = 0.665) and cardiac output (β = 0.636) were significant factors related to the increase in [Formula: see text] (adjusted R2 = 0.923, p < 0.001).Our results suggest that the ability of skeletal muscle to extract oxygen is a major cardiorespiratory factor related to the increase in [Formula: see text] during exercise testing in individuals with stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2979384553,"The physical simultaneity between two events can differ from our point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). Studies using simultaneity judgments (SJ) and temporal order judgments (TOJ) tasks have shown that whether two events are reported as simultaneous is highly context-dependent. It has been recently suggested that the interval between the two events in the previous trial can modulate judgments both in SJ and TOJ tasks, an effect named rapid recalibration. In this work, we investigated rapid recalibration in SJ and TOJ tasks and tested whether centering the range of presented intervals on perceived simultaneity modulated this effect. We found a rapid recalibration effect in TOJ, but not in SJ. Moreover, we found that centering the intervals on objective or subjective simultaneity did not change the pattern of results. Interestingly, we also found no correlations between an individual’s PSS in TOJ and in SJ tasks, which corroborates other studies in suggesting that these two psychophysical measures may capture different processes."
https://openalex.org/W2979568137,"Background Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. Approximately 30% of patients experience orthostatic headaches. Orthostatic headaches also are a hallmark symptom in spontaneous intracranial hypotension. While the cause of orthostatic headaches in spontaneous intracranial hypotension can be linked to the cerebrospinal fluid loss at the spinal level and consecutively reduced intracranial pressure in the upright position, the cause of orthostatic headaches in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome still remains unknown. The present study examined orthostatic changes of intracranial pressure using dynamic ultrasound of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath diameter in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, spontaneous intracranial hypotension and healthy subjects. Methods Data was obtained from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome patients with (n = 7) and without orthostatic headaches (n = 7), spontaneous intracranial hypotension patients (n = 5) and healthy subjects (n = 8). All participants underwent high-resolution transorbital ultrasound in the supine and upright position to assess optic nerve and optic nerve sheath diameter. Results Group differences were found in percentage deviations when changing position of optic nerve sheath diameter (p < 0.01), but not regarding the optic nerve diameter. Pairwise comparisons indicated differences in optic nerve sheath diameter only between spontaneous intracranial hypotension and the other groups. No differences were found between postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome patients with and without orthostatic headaches. Conclusion This study shows that the size of the optic nerve sheath diameter dynamically decreases during orthostatic stress in spontaneous intracranial hypotension, but not in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with or without orthostatic headaches, which indicates different underlying causes."
https://openalex.org/W2979435383,"Calibration of the molecular rate is one of the major challenges in marine population genetics. Although the use of an appropriate evolutionary rate is crucial in exploring population histories, calibration of the rate is always difficult because fossil records and geological events are rarely applicable for rate calibration. The acceleration of the evolutionary rate for recent coalescent events (or more simply, the time dependency of the molecular clock) is also a problem that can lead to overestimation of population parameters. Calibration of demographic transition (CDT) is a rate calibration technique that assumes a post-glacial demographic expansion, representing one of the most promising approaches for dealing with these potential problems in the rate calibration. Here, we demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate evolutionary rate, and the power of CDT, by using populations of the sandy beach amphipod Haustorioides japonicus along the Japanese coast of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Analysis of mitochondrial sequences found that the most peripheral population in the Pacific coast of northeastern Honshu Island (Tohoku region) is genetically distinct from the other northwestern Pacific populations. By using the two-epoch demographic model and rate of temperature change, the evolutionary rate was modeled as a log-normal distribution with a median rate of 2.2%/My. The split-time of the Tohoku population was subsequently estimated to be during the previous interglacial period by using the rate distribution, which enables us to infer potential causes of the divergence between local populations along the continuous Pacific coast of Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2979721239,"How various types of focus differ with respect to exhaustivity has been a topic of enduring interest in language studies. However, most of the theoretical work explicating such associations has done so cross-linguistically, and little research has been done on how people process and respond to them during language comprehension. This study therefore investigates the associations between the concept of exhaustivity and three focus types in Chinese (wh, cleft, and only foci) using a trichotomous-response design in two experiments: a forced-choice judgment and a self-paced reading experiment, both with adult native speakers. Its results show that, whether engaged in conscious decision-making or an implicit comprehension process, the participants distinguished only-focus and cleft-focus from wh-focus clearly, and also that there are specific differences between only-focus and cleft-focus in conscious decision-making. This implies that, in terms of the relationship between exhaustivity and the focus types under investigation, cleft-focus and only-focus behave very similarly during language comprehension despite the existence of some fine distinctions between them. In other words, the potential linguistic levels that exhaustivity encodes in Chinese cleft-focus render it more similar to only-focus than to wh-focus. These results are broadly in line with the semantic account that distinguishes cleft from only-focus, i.e., that cleft encodes exhaustivity in not-at-issue presupposition and only-focus encodes exhaustivity in at-issue assertion, while both express semantically encoded exhaustivity, triggering robust language-processing patterns that differ from patterns of wh-focus in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2980041134,"The N-type Ca2+ channel (Cav2.2) is distributed in sympathetic nerves that innervate the tubules, the vessels, and the juxtaglomerular granular cells of the kidney. However, the role of N-type Ca2+ channels in renal disease remains unknown. To address this issue, Cav2.2 knockout mice were utilized. Immunoreactive Cav2.2 was undetectable in normal kidneys of C57BL/6N mice, but it became positive in the interstitial S100-positive nerve fibers after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). There were no significant differences in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function between wild-type littermates and Cav2.2-knockout mice at baseline, as well as after UUO. Cav2.2 deficiency significantly reduced the EVG-positive fibrotic area, alpha-SMA expression, the production of type I collagen, and the hypoxic area in the obstructed kidneys. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for sympathetic neurons, was significantly increased in the obstructed kidneys of wild-type mice, but not in Cav2.2-knockout mice. These data suggest that increased Cav2.2 is implicated in renal nerve activation leading to the progression of renal fibrosis. Blockade of Cav2.2 might be a novel therapeutic approach for preventing renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2979767103,"Network coupled cells, such as astrocytes, regulate their cellular homeostasis via Ca2+ signals spread between the cells through gap junctions. Intracellular Ca2+ release is controlled by different signaling pathways that can be stimulated by ATP, glutamate and serotonin (5-HT). Based on our findings, all these pathways are influenced by inflammatory agents and must be restored to fully recover the Ca2+ signaling network. An ultralow concentration of the local anesthetic agent bupivacaine reduced 5-HT-evoked intracellular Ca2+ release, and an ultralow concentration of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil in combination with vitamin D3 reduced ATP-evoked intracellular Ca2+ release. Combinations of these three substances downregulated 5-HT-, glutamate- and ATP-evoked intracellular Ca2+ release to a more normal Ca2+ signaling state. Furthermore, inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 expression decreased with a combination of these three substances. Substance P receptor neurokinin (NK)-1 expression was reduced by ultralow concentrations of bupivacaine. Here, bupivacaine and sildenafil (at extremely low concentrations) combined with vitamin D3 have potential anti-inflammatory properties. According to the present study, drug combinations at the right concentrations, especially extremely low concentrations of bupivacaine and sildenafil, affect different cellular biochemical mechanisms and represent a potential solution for downregulating inflammatory parameters, thereby restoring cells or networks to normal physiological homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2980218728,"Nigeria has a plural legal system in which various sources of law govern simultaneously. Inconsistent and conflicting legal frameworks can reinforce pre-existing health disparities in sexual and reproductive health (SRH). While previous studies indicate poor SRH outcomes for Nigerian women and girls, particularly in Northern states, the relationship between customary and religious law (CRL) and SRH has not been explored. We conducted a state-level ecological study to examine the relationship between CRL and SRH outcomes among women in 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja (n = 37), using publicly available Demographic and Health Survey data from 2013. Indicators were guided by published research and included contraception use among married women, total fertility rate, median age at first birth, receipt of antenatal care, delivery location, and comprehensive knowledge of HIV. To account for economic differences between states, crude linear regression models were compared to a multivariable model, adjusting for per capita GDP. All SRH outcomes, except comprehensive knowledge of HIV, were statistically significantly more negative in CRL states compared to non-CRL states, even after accounting for state-level GDP. In CRL states in 2013, compared to non-CRL states, the proportion of married women who used any method of contraception was 22.7 percentage points lower ([95% CI: -15.78 --29.64], p<0.001), a difference that persisted in a model adjusting for per capita GDP (b[adj] = -16.15, 95% CI: [-8.64 --23.66], p<0.001.). While this analysis of retrospective state-level data found robust associations between CRL and poor SRH outcomes, future research should incorporate prospective individual-level data to further elucidate these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2979299324,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a morbid disease with poor prognosis and treatment that typically leaves patients with permanent damage to critical functions such as eating and talking. Currently only three targeted therapies are FDA approved for use in HNSCC, two of which are recently approved immunotherapies. In this work, we identify biological pathways involved with this disease that could potentially be targeted by current FDA approved cancer drugs and thereby expand the pool of potential therapies for use in HNSCC treatment. We analyzed 508 HNSCC patients with sequencing information from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) database and assessed which biological pathways were significantly enriched for somatic mutations or copy number alterations. We then further classified pathways as either “light” or “dark” to the current reach of FDA-approved cancer drugs using the Cancer Targetome, a compendium of drug-target information. Light pathways are statistically enriched with somatic mutations (or copy number alterations) and contain one or more targets of current FDA-approved cancer drugs, while dark pathways are enriched with somatic mutations (or copy number alterations) but not currently targeted by FDA-approved cancer drugs. Our analyses indicated that approximately 35–38% of disease-specific pathways are in scope for repurposing of current cancer drugs. We further assess light and dark pathways for subgroups of patient tumor samples according to HPV status. The framework of light and dark pathways for HNSCC-enriched biological pathways allows us to better prioritize targeted therapies for further research in HNSCC based on the HNSCC genetic landscape and FDA-approved cancer drug information. We also highlight the importance in the identification of sub-pathways where targeting and cross targeting of other pathways may be most beneficial to predict positive or negative synergy with potential clinical significance. This framework is ideal for precision drug panel development, as well as identification of highly aberrant, untargeted candidates for future drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2979893594,"Purpose To investigate the changes in the demographic, clinical, and biometric characteristics of APAC patients in South Korea during the last decade. Methods Medical records of patients with APAC who visit the emergency department or the glaucoma clinic of Chonnam National University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Gwangju, South Korea in 2007 and 2017 were analyzed. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment modality were compared between the APAC patients in 2007 and 2017. Results The number of patients with APAC increased from 54 in 2007 to 68 in 2017. Female patients in their 60s were most common in both groups and there was no significant difference in IOP, cataract grade, gonioscopic grading, PAS, or optic nerve damage between the two groups at baseline visit (all P > 0.05). However, APAC eyes in 2017 had a shallower ACD (1.74 ± 0.28 mm vs 1.87 ± 0.35 mm; P = 0.024) and greater LV (1.05 ± 0.26 mm vs 0.93 ± 0.19 mm; P = 0.001) than those of APAC eyes in 2007. During one year follow-up, 25 patients (51.02%) received LPI only, and 18 patients (36.73%) required LE, and 6 patients (12.24%) required phacotrabeculectomy or sequential LE and trabeculectomy. However, in 2017, LPI alone was sufficient in 23 patients (38.33%), 29 patients (48.33%) required further LE, and 8 patients (13.33%) required phacotrabeculectomy or sequential LE and trabeculectomy for the treatment of APAC (P = 0.015). Conclusions Compared to older cases of APAC, recent cases received LE more frequently, which suggests an increasing trend of LE as a treatment option for APAC. In addition, recent cases had a greater LV and shallower ACD than older cases and these biometric differences may be one of the reasons for increasing rate of LE in this study."

Chemical engineering (ChE) and electrical engineering (EE) are exemplars of relatively high and low gender diversity, respectively. Here, we investigate departmental, institutional, and regional factors associated with gender diversity among BS graduates within the US, 2010-2016. For both fields, gender diversity was significantly higher at private institutions (p < 1x10-6) and at historically black institutions (p < 1x10-5). No significant association was observed with gender diversity among tenure-track faculty, PhD-granting status, and variations in departmental name beyond the standard ""chemical engineering"" or ""electrical engineering"". Gender diversity among EE graduates was significantly decreased (p = 8x10-5) when a distinct degree in computer engineering was available; no such association was observed between ChE gender diversity and the presence of biology-associated degrees. States with a highly gender diverse ChE workforce had a significantly higher degree of gender diversity among BS graduates (p = 3x10-5), but a significant association was not observed for EE. State variation in funding of support services for K-12 pupils significantly impacted gender diversity of graduates in both fields (p < 1x10-3), particularly in regards to instructional staff support (p < 5x10-4). Nationwide, gender diversity could not be concluded to be either significantly increasing or significantly decreasing for either field."
https://openalex.org/W2980220294,"As our capacity to collect and store health data is increasing, a new challenge of transforming data into meaningful information for disease monitoring and surveillance has arisen. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using livestock mortality and antibiotic consumption data as a proxy for detecting disease outbreaks at herd level. Changes in the monthly records of mortality and antibiotic consumption were monitored in Danish swine herds that became positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and porcine pleuropneumonia. Laboratory serological results were used to identify herds that changed from a negative to a positive status for the diseases. A dynamic linear model with a linear growth component was used to model the data. Alarms about state changes were raised based on forecast errors, changes in the growth component, and the values of the retrospectively smoothed values of the growth component. In all cases, the alarms were defined based on credible intervals and assessed prior and after herds got a positive disease status. The number of herds with alarms based on mortality increased by 3% in the 3 months prior to laboratory confirmation of PRRS-positive herds (Se = 0.47). A 22% rise in the number of weaner herds with alarms based on the consumption of antibiotics for respiratory diseases was found 1 month prior to these herds becoming PRRS-positive (Se = 0.22). For porcine pleuropneumonia-positive herds, a 10% increase in antibiotic consumption for respiratory diseases in sow herds was seen 1 month prior to a positive result (Se = 0.5). Monitoring changes in mortality data and antibiotic consumption showed changes at herd level prior to and in the same month as confirmation from diagnostic tests. These results also show a potential value for using these data streams as part of surveillance strategies."

To test whether similar responses are seen in a non-rodent model, we used hapten-specific CHS to measure the ear inflammation response of outbred pigs to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), oxazolone (OXA), or vehicle controls. We adapted mouse innate memory literature protocols to the domestic pig model. Animals were challenged up to 32 days post initial sensitization exposure to the hapten, and specific ear swelling responses to this challenge were significant for 7, 21, and 32 days post-sensitization. We established hapten-specific CHS memory exists in a non-rodent model. We also developed a successful protocol for demonstrating these CHS responses in a porcine system."
