https://openalex.org/W2029409704,Normal rats which refused 5-and 20-percent alcohol in a previous study were restricted to 5-percent and 20-percent solutions in their home cages for either 30 or 120 days. Differential preferences for alcohol solutions of up to 8-percent were established as a function of length of time animals consumed alcohol but not as a function of the particular concentration consumed prior to testing.
https://openalex.org/W2087921921,"ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL investigation has shown that the ampullæ of Lorenzini of elasmobranch fishes are sensitive both to slight changes of temperature1 and also to weak mechanical stimuli2. But neither sensory modality is convincing as the biologically adequate stimulus, for the temperature-sensitive regions are buried deep in the body (there being no apparent reason for the great anatomical development of the tube system), and the mechanical sensitivity is quantitatively less than that of the lateral line without being qualitatively very distinct."

https://openalex.org/W1992319895,An alga identified as Synechococcus lividus has an exponential growth rate of nine doublings per day at 52 degrees C with illumination of 1500 foot-candles. It uses nitrate or urea as a nitrogen source and does not use acetate or glucose. It seems a promising organism for atmospheric regeneration in sealed cabins.

https://openalex.org/W2043717046,"VITAMIN A and cholesterol esters have been shown to undergo extensive hydrolysis in the lumen of the small intestine during the process of absorption; they are re-esterified to appear in the lymph mostly as esters1,2. However, the vitamin A esters of the lymph, blood and liver of the rat are formed by long-chain fatty acids3 and in the normal rat liver, probably as palmitates4. On the other hand, cholesterol esters are usually made up of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the lymph and blood of rats5. For the absorption of the two lipid materials, the enzymes of the pancreas have been largely implicated, while not much attention has been paid to the possible role of the mucosal enzymes. From the behaviour of the mucosal enzymes, as presented here, it appears that probably these enzymes play a more important part in the re-esterification of the two lipid materials during their absorption."

https://openalex.org/W2069899938,"Mutants of phage T4D can be isolated which multiply in the presence of concentrations of acriflavine inhibitory to the growth of wild-type phage. Bacteria mixedly infected with resistant and sensitive phage are unproductive in the presence of acriflavine. Irradiation of the sensitive phage with ultraviolet light results in inactivation of the function of the gene for acriflavine sensitivity, permitting the mixedly infected complexes to yield phage. This function is inactivated in an exponential manner and has a cross section comparable to cross sections of other gene functions in T4D."

https://openalex.org/W2058161809,"INSECTICIDES are now extensively applied to agricultural soils, and if this practice continues there is the obvious possibility that such treatments may have harmful effects on the soil fauna. The chlorinated hydrocarbons are not readily broken down in soil1,2 and the general use of fertilizers containing aldrin could be one source of accumulations of this material in agricultural land. The applications of insecticide may control specific pests as desired, but could also suppress certain elements of the fauna, and even cause secondary increases of some soil animals by modifications in the predator pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2027836583,"Four kinds of radicals are identified in dry spores (Bacillus megaterium) after x-irradiation: those associated with singlet, doublet, triplet, and oxygen-complex types of spectra. The singlet, present only at low temperatures, gives rise irreversibly to the doublet at 25 degrees C. All hyperfine structure is depressed after annealment at 1000 degrees C and is lost when oxygen or nitric oxide is added. The physical results support the hypothesis that reactions of long-lived free radicals can account for the radiobiological phenomena of thermorestoration, nitric oxide protection, and latent oxygen effect."
https://openalex.org/W2028296137,"Single isolated phasic muscle fibers and small bundles of tonic fibers were directly stimulated in one-per-second twitch series by massive electrode shocks. During the stimulation period the isometric tension developed by the phasic fiber continuously decreased, first rapidly and then slowly. The tonic fibers behaved similarly, but showed much less fatigue than the phasic ones. In general, recovery of the fibers after cessation of stimulation also occurred in two phases."

https://openalex.org/W1979824671,"When the end of a freshly cut nerve is drawn into a tube by means of a hydraulic device that serves as a holder and as an electrode, monophasic positive records of action potentials are recorded. A trailing positive phase develops, with time, after the cut. After-potentials can also be recorded by this method."

https://openalex.org/W2025993389,The frequency of the Hp1 gene in Polish subjects is 0.36. This frequency is lower than that in Western European populations and higher than that in Asiatic populations. We suggest that the increase in frequency of this gene from East to West has a regular continuous character that may be attributed to a still-unclear genetic mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W2065818192,A histochemical method for demonstration of monoamine oxidase activity was found to be almost as sensitive as a biochemical method when used for revealing total inhibition of monoamine oxidase in rat tissues after administration of β-phenyl-isopropyl hydrazine. The histochemical method is of special value in the study of monoamine oxidase inhibition in the complex structures of the brain.

An acute toxicity study in mice indicates a certain tolerance of the extract. Tentative identification indicates that the fungus is a penicillium."
