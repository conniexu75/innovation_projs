https://openalex.org/W1591593175,"Abstract Preparations of α- and β-galactosidases and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of high specific activities have been prepared from a commercial enzyme source from Aspergillus niger. The enzymes were reasonably stable around their pH optima, which varied between 3.2 to 4.6. The Km and Vmax of the enzymes were determined by using appropriate p-nitrophenyl glycosides as substrates. The enzymes were highly specific for the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic linkage. The α-galactosidase hydrolyzed methyl-α-galactopyranoside, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose, and split 37 to 40% of the total terminal 1,6-α-linked galactose residues from galactomannans from guar and locust bean. The β-galactosidase hydrolyzed methyl-β-galactopyranoside and lactose, and split 70 to 80% of the nonreducing terminal galactose residues from sialic acid-free fetuin, α1-acid glycoprotein and and human chorionic gonadotropin. The β-N-acetylglucosaminidase liberated N-acetylglucosamine from chitin oligosaccharides containing 2 to 6 residues. The enzyme removed 30 to 35% N-acetylglucosamine residues from ovalbumin glycopeptides and from sialic acid-free galactosidase-treated fetuin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The sialic acid-free galactosidase-treated human chorionic gonadotropin lost 60% of its N-acetylglucosamine residues when treated with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1607910945,"Abstract Peptide mapping of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase following tryptic digestion gave one-quarter the number of ninhydrin-reactive peptides, arginine-containing peptides, and tryptophan-containing peptides expected from the amino acid composition. Sedimentation velocity studies and disc gel electrophoresis of the enzyme subunits formed in 4 m urea and having one-quarter of the initial molecular weight gave no indication of more than one species. These results indicate that pyruvate kinase contains four highly similar, although not necessarily identical, subunits. About 4 moles of acetate were liberated per mole of enzyme upon acid hydrolysis, and differential hydrazinolysis indicated that these are probably present in the protein as amino acetyl groups. No free amino-terminal residues could be detected. Whereas the 7.3 S species formed in 2 m urea and having one-half of the initial molecular weight retains catalytic activity, the 2.0 S species formed in 4 m urea is inactive. Conditions are described under which the subunits undergo reassociation to a form having the sedimentation constant (10.0 S) and most of the catalytic activity of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1517458746,"The concentration of enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis was considerably less in extracts prepared from human omental adipose tissue than from rat epididymal fat. Overall rates of synthesis as measured by the incorporation of radioactive precursors into fatty acids were also much lower in human adipose tissue. The most striking difference was found with citrate-1,5-14C, human adipose tissue incorporating the compound at a rate less than one-tenth that of rat epididymal fat. This finding was consistent with the virtual absence of the citrate cleavage enzyme in human adipose tissue. By contrast, the activities of pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two enzymes necessary for the synthesis of glyceride glycerol from pyruvate, and the long chain fatty acid activating enzyme (or enzymes) were essentially similar in both human and rat adipose tissues. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that synthesis de novo of fatty acids is not an important physiological function of human adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1524832496,"Abstract A transport system for cationic amino acids has been described for the rabbit reticulocyte. This system appears neither concentrative nor energy-dependent. At high levels, several neutral amino acids with large apolar side chains inhibit uptake by it; furthermore, the presence of external leucine accelerates lysine exodus from the cell. These effects do not, however, arise from an interaction between the new system and the dominant Na+-independent system by which these amino acids are transported, because 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a new specific substrate for the latter system, shows no inhibition of diamino acid uptake. Furthermore, lysine is devoid of inhibitory action on leucine uptake. Although the relations described above can be shown either in the presence or absence of Na+, the basic amino acids tested are taken up from 10 to 50% more rapidly when Na+ is present at about 0.14 m. Unequivocal evidence that the Na+-stimulated portion represents an independent system has not been obtained. In the presence of Na+, cysteine and homoserine inhibit a substantially larger portion than the Na+-stimulated portion of the uptake of diamino acids whereas no inhibition is seen in the absence of Na+. The result is that, on the addition of one of these two amino acids in excess, Na+ is changed from a stimulant to an inhibitor of diamino acid transport."

https://openalex.org/W1652854341,"Abstract The biosynthesis of the first glucuronic acid residue in the polysaccharide-protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate has been studied in a cell-free system from embryonic chick cartilage. Transfer of glucuronic acid from uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid occurred to the galactose moiety present at the nonreducing terminal of the disaccharide, 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose, or larger, similar fragments from the linkage region. By comparison, free d-galactose was practically inactive as a substrate. Mixed substrate experiments indicated that transfer of glucuronic acid to oligosaccharide acceptors containing N-acetylgalactosamine residues at their nonreducing ends proceeded equally well in the presence of 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose. Under similar conditions, substrates for the transfer of the first glucuronic acid residue, such as 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose and 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose, mutually impeded product formation. An analogous effect was observed for a tri- and a pentasaccharide from chondroitin 6-sulfate containing N-acetylgalactosamine moieties as acceptors for glucuronic acid. These findings suggest that the transfer of glucuronic acid to the neutral trisaccharide of the linkage region is mediated by an enzyme distinct from that involved in the formation of the remainder of the polysaccharide chain, or at least by an independent active site on the same enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1525400182,"Abstract The amino-terminal sequence of papaya lysozyme was determined by a modified Edman degradation procedure to be Gly-Ile-Ser-Lys-Ile. The carboxyl-terminal sequence was determined by carboxypeptidase A degradation to be Ser-Phe-Gly. The presence of carboxyl-terminal glycine was verified by hydrazinolysis. Papaya lysozyme was shown to release reducing groups concomitantly with the lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls, and the reducing group was found to be that of N-acetylmuramic acid, as previously shown for egg white lysozyme by other investigators. However, papaya lysozyme initially hydrolyzed more glycosidic bonds than egg white lysozyme for an equal amount of lysis. The enzyme exhibited only 10% of maximal activity at an ionic strength of 0.15 and was maximally active at an ionic strength of 0.05. Papaya lysozyme was stable from pH 1.8 to 10 at room temperature and remained active for 5 min up to 95° at pH 4.6. Whereas papaya lysozyme exhibited 200 to 400 times higher chitinase activity toward tetra-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine than egg white lysozyme, with whole chitin as substrate, it was only 10 times as active as the egg white enzyme. The papaya enzyme exhibited a sharp pH activity profile with M. lysodeikticus cells. The enzyme had maximal activity at pH 4.6 and was virtually inactive above pH 6.5. With whole chitin as substrate, the pH profile was broad with an optimum from pH 4.5 to 6.0. The enzyme was still partly active at pH 7.5. The lysis of esterified cell walls from M. lysodeikticus yielded the same pH rate profile as that obtained for chitin. Thus, the difference in the pH dependence of hydrolysis of chitin and cell walls appears to result from the presence of carboxyl groups in the latter substrate. The mechanism of attack upon the bacterial cell wall by egg white and papaya lysozymes is discussed. Papaya lysozyme was strongly inhibited by histamine and histidine. No evidence was obtained of the involvement of tryptophan residues in the substrate-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1578017789,"Abstract Previous studies had suggested that mannosyl-1-phosphosphoryl-undecaprenol was an intermediate in the transfer of mannosyl units from GDP-mannose to mannan. In this report Triton X-100 and EDTA were used as selective inhibitors of the enzymatic synthesis of mannan. As a result of these studies the hypothesis that mannosyl-1-phosphoryl-undecaprenol was an obligatory intermediate in mannan biosynthesis was confirmed. The distribution of radioactive mannosyl units in mannan prepared in vitro was analyzed with the techniques of exhaustive methylation, acetolysis, and enzymatic digestion. Exhaustive methylation revealed that only the nonreducing terminal positions had become labeled as a result of the enzymatic reaction. Mannan formed in vitro was degraded by acetolysis to primarily disaccharides and trisaccharides; in both types of oligosaccharides the radioactivity was concentrated in the nonreducing termini. Enzymatic digestion with α-mannosidases released a large proportion of the radioactivity present in mannan formed enzymatically and thereby confirmed the results of methylation and acetolysis. As a result of exhaustive methylation the mannan was found to contain 1 → 2, 1 → 3, and 1 → 6 mannosidic linkages and the extent of branching in the polysaccharide was low."

https://openalex.org/W1519013047,"Abstract Postmitochondrial supernatant fractions derived from livers of hypophysectomized rats were found to contain twice the level of total (active + latent) alkaline RNase found in similar preparations from normal animals. Polysomes isolated from both sources often had similar optical density profiles, and both supported amino acid incorporation in vitro to about the same extent. Occasionally, however, polysomes obtained from hypophysectomized rats were of a smaller size class distribution than preparations from normal animals, and these preparations exhibited a correspondingly decreased capacity to support cell-free protein synthesis. This breakdown of polysomes was associated with an increase in the active RNase content of the corresponding postmitochondrial supernatant fraction. It is suggested that the apparent translational defect, reported by others, of polysomes isolated from livers of hypophysectomized rats may result from the effect of RNase upon polysomes during isolation and subsequent incubation. The elevated RNase levels of postmitochondrial supernatant fractions obtained from hypophysectomized animals were reduced to normal levels by intraperitoneal injection of bovine growth hormone, and optical density profiles and protein-synthesizing capacity of polysomes obtained from growth hormone-treated hypophysectomized rats were comparable to those of normal preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1526785640,"Abstract Inhibition of oxidative metabolism by cyanide, dinitrophenol, arsenate, or simple anoxia accelerated the carrier-mediated transport of monosaccharides in the erythrocytes of several avian species. This conclusion was supported by demonstrations of saturation kinetics, specificity of transport, competition between pairs of sugar, and counter-transport. Accelerated transport was shown for both the entry and exit of nonmetabolized sugars. The major kinetic effect was an increase in the maximal rate of transport. Treatment of avian erythrocytes with sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as HgCl2 and N-ethylmaleimide, resulted in an increased rate of transport of nonmetabolized sugars. The accelerated transport rate observed in cells treated with these agents was competitively inhibited by the addition of glucose. The increased transport rate induced by HgCl2 was immediately reversed by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds. HgCl2 treatment did not result in an increased level of 5'-AMP in the cells, suggesting that the acceleration of transport was not the result of an inhibition of oxidative metabolism. These observations suggest that the regulation of sugar transport in these cells may involve a sulfhydryl group. A partial reversal of the anoxic stimulation of transport by dithiothreitol strengthens this possibility. Hemolysis of erythrocytes in solutions of low osmotic strength followed by restoration of membrane integrity in solutions containing 300 milliosmoles per liter resulted in increased rates of transport in aerobic cells, suggesting that some inhibitor of transport present in aerobic cells had been lost. The accelerated rate of transport observed in cells subjected to hemolysis and restoration could not be inhibited by dithiothreitol."

https://openalex.org/W1589091581,"Abstract Based on a description of the difference in the transport characteristics for amino acids of a reticulocyte-rich population of young blood cells and the mature erythrocyte, the schedule of these changes during maturation has been studied during an interval of 17 days after administering phenylhydrazine to rabbits. All amino acid transport activities studied tended to reach their maxima several days after the peak in the reticulocyte count, and during an interval when the reticulocyte morphology was being lost rapidly. Subsequently, different schedules were followed for the regression of otherwise discernible transport activities. The activity for alanine was lost most rapidly; a Na+-dependent component of the uptake of α,γ-diaminobutyric acid, which was, however, not inhibitable by alanine or glycine, appeared to be lost about as rapidly. A Na+-independent transport of lysine, which applied also to other cationic amino acids, regressed much more slowly, and was to a considerable degree retained at maturity. The uptake of glycine was also lost slowly, a kinetic complexity persisting throughout. The complexity may mean that two glycine transport systems are present. Support for this view was not obtained either by the test of analogues for differential inhibition of the two components or by the finding of any difference in the rate of regression during reticulocyte maturation."

The increase in the alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient with rising concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin results from changes induced by carbon monoxide in the shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.

On the basis of measurements of sedimentation constant, diffusion constant, and partial specific volume, the molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 191,000. The reaction product was isolated and identified as δ-amino-n-valeramide based on melting point, elemental analyses, infrared absorption spectra, paper chromatography, and alkaline hydrolysis. Balance studies showed that 1 mole of l-lysine was converted to an equimolar amount each of δ-amino-n-valeramide and carbon dioxide with the consumption of 1 mole of oxygen. In addition to l-lysine the enzyme slowly oxidized l-ornithine, l-arginine, and l-thialysine. The enzyme was shown to contain 2 moles of flavin adenine dinucleotide, which were reduced by the anaerobic addition of l-lysine or the substrate analogues. δ-Amino-n-valeramide deaminase was also isolated and partially purified."

https://openalex.org/W1568076188,"The complete amino acid sequence of ferredoxin isolated from a green alga, Scenedesmus species, was determined by analyses of tryptic and chymotryptic digests, and cyanogen bromide cleavage of the S-carboxymethylcysteinylferredoxin. The total number of amino acid residues is 96, one less than for the higher plant ferredoxins. It is the first chloroplast-type ferredoxin found lacking in tryptophan and asparagine, and containing methionine. Evidently, neither tryptophan nor methionine can be essential for electron transfer activity. Six half-cystine residues were found in Scenedesmus ferredoxin as compared with only 5 in spinach and alfalfa ferredoxins. All of them were titratable with p-chloromercuribenzoate without prior reduction of the protein. Five are located in identical positions in all three ferredoxins. Similarity was observed between the ferredoxins of Scenedesmus, spinach, and alfalfa, with low values for minimum base differences per codon of 0.28 to 0.42. In the comparison of Scenedesmus and spinach ferredoxins there is a region which suggests a change produced by a frameshift mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2144206744,"Isolated vesicles of the sarcoplasmic reticulum are known to take up calcium when provided with magnesium adenosine triphosphate as an energy source. Preparations of high activity are obtained by keeping the vesicles in 5 millimolar dithiothreitol (a reagent that reduces disulfide groups), and these preparations retain activity for a week or longer. The highly active preparations lend themselves to a spectrophotometric method for following calcium uptake, and continuous uptake kinetics are readily obtained. Calcium uptake appears to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) = 8x10(-6); V(mas), = 7x10(-7) mole per second per milligram of protein). These preparations are also useful for studying the effects of inhibitors of uptake, such as quinine. When extrapolated to the intact muscle, the results from these isolated vesicles should give a better estimate than has been available of the actual rates of calcium uptake and of the physiological effect of inhibitors of uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1567355229,"Abstract Imidazole acetate monooxygenase, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of imidazole acetate, was purified about 250-fold from extracts of induced cells of a pseudomonad and was crystallized. The molecular weight was determined to be approximately 90,000, and the molecular activity was calculated to be 2,260 at 24°. The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous upon acrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The crystalline enzyme showed an absorption spectrum characteristic of a flavoprotein with absorption maxima at 270, 383, and 442 mµ. The flavin component of the enzyme was isolated and identified as flavin adenine dinucleotide, 1 mole of which was found per mole of enzyme. Aerobic incubation of the enzyme with imidazole acetate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide resulted in the accumulation of an unstable intermediate having an absorption spectrum with a maximum at 259 mµ, which was indistinguishable from that of imidazolone acetate. Flavin bound to the enzyme was reduced by the anaerobic addition of a stoichiometric amount of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The reduced form of enzyme-bound flavin was found to serve as an electron donor for the hydroxylation reaction. Some other properties of the enzyme are also described."
https://openalex.org/W1515716819,"γ-Cystathionases catalyze elimination of substituents from the β- or γ-positions of 4-carbon chain length amino acids with formation of α-ketobutyrate, but when N-ethylmaleimide is added to reaction mixtures the α-ketobutyrate is replaced by a product reflecting addition to the maleimide double bond of an intermediate with carbanion character at carbon 3. The product is α-keto-3-(3′-(N′-ethyl-2′,5′-dioxopyrrolidyl)) butyric acid, or KEDB. The reactive intermediate was postulated to be one of the three enamines: free aminocrotonate, aminocrotonate bound to the enzyme in an unprotonated form, or the Schiff base between aminocrotonate and the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. The cystathionases have now been shown to catalyze stereospecific reactions with N-ethylmaleimide, yielding only one of the two possible diastereoisomers. The same isomer was formed by a third pyridoxal-P enzyme, cystathionine γ-synthase acting on O-succinylhomoserine, but a threonine dehydrase yielded the other isomer of KEDB from threonine. The last two enzymes differ from cystathionases in that the 3-carbon substrates, O-succinylserine and serine, respectively, do react in the presence of the maleimide to yield the analogue of KEDB less the methyl group, KEDP. This evidence that free enamino acids were not the intermediates that reacted with maleimide prompted an investigation of whether they were intermediates in any form. The basis for this study was that if they were, solvent tritium would be introduced into the β-position of newly formed pyruvate or α-ketobutyrate in a spontaneous step, and therefore the kinetic isotope effect would always be the same, regardless of which enzyme was used. Preliminary results suggest that the isotope effects may differ characteristically with different enzymes. A third study of the reactions of enamines with maleimides involved generating free enamines in the presence of the latter, through the action of hydrolytic enzymes on N-acyl derivatives of α-aminoacrylate and α-aminocrotonate. A kidney aminopeptidase produced KEDP from the first and a mixture of isomers of KEDB from the second. However, it is possible that the reactive species was an enzyme-bound enamine in this case also."

It was found that two different mechanisms of attack obtain: (a) processive degradation and (b) random cleavage.

The loss of several important biological activities of transfer RNA or aminoacyl transfer RNA, such as amino acid acceptor activity, AMP acceptor activity, polynucleotide-directed ribosomal binding, and incorporation of the amino acid moiety into growing polypeptide chains, were examined in detail as a function of the digestion by spleen exonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1514130849,"Abstract The procedure for the purification of renal dipeptidase from particulate kidney cortex fractions has been modified to eliminate a time-consuming washing process and a chromatographic step which frequently led to loss in activity. The over-all purification resulted in the isolation of 5.8 mg of purified peptidase from 1.5 kg of kidney cortex and produced an enzyme approximately 500 times more active than source material. Physical and chemical properties such as sedimentation characteristics, electrophoretic behavior, and zinc content were compared with those reported for earlier peptidase preparations. The amino acid composition of the enzyme based on a molecular weight of 47,200 indicates a protein that contains approximately 414 amino acid residues. A study of the effect of pH upon the kinetic parameters of renal dipeptidase indicates that the NH2-terminal amino group of the peptide substrate dissociates a proton during the catalytic process. Furthermore, it is suggested that a dissociation of pK 8.5 which takes place from the enzyme-substrate complex results from the loss of a proton from a water molecule coordinated to zinc at the active center of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1524918089,"Abstract Cystathionase, an enzyme requiring pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, reacts with several cyclic derivatives of α-aminobutyric acid to form complexes. The reaction depends on the presence of the pyridoxal phosphate moiety of the enzyme and is specific for the l form of the cyclic derivatives. Homocysteine thiolactone, α-aminobutyrolactone, α-aminobutyro-γ-selenolactone, and cycloserine competitively inhibit cystathionase activity. Conversely, the substrates homoserine and cystathionine competitively inhibit complex formation. An enzymic group with a pK of 8.6 participates in complex formation, whereas another more acidic group (pK 7.3) does not, but is ionized in the complex. This group apparently does not affect the absorption characteristics of the enzyme. These observations suggest a mechanism for transaldimination, based on a nucleophilic attack of the cyclic compounds on a protonated aldimine situated on the enzyme. Cystathionase normally has an absorption maximum at 420 mµ. When it was combined with α-aminobutyrolactone, homocysteine thiolactone, α-aminobutyro-γ-selenolactone, or cycloserine, the absorption maxima appeared in the range 495 mµ to 530 mµ. The shift to the longer wave lengths apparently corresponds to decreasing electronegativity of the heteroatoms in the cyclic derivatives. Stable enzyme-inhibitor intermediates are possible because of increased resonance energy in the complexes."

Luminescence studies at low temperature (77° K) have permitted the analysis of the phosphorescence properties of pyridoxal. The long lived emission of pyridoxal (phosphorescence lifetime, 1.1 sec) originates in a triplet state (π → π* transition) and shows a structureless phosphorescence band (λmax at 420 mµ). An energy level diagram for pyridoxal is proposed, and the possible role of pyridoxal as a sensitizer in photobiological processes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1557696980,"Abstract In the presence of a number of alkyl cobalamins, a complex is formed between ethanolamine deaminase and radioactive ethanolamine which can be isolated by gel filtration. Studies with the methylcobalamin-dependent complex have shown that the amount of substrate bound reaches a maximum at a cobamide to enzyme ratio of 2. The binding of substrate to this complex is depressed by ethanolamine analogues which are competitive inhibitors of the catalytic reaction. Measurements of binding as a function of substrate concentration indicate a dissociation constant for the complex of 2 x 10-7 m, a value which is surprisingly high in view of the apparent stability of the complex. Incubating the complex with unlabeled ethanolamine or allowing it to reside on the gel column for various periods of time leads to a loss of radioactivity from the complex which is almost complete by 6 min. This loss does not occur if the complex is exposed to light prior to incubation with unlabeled substrate. However, exposure of a mixture of enzyme and methylcobalamin to light in the absence of substrate prevents the complex from forming when radioactive substrate is added. Although the photolyzed complex is stable in the presence of unlabeled substrate, treatment with 6 m urea results in the release of all the radioactivity from the complex. With both the unphotolyzed and the photolyzed complexes, the radioactive compound associated with the enzyme was shown to be unchanged ethanolamine. These results are interpreted as suggesting that the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex is reversible in practical terms, but that in the presence of certain cobalamin derivatives the dissociation of the complex is slowed to the extent that it can be observed experimentally. Thus, the apparent stability of the complex is kinetic rather than thermodynamic in origin."

https://openalex.org/W1542530877,"Abstract Several approaches have been used to elucidate the relationship of glutaric acid to the pathway for the biosynthesis of lysine in yeast. A comparative study of several auxotrophic mutants reveals that α-ketoadipate and glutarate are accumulated only in certain mutants that fail to utilize α-aminoadipic acid, a precursor of lysine, for growth. Neither wild type culture nor mutants that are blocked at intermediary steps leading to α-ketoadipate formation accumulate α-ketoadipate or glutarate. A yeast cell-free preparation decarboxylates α-ketoadipate and the activity is not dependent on oxygen. The α-ketoadipate decarboxylation is similar to α-carboxylase activity of yeast. The product of such a decarboxylation yields a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative that shows similar chromatographic mobility to the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of synthetic glutaric semialdehyde. Cell-free preparations from mutant 1y5, which accumulates glutarate and α-ketoadipate, do not show significantly higher decarboxylase activity than wild type yeast with α-ketoadipate as a substrate. Of the radioactivity incorporated into cell protein, the percentage going to lysine is not significantly different when 1,5-14C-glutarate or 2-14C-acetate is used as precursor. These precursors are much less selective for lysine (l10%) than 6-14C-dl-α-aminoadipic acid (g90%) in growing yeast culture. These results indicate that glutaric acid is not an obligatory intermediate of the homocitric acid pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1485250221,"Abstract Respiration by coupled mitochondria from heart was enhanced by acetate, butyrate, and octanoate in a controlled manner, limited by exogenous ADP. When uncoupling agents were added, the ADP requirement for oxidation of pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, or β-hydroxybutyrate was abolished. In contrast, respiration by uncoupled mitochondria incubated with acetate, butyrate, or octanoate remained dependent on the addition of ADP. The ratio of ADP to oxygen was approximately unity in uncoupled mitochondria incubated with short chain fatty acids. The controlled increase in respiration by mitochondria associated with ADP addition was abolished or inhibited by malonate or arsenite, indicating that operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was required for manifestation of the respiratory control in both coupled and uncoupled mitochondria. The data were interpreted to indicate that ATP required for fatty acid activation was generated from exogenous ADP indirectly via operation of the succinyl coenzyme A synthetase and the nucleoside diphosphokinase reactions. Addition of the nonmetabolized inhibitors of carnitine acetyltransferase ((+)-acetylcarnitine and dl-bromoacetylcarnitine) to bovine heart mitochondria elicited effects similar to those observed after the addition of acetate, butyrate, or octanoate. Either of these transferase inhibitors induced an increase in respiration, dependent on ADP, by both coupled and uncoupled mitochondria. The ADP to oxygen ratio in uncoupled mitochondria was approximately unity, and the effect was completely abolished by malonate or arsenite. The nature of the endogenous substrate whose oxidation was enhanced in the presence of ADP by the nonmetabolized inhibitors of carnitine acetyltransferase was not proven, but evidence was presented suggesting the importance of endogenous fatty acids in these processes."
