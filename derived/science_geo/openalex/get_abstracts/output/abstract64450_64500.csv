Removal of ethanol produces symptoms of physical dependence including death from tonic-clonic seizures. Overindulgence in oral self-administration of an aqueous ethanol solution, resulting in unequivocal physical dependence, approximates a model of human alcoholism."

https://openalex.org/W1559188901,"Abstract The fluorescence yield of bound retinol in human retinol-binding protein (RBP) and its prealbumin complex (PA-RBP) were found to be nearly the same and to exceed that of free retinol in petroleum ether by about 9-fold. Bovine serum albumin and β-lactoglobulin also formed strongly fluorescent water-soluble complexes with retinol. The fluorescence yield of retinol complexed with bovine serum albumin was about 4-fold and with β-lactoglobulin about 3-fold larger than retinol in petroleum ether. In the retinol-bovine serum albumin complex the molar ratio of retinol to protein was found to be approximately 1. The greater degree of fluorescence enhancement, the greater stability of retinol in RBP and PA-RBP to spontaneous degradation at room temperature, the relative resistance to extraction of the bound retinol by ether, and the complete unavailability of the retinol in RBP and PA-RBP for oxidation by liver alcohol dehydrogenase, in contrast to the retinol in complexes formed with either bovine serum albumin or β-lactoglobulin, were interpreted as indicating that retinol is bound with greater affinity to the natural carrier protein than it is to bovine serum albumin or β-lactoglobulin. Retinol was extracted from dry preparations of RBP and PA-RBP with ethanol in the cold, yielding apoprotein preparations that were able to rebind retinol, regenerating about 90% of their original fluorescence with the bound retinol becoming again completely unreactive toward liver alcohol dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1565510860,"Abstract The major physicochemical properties of epidermal growth factor are reported. The molecular weight of epidermal growth factor is estimated to be approximately 6100 by the methods of sedimentation equilibrium, gel filtration, and minimum molecular weight calculations from amino acid analyses. Epidermal growth factor is a single chain polypeptide having an asparagine amino-terminal residue and an arginine carboxyl-terminal residue. It is further characterized by the absence of 3 specific amino acid residues: lysine, alanine, and phenylalanine. No detectable free sulfhydryl groups, hexosamines, or neutral sugars were observed. Epidermal growth factor has an isoelectric point of pH 4.60. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum is typical for proteins, with an E1%1 cm at 280 nm of 30.9. The secondary structure, as judged by ultraviolet circular dichroism, is principally nonhelical."
https://openalex.org/W1560213098,"Abstract Regulatory effects of amino acids on rates of protein synthesis and degradation were investigated in perfused livers from nonfasted rats. In the absence of added amino acids, the rates of incorporation of valine into and its release from protein achieved stable values from 60 to 180 min of perfusion. The infusion of a mixture of amino acids similar in composition to an ovalbumin hydrolysate, but lacking leucine, isoleucine, valine, and tyrosine, suppressed the net breakdown of protein by more than 80% as reflected by an 80% inhibition of the net release of free valine. The effect was maximal at amino acid infusion rates of 132 µmoles per hour for livers averaging 5.5 g in weight. The mixture also inhibited the release of label from livers previously labeled in vivo with l-[1-14C]valine. Since the magnitude of this effect was the same after the addition of 15 mm carrier valine, we concluded that proteolysis was the primary site of action. The response appeared to depend strongly on the presence of four amino acids, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, and tryptophan, and near-maximal responses were obtained when they were infused together at their original concentrations. Small effects were observed when these amino acids were administered singly, but full responses were not obtained even at increased rates of infusion. Rates of valine incorporation into liver protein, measured in the presence of 15 mm valine, were low at the start of perfusion, but increased spontaneously to linearity by 60 min of perfusion. Infusion of the foregoing mixture of amino acids failed to influence incorporation rates, but single additions of a complete amino acid mixture, simulating 10 times plasma levels, corrected the initial reduction and also increased incorporation rates measured after 60 min. The present findings clearly show that amino acids can suppress hepatic proteolysis in the absence of any stimulation of valine incorporation and suggest that the amino acid requirement for this suppression differs from that for stimulation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515418547,"Abstract Hydroxylapatite (calcium phosphate) chromatography was investigated as a method for separating protein subunits dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The proteins used included: a series of 11 well characterized proteins composed of single or identical subunits varying in molecular weight from 11,700 to 165,000; hemoglobin, composed of α and β chains of 146 and 141 amino acids; and vaccinia virus structural proteins, composed of more than 15 different polypeptide subunits. Reduced proteins were complexed with SDS and adsorbed to columns of hydroxylapatite. Using linear gradients of sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, containing 0.1% SDS and 1mm dithiothreitol, all tested proteins eluted between 0.2 and 0.5 m phosphate. A useful feature of the method is that proteins do not all elute in order of molecular weight. Thus polypeptide separations on hydroxylapatite are different from those obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration in SDS. The high resolution of the method was demonstrated by separating the α and β chains of hemoglobin and complex mixtures of viral polypeptides. By using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and hydroxylapatite chromatography in succession, it has been possible to separate vaccinia virus structural polypeptides that had not previously been resolved."
https://openalex.org/W1518183134,"Abstract Reaction of leucine aminopeptidase with dimethyl suberimidate at pH 8.5 and room temperature, followed by incubation with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol and then electrophoresis in 3.5% acrylamide gels resulted in six protein bands with molecular weights as integer values of 56,000. Under reaction conditions where appreciable cross-linking took place, the species corresponding to dimers, tetramers, and hexamers were much more prevalent than those corresponding to trimers and pentamers, the latter being barely detectable. Providing that the ability of the protomers to form cross-links reflects their spatial arrangement in the oligomer, the results suggest that leucine aminopeptidase is composed of six identical protomers arranged as a trimer of dimers. Of the possible arrangements for a hexamer, the planar hexamer with all heterologous interactions is incompatible with these data. Thus, cross-linking reactions may yield information on the spatial arrangement of protomers in oligomers as well as on the number and kinds of protomers in the oligomer. Individual treatment of a number of monomeric proteins with dimethyl suberimidate in the frozen state at -10° in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol yielded intermolecular cross-linked species which could be separated into a large number of components on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. For any one cross-linked protein the plot of logarithm of molecular weight against Rf fell on a straight line for Rf values between 0.2 and 0.8. The lines described by different proteins, although generally having similar slopes, were not always superimposable. This procedure for cross-linking monomeric proteins has potential use in determining molecular weights by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate."

The correlation of the ultrastructural changes with quantitative alterations in lung surfactant is evidence that the lamellar bodies within this cell are the source of the surface-active phospholipids utilized at the air-liquid interphase of lung alveoli. Our findings suggest that in the rat, L-thyroxine may be a potent regulator of lung surfactant metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1575906026,"Abstract The two collagens of cartilage differing in primary structure, extracted from lathyritic chick xiphoid processes, can be separated from each other in their native forms by differential salt precipitation. One form, [α1(I)]2α2, present in smaller amount, is less soluble and is precipitated by 2.2 m NaCl at neutral pH; the other form, [α1(II)]3, which remains in solution, can be precipitated by dialysis at very low ionic strength. The two different α1 chains, α1(I) and α1(II) which chromatograph close to one another on CM-cellulose, can be completely separated under mildly alkaline conditions on an anion exchange resin, DEAE-cellulose, by stepwise elution with buffers of decreasing pH. This chromatographic technique for collagen chain separation has revealed microheterogeneity of both types of α1 chains by separating a number of components displaying only small differences in amino acid content, principally in the hydroxylysine moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1501926244,"Abstract Acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver has been purified to homogeneity as judged by gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and ultracentrifugation in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. When the enzyme is subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate a sharp protein band is observed which has a molecular weight of about 215,000. In addition two sharp bands are observed which run closely together and which have molecular weights of about 118,000 and 125,000. Prolonged or repeated treatment of the heavy band with sodium dodecyl sulfate at an elevated temperature results in its conversion to the two light bands. It is concluded that the enzyme contains pairs of unlike subunits which remain associated to a considerable degree in sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature but which can be separated after more drastic treatment. Ultracentrifugation of the native enzyme yields an s20,w value of 45. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and mercaptoethanol yield a molecular weight for the subunits of the enzyme of 111,100. The amino acid composition, biotin content, and phosphate content of the enzyme are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1552172218,"Abstract The stereochemical course of hydrolysis of radioactive triolein was determined using lipoprotein lipase of cow's milk and rat postheparin plasma. [3H]Glycerol trioleate or glycerol [1-14C]trioleate was emulsified with total egg yolk lipids to provide 0.2 to 2.5 µCi of 3H or 0.03 µCi of 14C per µm substrate. The hydrolysis products were isolated at 1 to 45 min and free fatty acids and the various positional isomers of mono- and diglycerides were resolved by thin layer chromatography. In a total yield of 0.03 to 0.16 µmole of diglyceride, 9 to 30% was 1,3- and 70 to 91%, 1,2-(2,3-)diglyceride. The 2,3-isomer was 73 to 96% of the latter. The yield of free fatty acids and monoglycerides varied with the length of incubation. In 15 of 17 determinations, the 1-(3-)isomer accounted for 51 to 87% of the monoglyceride. It is suggested that lipoprotein lipase attacks preferentially position 1 in sn-glycerides and follows it by hydrolysis of the positions 2 and 3. An intermediate formation of 2,3-diglycerides during lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis may be important in avoiding stimulation of triglyceride and phospholipid biosynthesis which proceed via 1,2-diglycerides."

https://openalex.org/W1486211079,"Abstract Two enzymes (A and B), each with β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and β-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminidase activity, were obtained from beef spleen extracts. Final purifications: Enzyme A, 310-fold; B, 260-fold. Purity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Only A was bound by DEAE-cellulose, at pH 7.0. The two enzymes had identical weight-average and z-average molecular weights: the latter was unchanged by addition of guanidine hydrochloride or dithiothreitol, but decreased greatly when both were present, indicating more than one peptide chain in each enzyme. Amino acid compositions were similar, but more sialic acid and neutral carbohydrate were present in A than in B. Optical rotatory and circular dichroism spectra also were similar: no Cotton effects were observed at 250 to 300 nm, and rotations and ellipticities were very low at wave lengths l250 nm. Enzyme structure could not be deduced by fitting with calculated curves. Km values were identical but Vmax was slightly greater in A; changes in pH affected Km and Vmax of both enzymes. Kinetic studies showed that the two p-nitrophenyl substrates tested compete for the active sites on both enzymes. Stimulation by bovine serum albumin enhanced Vmax but did not affect Km. Both enzymes were strongly inhibited by various metal ions; neither was affected by sulfhydryl reagents, but activity vanished during treatment with dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1587947517,"Abstract Several peptides contained within the amino acid sequence -Glu-Gly-Asn-Pro-Tyr-Val-Pro-Val-His-Phe-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val-OH at the carboxyl end of ribonuclease A were synthesized in which phenylalanine-120 was replaced by leucine, isoleucine, or tryptophan: [Leu120]-RNase 111–124, [Ile120]-RNase 111–124, [Trp120]-RNase 111–124, [Ile120]-RNase 113–124, [Leu120]-RNase 115–124, [Ile120]-RNase 115–124, [Trp120]-RNase 115–124. The peptides were examined for their ability to regenerate enzymatic activity when mixed with RNase 1–118 which had been prepared by enzymatic degradation of RNase A. A study of the dissociation constants of the peptide-protein complexes, of the Michaelis constants of the complexes with cyclic 2', 3'-cytidylic acid, and of the inhibition constants with 2'-cytidylic acid led to the conclusion that Phe120 plays an important role in binding the peptide and protein and in aligning the catalytic site of the complex, but that it does not have a specific effect on binding of substrate."

https://openalex.org/W52325185,"Abstract Antibodies to purified calf thymus F1, and to chromatographically purified subfractions of calf thymus F1 histones were induced by immunization of rabbits with histone-RNA complexes. Complement fixation studies with these antibodies demonstrated structural differences between the subfractions in one organ and between those of different organs and species. The anti-F1 sera showed varying reactivity with whole F1 histone preparations from (in order of decreasing reactivity) calf thymus, lamb thymus, calf liver, rat thymus, and mouse spleen, as well as with three chromatographically separated subfractions of calf thymus. Antibodies to each of the calf thymus subfractions showed preferential reactivity with the homologous antigen and differentiated between all three components. Subfractions II and III appeared to be more closely related to each other than to Subfraction I. With anti-Subfraction I or anti-Subfraction II serum, equal reactions were observed with whole F1 from either calf thymus or calf liver, but anti-Subfraction III serum reacted much more strongly with the thymus F1 than with the liver F1. Thus qualitative differences occur in the Subfraction III components from these two organs in one species. All sera reacted more effectively with calf thymus F1 than with rat thymus or mouse spleen F1. Chromatographically separated Subfractions I to V of rat thymus F1 were all distinguishable from calf thymus subfractions, and immunochemical relatedness of subfractions of the two species could not be predicted from chromatographic elution positions. The order of reactivity of rat thymus subfractions was: with anti calf thymus Subfraction I serum: III g II g IV >> I, V; with anti calf thymus Subfraction II serum: II g IV >> I, III, V; with anti calf thymus Subfraction III serum: II g I g III >> IV, V. The immunological data suggest that the variability among the F1 histones is greater than has been assumed on the basis of chromatographic and electrophoretic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1505575303,"Abstract The COOH-terminal tetradecapeptide of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, Glu-Gly-Asn-Pro-Tyr-Val-Pro-Val-His-Phe-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val, and a series of shorter peptides containing 7 to 12 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus were synthesized by the solid-phase method. The peptides were examined for their ability to restore the enzymatic activity of ribonuclease A from which the last four, five, or six amino acids had been removed. The hepta- and octapeptides only regenerated 1 to 2% activity when mixed with RNase 1–118, but the activity increased sharply to 60% when the peptide was extended to a length of 9 residues by the addition of Val116. The activity increased gradually with increasing chain length and reached a maximum of 98% at the tetradecapeptide stage. Qualitatively similar reactivation of RNase 1–119 and RNase 1–120 was observed. The His119 residue in RNase 1–119 was found to compete with His119 of the synthetic peptides for contribution of a functional histidine residue to the active site of the reconstituted enzyme. The results of alkylation by iodoacetate showed that there are two enzymatically active forms of the combination product."
https://openalex.org/W1562622260,"Abstract The pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase complex (s020,w = 14.0 S) is inactivated and dissociated into half-molecular weight subunits (s020,w = 9.0 S) in the presence of low ionic strength buffers. The rates of inactivation and dissociation of the complex are dependent upon the ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the medium. At low ionic strengths (0.01 or less) and mildly alkaline pH (8.35), the rates of inactivation and dissociation of the complex into subunits are coincident and the rate of inactivation is independent of protein concentration over a 62-fold range. At higher ionic strengths (above 0.02) and in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, complex, inactive enzyme complex, and inactive subunits are found. Increasing the pH above neutrality at constant ionic strength increases the rate of inactivation as well as dissociation of the complex. The inactivation rate is also increased as the pH is lowered below 7.0, but the rate of dissociation of the complex is quite slow; the enzyme thus exists mainly as inactive complex. Temperature also has a marked effect on the rate of inactivation and dissociation of the complex. The rate of inactivation and dissociation in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.35 (µ = 0.008) is nearly 10-fold greater at 0° than at room temperature. The lowest rate of inactivation is found at 18–25°. Above 25° the rate of inactivation again increases as the temperature rises. The fatty acid synthetase complex (s020,w = 14.0 S) appears to undergo a transition to an enzymatically at low ionic strength. The active intermediate is then further converted to either an inactive enzyme complex or to inactive subunits (s020,w = 9.0 S). There is no requirement for the oxidation of —SH groups of the enzyme prior to its dissociation to subunits. However, the subunits obtained in the presence of dithiothreitol (conditions under which there is no loss of —SH groups of the enzyme) do not transfer the acetyl group from the 4'-phosphopantetheine to the cysteine site. Hence, these subunits have no activity for fatty acid synthesis. The results presented in this paper suggest that hydrophobic forces and a diminution of electrostatic repulsions are factors which contribute to the stability of the complex in high ionic strength buffers at neutral pH. A lowering of the temperature weakens the hydrophobic interactions and a decrease in the ionic strength increases the electrostatic repulsion between the subunits. These cumulative effects lead ultimately to dissociation of the complex to two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1502341663,"Abstract Crystalline triosephosphate isomerase from human erythrocytes can be resolved into three catalytically active forms by isoelectric focusing. Each variant (I, 1 to 5%, pI = 6.7; II, 70 to 75%, pI = 6.5; and III, 20 to 25%, pI = 6.1) refocuses as a single component and is a dimer (mol wt 56,000). Identical electrophoretic patterns are obtained from fresh and aged red cell lysates and are unchanged in the presence of reducing agents or proteolytic inhibitors. The enzyme can be dissociated in guanidinium chloride and reassociated into catalytically active enzyme. Dissociation and reassociation of Components I and III result only in the respective parent species, whereas dissociation and reassociation of Component II gives rise to all three forms of the enzyme. The amino acid compositions and tryptic peptide fingerprints of the components indicate several structural differences in the two types of subunits. The catalytic properties of the three forms are similar but consistent with the designation of Components I and III as homodimers AA and BB and Component II as the heterodimer AB."
https://openalex.org/W2008494955,"The effect of salicylate on the relative cation permeability of a membrane was investigated in large, identified molluscan neurons, with the use of intracellular recording techniques. Salicylate caused a reversible, dose-dependent decrease in the permeability of rubidium, cesium, sodium, and lithium ions relative to that of potassium ions. The results suggest that the changes in cation selectivity result from the adsorption of salicylate anions to the membrane with a subsequent increase in the density and field strength of anionic sites in the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1493230854,"Abstract A simple cell-free system was developed for studying specific binding components for glucocorticoids in normal as well as neoplastic tissues of the mouse. The steroid-macromolecular complex was extracted from the lymphosarcoma P1798 as a 27,000 x g supernatant fraction and separated from free steroid by gel chromatography. When 9α-fluoro-11β-16α,21-tetrahydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione-16,17-acetonide (triamcinolone acetonide) was present at the time of cell breakage, the results indicate that the binding process is not complicated by degradation of the binding component. Triamcinolone acetonide protected the binding component from spontaneous degradation. The rate of degradation of the binding component in the presence of this potent synthetic glucocorticoid is approximately one-eightieth of that of the unprotected component. The specificity of the binding component was demonstrated by the finding that 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (cortisol) depressed the binding of [1,2,4-3H3]triamcinolone acetonide by 90%, whereas the biologically inactive stereoisomer, 11α, 17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (11-epicortisol), reduced the binding by only 20%. The resistant subline of the tumor binds less [1,2,4-3H3]-triamicinolone acetonide in a specific manner in comparison to the sensitive neoplasm. Adrenalectomy causes an increase in specific binding of [1,2,4-3H3]triamcinolone acetonide in the glucocorticoidsensitive lymphosarcoma P1798. A soluble macromolecular fraction from the thymus binds 3 times more [1,2,4-3H3]-triamcinolone acetonide than the corresponding fraction from either the testis or cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1494958828,"Abstract 4-Hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate aldolase was purified to a state of apparent homogeneity from Pseudomonas putida. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be around 150,000 from sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity data. The physicochemical properties described include: sedimentation coefficient (s20, w0 = 7.98 S), frictional ratio (f:f0 = 1.15) and apparent partial specific volume (v = 0.742 ml g-1). The low mobility of the protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis greatly increased after reduction with mercaptoethanol. One main band was then observed, with the mobility expected for a protein of molecular weight about 27,000, and it appears that before reduction, six polypeptide chains of similar size were joined through disulfide linkages. In urea-acetic acid gels, electrophoresis of the enzyme before reduction revealed heterogeneity attributable to disulfide bond interchange; this may have occurred during purification. 4-Carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate was a substrate for the enzyme, but other hydroxyoxoacid intermediates in aromatic catabolism were not. The aldolase attacked only one enantiomer of 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate, the reaction was inhibited competitively by oxaloacetate and the enzyme required Mn++ or Mg++ (Km = 0.17 mm MgCl2) for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1611000090,"Abstract The binding of trifluoroacetate anion to aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) has been measured by the changes of the chemical shift in the 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. The dissociation constants for the enzyme-trifluoroacetate complex are pH dependent with values ranging from 15 to 36 mm at pH values between 5 and 8. Stoichiometry shows that there is only one anion binding site. The pH-dependence of trifluoroacetate binding indicates that a group in the enzyme with a pKa of 6.2 ± 0.2 is responsible for anion binding. Apoenzyme and holoenzyme after reduction of the pyridoxyl-lysine aldimine with NaBH4 (reduced enzyme), show the same pH dependence pattern and the same pKa value for trifluoroacetate binding as native enzyme. Controlled photooxidation of the active site histidine residue results in the elimination of the anion binding site. Chloride and succinate compete with trifluoroacetate for the same site in the native, apoenzyme, and reduced enzymes. On the other hand, the pseudosubstrate α-methylaspartate, which binds covalently to the enzyme to form the initial aldimine enzyme-substrate complex, competes with trifluoroacetate for the binding site only in the native enzyme, but this does not occur after the removal or reduction of the active site Schiff's base, i.e. in the apoenzyme and reduced enzyme. The positively charged anion binding site in the protein is postulated to be the active site histidine. A model is proposed for mutual exclusion between anion and substrate from the active center without a sharing of common subsites. The model is consistent with the stoichiometry, competition effects and pH dependence of ligand binding, as well as with the elimination of anion binding after photooxidation of the active center histidine without a subsequent effect on substrate affinity."

https://openalex.org/W1632751105,"Abstract A new basic α-amino acid with a quaternary ammonium side chain was synthesized in high yield by trimethylaminoethylation of l-cysteine with (2-bromoethyl)trimethylammonium (BETA) bromide at pH 9.1. The amino acid, l-[2-[(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)thio]ethyl]trimethylammonium hydroxide, inner salt, is named 4-thialaminine or thialaminine. It was purified as crystals of bromide hydrobromide, bromide hydrobromide (2:1), and chloride hydrochloride. The N2-p-tolylsulfonyl derivative and esters of this derivative were also prepared. (2-Iodoethyl)trimethylammonium nitrate reacted nearly as rapidly as BETA bromide with cysteine, but (2-chloroethyl)trimethylammonium chloride reacted very slowly. Treatment of dithiothreitol-reduced proteins with BETA bromide resulted in quantitative conversion of cysteine residues to 4-thialaminine without significant reduction in content of other amino acid residues. Thialaminine was found to be extremely stable under the usual conditions of acid hydrolysis of proteins and eluted between lysine and histidine in the amino acid analyzer. In contrast to most products of reduction and alkylation or of S-sulfonation of proteins, reduced and trimethylaminoethylated proteins were readily soluble in water. Thialaminyl peptide bonds were resistant to the action of trypsin; on the other hand, the chymotryptic activity of trypsin toward certain bonds of trimethylaminoethylated insulin was enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W1492092040,"Abstract The volume effects produced by the reaction of sodium dodecyl sulfate with bovine serum albumin were determined dilatometrically at 30.0 ± 0.001°. The calculated volume isotherms indicate the operation of at least two major processes: (a) a volume decrease which is caused by a high affinity protein-detergent interaction and occurs at detergent concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.08 m; and (b) a volume increase which occurs at SDS concentrations g0.08 m and is attributed to detergent interaction with the structurally altered protein. At detergent concentrations less than 0.02 m either positive or negative volume changes are produced depending on the type and ionic charge of the protein. The effect of pH was investigated by comparing the volume isotherms produced by albumin at pH 5.1 and at pH 8; the negatively charged albumin exhibited a more pronounced volume decrease compared with the isoionic albumin. The volume isotherms are a unique function of the composition, structural organization, and charge of the protein. Acrylamide gel electrophoretic studies of these systems reveal the generation of at least two categories of protein-detergent complexes. At low ratios of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to protein, there is a progressive increase of the mobility of protein complexes with increasing anion concentration. At detergent concentration ≥0.02 m another component is formed whose mobility is substantially faster than that observed at lower concentrations. At SDS concentrations ≥0.08 m this is the only component present; the mobility of this component is invariant in the concentration region of 0.02 to 0.5 m SDS."
https://openalex.org/W1502689295,"Abstract We have analyzed the methionine and isoleucine acceptor capacity of transfer ribonucleic acid purified from reticulocytes of sheep carrying different globin genes and synthesizing characteristically different hemoglobins. It had been previously established that hemoglobin A (α2β2a) is synthesized by A/A homozygotes in the early stages of anemia, whereas these same sheep switch over to hemoglobin C (α2β2c) synthesis when they are severely anemic. On the other hand, only hemoglobin B (α2β2b) is synthesized by normal or by heavily anemic B/B homozygotes. It is also known that hemoglobin A contains 0 isoleucine and 6 methionine residues, hemoglobin B contains 0 isoleucine and 8 methionine residues, and hemoglobin C contains 2 isoleucine and 2 methionine residues. We found that the isoleucine acceptor capacity is 2 to 3 times higher in transfer ribonucleic acid from reticulocytes synthesizing hemoglobin C as compared with cells synthesizing hemoglobins A or B. However, the isoleucine transfer ribonucleic acids from these reticulocytes could not be distinguished in their chromatographic behavior. Methionine-specific transfer ribonucleic acid is resolved by chromatography into two peaks. The smaller of these peaks is relatively decreased in quantity in reticulocytes synthesizing hemoglobin C. We conclude that the relative quantities of the different transfer ribonucleic acids are correlated with the amino acid composition of the sheep hemoglobins being synthesized. Furthermore, the changes are specific for the different isoaccepting species of transfer ribonucleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W3158837805,"Abstract Rabbit muscle phosphoglucose isomerase was subjected to various dissociation methods to determine the number and the size of its subunits. Gel filtration over a 50,000-fold concentration range (0.0001 to 5 mg ml-1) showed that dissociation does not occur simply as a result of dilution. The following subunit molecular weights were measured in denaturing solvents: 64,400 and 64,000 by ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate; approximately 60,000 by equilibrium sedimentation in the presence of maleic anhydride; and 65,100 by equilibrium sedimentation in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. These values correspond to almost exactly one-half of the molecular weight of 132,000 for the native enzyme (Pon, N. G., Schnackerz, K. D., Blackburn, M. N., Chatterjee, G. C., and Noltmann, E. A. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 1506), indicating that rabbit muscle phosphoglucose isomerase is composed of 2 subunits of identical molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1520969637,"Abstract Cystathionine γ-synthase is a pyridoxal phosphate enzyme which catalyzes a step in methionine biosynthesis in Salmonella, the formation of cystathionine from cysteine and O-succinylhomoserine. It is the only pyridoxal enzyme known to catalyze this type of reaction, which is called a γ replacement. In addition it can catalyze γ elimination, and β elimination and β replacement, reactions, although these have no known physiological function. The enzyme also catalyzes very rapid exchanges between tritium-labeled water and hydrogens in the α and β positions of a variety of amino acids structurally unrelated to its natural substrates. Studies of the rates of these exchange reactions have now revealed that when the amino acid has an electronegative substituent on carbon 3, exchange is much more rapid in the α than in the β position; in the absence of such a substituent, exchange is slightly more rapid in the β position. NMR studies of exchange reactions in 2H2O have confirmed that exchange is exclusively in the α and β positions, and have shown that all three β hydrogens of alanine are exchanged at the same rate. In α-aminobutyrate and homoserine one of the two sterically distinguishable β hydrogens was exchanged about 100 times faster than the other. The β hydrogens of homoserine were found to be magnetically nonequivalent, and it could be shown that the rapidly exchanging β hydrogen is the one which in solution is more strongly coupled to the α hydrogen. The results have been correlated with previously reported transient changes in the absorption spectrum of the enzyme during the various reactions described."
https://openalex.org/W1553392726,"Evidence is presented that a brain fraction containing synaptosomal membrane fragments and ghosts prepared from lysed rat forebrain synaptosomes synthesize protein in a cell free system. The protein synthesis was dependent upon the addition of a synaptosomal membrane fraction, Mg++, monovalent cations, ATP, GTP, and enzyme factors prepared from intact synaptosomes. Protein synthesis was inhibited by ribonuclease, cyclohexamide, puromycin, and phosphate ion, but chloramphenicol, erythromycin, ouabain, and KCN had no significant effect. The products of protein synthesis with both the synaptosomal membrane fraction and microsomal fractions from rat forebrain were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The distribution of the synaptosomal membrane fraction product in the polyacrylamide gels differed significantly from the microsomal product. Also the distribution of products following density gradient centrifugation and a comparison of requirements for monovalent cations further differentiated protein synthesis with the synaptosomal membrane fraction from that with microsomal preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1583926189,"Abstract The rabbit corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), fully saturated with corticosteroid, was separated by Sephadex G-200 filtration into a corticoid-binding monomer and a steroid-free tetramer. Polymerization could be enhanced by removal of the steroid from CBG or by prolonged storage. Partial depolymerization and reactivation of the inactive tetramer was obtained by incubation with a relatively large quantity of cortisol; the restored binding affinity was associated with the monomeric species. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation according to Yphantis indicated paucidispersity of the CBG; the predominant component had a molecular weight of 34,700 ± 1,200. The approach to sedimentation equilibrium technique of Archibald gave a weight-average molecular weight of 61,400 ± 1,600, suggesting a mixture of approximately 75% monomer and 25% tetramer. A single broad band was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis; two closely adjacent bands resulted when mercaptoethanol treatment was included. The corresponding apparent molecular weight, based on calibration with carbohydrate-free proteins was approximately 40% greater than that obtained by the Yphantis method. Similar deviations occurred with α1-acid glycoprotein and ovomucoid. We attribute these deviations to abnormal behavior of glycoproteins in the polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The results are compatible with a molecular weight of approximately 35,000 for the monomeric rabbit CBG."
https://openalex.org/W1574196406,"One of the reactions catalyzed by cystathionine γ-synthase, a bacterial pyridoxal phosphate enzyme, is the decomposition of O-succinylhomoserine, by γ elimination, to yield ammonia, succinate, and α-ketobutyrate. It had been shown that when this reaction was carried out in 2H2O 1 atom of deuterium was stereospecifically introduced (the absolute configuration is confirmed in this paper) at carbon 3 of α-ketobutyrate, but considerably less than 1 atom of deuterium was present in the newly formed terminal methyl group. The latter result indicated that a portion of the hydrogen introduced at carbon 4 originated in the substrate, presumably by intramolecular proton transfer from either the α or the β position of the homoserine moiety. To answer this question we have synthesized homoserine with deuterium in the α, the β, or in both positions, have succinylated the various preparations, and allowed them to be decomposed in H2O or 2H2O by cystathionine synthase. The distribution of hydrogen (1H) and deuterium in the resultant α-ketobutyrate has been determined by NMR and mass spectroscopy. The results showed that: (a) there was proton (1H) transfer from both α and β positions of substrate to γ position of product; (b) the β hydrogen transferred was the same as the one shown in the preceding paper to be rapidly exchanged; (c) there was not a measurable amount of deuterium transfer from either α or β position. The effects of α and β deuterium substitution on the kinetic constants for the γ elimination reaction were found to be rather small. The explanation postulated for these results involves a single polyhydric basic group of the enzyme functioning in the abstraction of both the α and β hydrogens of the substrate and in a series of intramolecular proton transfers leading to their partial retention in the methyl group of α-ketobutyrate."
https://openalex.org/W1523831011,"Abstract The cytoplasmic and mitochondrial malic enzyme isozymes isolated from bovine heart have been studied to determine their capability in catalyzing the reductive carboxylation of pyruvate to malate. The cytoplasmic enzyme carries out this carboxylation at rates that approach one-seventh of the maximal decarboxylation velocity at the same pH. Michaelis constants of 13 mm for bicarbonate and 8 mm for pyruvate have been obtained for this enzyme. The mitochondrial isozyme catalyzes the carboxylation reaction at rates which are only about one-three hundredth that of the maximal rate for decarboxylation. This behavior can be modified by the addition of several C4 dicarboxylate anions, including succinate, d(+) malate, l(-) aspartate, and 2-mercaptosuccinate, the latter being the most active. In the presence of the above mentioned dicarboxylate anions, the carboxylation is enhanced 2- to 3-fold, indicating a possible change in the enzyme conformation. The Michaelis constants for bicarbonate and pyruvate, in the presence of mercaptosuccinate, have been calculated as 16.5 mm and 9 mm, respectively. From experiments conducted at low temperatures, it has been concluded that free CO2, rather than the bicarbonate ion, is the active carboxylating species in the reactions catalyzed by both isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1484503576,"Abstract The apparent rate of hydration of crotonylpantetheine is stimulated by coenzyme A, a finding in accord with earlier observations. Other compounds, such as ADP, ATP, and acetyl-CoA act in a similar manner. The action of coenzyme A was interpreted earlier to be the result of the activity of crotonase. It was presumed that crotonase catalyzed the transfer of the crotonyl moiety of crotonylpantetheine to coenzyme A and the resulting crotonyl coenzyme A was rapidly hydrated. Reaction of crotonylpantetheine and crotonase with either coenzyme A or acetyl coenzyme A has been found to give only β-hydroxybutyryl-pantetheine and neither crotonyl- nor β-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A. These observations indicate that crotonase lacks a thioltranscrotonylation activity. The stimulation of the rate of hydration of crotonylpantetheine by coenzyme A and similar compounds appears to occur because of an increased affinity of the enzyme for crotonylpantetheine in the presence of these compounds. It has also been found that the thiol groups in the enzyme, which were postulated to be involved in its thioltranscrotonylation activity as well as hydrase activity, are not essential for the catalytic action of crotonase."

Chem. 246, 5636–5644). It has been prepared from trout testis chromatin by extraction with 5% trichloroacetic acid and purified by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose using a lithium chloride gradient. The sequence of amino acids in the NH2-terminal region has been determined using an automatic protein Sequencer. In its primary structure, histone T differs from any of the other histones yet sequenced, and is thus not a degradation product derived from them."
https://openalex.org/W1923394607,"Abstract We have analyzed the messenger ribonucleic acids from reticulocytes of adult sheep carrying different globin genes and synthesizing correspondingly different hemoglobins. Hemoglobin A (α2β2a) is synthesized by A/A homozygotes in the early stages of anemia, whereas these same animals switch over to hemoglobin C (α2β2c) synthesis when they are severely anemic. On the other hand, only hemoglobin B (α2β2b) is synthesized by normal or by anemic B/B homozygotes. All four types of sheep globin messenger ribonucleic acids (i.e. for α, βa, βb, or βc chains) are successfully translated in a protein-synthesizing lysate from rabbit reticulocytes. The newly synthesized radioactive sheep globin chains are separated from the rabbit globin chains by chromatography on a carboxymethylcellulose column. The results suggest that a switch from βa to βc messenger ribonucleic acid accompanies the development of anemia in A/A sheep. However, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system synthesizes sheep globin chains in different proportions than they are synthesized intracellularly; in the rabbit lysate, α and βa chains constitute a lower percentage and βc chains a larger percentage of the synthesis. The method of Lodish (Lodish, H. F. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7131) was used to quantitate the relative levels of α, βa, and βc messenger ribonucleic acids in reticulocytes from an A/A homozygote. The proportion of βc messenger is approximately twice as high as the proportion of βc synthesis in sheep reticulocytes. On the contrary, the proportion of α messenger is lower than the proportion of α chain synthesis in sheep reticulocytes."

A known mixture of tritium-labeled racemic steroid and d-14C-labeled steroid was added to the protein and differences in the binding of d and l forms deduced from changes in 3H:14C ratio after separation of bound and unbound steroid fractions by gel filtration or equilibrium dialysis. The d- but not the l-enantiomers of progesterone and aldosterone were bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin. Similarly, only d-aldosterone was bound to an antiserum prepared against d-aldosterone hapten. In contrast, bovine and human serum albumin exhibited no antipodal preference, but bound equally both enantiomers of progesterone and aldosterone."

https://openalex.org/W1515653612,"Abstract Conformational studies have been carried out on two myoglobin (Mb) derivatives in which glutamic acid residues 83 and 85 were modified by coupling, after activation with carbodiimide, with glycine methyl ester (i.e. di(glycylmethyl ester)-myoglobin, (GlyMe)2-Mb) or with histidine methyl ester, (HisMe)2-Mb. Determination of the molecular parameters by gel filtration showed that Mb and (HisMe)2-Mb had identical molecular parameters, while in (GlyMe)2-Mb a large degree of unfolding and increase in the asymmetry of the molecule was observed. These studies also showed that even in the corresponding apoproteins, apomyoglobin (ApoMb) and (HisMe)2-ApoMb appeared to have similar conformational parameters, whereas (GlyMe)2-ApoMb was more unfolded. In optical rotatory dispersion measurements, (HisMe)2-Mb was only slightly less rotatory than Mb at the negative minimum at 233 nm and at the positive 199 nm extremum. Also the b0 value of (HisMe)2-Mb (-382) was slightly lower than that of Mb (-419). On the other hand (GlyMe)2-Mb showed a large degree of unfolding as evidenced by a sharp decrease of all of its optical rotatory dispersion parameters. Measurement of rotatory behaviors with decreasing pH showed that large unfolding of (HisMe)2-Mb takes place in a somewhat slightly higher pH range (pH 4.75 to 3.5) than the corresponding range for MbX (pH 4.0 to 3.0). (GlyMe)2-Mb, on the other hand, exhibited only a small decrease in rotatory power as the pH is lowered from 4.0 to 3.0. In circular dichroism measurements, the reduced molar ellipticity values at the negative bands at 208 nm and at 221 nm for Mb and (HisMe)2-Mb were equal in magnitude both around neutrality and at acid pH. The ellipticity values for (GlyMe)2-Mb were greatly suppressed relative to Mb. Circular dichroism measurements at acid pH showed little or no change in the [θ'] values for (GlyMe)2-Mb, indicating that little, if any, further unfolding of the molecule had taken place. The results are discussed in terms of the three-dimensional structure of Mb in the crystalline state and suggest that the two carboxyl groups at positions 83 and 85 do not participate in hydrogen bonding in the native protein."
