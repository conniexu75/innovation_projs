https://openalex.org/W2051268134,"The therapeutic potential of placental growth factor (PlGF) and its receptor Flt1 in angiogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that PlGF stimulated angiogenesis and collateral growth in ischemic heart and limb with at least a comparable efficiency to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). An antibody against Flt1 suppressed neovascularization in tumors and ischemic retina, and angiogenesis and inflammatory joint destruction in autoimmune arthritis. Anti-Flt1 also reduced atherosclerotic plaque growth and vulnerability, but the atheroprotective effect was not attributable to reduced plaque neovascularization. Inhibition of VEGF receptor Flk1 did not affect arthritis or atherosclerosis, indicating that inhibition of Flk1-driven angiogenesis alone was not sufficient to halt disease progression. The anti-inflammatory effects of anti-Flt1 were attributable to reduced mobilization of bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitors into the peripheral blood; impaired infiltration of Flt1-expressing leukocytes in inflamed tissues; and defective activation of myeloid cells. Thus, PlGF and Flt1 constitute potential candidates for therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1963876488,"The mechanism by which angiogenic factors recruit bone marrow (BM)-derived quiescent endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is not known. Here, we report that functional vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1) is expressed on human CD34+ and mouse Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ BM-repopulating stem cells, conveying signals for recruitment of HSCs and reconstitution of hematopoiesis. Inhibition of VEGFR1, but not VEGFR2, blocked HSC cell cycling, differentiation and hematopoietic recovery after BM suppression, resulting in the demise of the treated mice. Placental growth factor (PlGF), which signals through VEGFR1, restored early and late phases of hematopoiesis following BM suppression. PlGF enhanced early phases of BM recovery directly through rapid chemotaxis of VEGFR1+ BM-repopulating and progenitor cells. The late phase of hematopoietic recovery was driven by PlGF-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, mediating the release of soluble Kit ligand. Thus, PlGF promotes recruitment of VEGFR1+ HSCs from a quiescent to a proliferative BM microenvironment, favoring differentiation, mobilization and reconstitution of hematopoiesis."

This group of blinding conditions affects over 1.5 million persons worldwide. Approximately 30–40% of human autosomal dominant (AD) RP is caused by dominantly inherited missense mutations in the rhodopsin gene. Here we show that P23H, the most frequent RP mutation in American patients, renders rhodopsin extremely prone to form high molecular weight oligomeric species in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Aggregated P23H accumulates in aggresomes, which are pericentriolar inclusion bodies that require an intact microtubule cytoskeleton to form. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we observe that P23H aggregates in the cytoplasm even at extremely low expression levels. Our data show that the P23H mutation destabilizes the protein and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. P23H is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors and by co-expression of a dominant negative form of ubiquitin. We show that expression of P23H, but not wild-type rhodopsin, results in a generalized impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system, suggesting a mechanism for photoreceptor degeneration that links RP to a broad class of neurodegenerative diseases.

Approximately 43% of RP is inherited as autosomal dominant (AD) alleles of genes that are expressed predominantly or exclusively in rod photoreceptors. The recessive forms of RP are primarily the result of null mutations eliminating enzymes critical to photoreceptor function. More than 100 distinct mutations in the rhodopsin gene have been documented, accounting for 30–40% of ADRP. The most common abnormality found to cause RP (2Dryja T.P. McGee T.L. Reichel E. Hahn L.B.

Although the signal transduction cascades leading to caspase activation in RP are unknown (reviewed in Ref. 5Reme C.E. Grimm C. Hafezi F. Marti A. Wenzel A. Prog. Retin.

Studies of mutant rhodopsin molecules expressed heterologously in mammalian cells in culture have suggested that ADRP-linked rhodopsin mutations fall into two classes based on the differing intracellular fates of the mutant proteins. Class I mutants are expressed at wild-type levels in HEK293 or COS cells, where they traffic to the plasma membrane and produce functional photopigment when reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal, suggesting that they are correctly folded (12Sung C.H.

These mutants, the majority of which are strikingly clustered within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of rhodopsin, appear to be defective in their ability to traffic correctly to rod outer segments (15Li Z.Y.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because of defective interaction with the retrograde microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein (17Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). By contrast, the vast majority of ADRP-causing rhodopsin mutations are class II mutants, which are defective in their ability to fold (18Sung C.H. Tai A.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 215-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chapple J.P. Grayson C. Hardcastle A.J. Saliba R.S. van der Spuy J. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How rhodopsin misfolding causes ADRP is unknown, although misfolding has recently been suggested to be closely linked to the gain-of-function that underlies disease pathogenesis (19Chapple J.P. Grayson C. Hardcastle A.J. Saliba R.S. van der Spuy J. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When expressed in HEK293 or COS cells, class II mutants fail to acquire complex oligosaccharides indicative of transit through the Golgi apparatus and are severely defective or unable to produce functional photopigment on reconstitution with 11-cis-retinal (12Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 14Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These findings strongly support the conclusion that class II mutants are unable to fold correctly within the endoplasmic reticulum. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that class II mutants fail to accumulate to high levels in transfected cells (as wild-type rhodopsin), suggesting that they are subject to enhanced intracellular degradation (12Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which class II mutants are degraded, however, is unknown. Despite an extensive body of data, the mechanisms by which rhodopsin mutations initiate the signaling events leading to photoreceptor death and retinal degeneration remain a mystery. The dominant inheritance pattern, together with the lack of a haploinsufficient phenotype, imply that that rhodopsin-linked ADRP results from a toxic gain of function at the rhodopsin locus. However, the only phenotypic consequence to be attributed to class II mutations in rhodopsin, an inability to fold correctly, is a loss of function. The discovery that most class II mutants are folding-defective places ADRP within a family of conformational diseases that includes most neurodegenerative disorders (20Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 21Soto C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Like ADRP, the familial forms of these diseases are usually inherited as delayed onset, highly penetrant, dominant traits. In some cases, pathogenesis has been linked to enhanced susceptibility of the mutant gene product to degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (22Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 139: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Degenerating neurons in these diseases accumulate high molecular weight forms of mutant gene product that are usually segregated within intracellular inclusion bodies that are often heavily modified with ubiquitin (Ub) (24Alves-Rodrigues A. Gregori L. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 516-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Lowe J. Blanchard A. Morrell K. Lennox G. Reynolds L. Billett M. Landon M. Mayer R.J. J. Pathol. 1988; 155: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 26Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). By contrast, inclusion bodies and Ub immunoreactivity have not been reported to be prominent histopathological features of degenerating photoreceptors in transgenic animals or in retinas from human RP patients in early stages of the disease (27Flannery J.G. Farber D.B. Bird A.C. Bok D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although RP and other central nervous system neurodegenerations appear to share a common etiology, insofar as they are all linked to the production of abundantly expressed, folding-defective polypeptides, they differ in that overt inclusion bodies have not been reported in RP. A simple explanation for this difference might be that the retina may be more effective at eliminating misfolded proteins or preventing the accumulation of aggregated protein products than other central nervous system tissues. In this study, we have investigated the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the disposal of RP-linked mutant rhodopsin. Our data reveal that the class II rhodopsin mutant, P23H, is a substrate for Ub-dependent degradation by the proteasome. We find that high molecular weight, ubiquitinylated forms of P23H accumulate when expressed in cultured cells. We have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to demonstrate that the aggregation of P23H is intracellular, and furthermore, occurs even at very low expression levels, unlike wild-type rhodopsin and the class I mutant, V345M. Finally, our data indicate that aggregation of P23H in cells leads to impairment of the function of the ubiquitin proteasome system, as has recently been demonstrated for other aggregated proteins, including the mutant form of huntingtin linked to Huntington's disease (28Bence N. Sampat R. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Therefore, rhodopsin aggregation may represent a toxic gain of function associated with class II mutations in the pathogenesis of ADRP, raising the possibility that retinal degeneration may share a common pathogenic mechanism with other late-onset neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. The following antibodies were used in this study: Rho1D4 (29Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (gift from R. Molday, University of British Columbia), B6–30 (gift from P. Hargrave, University of Florida), anti-His6 (MMS-156P, BAbCO/Covance Research Products, Denver, PA), monoclonal γ-tubulin (GTU-88, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The c-myc-Ub plasmids have been described previously (30Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Wild-type and P23H rhodopsin in pRK were obtained from J. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University). V345M was made by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). YFP and CFP rhodopsin and P23H plasmids have been previously described (31Rajan R.S. Illing M. Bence N. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected as described previously (30Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were carried out by adding plasmid DNA as a calcium phosphate precipitate (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Cell pellets from transfected and washed HEK cells were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold buffer A (PBS, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% TX-100) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min and solubilized in 50 μl (PBS, 1% SDS) for 10 min at room temperature. After addition of 200 μl of buffer A, samples were sonicated for 20 s with a microtip sonicator. For immunopurification of the Ub-rhodopsin complexes, 150 μl of the detergent-soluble fraction from His6-myc-Ub-rhodopsin co-transfected cells was incubated with 5 μl of 1D4 Sepharose beads (a kind gift of D. Oprian, Brandeis University) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed extensively with cold buffer A, and protein was eluted into 20 μl of SDS sample buffer β-mercaptoethanol). Endoglycosidase H and PNGase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) digestion was performed on detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions for 1 h at 37 °C in a 10:1 dilution with the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. For immunoblotting, cell fractions were separated on Ready Gel precast 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and electroblotted to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes. Chemiluminescence detection was carried out with the ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Band intensities were quantified from non-saturated exposures using IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health). Cells were seeded onto #1 coverslips. For drug treatments, ALLN (5–10 mg/ml, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and nocodazole (10 mg/ml, Sigma Chemical Co.) in Me2SO were added to the culture medium 12 h before fixation. Cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min). After fixation, cells were washed extensively in PBS and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin for 10 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 5× for 5 min each in PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies at a 10 μg/ml final concentration. Cells were washed again (5× 5 min each) and then incubated for 3 min in PBS plus 10 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Sigma Chemical Co.) to stain DNA. Cells were washed a final time, mounted onto slides in Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). For C/YFP fusion proteins, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Epifluorescence micrographs were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a 63× oil objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). Digital (12-bit) images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and processed by using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). The excitation filters used were: 355DF20 (DAPI), 440 DF20 (CFP), 490DF10 (YFP and FITC), and 570DF10 (Texas red). Emission filters were: 460DF20 (DAPI), 475 DF20 (CFP), 535DF25 (FITC and YFP), and 630 DF20 (Texas red). The dichroic measurements were: 420 DCLP (DAPI), 445DCLP (CFP), 505 DCLP (FITC and YFP), and 595DCLP (Texas red). FRET was determined as previously described (31Rajan R.S. Illing M. Bence N. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on suspended cells (∼106 cells/ml) in a Spex Fluorolog fluorometer with a Spex 1620 dual grating emission monochromator (Spex Industries, Metuchen, NJ). FRET measurements were made by exciting the donor (CFP) at 425 nm and monitoring the emission spectrum between 450 and 600 nm. All FRET spectra were corrected for background YFP fluorescence using a non-FRET pair consisting of identical amounts of YFP fusion construct and unlabeled rhodopsin (wild-type or mutant). To quantify FRET, the ratio of fluorescence at 525 nm (YFP) to the fluorescence at 476 nm (CFP) was measured. For P23H-CFP alone, this ratio was found to be 0.42 ± 0.013 (S.E., n = 5). This value was subtracted from the ratio obtained for any given sample to yield the “FRET value.” Intrinsic YFP fluorescence was recorded by excitation at 490 nm and emission between 505 and 600 nm. Slit widths were 2 mm for all experiments. GFPu-1 cells (28Bence N. Sampat R. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were harvested by trypsinization 48 h post-transfection and fixed in 4% p-formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized in a solution of PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% bovine serum albumin and stained in suspension using the indicated antibody at room temperature for 1 h followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. GFP and phycoerythrin intensities were simultaneously measured on 50,000 cells for each sample using an XLII analyzer (Coulter). Histograms were generated using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Aggregation of wild-type rhodopsin and the RP-linked mutants P23H and V345M was assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble extracts from HEK293 cells transiently expressing these constructs at varying levels (Fig.1A). At low expression levels (<0.5 μg), wild-type rhodopsin migrated predominantly as a detergent-soluble, diffuse band at a molecular mass of ∼40–43 kDa. This species corresponds to monomeric, mature rhodopsin containing complex N-linked glycans, as evidenced by its mobility and by its sensitivity to cleavage by protein:N-glycanase (PNGase) but not by endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1B). Endoglycosidase H is specific for high mannoseN-linked oligosaccharide structures typical of proteins that have not matured beyond the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas PNGase cleaves all N-linked glycans. At higher expression levels of wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 1A), additional high molecular weight species, suggestive of SDS-resistant multimers, were also detected. All of the monomeric rhodopsin partitioned into the detergent-soluble fraction, whereas the slower migrating forms partitioned into both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. These data, together with the results from immunofluorescence studies (Figs.2 and 3), are in agreement with previous studies (12Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), which concluded that the majority of rhodopsin, expressed in HEK293 cells, folds into a native conformation. At high levels of expression, a minor fraction of wild-type rhodopsin forms high molecular weight complexes that are insoluble in SDS and non-ionic detergent, suggesting that the capacity of these cells to fold rhodopsin is limited.Figure 2Aggregated rhodopsin accumulates in aggresomes.A, intracellular distribution of wild-type, V345M, and P23H in HEK293 cells.

The small amounts of monomeric P23H detected migrated with a slightly faster mobility than that of monomeric wild-type rhodopsin and were sensitive to cleavage by endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1B), indicating that they were retained within the ER. The majority of P23H, however, migrated as dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers. These oligomers are evidence of a non-native conformation, because rhodopsin is monomeric in its native membrane (33Downer N.W. Cone R.A. Biophys J. 1985; 47: 277-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A substantial fraction of P23H partitioned into the detergent-insoluble fraction, suggesting that P23H is more prone to aggregate than wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 1). In contrast to P23H, both the mobility and the detergent solubility behavior of the class I mutant, V345M, were indistinguishable from those of wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 1, A and B). Exposure of cells expressing low levels of wild-type or V345M rhodopsin to the proteasome inhibitor (ALLN) resulted in a substantial increase in the abundance of all electrophoretic rhodopsin species (Fig.1A), suggesting that some folding-competent rhodopsin molecules are degraded by the proteasome in HEK cells. Indistinguishable results were obtained in cells exposed to the more specific inhibitors MG132 (34Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) and lactacystin (35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Chois S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, exposure of P23H-expressing cells to ALLN increased the proportion of oligomeric P23H species but failed to promote the formation of mature monomer, suggesting that proteasomes also participate in the degradation of this folding-incompetent class II mutant rhodopsin. Together, these data confirm that, in HEK cells, wild-type rhodopsin and a class I mutant (V345M) are able to fold and mature beyond the ER, whereas the class II mutant P23H is unable to fold productively. Moreover, our data suggest that P23H is considerably more prone to forming non-native oligomers than is wild-type or V345M. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the intracellular localization of wild-type and mutant rhodopsins. As shown in Fig.2A, wild-type and V345M were present in a predominantly plasma membrane distribution, consistent with previous reports and with our observation (Fig. 1) that wild-type and V345M rhodopsin are detergent soluble and modified by complex oligosaccharides. In contrast, under the same conditions, P23H was present in a predominantly ER distribution (Fig. 2A), consistent with its designation as a class II mutant and with data indicating that it remains core-glycosylated (Fig. 1B). Exposure to ALLN (or other proteasome inhibitors, not shown) led to the accumulation of wild-type and mutant rhodopsins in juxtanuclear inclusion bodies resembling aggresomes (Fig. 2B). Aggresomes are pericentriolar inclusion bodies into which aggregated proteins are sequestered by active retrograde transport on microtubules (26Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 36Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). To test whether P23H-containing inclusion bodies are aggresomes, we compared the distribution of P23H foci to that of γ-tubulin, a centrosomal protein (Fig. 2C). As observed for other aggresome substrates, P23H inclusions were localized around γ-tubulin-immunoreactive sites. Rhodopsin inclusions were also associated with pericentriolar depositions of rearranged vimentin intermediate filaments and were distinct from markers for Golgi apparatus and ER (data not shown). To assess the role of microtubules in the formation of P23H inclusion bodies, cells expressing low levels of P23H were treated simultaneously with ALLN to induce accumulation of aggregates and the microtubule-destabilizing agent, nocodazole (Fig. 2B,right-hand panel). In contrast to cells treated with ALLN alone (Fig. 2B, left panel), cells treated with ALLN and nocodazole together had numerous intense, small foci of P23H that were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. However, the extent of rhodopsin aggregation, as assessed by detergent solubility and electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2D) and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (31Rajan R.S. Illing M. Bence N. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was unaffected by nocodazole treatment. These data demonstrate that protein aggregation and inclusion body formation are distinct, separable processes and that delivery of misfolded mutant or wild-type rhodopsin to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies requires an intact microtubule cytoskeleton. A direct inference from this observation is that the absence of rhodopsin-containing inclusion bodies, as in retinas from human ARDP and animal mod"

In humans Hcy is formed from methionine as a by-product of biological methylation reactions (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Kraus J.P. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle II, D.

It is not known whether protein N-homocysteinylation occurs in humans. To determine this, human blood proteins were analyzed for the presence of Hcy bound by amide or peptide linkages (Hcy-N-protein) using protein chemistry and HPLC methods. As described in this communication, Hcy is a protein amino acid in humans. [35S]Hcy-thiolactone (20,000 Ci/mol) was prepared by digestion of [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) with hydriodic acid (18Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as described before (13Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21813-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and purified by adsorption to charcoal (Sigma) and elution with 0.1 m HCl. Normal human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers as approved by the Institutional Review Board. Blood was drawn into Vacutainer EDTA tubes and chilled on ice, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Plasma from homocystinuric subjects was kindly provided by Helga Refsum, David Rosenblatt, Vivian Shih, Ling Yu Shih, and the late John Lindenbaum. Purified individual blood proteins were obtained from Sigma. Human plasma or a 50 mg/ml protein solution (0.2 ml) was treated with 5 mm DTT for 5 min at room temperature and ultrafiltered through a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane at 4 °C to remove free Hcy. Plasma proteins were washed on ultrafiltration devices six more times with 5 mmDTT in phosphate-buffered saline. This procedure removes >99% of the total Hcy from serum proteins. DTT-treated protein was diluted to 0.4 ml with 25 mm DTT. The samples were distributed in 0.1-ml aliquots into glass ampoules (1-ml volume) containing 0.1 ml of 12n HCl. The ampules were sealed under vacuum, and the samples were hydrolyzed at 120 °C for up to 4 h. This procedure quantitatively converted Hcy-N-protein into Hcy-thiolactone. After hydrolysis samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1 ml of 2m ammonium bicarbonate, 1 m dipotassium phosphate supplemented with 18,000 cpm [35S]Hcy-thiolactone, and extracted with 0.4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Hcy-thiolactone was re-extracted from the organic layer with 0.1 ml of 0.1 n HCl. The acid extracts were lyophilized and dissolved in 10 μl of water. Further purification of Hcy-thiolactone was achieved by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on cellulose (Analtech) plates (6.7 × 5 cm) as described before (15Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hcy-thiolactone, localized on TLC plates by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax x-ray film, was extracted with water (60 μl). Final purification and quantitation was achieved by cation exchange HPLC. The principle of tHcy (19Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Malinow M.R. Lentz S.R. Jacobsen D.W. Brattstrom L. Wilcken B. Wilcken D.E. Blom H.J. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Selhub J. Rosenberg I.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) determination involves its conversion to Hcy-thiolactone (20Riegel B. du Vigneaud V. J. Biol. Chem. 1935; 112: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 867-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is then detected and quantitated by HPLC. Briefly, human plasma was treated with 5 mm DTT to convert disulfide-bound forms of Hcy to free reduced Hcy and deproteinized by ultrafiltration through Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membranes at 4 °C. The ultrafiltrate (50 μl) was lyophilized on a SpeedVac concentrator and dissolved in 6 μl of 50 mm DTT, and tHcy was converted to Hcy-thiolactone by treatment with 3 μl of 6 m HCl for 30 min at 100 °C. After lyophilization, samples were dissolved in 50 μl of water and subjected to HPLC. HPLC analyses were carried out using a cation exchange PolySULFOETHYL Aspartamide column (2.1 × 200 mm, 5 μ, 300 Å) from PolyLC, Inc. and System Gold Noveau HPLC instrumentation from Beckman-Coulter. Solution A (10 mm monosodium phosphate) and solution B (200 mm NaCl in 10 mm monosodium phosphate) were used as solvents. After application of sample, the column was eluted with 25% solution B for 0.5 min and a linear gradient from 25 to 80% solution B for 5 min followed by 80% solution B for 0.5 min and 3-min re-equilibration with 25% solution B. The effluent was monitored at A240, the UV absorption maximum of Hcy-thiolactone (ε = 3,500m−1cm−1) (10Jakubowski H. Jacobson D.W. Carmel R. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 21-31Google Scholar). For each sample, the identity of the eluted material as Hcy-thiolactone was confirmed by its co-migration with an authentic Hcy-thiolactone, by its characteristic absorbance at A240, and by its sensitivity to NaOH. The detection limit was 5 pmol of Hcy-thiolactone. An example of HPLC analysis of Hcy-thiolactone content in acid hydrolysates of human plasma protein is shown in Fig.2. Control experiments with proteins containing known amounts of [35S]Hcy-N-protein showed that acid hydrolysis in the presence of DTT quantitatively liberated Hcy in the form of [35S]Hcy-thiolactone. Quantities of [35S]Hcy-thiolactone released from the labeled proteins were essentially identical at various times of hydrolysis from 1 to 4 h (not shown), indicating that hydrolysis was completed within 1 h and that Hcy-thiolactone is stable under the conditions of hydrolysis. Nevertheless, monitoring in ultraviolet light atA240 showed that the amounts of Hcy-thiolactone liberated from the hydrolyzed protein were increasing as a function of time of hydrolysis (Fig. 3). Extrapolating the amounts of Hcy-thiolactone to zero time of hydrolysis yielded actual concentrations of Hcy-N-protein. The continuous increase in Hcy-thiolactone appears to be due to a slow conversion of protein methionine to Hcy-thiolactone. Because methionine is converted to Hcy-thiolactone by the treatment with hydriodic acid at 135 °C (18Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), treatment with HCl is also likely to elicit a similar conversion to a small extent. I found that, when 5 mmmethionine was treated with 6 n HCl at 135 °C, Hcy-thiolactone formed at a rate of 2 μm/h, some 1000-fold slower than in the presence of hydriodic acid (not shown). At 120 °C the rate of conversion of methionine to Hcy-thiolactone was 0.2 μm/h (Fig. 3), similar to rates of Hcy-thiolactone release from proteins containing similar amounts of methionine (Fig.3). Because protein is completely hydrolyzed to amino acids within 1 h, the slowly released Hcy-thiolactone is derived mostly from free methionine liberated from protein rather than directly from protein-bound methionine. To further confirm that the slow increase in Hcy-thiolactone during hydrolysis with HCl is due to the presence of methionine, various serum albumins, containing from 0 to 6 methionines per protein molecule, were analyzed. Before acid hydrolysis, >99% of disulfide bond-bound Hcy has been removed from proteins by extensive treatments with DTT. The quantities of Hcy-thiolactone released from human serum albumin, which contains 6 methionine residues, increased as a function of time of hydrolysis from 1 to 4 h. Similar slopes of Hcy-thiolactoneversus time plots were observed in experiments with 50 mg/ml human serum albumin and an equivalent concentration (5 mm) of methionine. Smaller increases in Hcy-thiolactone were observed with sheep serum albumin, which contains 4 methionine residues. As expected, amounts of Hcy-thiolactone essentially did not change with time in experiments with pig and rabbit serum albumin, which contain 0 and 1 methionine residue, respectively. These observations confirm that the slow increase in Hcy-thiolactone released from protein is due to methionine. Extrapolation of the released amounts of Hcy-thiolactone to zero time indicates that 50 mg/ml solutions of human and sheep serum albumin contained 2.1 and 1.6 μmHcy-N-protein, respectively. Pig and rabbit serum albumin at 50 mg/ml contained 0.8 and 1.8 μmHcy-N-protein, respectively (Table I).Table ILevels of Hcy in albuminsAlbumin (50 mg/ml)Hcy-N-proteinHcy-S-proteinμmμmHuman2.8 ± 0.77.3 ± 0.4Sheep1.711.5Pig0.824.0Rabbit1.80.52Ovalbumin0.90.25Chicken1-aSerum was used for these measurements.1.37.4Rat1-aSerum was used for these measurements.1.64.8Mouse1-aSerum was used for these measurements.1.12.61-a Serum was used for these measurements. Open table in a new tab Albumin from each animal organism tested was found to contain Hcy-N-protein (Table I). The highest levels of Hcy-N-protein were present in human serum albumin (2.8 μm), and the lowest were in pig albumin (0.6 μm). The levels of Hcy-N-albumin did not correlate with the levels of Hcy-S-albumin (Hcy bound to albumin by a disulfide linkage, bHcy in Ref. 19Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Refsum H. Ueland P.M.

To determine whether Hcy is present in some or all proteins, individual purified human blood proteins were subjected to analyses. In absolute values, the highest amounts of Hcy-N-protein, 4.2, 2.8, and 1.2 μm, were present in 50 mg/ml solutions of human hemoglobin, serum albumin, and γ-globulins, respectively (Table II). 50 mg/ml solutions of LDL, HDL, antitrypsin, and transferrin contained 0.95, 0.85, 0.65, and 0.48 μmHcy-N-protein, respectively. Fibrinogen at 50 mg/ml contained the lowest amount of Hcy-N-protein, 0.15 μm. On a per molecule basis about 0.6% of hemoglobin molecules contained 1 molecule of Hcy in amide or peptide bonds, equivalent to 1 molecule of Hcy per 1000 molecules of protein methionine. Human serum albumin and γ-globulin contained 0.36% Hcy-N-protein. Other proteins contained from 0.04 to 0.1% Hcy-N-protein. Thus, 1 molecule of Hcy bound via amide or peptide bond is present per each 170–2500 individual protein molecules.Table IILevels of Hcy in human blood proteinsProtein (50 mg/ml)Hcy-N-proteinHcy-S-proteinμmmol %μmmol %Hemoglobin4.24 ± 0.040.60 ± 0.010.50 ± 0.050.060 ± 0.001Albumin2.8 ± 0.70.36 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.20.99 ± 0.06γ-Globulin1.20.3611.33.4LDL0.950.100.520.05HDL0.850.041.70.08Antitrypsin0.650.070.200.02Transferrin0.480.08< 0.1< 0.02Fibrinogen0.150.1< 0.2< 0.1 Open table in a new tab The levels of Hcy-N-protein in individual blood proteins appear to correlate with the reactivity of these proteins toward Hcy-thiolactone. For example, fibrinogen, found to contain about 18-fold less Hcy-N-protein than albumin (Table II), exhibits about 6-fold lower reactivity toward Hcy-thiolactone than albumin (17Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Similarly, low density lipoprotein contains about 3-fold less Hcy-N-protein than albumin and exhibits about 8-fold lower reactivity toward Hcy-thiolactone than albumin (17Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A major fraction of lysine residues in LDL and fibrinogen is not accessible to solvent and therefore not able to react with Hcy-thiolactone (17Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For comparison, the levels of disulfide bond-bound Hcy in each protein (Hcy-S-protein) are shown in Table II. As expected, significant amounts of Hcy-S-protein were present in human serum albumin, about 1 molecule per 100 protein molecules. Unexpectedly, more Hcy-S-protein, about 3.4 molecules per 100 protein molecules, was detected in γ-globulin. This suggests that γ-globulin, in addition to serum albumin, is a major component of the Hcy-S-protein pool in human plasma. Other proteins contained >10-fold less Hcy-S-protein than albumin. Fig. 4A is a plot of the individual values of plasma Hcy-N-protein and the corresponding plasma tHcy values. Overall, plasma Hcy-N-protein was positively correlated with plasma tHcy. However, a subset of plasma samples, indicated by empty circles in Fig. 4, contained much lower levels of Hcy-N-protein than expected. High levels of serum Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase, which minimizes proteinN-homocysteinylation (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), may account for low levels of Hcy-N-protein. However, this could not be examined because Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase is inactivated by EDTA (22Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3957-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in plasma samples that were available for these measurements. Fig. 4B shows that relative levels of plasma Hcy-N-protein are not correlated with the corresponding plasma tHcy values. Overall, Hcy-N-protein represented from 0.1 to 23% of plasma tHcy. The data presented in this communication show that 1) Hcy is a protein amino acid in humans and 2) plasma levels of Hcy-N-protein are positively correlated with plasma tHcy levels. These data extend our previous ex vivo observations from cultured human cells to human organism and provide direct evidence that Hcy-N-protein is a significant component of Hcy metabolism in humans. A possibility of incorporation of Hcy into protein was raised in the 1960s shortly after the identification of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency in humans (discussed in Ref. 24Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle I, D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1279-1327Google Scholar). However, no Hcy was detected in acid hydrolysates of hair from three cystathionine β-synthase-deficient patients or brain from one of these patients. These negative results are not surprising given the low sensitivity of the standard amino acid analysis methods used in these early studies. Even the highest levels of Hcy measured in human hemoglobin in the present work (1 Hcy residue per 1000 methionine residues) would have not been detected by using standard protein amino acid analysis methods. The levels of Hcy-N-protein present in individual human blood proteins (Table II) are roughly proportional to their abundance in human blood. This indicates that most of Hcy-N-protein in normal human blood is present in hemoglobin (about 75%), albumin (22%), and γ-globulins (2%). All other blood proteins contain about 1% of total Hcy-N-protein. In contrast, most of Hcy-S-protein is present in albumin (65%) and γ-globulin (25%); hemoglobin contains about 10% of Hcy-S-protein present in human blood. The metabolic role of Hcy-N-protein and Hcy-S-protein in human blood is not understood. However, it is likely that formation of these Hcy adducts with major blood proteins functions as a protective mechanism, which detoxifies Hcy and its reactive metabolites. The findings of the present work support a hypothesis that proteinN-homocysteinylation and resulting protein damage cause Hcy toxicity to human cells, especially to vascular endothelium. In previous work we have shown that Hcy-N-protein occurs in a variety of cultured human cells. In normal and cystathionine synthase-deficient fibroblasts and in breast cancer cells, Hcy-N-protein is elevated by the presence of the antifolate drug aminopterin (15Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, Hcy-N-protein level is positively correlated with tHcy and negatively correlated with methionine, folic acid, and HDL (16Jakubowski H. Zhang L. Bardeguez A. Aviv A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As shown in the present work, similar positive correlation between Hcy-N-protein and tHcy has been found in vivo in humans (Fig. 4A). Edman degradation of Hcy-N-protein from endothelial cell cultures suggests that Hcy, in addition to being linked by amide bonds to side chains of protein lysine residues, is also linked by peptide bonds (8Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2001; 131, (suppl.): 2983-2987Crossref Google Scholar, 16Jakubowski H. Zhang L. Bardeguez A. Aviv A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, in the present work it was not possible to determine what specific mechanism(s) are responsible for the presence of Hcy in human blood proteins. The formation of Hcy-N-protein, mediated byS-nitroso-Hcy, possibly accounts for the observations that atherosclerosis originates mostly at branch points in arteries (25Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. Nagel T. Anderson K.R. Garcia-Cardena G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) that are subject to mechanical stress leading to increased production of nitric oxide (26Malinski T. Mesaros S. Patton S.R. Mesarosova A. Physiol. Res. 1996; 45: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). Local concentrations of nitric oxide (26Malinski T. Mesaros S. Patton S.R. Mesarosova A. Physiol. Res. 1996; 45: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar) and S-nitroso-Hcy (12Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) are likely to be higher at arterial branch points than elsewhere. Therefore, at branch points, S-nitroso-Hcy-mediated formation of Hcy-N-protein and resulting damage would be greater than at other points in arteries. This would be particularly damaging for arterial branch points in subjects with elevated serum Hcy levels. Hcy-thiolactone is toxic to endothelial cells. For example, chronic infusions of baboons with Hcy-thiolactone cause endothelial cell injury (29Harker L.A. Slichter S.J. Scott C.R. Ross R. N. Eng. J. Med. 1974; 291: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Hcy-thiolactone, but not Hcy, was found to induce gross changes in human endothelial cell morphology and to induce cell death with apoptotic features (30Mercie P. Garnier O. Lascoste L. Renard M. Closse C. Durrieu F. Marit G. Boisseau R.M. Belloc F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These effects are likely to be caused by Hcy-thiolactone-mediated formation of Hcy-N-protein, which results in protein damage (17Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 27Liu G. Nellaiappan K. Kagan H.M. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 925-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of Hcy-N-protein in Hcy-induced toxicity has not been examined. Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase, a component of HDL, minimizes proteinN-homocysteinylation in vitro (16Jakubowski H. Zhang L. Bardeguez A. Aviv A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 22Jakubowski H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in human cardiovascular disease (31Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Mackness M.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). We have suggested that Hcy-thiolactonase activity is a better predictor of Hcy-associated vascular disease than PON1 genotype (23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hcy-thiolactonase and paraoxonase activities are highly correlated in human populations (23Jakubowski H. Ambrosius W. Pratt J.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that paraoxonase activity is a predictor of vascular disease (32Jarvik G.P. Rozek L.S. Brophy V.H. Hatsukami T.S. Richter R.J. Schellenberg G.D. Furlong C.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) supports our suggestion that Hcy-thiolactonase activity is a physiologically relevant predictor of the disease. However, the relationship of Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase to Hcy-N-protein in humans needs to be examined. This need is underscored by the present observation that in a subpopulation of human subjects levels of plasma Hcy-N-protein are much lower than in most subjects (Fig. 4). In conclusion, this work shows that Hcy is a protein amino acid in humans and that plasma Hcy-N-protein is correlated with plasma tHcy. Our finding and the observations of others suggesting that Hcy-N-protein has adverse effects on physiological function do not establish a role of Hcy-N-protein in human disease. However, they underscore the importance of examining proteinN-homocysteinylation in the context of human disease.

In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanism by which p38 kinase induces apoptosis through activation of p53. We report here that NO-induced activation of p38 kinase leads to activation of NFκB, which in turn induces transcription of the p53 gene. Activated p38 kinase also physically associates and phosphorylates the serine 15 residue of p53, which results in accumulation of p53 protein during NO-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of wild-type p53 enhanced NO-induced apoptosis, whereas expression of a dominant negative p53 blocked it, indicating that p53 plays an essential role in NO-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes. The increased accumulation of p53 caused expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that is known to cause apoptosis via release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. These results suggest that NO-activated p38 kinase activates p53 function in two different ways, transcriptional activation by NFκB and direct phosphorylation of p53 protein, leading to apoptosis of articular chondrocytes.

Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Martel-Pelletier J. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 694-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although NO-induced cartilage destruction can be caused by various ways, the increased apoptotic cell death of articular chondrocytes appears to be an important contributor (3Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 4Hashimoto S. Ochs R.L. Komiya S. Lotz M.

Rheumatol. 2001; 28: 2509-2519PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway leading to NO-induced apoptosis of chondrocyte is poorly understood. In other cell types, it has been shown that subtypes of mitogen-activated protein kinase play an important role in NO-induced apoptosis. For example, NO-induced apoptosis of neuronal progenitor cells is mediated by p38 kinase (7Cheng A. Chan S.L. Milhavet O. Wang S. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43320-43327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase but not p38 kinase are involved in NO-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (8Taimor G. Rakow A. Piper H.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2518-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our recent study demonstrated that apoptosis of chondrocyte apoptosis caused by direct production of NO with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP)1 is regulated by opposite functions of two mitogen-activated protein kinase subtypes, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 kinase, in association with the elevation of p53 protein level, caspase-3 activation, and differentiation status (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SNP treatment stimulated activation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 kinase. The activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 plays a role as an inducing signal for dedifferentiation and an inhibitory signal for NO-induced apoptosis, whereas p38 kinase functions as a signal for the maintenance of the differentiated status and as an inducing signal for apoptosis of chondrocytes. NO production is less pro-apoptotic in chondrocytes that are dedifferentiated by a serial monolayer culture that is associated with decreased potential of NO to activate p38 kinase in dedifferentiated cells compared with that in differentiated chondrocytes. Apoptotic death of NO-treated chondrocytes is due to the ability of p38 kinase to stimulate caspase-3 activity, an inducer of apoptosis, and to stimulate expression and/or accumulation of p53, a known signaling molecule that acts upstream of caspase-3 (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D.

The signaling pathways leading to caspase activation during apoptosis involves the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors from injured mitochondria. The release is mediated by the translocation of cytosolic Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, to mitochondria in response to various apoptotic stimuli (10Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J.

Several studies indicate that p53 regulates the function of Bax and mitochondrial integrity (14Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). p53 has a short half-life, and the pro-apoptotic function of p53 is achieved by increased expression at the transcriptional level and by post-translational stabilization of the protein by escaping from ubiquitin-dependent degradation (17Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 18Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites is the main post-translational modification that is regulated by several different protein kinases depending on types of cells and extracellular stimuli. The protein kinases include ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (19Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition to p53, mounting evidence indicates that a nuclear factor κB (NFκB) regulates apoptosis by protecting cells from apoptosis in most cases. However, NFκB also has pro-apoptotic function, depending on cell type and extracellular stimuli (28Foo S.Y Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 6: 229-235Google Scholar). NFκB exists in a latent form in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells bound to an inhibitory protein, IκB. Upon stimulation of cells, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated at serine residues, leading to ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The released NFκB dimer from IκB then translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes by binding to the promoter/enhancer region (29Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The known target genes of NFκB include both apoptosis-protective genes such as Bcl-2 (30de Moissac D. Zheng H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 29505-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and pro-apoptotic p53 (31Zhang L.H. Youn H.D. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43534-43540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cell type- and extracellular stimuli-dependent effects of NFκB on apoptosis may be due to its specific effects on the expression of apoptosis-regulating genes. The functional relationship between NFκB and p53 during the regulation of apoptosis is controversial, especially when NFκB functions as a pro-apoptotic signal. For instance, genotoxic agents stimulate transcription of p53 via activation of NFκB (31Zhang L.H. Youn H.D. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43534-43540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas induction of p53 causes activation of NFκB, that correlates with the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (32Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Thus, NFκB appears to function as either an upstream or downstream signaling molecule of p53 during the apoptotic process. Moreover, there is no available evidence indicating the involvement of NFκB and its relationship with p53 in NO-induced apoptosis. We therefore investigated the role and underlying molecular mechanism of NFκB and p53 in NO-induced and p38 kinase-mediated apoptosis of rabbit articular chondrocytes by using SNP as a NO donor. The investigation additionally focused on the characterization of the downstream signal of p53. We report here that NO-induced activation of p38 kinase activates NFκB, which led to increased transcriptional expression p53. p38 kinase also associated with and phosphorylated the serine 15 residue of p53, which caused accumulation of p53 by stabilization of the protein. The increased expression and accumulation of p53 caused apoptosis by inducing expression and activation of pro-apoptotic Bax. Rabbit articular chondrocytes were released from cartilage slices by enzymatic digestion, as previously described (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J.

To summarize, cartilage slices were dissociated enzymatically for 6 h in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg solid, Sigma). Individual cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin, after which they were plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104cells/cm2. The cells from day 3 cultures were treated with various concentrations of SNP for the indicated period and reached confluence in ∼5 days. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with various inhibitors or activators for 30 min unless otherwise indicated, including 50 μg/ml of SN-50 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) to inhibit nuclear translocation of NFκB (33Lin Y.Z.

NO production was measured by estimating nitrite using the Griess reagent as previously described (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-3 was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm after cleavage of the synthetic substrate acetyl-DEVD-p-nitroanilide as described previously (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D.

Apoptotic cell death in this study was quantified by a flow cytometric assay based on the number of cells with fragmented DNA (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H.

Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation and fixed in 80% ethanol that had been precooled to −20 °C. The cells were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h. The number of cells with fragmented DNA was then quantified using 1–2 × 104 cells on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and inhibitors of proteases (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatases (1 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4). Samples were precipitated with antibody against p38 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or phosphorylated p38 kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce). The immune complex was used for Western blot analysis or p38 kinase assay as previously described (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For p38 kinase assay, the beads were re-suspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate (New England Biolabs). The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C, and ATF-2 phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. To determine direct phosphorylation of p53 by p38 kinase, cells were treated with SNP for 12 h, and active p38 kinase was precipitated with phospho-specific anti-p38 kinase antibody (New England Biolabs). Immune complex kinase assays were then performed as described above using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of p53. After electrophoresis and transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, phosphorylation of p53 was determined by Western blot analysis using phosphorylation site-specific anti-p53 monoclonal antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Chondrocytes were treated with various concentrations of SNP for the indicated time period. Nuclear extracts were then prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases as described above and lysed by the addition of 0.07% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and re-suspended in extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA and inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases. Nuclear protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts (10 μg) were assayed for NFκB DNA binding activity as described by Rupec and Baeuerle (36Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (the binding site is underlined: Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions were performed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min, and samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For the luciferase assay, chondrocytes were transfected with plasmid containing luciferase and three tandem repeats of serum response element or a control vector. In experiments where indicated, chondrocytes were co-transfected with dominant negative forms of IKKα, IKKβ, or IκBα (37Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W.

Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Transfection of the expression vector was performed as described previously (40Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J., Oh, C.-D., Ju, J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The expression vector was introduced to cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h and used for further assay as indicated in each experiment. Luciferase gene expression and activity were analyzed using an assay kit purchased from Promega and normalized by β-galactosidase activity. Total RNA was isolated by a single step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 42 C. Reverse transcription reactions were subjected to PCR withTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for a total of 25 cycles. The PCR primers used were p53 (532-bp product) sense, 5′-CAGCAGCTCCTGCACCAGAGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-ATGCCCCCCATGCAGCAGCTG-3′, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (363-bp product) sense, 5′-CATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Pulse-chase analysis of p53 protein was performed to determine p53 stability. Briefly, chondrocytes, treated with 1 mm SNP for 24 h were preincubated for 20 min in methionine-free medium, pulse-labeled for 30 min with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, washed twice, and incubated in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h. At each indicated time point, the cells were lysed, and p53 protein was immunoprecipitated as described above. [35S]Methionine-labeled p53 was detected by autoradiography. Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins using a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using antibodies purchased from the following sources. Mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody was from New England Biolabs, phosphorylation site-specific anti-p53 polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies was from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-IκB and anti-Bax antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and mouse monoclonal p21 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence system. Treatment of chondrocytes with SNP (1 mm) leads to activation of the NFκB transcription factor as determined by the increased DNA binding activity of NFκB (Fig. 1A), transcriptional activation of the NFκB-responsive promoter (Fig.1B), and degradation of IκB (Fig. 1C). SNP-induced activation of NFκB was blocked by the addition of 50 μg/ml SN-50, an inhibitory peptide for nuclear translocation of the activated NFκB. Because NFκB can either protect or stimulate apoptosis, depending on cell type and extracellular stimuli, we examined whether NFκB activation is essential for NO-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.2A, inhibition of NFκB activity with the SN-50 peptide significantly blocked SNP-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. SNP-induced NFκB activation (Fig.2B) and apoptosis (Fig. 2C) were also blocked by the transient expression of dominant negative forms of IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) or IκBα. Therefore, the above results clearly indicate that SNP-induced activation of NFκB functions as a pro-apoptotic signal in articular chondrocytes.Figure 2Pro-apoptotic role of NFκB in SNP-treated chondrocytes.A, apoptotic cells (filled bars) and caspase-3 activity (open bars) were determined from chondrocytes untreated (Control) or treated with 1 mm SNP for 24 h that was pretreated for 30 min with vehicle alone or 50 μg/ml SN-50.B and C, chondrocytes were co-transfected with the NFκB reporter gene with empty vector (Control) or vector containing cDNA for the dominant negative form of IKKα, IKKβ, or IκBα. After incubation of cells in complete medium for 24 h, the cells were treated with 1 mm SNP for 24 h. NFκB activity was determined by measuring luciferase activity (B), and apoptotic cells were determined by flow cytometric analysis (C). The data represent average values with S.D.

Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) indicate that NO production in chondrocytes activates p38 kinase, which signals the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, in the present study we examined the role of p38 kinase in NFκB activation. Consistent with our previous observation, SNP treatment caused transient activation of p38 kinase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3A). Blocking p38 kinase activation by treatment with SB203580 or ectopic expression of dominant negative p38 kinase inhibited NO-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Treatment of cells with SN-50 peptide before SNP treatment, a condition that inhibits NFκB activation (Fig. 1, A and B) did not affect SNP-induced p38 kinase activation (Fig. 3C). However, inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 or expression of dominant negative p38 kinase significantly blocked SNP-induced IκB degradation (Fig. 3C) and NFκB transcriptional activity (Fig.3D). Therefore, activation of p38 kinase appears to lead to NFκB activation in SNP-treated articular chondrocytes. Our previous study showed that p38 kinase-mediated apoptosis of SNP-treated chondrocytes is associated with an increase in p53 protein level (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional relationship between NFκB activation and p53 protein level, the effects of NFκB inhibition on p53 protein level were first examined. The SNP-induced increase in p53 protein level was abrogated by the inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 or expression of dominant negative p38 kinase. Inhibition of NFκB with SN-50 peptide or by forced expression of dominant negative IKKα, IKKβ, or IκBα also abrogated the SNP-induced increase in p53 protein level (Fig.4A). In contrast, however, ectopic expression of wild-type p53 or dominant negative p53 did not affect SNP-induced IκB degradation (Fig. 4B), indicating that NFκB activity is necessary to increase the p53 protein level in response to NO. We next examined the role of p53 in caspase activation and apoptosis to determine whether the increase in p53 protein level is directly involved in NO-induced apoptosis. Forced expression of a dominant negative mutant form of p53 (p53273) blocked SNP-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of chondrocytes (Fig. 4,C and D). In contrast, ectopic expression of wild-type p53 significantly enhanced SNP-induced caspase activity and apoptosis (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating an essential role for p53 in NO-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism leading to the increase in p53 protein level, we first examined whether p53 proteins are accumulated during NO-induced apoptosis by transcriptional activation of thep53 gene. Consistent with the increased protein level, mRNA transcript levels of p53, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR, were also increased in a time-dependent manner in cells treated with SNP (Fig.5A). The enhanced transcription of p53 was reduced by the inhibition of NFκB (with SN-50 peptide) or p38 kinase (with SB203580 or ectopic expression of a dominant negative p38 kinase) (Fig. 5B), indicating that NFκB-mediated enhanced transcription of p53 leads to accumulation of p53 protein during NO-induced apoptosis. In addition to transcriptional regulation, p53 activity is more commonly regulated by post-translational stabilization of protein that blocks ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (29Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Therefore, pulse-chase analyses were used to determine whether NO production causes an alteration in the p53 half-life. The results, shown in Fig.6A, clearly indicate a dramatically increased half-life of p53 in SNP-treated cells, suggesting that post-translational stabilization of p53 also contributes to the increased p53 protein level upon production of NO. Because phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites commonly leads to its stabilization, we determined which site(s) of p53 is phosphorylated in response to SNP treatment by Western blot analysis using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Among the phosphorylation sites tested, SNP treatment caused significantly increased phosphorylation at serine 15 (Fig. 6B). The kinetics of dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation on serine 15 (Fig.6C) is similar to that of the increase in p53 protein level (9Kim S.-J., Ju, J.-W., Oh, C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K.

Here we demonstrate that in human primary monocytes, plasmin stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling via phosphorylation of MAPK kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6) and p38 MAPK that triggers subsequent DNA binding of transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). The AP-1 complex contained phosphorylated c-Jun and ATF2, and its DNA binding activity was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In addition, plasmin elicits Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, as detected by phosphorylation of JAK1 tyrosine kinase and STAT1 and STAT3 proteins. Plasmin-induced DNA binding of STAT1 and STAT3 was blocked by SB203580 and AG490, inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JAK, respectively, but not by U0126, an inhibitor of MKK1/2. DNA binding of NF-κB remained unaffected by any of these inhibitors. The plasmin-induced signaling led to expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and CD40, which required activation of both p38 MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Additionally, signaling through both p38 MAPK and JAK is involved in the plasmin-mediated monocyte migration, whereas the formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced chemotaxis remained unaffected. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel function of the serine protease plasmin in a proinflammatory signaling network.

A number of membrane-associated macromolecules including annexin II, gangliosides, α-enolase, and TIP49a are able to bind plasmin and plasminogen, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of these binding sites (1Plow E.F.

Specifically on blood cells, the functional consequences of membrane-bound plasmin have usually been regarded in terms of amplification of the fibrinolytic activity (1Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A.

However, the serine protease plasmin might have functions beyond fibrinolysis. Thus, plasmin induces neutrophil aggregation and platelet degranulation, implying activity as a proinflammatory agonist (4Ryan T.J. Lai L. Malik A.B. J. Cell.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasmin was found to be a potent and selective stimulus for human monocytes eliciting release of lipid mediators, such as chemotactic leukotriene B4, as well as a chemotactic response equipotent to that of fMLP,1 and proinflammatory cytokine and tissue factor expression (6Weide I.

Monocyte stimulation with plasmin requires binding of plasmin via its lysine binding sites and an active catalytic center (6Weide I. Tippler B. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Weide I. Ro¨misch J. Simmet T. Blood. 1994; 83: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Syrovets T. Jendrach M.

Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect is specific for plasmin because it cannot be mimicked by the zymogen plasminogen or other serine proteases such as α-chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase, or cathepsin G (6Weide I.

Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of plasmin for inflammatory reactions was further demonstrated in plasminogen-deficient mice, in which monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation as well as the development of atherosclerosis was severely impaired (10Ploplis V.A. French E.L. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Plow E.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 2005-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ploplis V.A. Carmeliet P. Vazirzadeh S. van Vlaenderen I. Moons L. Plow E.F. Collen D. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). One of the major signaling pathways controlling expression of different proinflammatory genes is the MAPK pathway. The MAPK family consists of three subgroups, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPK; all of them require dual (Tyr/Thr) phosphorylation for activation (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). ERK kinases are typically activated by growth factor receptor activation of the Ras/Raf and ERK1/2 kinases signaling pathway. MAPKs regulate several transcription factors involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). A variety of stimuli elicit stimulation of JNK and p38 MAPK through activation of upstream MKK4/7 and MKK3/6, respectively (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Activated JNK and p38 kinases translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors of the Jun family, which regulate expression of genes of proinflammatory molecules such as c-Fos, MCP-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). JAKs have been reported to mediate signaling of some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), supposedly including the chemokine receptors for stromal cell-derived factor-1α and MCP-1 (13Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Mañes S. Martinez-A C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Likewise, thrombin-mediated activation of protease-activated receptor 1, another GPCR, leads also to phosphorylation of JAKs (14Madamanchi N.R., Li, S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Four members of the JAK family were identified so far, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (15Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Following activation of chemokine receptors, JAK kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, subsequently leading to a conformational change that creates a docking site for STATs (15Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation by JAKs, STAT transcription factors form homo- or heterodimers and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression of proteins of the acute phase such as MCP-1 and CD40 (15Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Zhou Z.H.L. Chaturvedi P. Han Y.L. Aras S., Li, Y.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Ping D. Boss J.M. Ransohoff R.M. J.

Peri G. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 760-765PubMed Google Scholar). It is chemotactic for monocytes as well as for activated T cells and natural killer cells (21Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Allavena P. Bianchi G. Zhou D. van Damme J. Jilek P. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3233-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); its major role is therefore recruitment of immunocompetent cells to sites of inflammation. Activation of monocytes by immunocompetent cells is dependent both on cytokine- and cell contact-mediated signals. CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is expressed on many cells associated with inflammatory reactions including monocytes, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (23Scho¨nbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of CD40 with its ligand CD154 (presented for example by activated T cells) triggers cell-mediated stimulation of monocytes, leading to expression of adhesion molecules, release of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased nitric oxide production (23Scho¨nbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the CD40/CD154 signaling system may have severe consequences for the immune response, and persistent stimulation may indeed contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (23Scho¨nbeck U.

Plasmin-induced monocyte chemotaxis proceeds via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and can be blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (9Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because G proteins and protein kinase C may induce MAPK activation (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, 27Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), the role of MAPKs in plasmin-triggered signaling and monocyte chemotaxis was investigated. Here we show that in addition to p38 MAPK, plasmin activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and that both signals cooperate in the induction of MCP-1 and CD40 gene expression as well as in the plasmin-mediated monocyte migration. Human plasmin was from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany). Kinase-specific inhibitors and control compounds SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole), SB202474 (4-(ethyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole), U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene), and AG490 (α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide) were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies against MKK3 and phosphorylated forms of MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, and anti-phosphotyrosine and against phosphorylated ATF2 and c-Jun (Ser-63) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against total and phosphorylated forms of Tyk2, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, STAT1α, and STAT3 were from BioSource International (Nivelles, Belgium). Anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD PharMingen. RPMI 1640,Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, fMLP, and endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5) were purchased from Sigma. Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences. Oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads were from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Human primary monocytes were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (8Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu¨le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations with 94% or more CD14+ cells were used. Contaminating cells were lymphocytes (2–6%). Flow cytometry of cells stained additionally with anti-CD41 antibodies did not show any platelets associated with monocytes. Monocytes were generally incubated in lysine-free RPMI 1640 in the presence or absence of LPS-free human plasmin (0.043–0.86 Committee on Thrombolytic Agents (CTA) units/ml). All plasmin batches were routinely tested with the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay for LPS contamination. Occasionally monocytes were stimulated with either LPS or UVC irradiation (254 nm, 500 J/m2 for 2 min) as control stimulus. Freshly isolated human primary monocytes were cultured for 16 h in lysine- and serum-free media on hydrophobic PetriPerm membranes to reduce stress signaling by the isolation procedure. Monocytes (2 × 106 cells/assay) were then stimulated as indicated. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 500 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 8% glycerol (v/v), and mammalian protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), precleared by normal rabbit antiserum (Sigma) with 20 μl of protein-G agarose (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and the same amount of protein-G agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes (10 min at 4 °C) with lysis buffer, proteins bound to the beads were solubilized in sample lysis buffer and resolved by 8% Tricine-SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (28Burysek L. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2345-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, whole cell lysates were directly resolved by PAGE. Blots were immunostained with specific antisera, and antibody complexes were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) with subsequent exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes were preincubated for 30 min with or without inhibitors before stimulation with plasmin (0.43 CTA units/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were prepared as described (8Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu¨le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). AP-1 and NF-κB DNA-protein interactions were assayed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with 50,000 cpm of32P-end labeled site-specific DNA probes in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in 15 μl of binding buffer (8Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu¨le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with corresponding antibodies (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C (8Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu¨le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). STAT activation in monocytes stimulated with plasmin for 25 min was assayed with sis-inducible element (SIE)-oligonucleotide from thec-fos promoter according to Kube et al. (29Kube D. Holtick U. Vockerodt M. Ahmadi T. Haier B. Heinrich P.C. Diehl V. Tesch H. Blood. 2001; 98: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Antibodies against STAT1 (clone E-23) and STAT3 (clone H-190) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added 10 min after addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and incubation proceeded for another 20 min at 24 °C. mRNA isolated from monocytes (0.5 × 106 cells/assay) with Oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR using primers specific for human MCP-1 and CD40 (30Seino Y.

Guret C. Madrid-Marina V. Sun Y. Martinez-Valdez H. Nature. 2001; 410: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conditions were such that the PCR reactions did not reach the saturation phase. Electrophoresis in 2% TBE-agarose gels showed amplification products of the appropriate size. Control experiments without reverse transcriptase showed no DNA contamination. HLA(B) served as internal standard for normalization of PCR reactions (8Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu¨le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing (ABI Prism 310; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). MCP-1 was assayed in cell-free supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For flow cytometric analysis of CD40 expression, monocytes plated on hydrophobic PetriPerm membranes (In Vitro Systems, Osterode, Germany) were stimulated with plasmin (0.43 CTA units/ml) or LPS (1μg/ml) for 4 or 8 h. Cells were detached by scraping, stained with monoclonal anti-CD40 or control IgG mouse antibodies and anti-CD-14 monoclonal antibodies (BD PharMingen), and analyzed by FACScan (BD PharMingen). Cell migration was analyzed in triplicate using tissue culture-treated 24-well Transwell plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with polycarbonate membranes of pore size of 5 μm (9Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes were suspended in Hank’s balanced salt solution containing 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and 100 μl was added to the upper compartment of each well. Chemoattractants or solvents were added to the lower compartments, and cells were allowed to migrate at 37 °C for 90 min. Polycarbonate membranes were fixed, and then stained with hematoxylin (Accustain; Sigma). Migrated cells were counted in seven high power oil-immersion fields (×100) (9Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). fMLP (10 nm) was used as standard chemoattractant. Pharmacological inhibitors were added to both upper and lower compartments 30 min before the addition of chemoattractants. Values shown represent mean ± S.E. where applicable. Statistical significance was calculated with the Newman-Keuls test. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. Based on previous studies showing plasmin-induced and G protein-mediated proinflammatory stimulation of human primary monocytes, we now investigated whether plasmin might elicit activation of MAPKs. Stimulation of human monocytes with 0.43 CTA units/ml plasmin led to time-dependent stimulation of p38 MAPK (Fig.1A). A detectable increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurred as early as 5 min after plasmin exposure with a maximum at 30 min and a decrease at 60 min. In addition, plasmin was found to stimulate time-dependent activation of MKK3/6, kinases upstream from p38 MAPK, as shown by immunoblot of phosphorylated MKK3/6 (Fig. 1A). Both MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK were phosphorylated as early as 5 min after plasmin stimulation, showing closely correlating activation kinetics, although activation of p38 MAPK occurred somewhat earlier than that of MKK3/6, suggesting some additional mechanism of p38 phosphorylation. Plasmin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK followed a classical bell-shaped concentration-response curve with the highest response at 0.43 CTA units/ml plasmin, a concentration that had previously triggered maximum responses in terms of chemotaxis and cytokine and lipid mediator release (6Weide I. Tippler B. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Weide I. Ro¨misch J. Simmet T.

At this concentration, p38 phosphorylation level was somewhat lower than that seen after UVC irradiation (254 nm, 500 J/m2) used as positive control (Fig. 1B). Activation of p38 MAPK is often associated with stimulation of ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK signaling pathways (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, 32Vouret-Craviari V. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Scimeca J.C. Van Obberghen E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem.

Maruyama T. Kimura S. Takuwa Y. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, stimulation of these MAPKs could not be detected by Western blotting in plasmin-stimulated human monocytes (data not shown). GPCRs do not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity for downstream signaling. In light of the pertussis toxin sensitivity of plasmin-induced signaling (6Weide I. Tippler B. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the recent demonstration that JAK kinases can mediate signaling from different GPCRs (13Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Mañes S. Martinez-A C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of different JAK kinases was studied in plasmin-stimulated monocytes. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Exposure of monocytes to 0.43 CTA units/ml plasmin resulted in strong stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 (Fig.2). The increase in JAK1 phosphorylation was observed already 5 min after stimulation and rapidly decreased so that after 30 min, no phosphorylated JAK1 protein could be detected any more. Plasmin stimulation did not induce phosphorylation of any of the other members of the JAK family, JAK2, JAK3, or TYK2 (Fig.2). To address the question of whether plasmin-mediated activation of JAK1 kinase leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, membranes used for detection of activated JAKs were stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT1 or -STAT3 antibodies. As shown in Fig.3A, after stimulation with 0.43 CTA units/ml plasmin, both STAT1 and STAT3 were phosphorylated at tyrosine residues (known to be Tyr-701 or Tyr-705 for STAT1 and STAT3, respectively). Maximum levels of tyrosine phosphorylation occurred between 5 and 10 min after stimulation; although STAT1 activation had vanished already after 15 min, the phosphorylated form of STAT3 still remained detectable at this time point. Dual phosphorylation of STAT proteins at both tyrosine and serine 727 residues is generally required for maximum transcriptional activity (35Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides tyrosine phosphorylation, changes in serine phosphorylation were additionally investigated using phospho-specific antibodies recognizing STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylated at serine 727. Indeed, Western blot analysis of lysed monocytes showed that 0.43 CTA units/ml plasmin induced rapid and transient Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 within 5 min after stimulation (Fig.3, B and C). Ser-727 phosphorylations of both STAT proteins (Fig. 3, B and C) corresponded favorably with the activation kinetics of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1A) that might act as an upstream kinase phosphorylating STAT proteins (35Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 36Gollob J.A. Schnipper C.P. Murphy E.A. Ritz J. Frank D.A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28340-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The significance of both JAK and p38 MAPK activity for the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was confirmed by experiments demonstrating that phosphorylation was inhibited by the respective inhibitors AG490 (50 μm) and SB203580 (1 μm) but not by U0126 (1 μm), an inhibitor of MKK1/2 (Fig. 4). U0126 (1 μm) was, however, effectively inhibiting the LPS (100 ng/ml)-induced TNF-α generation (data not shown), which is MKK1/2-ERK1/2-dependent (38Scherle P.A. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Daulerio A.J. Covington M.B. Nurnberg S.A. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5681-5686PubMed Google Scholar), confirming inhibitory efficacy at the concentration used. Thus, via activation of a so far unidentified receptor, plasmin stimulates p38 MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, implying activation of further cellular responses by these signaling cascades. Based on the plasmin-induced phosphorylation of STAT proteins, DNA binding activity of STATs was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Although no DNA binding activity recognizing the sis-inducible element of the c-fos gene, a known response element for STAT1 and STAT3, was detected in nuclear extracts from untreated monocytes, formation of DNA-protein complexes was observed in extracts from plasmin (0.43 CTA units/ml)-stimulated monocytes (Fig.5A). Preincubation of nuclear extracts with specific antibodies revealed that the protein-DNA complex with lower mobility contained STAT3, whereas the complex with higher mobility contained STAT1. The specificity of STAT binding was confirmed in competition experiments; a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled STAT, but not of AP-2 consensus oligonucleotides, abolished binding of the nuclear extracts to the labeled STAT binding site sequence. Preincubation of monocytes for 30 min with either 1 μmSB203580 or 50 μm AG490 as inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JAK, respectively, totally abolished the DNA binding activity, indicating that the dual phosphorylation of STATs elicited by p38 and JAK1 is essential for the plasmin-induced STAT activation. U0126 (1 μm), the inhibitor of the MKK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, had no effect on STAT activation (Fig. 5A). The p38 MAPK is believed to play an important role in AP-1-dependent gene expression through phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which may form heterodimers with phosphorylated c-Jun (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81"

This study investigated the possibility that treatment with the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid might prevent interleukin-1β-induced deterioration in neuronal function. Assessment of four markers of apoptotic cell death, cytochrome c translocation, caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and terminal dUTP nick-end staining, revealed an age-related increase in each of these measures, and the evidence presented indicates that treatment of aged rats with eicosapentaenoate reversed these changes as well as the accompanying increases in interleukin-1β concentration and p38 activation. The data are consistent with the idea that activation of p38 plays a significant role in inducing the changes described since interleukin-1β-induced activation of cytochrome ctranslocation and caspase-3 activation in cortical tissue in vitro were reversed by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. The age-related increases in interleukin-1β concentration and p38 activation in cortex were mirrored by similar changes in hippocampus. These changes were coupled with an age-related deficit in long term potentiation in perforant path-granule cell synapses, while eicosapentaenoate treatment was associated with reversal of age-related changes in interleukin-1β and p38 and with restoration of long term potentiation.

Significantly, we have recently reported that the age-related increases in IL-1β concentration and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity, as well as the decrease in LTP, are reversed by treatment with the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (22McGahon B.M. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study we have attempted to identify the downstream consequences of the coupled age-related increases in IL-1β concentration and p38 activation in neuronal tissue. In particular, we have focused on assessing whether these changes might trigger apoptotic changes in neuronal tissue as it does in other tissues and have analyzed the effect of the ethyl ester of the ω-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on age-related changes in cortex and hippocampus. The data indicate that dietary manipulation reversed several changes in the aged cortex that are indicative of apoptotic cell death as well as age-related changes in IL-1β concentration, p38 activation, and LTP in hippocampus. Groups of young and aged male Wistar rats (300–350 g), maintained at an ambient temperature of 22–23 °C under a 12-h light-dark schedule, were subdivided into those that were fed on a diet enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl eicosapentaenoate, 10 mg/rat/day for 3 weeks and 20 mg/rat/day for 5 weeks; Laxdale Research Ltd.) or standard laboratory chow for 8 weeks. Daily food intake was assessed for 2 weeks prior to commencement of the treatment: mean values (±S.E.) were 21.25 ± 1.4 and 18.55 ± 0.6 g/day for 4- and 22-month-old rats, respectively. At this time the mean body weights of young rats assigned to control and experimental groups were 265.6 ± 9.1 and 250.2 ± 11.7 g, respectively; corresponding values in aged rats were 483.6 ± 9.8 and 481.2 ± 7.9 g, respectively. Diet was prepared fresh each day, and rats were offered 100% of their daily intake. Mean daily food intake in all groups remained unchanged throughout the 8-week treatment period, and at the end of this time mean body weights of young rats assigned to control and experimental groups were 366.4 ± 13.4 and 354.5 ± 19.4 g, respectively; corresponding values in aged rats were 473.7 ± 11.4 and 462.9 ± 6.3 g, respectively. At this time rats were 4 and 22 months old. Rats were maintained under veterinary supervision for the duration of this experiment. At the end of the 8-week treatment, LTP was induced as described previously (19Murray C.A. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5g/kg), recording and stimulating electrodes were placed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to bregma) and perforant path, respectively (angular bundle, 4.4 mm lateral to lambda), and stable baseline recordings were made before electrophysiological recording at test shock frequency (1/30 s) commenced for 10 min before and 40 min after tetanic stimulation (three trains of stimuli; 250 Hz for 200 ms; intertrain interval, 30 s). Rats were then killed by decapitation, and the hippocampus and cortex were removed, cross-chopped into slices (350 × 350 μm), and frozen separately in 1 ml of Krebs’ solution (136 mm NaCl, 2.54 mm KCl, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 1.18 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 16 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 1.13 mmCaCl2) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (22McGahon B.M. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For analysis, thawed slices were rinsed three times in fresh buffer and used as described below. IL-1β concentration was analyzed in homogenate prepared from cortex and hippocampus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems). Antibody-coated (100 μl; 1.0 μg/ml final concentration diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3; goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, washed several times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 300 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3 containing 5% sucrose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% NaN3), and washed. IL-1β standards (100 μl; 0–1,000 pg/ml in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) or samples (homogenized in Krebs’ solution containing 2 mm CaCl2) were added, and incubation proceeded for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody (100 μl; final concentration, 350 ng/ml in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum; biotinylated goat anti-rat IL-1β antibody) was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, detection agent (100 μl; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) was added, and incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. Substrate solution (100 μl; 1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine) was added and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h after which time the reaction was stopped using 50 μl of 1 mH2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm, and values were corrected for protein (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) and expressed as pg of IL-1β/mg of protein. p38 phosphorylation was analyzed in samples of homogenate prepared from hippocampus and cortex; cytosolic cytochromec and expression of 116-kDa PARP were analyzed in cortical tissue. p38 activity was also assessed in freshly prepared hippocampal and cortical tissue that was incubated for 20 min in the absence or presence of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml), while cytochrome ctranslocation was assessed in vitro following incubation of slices of cortex with IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of IL-1ra (350 ng/ml) or SB203580 (50 μm). For analysis of p38 in all experiments and also for PARP, homogenate was diluted to equalize for protein concentration, and aliquots (10 μl, 1 mg/ml) were added to 10 μl of sample buffer (0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto 10% SDS gels. In the case of cytochrome c, cytosolic fractions were prepared by homogenizing slices of cortex in lysis buffer (20 mm hEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubating for 20 min on ice, and centrifuging (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (i.e. cytosolic fraction) was suspended in sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue) to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (6 μg/lane) onto 12% gels. In all cases proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. In the case of p38, anti-phospho-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk) and peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgM (1:1,000; Amersham Biosciences) were used. In the case of PARP, we immunoblotted with an antibody (1:2,000) raised against the epitope corresponding to amino acids 764–1014 of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To assess cytochrome c, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1–104 of cytochromec (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. In addition to loading equal amounts of protein, some blots were reprobed for analysis of total (rather than phosphorylated) p38, and in other cases blots were probed with an anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loading. Data from these experiments showed no differences between treatment groups. In all experiments, immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences). Quantification of protein bands was achieved by densitometric analysis using two software packages, Grab It (Grab It Annotating Grabber, Version 2.04.7, Synotics, UVP Ltd.) and Gelworks (Gelworks ID, Version 2.51, UVP Ltd.) for photography and densitometry, respectively. Slices of cortical tissue prepared from young and aged rats were washed, homogenized in lysis buffer (400 μl; 25 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4), incubated on ice for 20 min, analyzed for protein concentration, and diluted to equalize for protein concentration. In some experiments, slices prepared from control young rats were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) to which IL-1ra (350 ng/ml) or SB203580 (50 μm) was added; these samples were treated as described above. All samples (98 μl) were added to 2 μl of caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC peptide, Alexis Corp.; 5 μm), transferred to a 96-well plate, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was assessed (excitation, 390 nm; emission, 510 nm), and enzyme activity was calculated with reference to a standard curve of AFC (0–10 μm) concentration versusabsorbance. Total RNA was extracted from cortical neurons (26MacManus A. Ramsden M. Murray M. Pearson H.A. Campbell V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using TRI reagent (Sigma). cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer (Superscript reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). Equal amounts of cDNA were used for PCR amplification for a total of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min and 58 °C for 2 min. A final extension step was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min. Multiplex PCR was performed using the Quantitative PCR Cytopress Detection kit (Rat Apoptosis Set 2; BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) generating caspase-3 PCR products of 320 bp and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR products of 532 bp. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, photographed, and quantified using densitometry. Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as a standard to quantify the relative expression of caspase-3 mRNA. Cortical slices (350 × 350 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in HEPES-buffered Krebs’ solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMg2SO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 30 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) containing trypsin (1 mg/ml), DNase (1,600 kilounits/liter), protease X (1 mg/ml), and protease XIV (1 mg/ml). Slices were washed, triturated, and passed through a nylon mesh filter. Cells were centrifuged (1,000 rpm for 1 min), resuspended in HEPES-buffered Krebs’ solution, plated onto coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (w/v) for 30 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS (v/v) for 15 min. Cells were incubated in normal goat serum in PBS (v/v) to block nonspecific binding, treated with anti-phosphospecific p38 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-caspase-3 (1:500; BioSource), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in the dark for 2 h in either fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (1:100; BioSource) or R-phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; BioSource) to visualize labeling with p38 and caspase-3, respectively. Following a further wash, slides were mounted using 2 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine in 50% glycerol in PBS (v/v) and sealed. Fluorescence was analyzed using the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system in which the fluorochromes were excited by laser light emitted at 565 and 494 nm and detected at 578 and 520 nm, which measured bound R-phycoerythrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively. Cells were analyzed at ×63 magnification under oil immersion with the laser at 100% power. The images were analyzed using the Bio-Rad software, and the Kalman filter was used to decrease background. In this system R-phycoerythrin-labeled cells are stained red, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells are stained green. In a separate series of experiments, groups of aged and young rats were killed and brains were rapidly removed, coated in OCT compound, immersed in an isopentane bath over liquid nitrogen, and used to prepare sections for analysis of phosphorylated p38 as described above. Apoptotic cell death was assessed using the DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega). Cells were permeabilized and fixed in paraformaldehyde as described above. In separate experiments cultured cortical neurons were prepared from neonatal rats as described previously (26MacManus A. Ramsden M. Murray M. Pearson H.A. Campbell V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and maintained in neurobasal medium for 12 days before incubating in the absence or presence of IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 72 h. Biotinylated nucleotide was incorporated at 3′-OH DNA ends by incubating cells with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 30 min at 37 °C. Washed cells were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and then incubated in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen solution, and TUNEL-positive cells were calculated as a proportion of the total cell number. IL-1β concentration and p38 activity were both significantly increased in cortical tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats (p < 0.05, ANOVA; Fig. 1, a andb), but EPA suppressed these age-related changes so that the values in tissue prepared from EPA-treated rats were not significantly different from control values. In vitro analysis revealed that IL-1β significantly enhanced p38 activity in cortical tissue (Fig. 1c). In parallel with this observation, we found that cytochrome c translocation was significantly increased in cortical tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with tissue prepared from either group of young rats (p < 0.05, ANOVA; Fig.2a). A causal relationship between the age-related changes in cytochrome ctranslocation and IL-1β is suggested by the finding that cytochromec translocation was significantly enhanced by IL-1β (p < 0.05, ANOVA; Fig. 2b) and that this action relied on IL-1RI activation since the IL-1β-induced change was inhibited by IL-1ra. Fig. 2b also demonstrates that the IL-1β-induced change was inhibited by SB203580 suggesting that the effect was mediated by activation of p38.Figure 2The age-related increase in cytochromec translocation is abolished by EPA and mimicked by IL-1β.a, cytochromec translocation was significantly enhanced in cortical tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats fed on control diet (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA; compare lane 3 with lane 1), but this change was not evident in tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the EPA-enriched diet (lane 4). b, incubation of cortical tissue in the presence of IL-1β (lane 2) significantly increased cytochrome c translocation (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA), but this effect was inhibited by IL-1ra (lane 4) and by SB203580 (lane 6); neither IL-1ra (lane 3) nor SB203580 (lane 5) affected cytochrome ctranslocation (n = 6 in each group). Con, control; SB, SB203580.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One downstream consequence of cytochrome c translocation is activation of caspase-3, therefore we analyzed enzyme activity in tissue prepared from aged and young rats fed on either the control or experimental diet. Fig. 3ademonstrates that there was a significant age-related increase in caspase-3 activity; thus the mean value in cortical tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet was significantly increased compared with the value in tissue prepared from young rats (p < 0.05, ANOVA), but EPA suppressed this change. In an effort to establish whether the change in caspase-3 activation was coupled with the increases in IL-1β concentration and p38 activation, a series of in vitro experiments were undertaken that revealed that IL-1β significantly enhanced caspase-3 activity in cortical tissue (p < 0.05, ANOVA; Fig. 3b); this effect was blocked by IL-1ra, suggesting that the action of IL-1β was dependent on receptor interaction, and by SB203580, indicating that the action of IL-1β also required activation of p38. Cells prepared from cortex of young and aged rats fed on both diets were stained for phosphorylated p38 and caspase-3, and staining was assessed using confocal microscopy. We found no cell in preparations obtained from young rats in which there was evidence of colocalization of activated p38 and caspase-3. In contrast, several cells prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet stained positively for both; an example is shown in Fig. 3d. However, while some cells prepared from aged EPA-treated rats stained positively for p38, there was little staining for caspase-3, and we found no evidence of colocalization. These findings support the idea that caspase-3 activation is closely coupled with p38 activation. In addition to the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on caspase-3 activity, we observed that IL-1β significantly increased caspase-3 mRNA in cultured cortical cells (Fig. 3c). In an effort to consolidate these findings, which suggested that there was significant evidence of cell death in the aged cortex, we investigated cleavage of PARP by assessing expression of the 116-kDa form of the enzyme. Fig. 4 indicates, in a sample immunoblot and by analysis of the mean data obtained from densitometric analysis, that there was a significant decrease in expression of 116-kDa PARP in cortical tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats (p < 0.05, ANOVA) but that this effect was reversed in tissue prepared from aged rats treated with EPA. These data were paralleled by changes in TUNEL staining; thus a significantly greater number of cells stained positively for TUNEL in preparations obtained from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats fed on either diet (p < 0.05, ANOVA; Fig.5a). The number of TUNEL-positive cells in preparations obtained from aged rats fed on the EPA-enriched diet was similar to that in tissue prepared from young rats. Fig. 5b shows that exposure of cultured cortical neurons to IL-1β for 72 h also significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (p < 0.05, Student’st test for independent means).Figure 5The increase in TUNEL staining with age is blocked by EPA and mimicked by IL-1β.a, the number of cells that stained positively for TUNEL was significantly enhanced in cortex of aged rats fed on the control diet (e.g. left-hand picture) compared with that in young rats fed on either diet (*, p < 0.05, ANOVA); dietary manipulation with EPA reversed this effect. b, incubation of cultured cortical neurons in the presence of IL-1β significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (*,p < 0.05, Student’s t test for independent means; n = 5). Con, control; +ve, positive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an effort to explore the synaptic changes that might occur as a consequence of IL-1β-induced cell death, we turned to analysis of changes in hippocampus and first assessed age- and diet-related changes in IL-1β concentration and p38 activation. Fig.6a shows that, in parallel with the age-related findings in cortical tissue, IL-1β concentration was significantly increased in hippocampal tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the control diet compared with young rats fed on either diet (p < 0.05, ANOVA). There was no evidence of a similar age-related increase in aged rats fed on the EPA-enriched diet. Analysis of p38 activation revealed a similar pattern; thus there was a significant age-related increase in p38 activity (p < 0.05, ANOVA, aged rats fed on the control diet versus young rats; Fig. 6b), which was not observed in tissue prepared from aged rats fed on the EPA-enriched diet. A likely causal relationship between IL-1β concentration and p38 activation is suggested by the finding that IL-1β significantly increased p38 activity in hippocampus in vitro (Fig. 6c). In a separate series of experiments, in which no dietary manipulation was made, cryostat sections of tissue were prepared from young and aged rats. We observed that there was a marked increase in p38 staining in hippocampus of aged compared with young rats; sample sections are demonstrated in Fig. 6d.

Axons can extend neurites on growth inhibitory substrates when Rho is inactivated by C3-ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3). We found by Rho-GTP pull-down assay that inhibitory substrates activate Rho. To inactivate Rho, scrape-loading of C3 was necessary because it does not freely enter cells. To overcome the poor permeability of C3, we made and characterized five new recombinant C3-like chimeric proteins designed to cross the cell membrane by receptor-independent mechanisms. These proteins were constructed by the addition of short transport peptides to the carboxyl-terminal of C3 and tested using a bioassay measuring neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells plated on growth inhibitory substrates. All five constructs stimulated neurite outgrowth but with different dose-response profiles. Biochemical properties of the chimeric proteins were examined using C3-05, the most effective construct tested. Gel shift assays showed that C3-05 retained the ability to ADP-ribosylate Rho. Western blots and immunocytochemistry were used to verify the presence of C3 inside treated cells. C3-05 was also effective at promoting neurite outgrowth in primary neuronal cultures, as well as causing the disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions complexes in fibroblasts.

Initial studies using Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts demonstrate the ability of Rho to regulate the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes in non-neuronal cells (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). In neurons, Rho plays a key role in determining the response of axons to growth inhibitory proteins. GTPases have two conformations: a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho in neurons causes growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and cell body rounding (3Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 4Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J.

Treatment with C3-ADP-ribosyltranferase (C3),1 a specific inhibitor of Rho, stimulates axon growth and regeneration (6Dergham P. Ellezam B. Essagian C. Avedissian H. Lubell W.D. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To be effective, this 24-kDa protein must cross the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular Rho; however, C3 does not easily enter cells. To date, various methods have been used to help facilitate the entry of C3 into cells. In experiments using fibroblasts, C3 is microinjected into individual cells (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), whereas in studies using neuronal cells triturating (8Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or scrape-loading techniques (7Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are used to aid cellular entry. The need for such disruptive methods to inactive Rho by C3 and the inability to treat all cell types with equivalent techniques have limited the use of C3 as a tool for biochemical studies on Rho signaling. One solution has been to create a fusion protein that increases the efficiency of C3 delivery across the membrane. One such protein, a fusion between C3 and the B subunit of diphtheria toxin (DT), binds to cell surface DT receptors and is internalized by an endocytosis-mediated mechanism (9Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Giry M. Lemichez E. Bergez-Aullo P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This fusion protein is only effective in cells that contain DT receptors, therefore, excluding most rodent cells (9Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Giry M. Lemichez E. Bergez-Aullo P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A fusion protein between the bacterial toxin C2 and C3-transferase, C2IN-C3, also increases the ability of C3 to cross the cell membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, C2IN-C3 cannot independently cross the cell membrane, because it requires the presence of the C2 toxin-binding component, C2II, to enter cells (10Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ohishi I. Yanagimoto A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4648-4655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these fusion proteins enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytotic pathways, and therefore, may be trapped within vesicles, which may lessen efficient interaction with Rho.Small peptides can act as carriers by transporting a large protein cargo across cell membranes. Such peptides are part of larger proteins that are able to cross biological membranes. A series of different classes of transport peptides exist: 1) the human immunodeficiency virus transcription activator (Tat) contains a region spanning amino acids 37 to 72, which translocates its cargo to both the cytosol and nucleus (12Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 13Schwarze S.R., Ho, A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). A shorter Tat sequence, spanning amino acids 48 to 60, is also effective (14Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). 2) The third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain (Antp), a Drosophila homeoprotein, possesses the ability to cross biological membranes. Experiments using biotinylated forms of this 16-amino acid peptide have confirmed its ability to penetrate cells and locate in both the cytosol and nucleus (15Bloch-Gallego E., Le Roux I. Joliot A.H. Volovitch M. Henderson C.E. Prochiantz A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). 3) Prolines are functional participants in some transport peptides (18Deber C.M. Brandl C.J. Deber R.B. Hsu L.C. Young X.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proline residues act as helix breakers and form turn structures within peptides. Peptides rich in proline can form conformations that help in membrane translocation (19Du C. Yao S. Rojas M. Lin Y.Z. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 51: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 4) Peptides of 7 amino acids in length or longer that contain basic, arginine-rich sequences can act as effective transport peptides (20Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). 5) The hydrophobic regions of several membrane transport sequences (MTS) can translocate across the cellular membrane and accumulate in the nucleus (21Rojas M. Donahue J.P. Tan Z. Lin Y.Z. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 6) Recently, a short amphipathic peptide carrier, Pep-1, was also shown to be able to translocate across cellular membranes (22Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We have made and tested four different classes of transport peptides: Tat (C3-02, C3-03); Antennapedia homeodomain (C3-04); a proline-rich fusogenic peptide sequence (C3-05); and a highly basic, arginine-rich sequence corresponding to the reverse Tat sequence (C3-06). We provide evidence that these five new C3-like chimeric proteins all cross the plasma membrane, inactivate Rho, and stimulate neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates.RESULTSWe chose to test a number of different strategies to design C3-like chimeric proteins that could cross the plasma membrane by receptor-independent mechanisms. Five C3-like chimeric proteins were constructed by adding DNA sequences encoding known membrane-translocating peptides derived from Tat (C3-02, C3-03), Antennapedia (C3-04), a proline-rich fusogenic peptide (C3-05) and a basic, arginine-rich peptide (C3-06) to the 3′-end of the C3 cDNA. All five cDNAs encoding the C3-like chimeric proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified, and their molecular weights were verified by SDS-PAGE gel (e.g. Fig. 1A). To confirm the presence of C3 in all five constructs, Western blots using a polyclonal antibody raised against C3 were completed (e.g.Fig. 1B).PC-12 cells typically extend neurites in response to NGF, but, when plated on inhibitory substrates, this outgrowth is inhibited and the cells remain round (7Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to inactivate Rho and promote neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates was used as a bioassay to test the effectiveness of the new C3-like chimeric proteins. First, we examined the dose-response profile of unmodified C3. In previous experiments to inactivate Rho, we determined that scrape-loading was necessary to treat PC-12 cells with C3 (7Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that even with the scrape-loading technique, high concentrations of C3 were required to stimulate neurite outgrowth on myelin (Fig.2). When C3 was added to the culture medium of pre-plated cells, C3 had no significant effect (Fig. 2).To test the ability of the new C3-like chimeric proteins to promote neurite outgrowth, we performed dose-response experiments with PC-12 cells plated on myelin substrates (Fig.3). In these experiments, the C3-like chimeric proteins were added directly to the culture medium after pre-plating cells. This procedure was carefully preformed to avoid any mechanical disruption of the cells. To establish the effective concentration ranges, preliminary experiments, including a test concentration of 0.00025 μg/ml, were completed, but none of the C3-like chimeric proteins were effective at this dose. Surprisingly, concentrations of 0.0025 μg/ml C3-03, C3-05, and C3-06 lead to significant increases in both the number of cells extending neurites and the length of neurites compared with cells plated on myelin without treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). This effective dose is 10,000-fold lower than that required with unmodified C3 using scrape-loading techniques (Figs. 2 and 3). At the highest concentrations tested, C3-03 was not effective, perhaps because of toxicity associated with the Tat sequence (14Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). C3-02 and C3-04 promoted significant neurite outgrowth at concentrations of 0.25 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively, and an increase in neurite length was observed at concentrations between the range of 0.025 and 2.5 μg/ml (Fig. 3, A and B). At all concentrations, C3-05 and C3-06 stimulated neurite outgrowth on myelin substrates, with C3-05 giving the best results. These results indicated that all of the new C3-like proteins had some capacity to penetrate cells, inactivate Rho, and promote neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates. Because C3-05 gave the best results, it was used for further testing.Figure 3C3-like chimeric proteins efficiently promote neurite outgrowth on myelin substrates. PC-12 cells were plated on myelin substrates in the absence (black bars) or presence of C3-like proteins (C3-02, white bars; C3-03, light gray bars; C3-04, gray bars; C3-05, dark gray bars; C3-06, charcoal bars) at increasing concentrations, between 0.0025 and 50 μg/ml, for 24 h.

To study the ability of C3-05 to ADP-ribosylate Rho, we examined the electrophoretic mobility of RhoA by Western blot of cell lysates treated for 24 h with 25 μg/ml scrape-loaded C3 or 10 μg/ml C3-05 added directly to the media (Fig.4, top). Both scrape-loaded C3 and C3-05 caused a similar molecular weight shift, confirming the ability of C3-05 to ADP-ribosylate Rho (Fig. 4, top). As a control for the specificity of this molecular weight shift effect, we stripped and re-probed the same blots for another member of the Rho GTPase family, Cdc42 (Fig. 4, bottom). Cdc42 did not show any change in mobility after treatment with C3-05, demonstrating that C3-05 maintains the same ADP-ribosylation specificity as unmodified C3.Figure 4ADP-ribosylation of Rho in PC-12 cells.PC-12 cells plated on myelin substrates, were untreated (CTRL), scrape-loaded with 25 μg/ml unmodified C3 (C3-SCRAPE), or treated with 10 μg/ml C3-05 added directly to the media, and incubated for 24 h.

PC-12 cells were plated on myelin substrates and treated with C3, C3-05, or left untreated. The cells were washed twice in cold TBS before preparing cell lysates. The proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a polyclonal anti-C3 antibody. A 27-kDa band was observed in the lysates of PC-12 cells treated with C3-05 (Fig. 5A). No band was detected in PC-12 cells treated with unmodified C3, indicating that no detectable amount of unmodified C3 was able to penetrate PC-12 cells without scrape-loading. CHO and NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml C3-05 for 24 h or left untreated. C3-05 was clearly detected in the cell lysates of both fibroblast cell lines tested (Fig.5B). By immunocytochemistry of PC-12 cells plated on myelin, we observed no intracellular staining with unmodified C3, but staining was visible when cells were treated with C3-05 (Fig. 5, Band C). These results further confirm the permeability of C3-05.Figure 5Transmembrane delivery of C3-05 into PC-12, CHO , and NIH 3T3 cells.A, Western blot of PC-12 cell lysates prepared from cells treated with 10 μg/ml C3-05 (C3-05), 10 μg/ml C3 (C3), and untreated cells (CTRL) and probed with a polyclonal anti-C3 antibody.B, Western blots of CHO and NIH 3T3 cell lysates prepared from cells treated with 10 μg/ml C3-05 (C3-05) and untreated cells (CTRL) and probed with a polyclonal C3 antibody.

Microinjection of C3 into fibroblast cells results in the loss of stress fibers (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). To test if C3-05 is effective in crossing the cell membrane and inactivating Rho in fibroblasts, we treated CHO cells and NIH 3T3 cells with varying concentrations of C3-05, and stained the cells with phalloidin to visualize actin stress fibers (Fig. 6). When CHO and NIH 3T3 cells were plated in serum-containing medium in the absence of C3-05, well-formed actin stress fibers were present (Fig. 6). In both cell lines the addition of C3-05 at concentrations as low as 0.0025 μg/ml dramatically reduced actin stress fiber formation. At concentrations of 0.025 or 0.25 μg/ml, disassembly of actin stress fibers was almost complete. At 25 μg/ml, the highest concentration tested, CHO cells treated with C3-05 showed an altered morphology (Fig. 6).The serum component lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a strong activator of Rho (25Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Serum-starved fibroblasts have very few visible stress fibers, however, the stimulation of such cells by LPA produces an intense network of actin stress fibers (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). To test if C3-05 is effective in reversing Rho activation by extracellular stimuli in fibroblasts, we stimulated serum-starved CHO and NIH 3T3 cells with LPA (100 nm) and then treated them with 0.0025 μg/ml C3-05. The cells were stained with phalloidin to visualize the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 7A). In both cell lines, serum-starved cells in the absence of LPA displayed a limited number of stress fibers. In contrast, when Rho was activated by LPA stimulation, a dramatic increase in the formation of stress fibers occurred. The treatment of LPA-stimulated cells with 0.0025 μg/ml C3-05 resulted in a substantial decrease in the formation of actin stress fibers visualized by phalloidin stain (Fig.7A). Therefore C3-05 can reverse the formation of actin stress fibers induced by LPA.Focal adhesions are sites of attachment between cells, and their extracellular matrices that are regulated by Rho (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of C3-05 on focal adhesions, we stimulated serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells with 100 nm LPA, treated them with 0.0025 μg/ml C3-05, and visualized focal adhesion complexes with an anti-vinculin antibody (Fig. 7B). Serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells prevented formation of focal adhesions. LPA stimulation to activate Rho promoted an increased formation of focal adhesions compared with the serum-starved controls (Fig. 7B). Treatment of the LPA-stimulated cells with 0.0025 μg/ml C3-05 prevented the LPA-induced augmentation of focal contacts (Fig. 7B).Rho activity can be measured using GTP-bound Rho pull-down assays. When cells were plated on myelin substrates, an increase in the amount of active Rho was observed compared with cells plated on poly-l-lysine (Fig.8A). When PC-12 cells were plated on myelin and treated with 0.0025, 0.025, and 0.25 μg/ml C3-05, there was a dramatic reduction in the levels of active Rho. Treatment with C3-05 decreased the amount of active Rho below levels observed from PC-12 cells plated on growth promoting poly-l-lysine substrates (Fig. 8A). To determine the duration of this C3-05-induced Rho inactivation, PC-12 cells plated on growth inhibitory substrates were incubated with C3-05 and lysed at different time points after the addition of C3-05. Rho activation was completely reversed at 0.025 and 0.25 μg/ml after 24 h. At all concentrations tested, the ability of C3-05 to inactive Rho peaked at 24 h. Rho inactivation began to diminish after 36 h with the complete activation of Rho regained in cells treated with 0.0025 μg/ml at 48 h (Fig. 8B). Cells treated with all three concentrations maintained their differentiation state for at least 48 h after treatment (data not shown). These results show that myelin causes Rho activation, resulting in inhibition of neurite outgrowth, and that this inhibition can be completely reversed by treatment with C3-05.In NIH 3T3 cells Rho activation is correlated with the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 4). Pull-down assays of homogenates prepared from NIH 3T3 cells grown in the presence of serum showed high Rho activation levels, in agreement with the spread morphology of these cells (Fig. 8C). Treatment with varying concentrations of C3-05 at 0.0025, 0.025, and 0.25 μg/ml for 24 h decreased Rho activation (Fig. 8, C and D). These results confirm that C3-05 inactivated Rho in fibroblasts.To further support the ability of C3-like chimeric proteins to promote neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates, we examined the response of primary cultures plated on inhibitory substrates to C3-05 treatment. Purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were plated on myelin or CSPG substrates and treated with varying concentrations of C3-05 for 24 h. During the RGC dissection great care was taken to try to limit the amount of mechanical manipulation of the cells, however, the isolation protocol requires that some triturating take place to dissociate and separate the cells. When RGCs are plated on inhibitory substrates, they maintained a similar round appearance to PC-12 cells plated on myelin. Treatment of RGCs with C3-05 promoted neurite outgrowth and increased neurite length on both myelin and CSPG substrates (Fig.9, A–F). In contrast to the wide range of concentrations shown to be effective in experiments with PC-12 cells, a narrower range of C3-05, 0.025 to 50 μg/ml, promoted neurite outgrowth and increased neurite length on myelin (Fig. 9,A and D). In the case of RGCs plated on CSPG, effective concentration ranges of 0.0025 to 50 μg/ml were observed (Fig. 9, A, B, E, andF).Figure 9C3-05 promotes neurite outgrowth from retinal neurons plated on inhibitory myelin or CSPG substrates.

By a bioassay in which PC-12 cells were plated onto growth inhibitory myelin substrates, we have shown that, to varying extents, all five C3-like chimeric proteins promoted neurite outgrowth. Based on our experiments with unmodified C3, which must be scrape-loaded, we suggest that the ability of these new C3-like proteins to promote neurite outgrowth at such low concentrations is due to their increased cellular permeability. The differences observed in promoting neurite outgrowth between the five C3-like chimeric proteins might result from the different methods used by the various transmembrane carrier peptides to enter cells.We tested two different transport sequences derived from the Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus. This protein has been reported to enter cells, carry protein cargo into cells, and even cross the blood-brain barrier (13Schwarze S.R., Ho, A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby Tat transports cargo across the plasma membrane is still not completely understood. Tat internalization is not decreased at 4 °C or in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors (14Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). There is uncertainty, however, whether its uptake is receptor-mediated because Tat binds to specific cell membrane proteins (28Weeks B.S. Desai K. Loewenstein P.M. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. Green M. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5279-5284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that C3-03, the longer Tat peptide sequence, was more efficient at promoting neurite outgrowth then C3-02, the shorter Tat peptide. However, the longer sequence may have some cellular toxicity (14Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the decreased ability to promote neurite growth at high concentrations (Fig. 3).The third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain can cross cell membranes by both energy- and receptor-independent mechanisms (16Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antp is a basic peptide that interacts with the charged phospholipids on the outer side of the cell membrane, causing destabilization of the lipid bilayer and the formation of inverted micelles. The formation of this hydrophobic structure allows the Antp and protein cargo to travel freely across the membrane, releasing the transported protein inside the cell once the hydrophobic pocket opens (16Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1"

To identify tyrosines in Ret that are autophosphorylation sites in neurons, we generated antibodies specific to phosphorylated Y905Ret, Y1015Ret, Y1062Ret, and Y1096Ret, all of which are autophosphorylated in cell lines. All four of these tyrosines in Ret became phosphorylated rapidly upon activation by GFLs in sympathetic neurons. These tyrosines remained phosphorylated in sympathetic neurons in the continued presence of GFLs, albeit at a lower level than immediately after GFL treatment. Comparison of GFL activation of Ret9 and Ret51 revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr905 and Tyr1062 was greater and more sustained in Ret9 as compared with Ret51. In contrast, Tyr1015 was more highly phosphorylated over time in Ret51 than in Ret9. Surprisingly, Ret9 and Ret51 did not associate with each other in sympathetic neurons after glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, even though they share identical extracellular domains. Furthermore, the signaling complex associated with Ret9 was markedly different from the Ret51-associated signaling complex. Taken together, these data provide a biochemical basis for the dramatic functional differences between Ret9 and Ret 51 in vivo.

The GFL family consists of GDNF, neurturin (NRTN), persephin, and artemin, and they promote the survival and growth of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system neurons both in vitro and in vivo (5Baloh R.H. Enomoto H. Johnson E.M., Jr. Milbrandt J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Ret is not activated via direct binding of GFLs to its extracellular domain but rather is activated by complexes formed by GFLs associated with glycerophosphatidylinositol-anchored co-receptor proteins called GFRαs. GFRα family members (GFRα1–4) demonstrate preferential binding to a particular GFL, thus providing specificity to Ret activation depending upon which GFL and GFRα are present. Signal transduction pathways activated by Ret have been analyzed mostly in cell lines transiently expressing the receptor components, in cell lines that express MEN-2A and MEN-2B constitutively activated forms of Ret, or in neuroblastoma cell lines (4Takahashi M.

However, the extent of autophosphorylation of these tyrosine residues and their functions in Ret signal transduction in neurons are unknown. Ret is alternatively spliced to produce at least two isoforms that differ only in the C-terminal residues; Ret9 has 9 amino acids that differ from the unique C-terminal 51 residues of Ret51 (20Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). These relatively minor differences have dramatic functional consequences; Ret9 is critically important for kidney morphogenesis and enteric nervous system development, whereas Ret51 is dispensable (21de Graaff E. Srinivas S. Kilkenny C. D'Agati V. Mankoo B.S. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of Ret51 only partially compensates for the loss of Ret9 in kidney and enteric nervous system development (21de Graaff E. Srinivas S. Kilkenny C. D'Agati V. Mankoo B.S. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ret51, but not Ret9, is required for the metabolism and growth of mature sympathetic neurons via a GFL-independent mechanism of activation (22Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M., Jr. Neuron. 2002; 33: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The biochemical differences between Ret9 and Ret51 that account for these functional differences are unknown.

Consistent with this, Tyr1062 in Ret9 and Ret51 does appear in some cases to have altered interactions with SHC and GRB2 (11Lorenzo M.J. Gish G.D. Houghton C. Stonehouse T.J. Pawson T. Ponder B.A.J.

Consistent with this possibility, Tyr1096appears to contribute to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (16Hayashi H. Ichihara M. Iwashita T. Murakami H.

To determine whether Ret9 and Ret51 autophosphorylation and downstream signaling differ in neurons, we generated antibodies that specifically recognize Ret when phosphorylated on Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, or Tyr1096. Additionally, antibodies were generated that stoichiometrically immunoprecipitate Ret9 or Ret51. Using these antibodies we show that upon ligand binding significant differences in the kinetics of Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062 autophosphorylation occur between Ret9 and Ret51 in neurons. Furthermore, despite co-expression, Ret9 and Ret51 did not associate with each other upon activation in neurons and formed distinctly different signaling complexes in sympathetic neurons. These data indicate that Ret9 and Ret51 functioned as independent receptors for GFLs even within the same cell, providing a biochemical basis for the functional uniqueness of these Ret isoforms in vivo. Sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglia were dissociated and maintained in vitro as described previously (26Deckwerth T.L. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Sympathetic neurons were maintained for 9–12 days in vitro(DIV) in the presence of NGF (50 ng/ml) and then switched to medium containing a lower concentration of NGF (2 ng/ml) for 24 h prior to stimulation with either GDNF or NRTN (both at 50 ng/ml) for the length of time described in each experiment. CHP126 neuroblastoma cells were seeded into Primaria 6-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and maintained in normal growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 1.4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F-12 medium (Sigma)) to 50–70% confluence. The cells were then transfected with various expression vectors by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transfected cells were maintained for 48 h in normal growth medium prior to lysis. After the described treatments, sympathetic neurons and transfected CHP126 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then extracted with immunoprecipitation buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The detergent extracts were cleared of insoluble debris and nuclei by centrifugation at 13,000 × g in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 10 min. The cleared extracts were either immunoprecipitated with Ret antibodies or diluted 2-fold with 2× sample buffer and boiled for SDS-PAGE as described previously (22Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M., Jr. Neuron. 2002; 33: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 4–12% gradient mini-gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) or 7.5% slab gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The blots were then blocked with either 2% bovine serum albumin (PY-Ret antibodies, Pan-Ret antibodies) or 4% heat-inactivated horse serum (phosphotyrosine antibody) in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h. The blots were next incubated with the primary antibody in the appropriate blocking buffer for 2 h, washed three times with TBST, and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) in blocking buffer for 1 h. The immunoblots were again washed three times with TBST and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal; Pierce). The dilutions and sources of the antibodies used for immunoblot analysis were as follows: anti-PY905Ret, anti-PY1015Ret, anti-PY1062Ret, and anti-PY1096Ret were diluted 1:1000–1:3000; anti-pan-Ret was diluted 1:1000 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; or a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of Ret produced previously); anti-Ret9 was diluted 1:1000 (C19, Santa Cruz, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Ret51 was 1:1000 (C20, Santa Cruz); anti-phosphotyrosine was 1:2000 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Beverly, MA). The blots were quantified by using the UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) after confirmation that each antibody was in the linear range for the protein of interest by a dose-response analysis. Antibodies to specific phosphorylated tyrosines of mouse Ret were produced by first generating peptides containing the appropriate phosphotyrosine residues (Biomolecules Midwest Inc., Waterloo, IL). The Ret phospho-peptides were as follows: PY905Ret was CEEDSY(PO4)VKKS; PY1015Ret was CVKSRDY(PO4)LDLA; PY1062Ret was CIENKLY(PO4)GMSD; and PY1096Ret was CANDSVY(PO4)ANWM. The peptides were covalently bound to the large carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their N-terminal cysteine residues by using maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The protein conjugates were then injected into rabbits (Covance Research Products Inc., Richmond, CA), and the sera were tested for specific antibody production by Western analysis. The highest titer antiserum was affinity purified by first binding the antibodies to affinity columns produced by covalently linking the corresponding phosphopeptide to an agarose resin (Pierce). The nonspecific antibodies were washed off the column, and the specific antibodies were eluted by using both acidic (100 mmglycine, pH 2.5) and basic (100 mm triethylamine, pH 11) buffers. To purify the antibodies further, these eluates were counter-purified over a column made with the corresponding peptide that did not contain the phosphorylated tyrosine. After this, phosphotyrosine antibodies not specific to the particular tyrosine in Ret were removed from the eluate by counter-purifying the eluate from the prior two columns over a third column produced by using the three other unrelated PYRet peptides. These eluates were then dialyzed and concentrated with a Centriprep centrifugal device (Millipore). This triple purification produced antibodies highly specific to the phosphorylated tyrosine in Ret that was originally targeted. Antibodies specific to the short isoform of Ret (Ret9) and the longer isoform of Ret (Ret51) were generated in a manner similar to that of the PYRet antibodies. The peptides were: Ret9, CGRISHAFTRF; Ret51, CMVSPSAAKLMDTFDS, both of which are only contained in that particular Ret isoform. For immunoprecipitation using these Ret9 and Ret51 antibodies, anti-Ret9 and anti-Ret51 were covalently bound to an agarose support to avoid contamination of the immunoprecipitate with IgG released from the protein A beads after detergent solubilization. To generate anti-Ret9 and anti-Ret51 agarose, purified and unpurified antibodies were covalently bound to the agarose support by using AminoLink resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Ret expression plasmids used in this study have been described previously (27Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M., Jr. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Y905F, Y1015F, Y1062F, and K758M Ret mutants were generated by standard PCR-based point mutagenesis cloning techniques. The Y1096F Ret mutant was generously provided by Jack Dixon and Carolyn Worby (7Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether specific tyrosine residues in Ret are bona fide autophosphorylation sites in neurons, we generated antibodies that recognize Ret only when phosphorylated on individual tyrosine residues. Antibodies to PY905Ret, PY1015Ret, PY1062Ret, and PY1096Ret (Fig.1A) were made by producing and purifying rabbit antisera against phosphorylated Ret antigens (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar antibodies to PY1015Ret and PY1062Ret have been described previously (28Salvatore D. Barone M.V. Salvatore G. Melillo R.M. Chiappetta G. Mineo A. Fenzi G. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3898-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto M., Li, M. Mitsuma N. Ito S. Kato M. Takahashi M. Sobue G. Brain Res. 2001; 912: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and were used to demonstrate that these tyrosines are phosphorylated in Ret in transfected cell lines and transforming mutants of Ret. To confirm that these antibodies were specific for only the targeted tyrosine residue in Ret, we expressed Ret9, Ret51, or various tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants of Ret51 in the neuroblastoma cell line CHP126. CHP126 cells did not express Ret and were transfected with high efficiency (data not shown). Like other cell lines, transient overexpression of Ret in CHP126 cells resulted in high levels of Ret autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand stimulation (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Consistent with this observation, all four phospho-Ret antibodies recognized Ret51 when overexpressed in CHP126 cells (Fig.1B). In contrast, none of the P-Ret antibodies recognized Ret containing a K758M mutation that renders Ret kinase inactive (Fig. 1B). Of importance, none of the P-Ret antibodies recognized Ret that contained a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation of the tyrosine that each antibody was directed against (Fig.1B). Anti-PY1096Ret also did not detect activated Ret9 because Ret9 does not contain Tyr1096 (Fig. 1B). Because Tyr905 is required for the catalytic activity of Ret, mutation of this residue diminishes, but does not eliminate, Ret autophosphorylation (data not shown). Although anti-PY1015Ret could not detect Y905F Ret when expressed in CHP126 cells, anti-PY1062Ret, and anti-PY1096Ret did recognize Y905F Ret at lower levels than Ret51, demonstrating that some residual autophosphorylation remained. This indicates that anti-PY905Ret is specific for Tyr905 because anti-PY905Ret was unable to detect the residual autophosphorylation of Y905F Ret (Fig. 1B) even after long exposure times (data not shown). Therefore, purified antibodies directed against PY905, PY1015, PY1062, and PY1096 Ret specifically recognized Ret only when the tyrosine of interest was phosphorylated. To determine whether these tyrosine residues were autophosphorylated upon ligand-mediated Ret activation, sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion of mice were dissociated and maintained in vitro with NGF, which is required for their survival. After 8–12 DIV, the neurons were starved of NGF for 2 days and were treated with GDNF (50 ng/ml) or medium alone for 15 min. The sympathetic neurons were then detergent-extracted, and P-Ret immunoblotting was performed on the extracts. Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 were phosphorylated upon GDNF stimulation, demonstrating that they are autophosphorylation sites in Ret (ret+/+neurons; Fig. 2). Proteins with a molecular mass smaller than 180 kDa were also detected with several of the P-Ret antibodies after GDNF treatment of sympathetic neurons and probably represent proteolytic degradation of Ret that may occur during detergent extraction (data not shown). To confirm that the 180-kDa protein identified by the P-Ret antibodies was Ret, dissociated 12 DIV superior cervical ganglia neurons fromret+/+, ret+/−, orret−/− mice were stimulated with GDNF, NGF, or medium alone and subjected to P-Ret antibody analysis. GDNF induced the appearance of a 180-kDa protein by all four P-Ret antibodies inret+/+ and ret+/−neurons but not ret−/− neurons (Fig. 2). A gene dosage effect occurred because less P-Ret was detected inret+/− than in ret+/+neurons after GDNF stimulation (Fig. 2). NGF treatment did not stimulate the appearance of the 180-kDa phosphoprotein, indicating that this protein was not a downstream tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate of neurotrophic factors in sympathetic neurons. Therefore, Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 are Ret autophosphorylation sites in response to GDNF in neurons. While this manuscript was in preparation, a study was published that described phospho-Ret antibodies directed against the same four tyrosines (30Coulpier M. Anders J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1991-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Coulpier et al. (30Coulpier M. Anders J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1991-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found, as we did, that Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 are autophosphorylated in a coordinated manner by GFL stimulation. The kinetics of autophosphorylation of these four tyrosines stimulated by GDNF and NRTN was examined in dissociated sympathetic neurons. GDNF induced the rapid and coordinated phosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096within minutes of treatment, and this phosphorylation persisted for hours (Fig. 3A). NRTN also promoted a rapid and robust autophosphorylation of these tyrosine residues in sympathetic neurons, and no significant differences between GDNF and NRTN were observed (Fig. 3A). Within 4 h the levels of autophosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 began to decrease and reached a minimum by 8–24 h of GDNF or NRTN treatment (Fig. 3A). The levels of Ret also decreased during this same time, suggesting either that Ret was degraded or that new Ret synthesis was inhibited after GFL treatment in sympathetic neurons (Fig.3A). Because the amount of Ret decreases over time, changes in the levels of phosphorylation of a particular tyrosine residue may not reflect the actual changes in the percentage of Ret that is phosphorylated on that residue at any given time. Therefore, the immunoblots were quantified, and the PY-Ret/Ret ratio was calculated to determine whether the percentage of autophosphorylation of these tyrosine residues changed with time after GFL treatment. Quantitative measurements demonstrated that GDNF and NRTN treatment caused a marked reduction of Ret protein, decreasing to 35.1% and 42.1% of unstimulated levels, respectively, after 24 h. Analysis of the P-Ret/Ret ratio revealed that the percentage of Ret that was phosphorylated on Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062 reached a maximum within 1 h, declined somewhat thereafter, and, by 24 h, either reached a plateau or even increased (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the percentage of Ret with phosphorylated Tyr1096 declined with time and reached a minimum value after 24 h of GDNF or NRTN treatment (Fig. 3B). Although the percentage of phosphorylated Ret increased on some tyrosines at 24 h, this may reflect a differential localization or stability of the phosphorylated receptor as compared with the nonphosphorylated receptor as opposed to an enhanced activation of Ret occurring at 24 h. Densitometric analysis also revealed that Tyr905 and Tyr1062showed the greatest increases in phosphorylation with GFL stimulation, changing by 9- and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 3B). GFL stimulation also markedly induced the phosphorylation of Tyr1015 and Tyr1096 with GFL stimulation, increasing by roughly 4-fold (Fig. 3B). Therefore, GDNF and NRTN promote the sustained autophosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and, to a lesser extent, Tyr1096. Furthermore, these data suggest that a significant portion of the decrease in Ret phosphorylation after GFL stimulation was because of the loss of Ret protein rather than the dephosphorylation of Ret. Sympathetic neurons, like other cell types, express both Ret9 and Ret51. To determine whether any differences in the kinetics of autophosphorylation occur between these Ret isoforms, dissociated sympathetic neurons were stimulated with GDNF for various lengths of time and were detergent-extracted. Ret9 or Ret51 were immunoprecipitated with immobilized antibodies specific for either isoform (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5), and the phosphorylation of Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 was evaluated. Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062 were rapidly phosphorylated in a synchronous manner in both Ret9 and Ret51 (Fig. 4A). Tyr1096was also rapidly phosphorylated in Ret51 and was not detected in Ret9 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). The levels of phosphorylation of all four tyrosine residues began declining within 1–4 h of GDNF treatment (Fig. 4A), similar to the previous experiments (Fig. 3).Figure 4Ret9 and Ret51 differ in their kinetics of Tyr905, Tyr1015, and Tyr1062phosphorylation in sympathetic neurons.A, dissociated sympathetic neurons were treated with medium alone (MA) or medium containing GDNF (50 ng/ml) for the length of time indicated. The neurons were then detergent-extracted, and either Ret9 or Ret51 was immunoprecipitated from the extracts. Equal amounts of each immunoprecipitate was subjected to PY-Ret and pan-Ret Western analysis as in Fig. 2. This experiment was performed twice with similar results.B, the immunoblots generated in A were quantified and the PY-Ret/pan-Ret ratio calculated for each condition. These values were graphed as a function of time. C, the PY-Ret/pan-Ret values displayed in B were divided by the PY-Ret/pan-Ret value for the control (MA) conditions to determine the percentage of change of phosphorylation each tyrosine underwent after GDNF stimulation. The values graphed here were generally greater than the values in Bbecause Ret9 and Ret51 display some basal autophosphorylation in the absence of GFLs at this neuronal age.

In addition, it appears that extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (2Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar), thrombospondin (3Taraboletti G. Morigi M. Figliuzzi M. Giavazzi R. Zoja C. Remuzzi G. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar), and heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (4Person J.M. Lovett D.H. Raugi G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar) can modulate this migration. This movement of cells must involve disengagement from and remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Possible mediators for this remodeling include a variety of serine proteinases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 but also the newly described ADAM family of molecules.The ADAMs are a family of cell surface molecules that possess both disintegrin and MMP domains. The disintegrin domain of these molecules resembles the sequence of the snake venom disintegrins and binds to integrins on the cell surface (5Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A.P. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This displaces the integrin from its matrix target, thus freeing the cell from its substrate. Moreover the binding of a disintegrin to integrins on its own cell membrane in addition to those on adjacent cells is a possibility, freeing both cells from their substratum. Furthermore, because the ADAM molecules are proteolytically processed (6Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), cleavage of the ADAM may also take place, releasing the bound disintegrin from the cell and freeing the cell from the matrix. In addition, the binding of the disintegrin domain to integrins on adjacent cells may direct the MMP to the site of integrin/matrix interaction resulting in matrix degradation and facilitating cell migration.The deduced structure of the MMP catalytic domain appears functional in many of the 30 or more ADAM family members (that is, there is an active site consensus sequence) (7Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), whereas in some it lacks the necessary zinc-binding site. The third extracellular region of the ADAM molecule is a cysteine-rich domain, which may promote membrane fusion (8Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 9Mahimkar R.M. Blobel C.P. Baricos W.H. Lovett D.H. Pollock A.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8 (, Abstr. 1971): 426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is adjacent to a cytoplasmic domain containing putative binding sites for several intracellular signaling molecules (6Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of the ADAM molecule, through either the disintegrin or MMP domain, may mediate signal transduction and affect cell function.The structure of the ADAM molecules suggests that they are centrally involved in the remodeling of tissue that occurs following damage and/or disease. At present, however, the specific role of many of the ADAMs is limited. ADAMs 1–6 are believed to be involved in the binding and fusion of sperm to egg (10Cho C., Ge, H. Branciforte D. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Yuan R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Others are involved in the “shedding” of membrane-bound receptors and cytokines (12Qi H. Rand M.D., Wu, X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P., Xu, T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated that the interaction of matrix proteins with their integrin receptors leads to an alteration in the production of metalloproteinases by glomerular cells (15Martin J. Eynstone L. Davies M. Steadman R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 88-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ADAM molecules bind to the same receptors, they possess the potential for inducing the same intracellular effects as the matrix molecules themselves. The ADAM molecules may, therefore, affect the interaction of the cell with the extracellular matrix at many levels, and an increase in ADAM expression is likely to be centrally involved in the response of cells following injury.To date little is known about the expression or potential role of ADAMs in the kidney. ADAM TS1, a novel ADAM protein that is released extracellularly and possesses a thrombospondin-binding site, is induced in several tissues (including the kidney) in mice following the systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide or phorbol ester (16Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of ADAM 12 (also known as MDC9) has been described in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells, and a role for this molecule has been suggested in interactions with the basal lamina (17Mahimkar R.M. Baricos W.H. Visaya O. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 595-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ADAM 15, MDC 15 (6), or Metargidin (18Kratzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) has been shown to be present in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells, although it is not seen in normal vessels in vivo. It is, however, up-regulated in atherosclerotic lesions (6Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our present report examines the expression of ADAM 15 by human mesangial cells in vitro and its involvement in the migration of these cells following injury.DISCUSSIONThe role of the ADAM molecules in tissue homeostasis is poorly understood. These molecules have separate domains that would enable the cell to both interfere with integrin binding to the extracellular matrix and to degrade that matrix, suggesting a role in cell migration. However, their ability to influence cell migration has not previously been demonstrated. We have shown here for the first time that the ADAM 15 molecule may be involved in the migration of human mesangial cells following the initiation of migration in vitro.Low levels of ADAM 15 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR in HMC and were increased following exposure to serum. Subsequently, the levels of ADAM 15 mRNA and protein were both shown to increase following the initiation of migration, suggesting a degree of transcriptional up-regulation. The fact that the antisense oligonucleotide and antibodies raised against the separate extracellular domains of the ADAM 15 molecule decreased the migration of HMC in vitrofurther suggested that there was a causal relationship between the level of ADAM 15 and the rate of movement of the HMC.An important finding that may indicate the mode of action of ADAM 15 in HMC migration was its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix protein collagen IV and denatured collagen I (gelatin). This proteolytic activity in vivo would not only facilitate cell migration by allowing the degradation of the mesangial matrix and cell detachment but could also promote the movement of the cell through its surrounding ECM barrier. These findings with ADAM 15 are similar to those of other members of the ADAM family that have been shown to possess proteolytic activity, such as ADAM 12 (Meltrin α) (28Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewe U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and ADAMTS-1 (29Kuno K. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18821-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both of these molecules have been shown to be active metalloproteinases through their binding to α-2 macroglobulin. In addition, ADAM 10 (MADM) has been reported to possess type IV collagenase activity in vitro (30Millichip M.I. Dallas D.J., Wu, E. Dale S. McKie N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inhibition by antisense was through a direct effect on ADAM 15 expression we hypothesized that the antibodies inhibited HMC migration through an effect on the tertiary structure of the ADAM 15 molecule, which may have inhibited its metalloproteinase activity. This was supported using a sensitive fluorometric assay to investigate the effect of the antibodies on the proteolytic activity of purified ADAM 15. Both the antibody raised against the metalloproteinase domain and that raised against the disintegrin domain inhibited the cleavage of the substrate, whereas control IgG had no effect. This result, taken together with the effect of the BB-3103 proteinase inhibitor on migration, imply that at least part of the inhibitory activity of both the anti-metalloproteinase and anti-disintegrin antibodies on the migration of the HMC in vitro is due to their inhibition of the enzymatic activity of ADAM 15.Neither the antibodies to the extracellular domains of the ADAM 15 molecule nor the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-3103 affected HMC proliferation as measured by labeling with BrdUrd. This was somewhat unexpected, as it has been previously reported that the metalloproteinase activity of MMP-2 is involved in the proliferation of mesangial cells (25Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our findings were confirmed by MTT assay where there were no changes in cell number or viability following incubation with either the antibodies or the metalloproteinase inhibitor. These results confirm a separate series of studies suggesting that factors affecting proliferation in MC are separate from those that effect migration (26Haseley L.A. Hugo C. Reidy M.A. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 964-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A Hastings R.R. Bocanegra R.A. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 460-467PubMed Google Scholar).The RGD integrin-binding sequence of ADAM 15 (18) is reported to facilitate the interaction of this molecule with both the αVβ3 and αVβ1integrin (32Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 33Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considered together with its proteolytic activity, this gives ADAM 15 the potential for involvement in cell migration at several levels. The migration of the mesangial cell from the glomerulus into the pericapillary space in diseases such as mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is a major feature of this disease. Little is known about the mechanisms controlling the migration of the mesangial cells, although it has been reported that MC stimulated with a combination of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ but not unstimulated MC migrated toward a RANTES gradient (34Banas B. Luckow B. Moller M. Klier C. Nelson P.J. Schadde E. Brigl M. Halevy D. Holthofer H. Reinhart B. Schlondorff D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that heparin (4Person J.M. Lovett D.H. Raugi G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar), platelet secretory products, and platelet-derived growth factor (2Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar, 35Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 379-382PubMed Google Scholar) can stimulate their migration in vitro.The work presented here describes a possible mechanism by which HMC migration is mediated. We have demonstrated for the first time that ADAM 15 is proteolytically active and that this activity is associated with the migration of HMC. Because inhibition of migration was only partially complete in our system, however, it is likely that there are additional molecules, possibly including other members of the ADAM family, that also contribute. Thus, in both mesangial and other cell types, a degree of redundancy may exist. A recent report (31Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that ADAM 9 can also modulate cell migration, suggests that this is an important role of this family of molecules. The inhibition of cell migration by selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors may provide an anti-inflammatory role for these compounds. This may allow a novel approach to therapeutic strategies with targeted inhibition of such molecules preventing chronic progression of disease. Mesangial cell migration through the mesangial matrix and into the pericapillary space is a feature of a number of renal diseases, including mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (1Cameron, S., Davison, A. M., Grunfeld, J. P., Kerr, D., and Ritz, E. Oxford Textbook of Clinical Nephrology, Vol. I, pp. 388–402, Oxford University Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). In addition, it appears that extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (2Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar), thrombospondin (3Taraboletti G. Morigi M. Figliuzzi M. Giavazzi R. Zoja C. Remuzzi G. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar), and heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (4Person J.M. Lovett D.H. Raugi G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar) can modulate this migration. This movement of cells must involve disengagement from and remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Possible mediators for this remodeling include a variety of serine proteinases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 but also the newly described ADAM family of molecules. The ADAMs are a family of cell surface molecules that possess both disintegrin and MMP domains. The disintegrin domain of these molecules resembles the sequence of the snake venom disintegrins and binds to integrins on the cell surface (5Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A.P. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This displaces the integrin from its matrix target, thus freeing the cell from its substrate. Moreover the binding of a disintegrin to integrins on its own cell membrane in addition to those on adjacent cells is a possibility, freeing both cells from their substratum. Furthermore, because the ADAM molecules are proteolytically processed (6Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R.

Commun. 1998; 245: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inhibition by antisense was through a direct effect on ADAM 15 expression we hypothesized that the antibodies inhibited HMC migration through an effect on the tertiary structure of the ADAM 15 molecule, which may have inhibited its metalloproteinase activity. This was supported using a sensitive fluorometric assay to investigate the effect of the antibodies on the proteolytic activity of purified ADAM 15. Both the antibody raised against the metalloproteinase domain and that raised against the disintegrin domain inhibited the cleavage of the substrate, whereas control IgG had no effect. This result, taken together with the effect of the BB-3103 proteinase inhibitor on migration, imply that at least part of the inhibitory activity of both the anti-metalloproteinase and anti-disintegrin antibodies on the migration of the HMC in vitro is due to their inhibition of the enzymatic activity of ADAM 15. Neither the antibodies to the extracellular domains of the ADAM 15 molecule nor the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-3103 affected HMC proliferation as measured by labeling with BrdUrd. This was somewhat unexpected, as it has been previously reported that the metalloproteinase activity of MMP-2 is involved in the proliferation of mesangial cells (25Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our findings were confirmed by MTT assay where there were no changes in cell number or viability following incubation with either the antibodies or the metalloproteinase inhibitor. These results confirm a separate series of studies suggesting that factors affecting proliferation in MC are separate from those that effect migration (26Haseley L.A. Hugo C. Reidy M.A. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 964-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A Hastings R.R. Bocanegra R.A. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 460-467PubMed Google Scholar). The RGD integrin-binding sequence of ADAM 15 (18) is reported to facilitate the interaction of this molecule with both the αVβ3 and αVβ1integrin (32Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K.

Considered together with its proteolytic activity, this gives ADAM 15 the potential for involvement in cell migration at several levels. The migration of the mesangial cell from the glomerulus into the pericapillary space in diseases such as mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is a major feature of this disease. Little is known about the mechanisms controlling the migration of the mesangial cells, although it has been reported that MC stimulated with a combination of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ but not unstimulated MC migrated toward a RANTES gradient (34Banas B. Luckow B. Moller M. Klier C. Nelson P.J. Schadde E. Brigl M. Halevy D. Holthofer H. Reinhart B. Schlondorff D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that heparin (4Person J.M. Lovett D.H. Raugi G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar), platelet secretory products, and platelet-derived growth factor (2Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Am. J.

The work presented here describes a possible mechanism by which HMC migration is mediated. We have demonstrated for the first time that ADAM 15 is proteolytically active and that this activity is associated with the migration of HMC. Because inhibition of migration was only partially complete in our system, however, it is likely that there are additional molecules, possibly including other members of the ADAM family, that also contribute. Thus, in both mesangial and other cell types, a degree of redundancy may exist. A recent report (31Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that ADAM 9 can also modulate cell migration, suggests that this is an important role of this family of molecules. The inhibition of cell migration by selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors may provide an anti-inflammatory role for these compounds. This may allow a novel approach to therapeutic strategies with targeted inhibition of such molecules preventing chronic progression of disease.

The present study investigated regulation of the human luteinizing hormone receptor (hLHR) gene by histone deacetylases. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin A (TSA) increased hLHR promoter activity by 40-fold in JAR cells and markedly elevated endogenous hLHR mRNA levels. Acetylated histones H3 and H4 accumulated in TSA-treated cells and associated predominantly with the hLHR promoter. Furthermore, TSA significantly enhanced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter. One of the two Sp1 sites essential for basal promoter activity was identified as critical for the TSA effect, but the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to this site remained unchanged in the absence or presence of TSA. A multiprotein complex was recruited to the hLHR promoter via interaction with Sp1 and Sp3, in which HDAC1 and HDAC2 were docked directly to Sp1-bound DNA and indirectly to Sp3-bound DNA through RbAp48, while mSin3A interacted with both HDACs. HDAC1 and HDAC2 were shown to potently repress the hLHR gene transcription, and mSin3A potentiated the inhibition mediated by HDAC1. Our studies have demonstrated that the HDAC-mSin3A complex has an important role in the regulation of hLHR gene transcription by interaction with Sp1/Sp3 and by region-specific changes in histone acetylation and polymerase II recruitment within the hLHR promoter.

It mediates gonadotropin signals and triggers intracellular responses that participate in maturation and function of the gonads as well as the regulation of steroidogenesis and gametogenesis (1Catt K.J.

The LHR gene is also expressed in several non-gonadal tissues, including the uterus and placenta, where its functions have not been determined (for a review, see Ref. 2Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Characterization of the LHR gene promoter from different species has provided insights into regulatory mechanism of LHR gene transcription. Our previous studies showed that the LHR gene is TATA-less and contains multiple transcriptional start sites (3Tsai-Morris C.H. Xie X. Wang W. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

The minimal promoter domain resides within the 180-bp region 5′ to ATG (+1) and contains multiple elements with potential binding activity for transcriptional factors Sp1 and Sp3. Two Sp1/Sp3 binding domains of central importance for basal promoter activity have been identified in human and rodents (for a review, see Ref. 2Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear orphan receptors EAR2 and EAR3 were shown to repress LHR gene transcription through binding to an imperfect direct repeat motif (8Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2763-2770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of the promoter activity at the same site by another orphan receptor, TR4, was only observed for the human LHR gene (hLHR). This difference was attributed to a single nucleotide base pair substitution at the core motif and absence of a guanine in the 3′ adjacent sequence of the rat LHR promoter (8Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J.

Recent evidence have demonstrated that modification of nucleosomal histones by two opposing enzymes, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), plays an active role in transcriptional regulation of a number of target genes (10Chen H.

Histone acetyltransferase-catalyzed acetylation of the conserved lysine residues at N-terminal region of histones reduces interaction between chromosomal DNA and histone tails, rendering an accessible chromatin environment for initiation of target gene transcription. In contrast, HDACs promote formation of a compact promoter and transcriptional repression (for reviews, see Refs. 14Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar and 15Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). In the present study, an investigation of the modulation of hLHR gene transcription demonstrated that the histone deacetylase-mSin3A complex has a major role in silencing of Sp1/Sp3-driven hLHR gene transcription. All plasmids were constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques. The wild type hLHR promoter construct or the promoters harboring the mutant Sp1-1, Sp1-2, or orphan receptor binding site (direct repeat) have been described previously (7Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2763-2770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other mutant promoter/reporter gene constructs were designed in order to disrupt any DNA binding activity of Sp1/Sp3 transcriptional factors. For construction of HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression plasmids, the appropriate DNA fragment containing HCAC1 or HDAC2 coding sequence with the stop codon removed was generated by PCR amplification using Quick-Clone cDNA of human ovary (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as template, followed by ligation into pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in frame with C-terminal V5/His tag. The fidelity of the clones was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression of HDACs in transfection assays was confirmed by Western blot using V5 antibody (Invitrogen). For construction of the expression plasmid of mSin3A, a 4.721-kb fragment harboring full-length mSin3A coding sequence as well as 78-bp 5′-untranslated region and 793-bp 3′-untranslated region was released from pBluescript SK-mSin3A plasmid (kindly provided by Drs. Halleck and Schlegel, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Penn State University) and ligated into pcDNA3.1 vector at theEcoRI site. JAR cells (human placental choriocarcinoma cells; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate (NaB), and hydroxyurea were obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Transfection of the various constructs into JAR cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The luciferase activities were normalized to light units/μg of protein and expressed as mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate wells. JAR cells were cultured to 90% confluence followed by treatment with vehicle (ethanol) or with 100 ng/ml TSA (330 nm) for various times as indicated. At different time points, cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Any possible co-purified DNA was removed during the preparation using an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RT-PCR was carried out using Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), in which 600 ng of total RNA of each sample was used as template. The primers used for amplification of a 474-bp fragment of human LHR coding region were 5′-GGAAACCACTCTCTCACAAGT-3′ and 5′-GGTGGATTGAGAAGGCTTATTTG-3′. Amplification of a 620-bp fragment of human β-actin gene was carried out as an internal control. The specific primers used for hβ-actin were 5′-CCTCGCCTTTGCCGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3′ (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 90% confluence before TSA was added, and cells continued to be cultured for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and collected into 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested by brief centrifugation and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Sonication of cells was performed 5 times for 10 s each followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) followed by immunoclearing with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum and 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for overnight at 4 °C with 3–5 μl of specific antibodies as indicated. The antibodies for acetylated forms of histone H3 or H4 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the RNA polymerase II antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After immunoprecipitation, 30 μl of protein A-agarose and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added, and the sample was incubated for another 1 h. Precipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 2500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 M LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and extracted three times with 150 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. The samples were then treated with protease K (100 μg/ml) at 50 °C for 45 min followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation facilitated by adding Pellet PaintTM co-precipitant reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI). DNA pellet was dissolved in 40 μl of TE buffer. 1 μl of DNA was used for PCR with 25 cycles of amplification. Nuclear extracts from TSA-treated or vehicle-treated (ethanol) JAR cells were prepared as described previously (8Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2763-2770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). For EMSA, [32P]ATP end-labeled double-stranded DNA oligomer corresponding to the Sp1-1 site (5′-AGCCAAGGGGCGGGGAGAGGG-3′) of the hLHR promoter was incubated with 5-μg nuclear extracts on ice for 15 min. In supershift assays, specific antibodies for Sp1, Sp3, or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preincubated with proteins for 30 min at 4 °C before the probe was added. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gel. 5′ biotin end-labeled sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild type (5′-AGCCAAGGGGCGGGGAGAGGG-3′) or mutant (5′-AGCCAAatctgcaGcAGAGGG-3′; mutation shown in lowercase type) Sp1-1 binding site of the hLHR promoter were custom made by Gene Probe Technology, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The oligomers were annealed and gel-purified by 12% PAGE gel. 50 μg of nuclear extracts isolated from TSA-treated or vehicle-treated JAR cells were incubated with 0.25 μg of wild type or mutant oligonucleotide probe in 400 μl of binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 45 min. The DNA-protein complexes were then incubated with 40 μl of TetralinkTM Avidin Resin (Promega, Madison, WI), which was pre-equilibrated in the binding buffer for 1 h. The incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. DNA-protein complexes were then washed five times with the binding buffer. 36 μl of 2× protein sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to the avidin-precipitated DNA-protein complex, which was then boiled for 5 min to dissociate the complexes. The proteins were resolved on PAGE followed by Western blot detection using specific antibodies as indicated. The nuclear proteins (30 μg/lane) isolated from TSA- or vehicle-treated JAR cells were subject to Western blot for detection of various transcription factors as shown. The antibodies for acetylated forms of histone H3 or H4 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against HDAC-1, HDAC-2, mSin 3A, RbAp46 or RbAp48, and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 100 μg of nuclear extracts with 0.5 μg of the appropriate immunoprecipitation antibody in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads was then added, and the incubation was continued for overnight. Protein A-precipitated protein complex was recovered by brief centrifugation followed by washing for five times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The beads were resuspended in 36 μl of 2× protein sample buffer and were boiled for 5 min to release the bound proteins, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blot using the antibodies as indicated. To investigate whether transcription of the hLHR gene was subject to modulation through chromatin modification related to histone acetylation and deacetylation, transient transfection studies using reporter gene analysis of the hLHR promoter activity was carried out in JAR cells treated with or without two HDAC inhibitors, TSA and NaB. TSA is the most specific of the HDAC inhibitors yet identified, whereas butyrate affects DNA methylation and other enzyme systems (17Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar,18Kramer O.H. Gottlicher M. Heinzel T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Since, in some studies, both TSA and NaB were reported to display pleiotropic effects as cell differentiation inducers in cell lines tested (19Minucci S. Horn V. Bhattacharyya N. Russanova V. Ogryzko V.V. Gabriele L. Howard B.H. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11295-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), hydroxyurea, a known potent cell differentiation inducer (20Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was also evaluated. The hLHR promoter activity was markedly increased in the cells incubated with either TSA or NaB (Fig.1A). The magnitude of the activation observed in the presence of 100 ng/ml (330 nm) TSA was 40-fold, which more than doubled that elicited by NaB at a much higher concentration (2.5–5.0 mm). In contrast, hydroxyurea only marginally elevated the hLHR promoter activity over the control, and the increase was not dose-related. Thus, the results made TSA a preferred HDAC inhibitor to employ in the subsequent experiments. Further analyses showed a dose-dependent activation of the hLHR promoter activity by TSA (Fig. 1B). A potent induction of the hLHR promoter was observed at 50 ng/ml TSA, and the maximal activation was achieved at the concentration of 100 ng/ml. In temporal studies, TSA caused a major induction of hLHR promoter activity at 6 h (13 ± 1.2-fold) that reached maximal levels at 12 h (36.7 ± 1.8-fold), and were maintained at the 24-h time point (38.4 ± 3.5-fold; Fig. 1C). In further studies, we evaluated whether the endogenous expression of the hLHR gene governed by its natural promoter could be regulated by TSA. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from TSA-treated or -untreated cells revealed a strong activation of endogenous hLHR gene transcription following a 6-h incubation of the cells with 100 ng/ml of TSA (7-fold induction; Fig. 1D). The hLHR mRNA level was further increased at 12 h after treatment (11-fold), and similar -fold-induction was observed at 24 h. In contrast, the expression of the human β-actin gene was not affected. Our results showed clear correlation between the transcriptional responses of the hLHR gene to TSA, exogenously and endogenously. These studies have demonstrated that hLHR gene transcription was markedly induced when histone deacetylase activity was inhibited by TSA and that histone deacetylation caused significant repression of the hLHR gene transcription in these cells. The initial studies led us to propose that TSA-mediated changes in the balance of histone acetylation and deacetylation might result in local chromatin modification or remodeling of the hLHR gene, which in turn would elicit activation/derepression of the hLHR gene transcription. In order to test this proposal, the effect of TSA treatment on the degree of acetylated histone proteins present in JAR cells was first examined (Fig. 2A). Both acetylated histones H3 and H4 were undetectable in the absence of TSA and no increases were noted in the cells incubated with TSA for 3 or 6 h. However, at 12 h of treatment with TSA, a strong immunoreactive band of acetylated H4 and a weaker band of acetylated H3 were observed. Further increases were observed at 24 h, when the intensities of the bands for acetylated H3 and H4 were similar. In contrast, the level of actin (used as normalizing protein) was not affected by TSA treatment. In order to determine assembly of the acetylated histones throughout the 5′-flanking region of the hLHR gene, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed. Occupancy of four regions of the 5′-flanking sequence by the acetylated histones was analyzed, including one that covered the entire 176-bp hLHR gene promoter as well as a small part of the coding region (+1 to +27), and three other nonoverlapping segments 5′ to the promoter domain (Fig. 2C). TSA treatment caused a profound induction in the binding of both acetylated H3 and H4 to the region 1 (Fig. 2B, band c). Also, weak binding of both acetylated histones to region 2 was detected in the presence of TSA, whereas no binding was noted in its absence. In contrast, no binding to regions 3 and 4 was observed regardless of TSA treatment. The results showed that TSA-induced acetylated histones were associated predominantly with the hLHR gene promoter rather than distributed randomly at its 5′-flanking region. This promoter-specific localization of the histone acetylation could provide a more accessible promoter environment for recruitment of component(s) of general transcriptional machinery and RNA polymerase II. In this regard, specific recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the hLHR gene promoter was significantly increased upon TSA treatment (Fig. 2B, d). Taken together, the results indicated a direct link between the inhibition of HDAC activity and the increase of RNA polymerase II recruitment to the hLHR promoter in activation/derepression of the hLHR gene transcription. Previous studies have revealed that the highly GC-rich hLHR promoter harbored two Sp1-activating domains (Sp1(I) and Sp1(II)) and a repressive/activating nuclear orphan receptor binding site (direct repeat; DR) (Fig. 3A, 7 and8). Moreover, four additional elements bearing weak Sp1/Sp3 binding activities but without detectable function were also identified (domains A1, A2,A3, andS3). 2B. Fu, C. H. Tsai-Morris, and M. L. Dufau, unpublished observations. In order to identify cis-element(s) responsible for TSA-mediated induction of the hLHR gene promoter activity, reporter gene analyses were performed utilizing the hLHR wild type promoter (WT) and its various mutant constructs. These included the constructs that were devoid of binding of Sp1/Sp3 or of the three nuclear orphan receptors (EAR2, EAR3, and TR4). As shown in Fig. 3, the wild type promoter activity was markedly increased after TSA treatment (construct 2), whereas the Basic vector as a control was only marginally elevated (construct 1). Mutation of the direct repeat element resulted in activated basal promoter activity due to release of the inhibition at this site (construct 3). Moreover, TSA significantly induced the activity of this mutant construct (-fold induction, 35.3 ± 2.36) similarly as for the wild type promoter (-fold induction, 38.8 ± 2.95). Mutation at the four non-functional Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (A1, A2, A3, and S3) did not affect promoter activities in the absence or presence of TSA when compared with the wild type construct (constructs 4 and 5). Thus, these domains did not participate in basal promoter activity or the TSA response. When constructs containing either mutated Sp1-1 or Sp1-2 or double mutations were analyzed, as expected, mutation at either site decreased the basal promoter activity (constructs 6–8). However, only when the Sp1-1 site was mutated was the induction of the hLHR promoter activity by TSA markedly decreased. The largely impaired TSA responses due to Sp1-1 site mutation were most evident when presented as -fold induction from control (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in analyses using the constructs with simultaneous mutations at all Sp1 binding sites (constructs 9 and 10). Taken together, these studies demonstrated that the Sp1-1 site is critical for activation/derepression of the hLHR gene transcription by HDAC inhibitor TSA. We next investigated whether the Sp1-1 site-dependent activation of the hLHR promoter activity could be attributed to a change of Sp1/Sp3 binding activities to this site or to formation of novel DNA-protein complex(s) after TSA treatment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses demonstrated that incubation of Sp1-1 site probe with the nuclear extracts from control or TSA-treated JAR cells formed Sp1 and Sp3 binding complexes (Fig.4A, lanes 1 and7). The binding specificity was confirmed by cold competition (lanes 2 and 8) and antibody supershift assays (lanes 3–5 and 9–11) using normal rabbit IgG as a control (N-IgG, lanes 6and 12). As previously shown (7Geng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the binding was competed by the unlabeled Sp1-1 oligomer DNA (100-fold) and supershifted by Sp1 or Sp3 antibody. Furthermore, the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the Sp1-1 site was not affected by TSA, since similar binding was observed in the absence or presence of TSA. Also, no additional DNA-protein complex was detected. The observation that activation of hLHR gene transcription occurred when HDAC-induced deacetylation of the promoter region was inhibited by TSA treatment indicated that HDAC(s) recruited to the hLHR gene caused an unfavorable promoter environment. DAPAs were used to determine whether Sp1/Sp3 were possible candidates to target the non-DNA-binding protein HDACs to the hLHR promoter. The expected binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the WT but not the mutated Sp1-1 probe (Mutant) was shown in this assay (Fig.5, right). Histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 were specifically pulled out by the wild type Sp1-1 but not by the mutant probe, revealing association of both proteins to the Sp1-1 complex. Also, the possible inclusion in the complex of two corepressor proteins, mSin3A and NcoR, was investigated, since HDAC1/2 were previously reported to associate differentially with these cofactors to regulate target gene expression (21Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H., Jr. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 22Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). mSin3A was identified as a component of the complex, whereas association of NcoR was not detected. Moreover, when two reported HDAC-interacting proteins, RbAp46 and RbAp48, were evaluated, only RbAp48 bound to the complex. The formation of the complex was sequence-specific, since it was abolished when the Sp1-1 site was mutated. Western blot analyses revealed that all of the relevant proteins evaluated by DAPA assays, including NcoR and RpAp46, were expressed in JAR cells (Fig. 5,left). Thus, the lack of participation of NcoR or RbAp46 was not related to absence of protein expression. It was also noted that the binding of the complex and the expression level of the individual complex component was not affected by the TSA treatment. In addition, no recruitment to the hLHR promoter of several transcription factors with histone acetyltransferase activity, including p300, CBP, or pCAF, was observed (data not shown). Taken together, our findings have indicated the formation of a multiprotein complex including DNA-binding protein(s) and at least four non-DNA-binding cofactors at the Sp1-1 site. More significantly, it was revealed that two histone deacetylases and the corepressor mSin3A but not NcoR were specifically recruited to the hLHR gene promoter. To determine the order in which the identified components of the complex associated with each other, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed. This study showed that HDAC1 could be co-precipitated by specific antibody against Sp1 but not by Sp3 antibody (Fig.6A). A similar observation was obtained for HDAC2 and RbAp48, whereas a weak interaction between Sp3 and RbAp48 was also detected. Furthermore, mSin3A was not revealed in the presence of Sp1 or Sp3 antibody, indicating that there was no direct protein-protein interaction between mSin3A and the Sp1/Sp3 factors. However, direct association between mSin3A and either HDAC1 or HDAC2 was shown, since it could be co-precipitated by both HDAC antibodies (Fig. 6B). In addition, coimmunoprecipitation using RbAp48 antibody showed that RbAp48 was able to directly interact with both HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the results indicated that recruitment of HDAC1/2 to the hLHR promoter was mediated through a double-docking action: a direct recruitment by Sp1 but not Sp3 and an indirect binding via their association with RbAp48, which interacted with both Sp1 and Sp3. Targeting of mSin3A to the Sp1-1 site was achieved indirectly through binding of mSin3A to both HDAC1 and HDAC2. To elucidate whether the HDACs-mSin3A complex could actively participate in the regulation of the hLHR gene transcription, cotransfection studies of the hLHR promoter and the HDAC1 and HDAC2 constructs were carried out (Fig.7A). As was shown above (Fig.1B), TSA dose-dependent"
https://openalex.org/W2049451816,"Myc is a ubiquitous mediator of cell proliferation and can transactivate the expression of various genes through E-box sites. Here we report a novel gene, mina53(Myc-inducednuclear antigen with a molecular mass of 53 kDa). The mina53 gene encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 53 kDa, which is localized in the nucleus and with part of the protein concentrated in the nucleolus. When serum-starved cells were activated by serum, the level of c-myc mRNA was elevated, and an increase in mina53 mRNA followed the elevation of c-myc mRNA. When expression of c-myc was reduced in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the expression ofmina53 mRNA and protein was reduced. The expression ofmina53 mRNA and Mina53 protein was induced by ectopic introduction of wild type c-Myc but not by a mutant c-Myc lacking the transactivation domain. When c-Myc in the c-MycER chimeric protein was activated, mina53 mRNA was increased, even in the presence of an inhibitor for protein synthesis. E-box sites are present in a region proximal to the transcription initiation sites of themina53 gene. The gene expression from themina53 promoter was elevated by c-Myc through E-box sites. c-Myc protein bound to the mina53 promoter region in vivo in HL60 cells in the proliferating phase but not after treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

The myc family of proto-oncogenes consists mainly of three genes, c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc(1DePinho R.A. Schreiber-Agus N. Alt F.W. Adv.

Although the three genes exhibit distinct patterns of expression with respect to cell types and developmental stages of cells, they can substitute for each other in certain situations and appear to have basically the same biological activity. Deregulated expression of myc family genes, through gene amplification, viral promoter insertion, chromosomal translocation, or promoter mutation has long been known to be associated with neoplastic diseases in a wide range of vertebrates including humans. Embryonic mice with c-myc or N-myc deleted develop multi-organ hypoplasia and die during mid-embryogenesis (6Stanton B.R. Perkins A.S. Tessarollo L. Sassoon D.A. Parada L.F.

These results indicate that the myc family genes are central regulators of cell growth (4Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 9Lüscher B. Gene. 2001; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). c-myc is one of the most widely studied proto-oncogenes and is the best characterized member of the myc gene family. In general, c-myc expression is associated with cell proliferation and is down-regulated in quiescent and differentiated cells. The protein encoded by c-myc is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors (5Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 9Lüscher B. Gene. 2001; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Dimerization of c-Myc protein with its obligate partner Max results in the formation of a heterodimer that binds to E-box sites (mainly CACGTG elements). Besides the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain (Max binding and DNA binding sites), c-Myc has another domain, the transactivation domain (TAD), 1The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends; CMV, cytomegalovirus; kb, kilobase(s); siRNA, small interference RNA; OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; FCS, fetal calf serum; EST, expressed sequence tag; TPA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HEL, human erythroid leukemia. and the c-Myc-Max heterodimer activates transcription of various genes by activities of these domains. c-Myc has been shown to directly transactivate the expression of a number of genes (10Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar), including ornithine decarboxylase (11Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). But the transactivation of these genes by c-Myc is generally weak, between two to severalfold. Attempts to identify genes capable of re-establishing normal proliferative rates in c-myc−/− cells have resulted in the repeated identification of c-myc and N-myc(16Nikiforov M.A. Kotenko I.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results suggest that myc controls not a gene but genes to regulate cell proliferation. Although much effort has been made to investigate c-Myc, c-myc still remains enigmatic, and information about additional genes controlled by c-myccan help elucidate the function of c-Myc. Here we report a novel gene, mina53, whose expression is directly induced by c-Myc. The mina53 gene encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa, which localizes in the nucleus and some of which is concentrated in the nucleolus. Specific inhibition of mina53 expression by an RNA interference method severely suppressed cell proliferation, suggesting that the mina53 contributes to cell growth induced by c-myc. Human glioblastoma cell line T98G cells were cultured in Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and rat fibroblast cell line 3Y1 and its derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS. Rat colon cancer cell line RCN-9 (Riken Cell Bank, Saitama, Japan) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Human cancer cell lines, human erythroid leukemia (HEL), MCAS (ovarian cancer), and WiDr (colon cancer) were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan. These cells were grown in appropriate media. PCR amplifications were performed in 50 μl of EXTaq buffer (Takara, Shiga, Japan) containing 10 pmol of each primer, 1.2 units of EX Taq DNA polymerase, and 200 μm dNTP. Synthesis of single-strand cDNA of human erythroleukemia HEL or rat colon cancer RCN-9 cells was performed on total RNA (1 μg) using a Superscript First-strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). One μl (total 20 μl) of resultant single-strand cDNA was used as the template for PCR. The RT-PCR primers for the amplification were mina53 RT-F (5′-ACACCGGTGACGAGCGCACGGAAAG-3′, a sequence in the 5′-untranslated region) and mina53 RT-R (5′-GCCTCTCATCTGTGGGGAAGTATTA-3′, a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region) for human and mina53 RT-F (5′-TTTCCTCCCTACTTGTGAACAATGC-3′, a sequence in the 5′-untranslated region and the first four coding nucleotides) and rat mina53 RT-R (5′-AATGATGCTCTTTAAAGGAGTTATTT-3′, a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region) for rat. The temperature profile was 35 cycles of denaturing at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2.5 min. Reverse transcriptase reaction, double-strand cDNA synthesis, and adapter ligation from poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) of HEL cells were performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (18Koda Y. Soejima M. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7501-7505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The first PCR was performed using primers, mina53-RACE-1 (5′-GCAGTACTGTGAGGACAATGTGGTCTT-3′, a sequence in the 5′-terminal region of expressed sequence tag (EST) clone W27666) and the AP1 primer provided by the supplier. The temperature profile was initial denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 96 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. One μl of the first RACE-PCR product diluted 1000 times was used as the template for nest RACE-PCR. Nest PCR was performed using mina53-RACE-2 primer (5′-CTCACTACACTGTCCAGCCTCGGTAA-3′), which corresponds to a sequence in the upstream region of mina53-RACE-1 of EST clone W27666 or the mina53-RACE-3 primer (5′-CAACCAAGGAGCCAAAGTAACATTC-3′, a sequence in the middle part of mina53 cDNA) and the AP2 primer provided by the supplier. The temperature profile was initial denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 96 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. Pc-myc/CDM8, in which human c-myc is driven by a CMV promoter, was described previously (13Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pc-myc/CDM8 was digested with PstI and self-ligated to produce pc-myc(d41–178)/CDM8, which encodes a mutant c-Myc protein lacking the TAD. The 2-kb BstXI-KpnI fragment, blunted with Klenow enzyme, of pTc-mycerS/BS (13Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was inserted into a 5-kb EcoRI fragment, blunted with Klenow enzyme, and de-phosphorylated with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase of a pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (19Sunaga S. Maki K. Komagata Y. Ikuta K. Miyazaki J.I. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to produce pc-mycer/CAGGS in which c-mycer is driven by a chimeric promoter consisting of chicken actin and CMV promoters. cDNA for humanmina53 was amplified by PCR with 5′-GAAGCTTATGCCAAAGAAAGCAAAGCCTACAGG-3′, adding aHindIII site just before the initiation methionine, and 5′-TGAATTCATCCTCTCCTCGGCTCAGGTCTT-3′, which is located downstream after the stop codon, as primers from a library of HEL cells, and the amplified 1.4-kb fragment was cloned into a pGEM-T-vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce pT/hmina53 (465) and pT/hmina53 (464), encoding 465- and 464-amino acid proteins, respectively. The 1.5-kbHindIII-SalI fragment of pT/hmina53 (465) was inserted into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) cut withHindIII and SalI to produce pEGFP/hmina53 (465) for green fluorescent protein-Mina53 fusion protein. The 1.5-kb HindIII-NotI fragment of pT/hmina53 (465) was inserted into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), which was digested with HindIII and NotI, to produce phmina53/Rc/CMV. The DNA fragment encoding human mina53 was amplified by PCR with 5′-GCCATGCCATGGCAAAGAAAGCAAAGCCTAC-3′, designed to have an artificial NcoI site at the initiation codon methionine, and 5′-GGCATGCCATGGCTAGACTACTTGAATTAAAC-3′, adding aNcoI site just after the stop codon, as primers from pEGFP/hmina53 (465). The amplified 1.4-kb fragment was cleaved withNcoI and ligated with an E. coli expression vector pET11d (Novagen, Madison, WI) cut with NcoI and de-phosphorylated with E. coli alkaline phosphatase to produce pET/hmina53. The 1.5-kb XhoI-SalI fragment, blunted with Klenow enzyme, of pEGFP/hmina53 (465) was inserted into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences), which was digested withEcoRI, blunted with Klenow enzyme, and de-phosphorylated with E. coli alkaline phosphatase to produce pGEX-hmina53 for glutathione S-transferase-Mina53 fusion protein. Ratmina53 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR protocol as described above and cloned into a pGEM-T-vector (Promega) to produce pT/rmina53. A genomic DNA fragment of the human mina53 gene, which extends from the promoter region to intron 1, was amplified by PCR with 5′-CGGGATCCTGAACGCGGAACACCGCCGGGTAGC-3′, adding a BamHI site, and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCTCTTCCTCCCAGTCTATCCTTC-3′, adding aHindIII site. The 0.8-kb amplified fragment was cleaved withBamHI and HindIII and inserted into the 4.8-kb fragment of pGL3-basic vector containing firefly luciferase (Promega) cut with BglII and HindIII to produce pMina(W)luci. pMina(W)luci was cleaved with HindIII andPmaCI, blunted with Klenow enzyme, and self-ligated to produce pMina(dE)luci, in which two E-boxes were deleted. Mutation was introduced at E-box sites of pMina(W)luci using a Gene EditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) to produce pMina(mE1)luci, pMina(mE2)luci, and pMina(mE1/2)luci, in which one or two E-boxes (CACGTG elements) were mutated to CACCTG. pActHyg, which contains a hygromycin resistance gene under control of an actin promoter, was a kind gift from Dr. M. Nakanishi (13Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pRL-CMV containing the Renilla reniformis luciferase gene under control of the CMV promoter was purchased from Promega. To establish rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells highly expressing c-Myc or mutant c-Myc lacking a large part of TAD, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pActHyg and 20 μg of pc-myc/CDM8 or pc-myc(d41–178)/CDM8 by a calcium phosphate method (20Chen C.A. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 2 weeks in the medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Individual clones were isolated, and the expression of c-Myc or mutant c-Myc protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody. Clones 3Y1MycA and 3Y1MycB (expressing c-Myc protein) and 3Y1Myc(dTAD)A and 3Y1Myc(dTAD)B (expressing mutant c-Myc protein lacking the transactivation domain) were established. To establish human glioblastoma T98G cells expressing c-MycER chimeric protein (T98Gmycer-2 cells), cells were transfected with 20 μg of pc-mycer/CAGGS and 0.4 μg of pActHyg, and the expression of c-MycER in individual clones was detected as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol/chloroform extraction method using a diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated RNA preparation solution set (Nakalai, Kyoto, Japan). Total RNA from untreated T98Gmycer-2 cells and from cells treated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) for 20 h was isolated. Poly(A+) RNA was recovered and subjected to differential display using a DNA chip (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). About 9000 kinds of cDNAs including EST clones were plated on the chip (UniGEM Human V Version. 2). RNA was electrophoresed in an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with32P-labeled cDNA. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Multiprime labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences). The results were quantified using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The DNA probes for c-myc, mina53, and CD18 were prepared as follows: c-myc, a 1.6-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment from pc-myc/CDM8 (13Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); human mina53, a 442-bp fragment amplified by PCR with 5′-CAGAGCTGTCAACACCAGGTGGAAAGTTAC-3′ and 5′-TGAATTCATCCTCTCCTCGGCTCAGGTCTT-3′ as primers from pEGFP/hmina53 (465); rat mina53, a 0.6-kb ApaI fragment from pT/rmina53; CD18, a 1.8-kb fragment amplified by RT-PCR with 5′-GTTTGCCACTGATGACGGCTTCCATTTC-3′ and 5′-AACACGCACCTAACCTCACCAACCTCAA-3′ as primers from total RNA isolated from HL60 cells that had been cultured in 10 nm TPA for 24 h. The sequence of CD18 cDNA was confirmed by direct sequencing. T98Gmycer-2 cells were grown in medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For transfection, 3 × 104 cells were plated into a dish (12-well plate; well diameter, 22 mm) and cultured for 20–24 h. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg of the reporter plasmids and 20 ng of pRL-CMV as an internal transfection marker. One day later, OHT (final concentration, 0.2 μm) was added to activate MycER chimeric protein, and cells were further cultured for 17 h. Cells were then collected and analyzed for firefly and R. reniformis luciferase activities using a Dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). After normalization of R. reniformis luciferase activities, firefly luciferase activities with activated c-MycER were expressed as the ratio of activities without the MycER activation. To normalize the effect of OHT not through MycER activation, the values from T98Gmycer-2 cells were divided by the values from T98G parent cells, which were treated by exactly the same procedures as those of T98Gmycer-2 cells described above. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed basically as described by Boyd et al.(21Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered by adding 20 μl of protein A beads blocked by DNA and BSA (50% volume/volume). The beads were washed, the DNA fragments were eluted, and the eluted solutions were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Then, immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were detected by PCR. PCR primers were 5′-GCCGGCGCTGTGGTTGCGGGACCTG-3′ and 5′-TCCTCTTCCTCCCAGTCTATCCTTC-3′, which amplified a 483-bp fragment containing E-boxes near the two transcription start sites of the human mina53 gene, and 5′-TTACAGGTAAGCCCTCCAATGACC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAGCTACCATTTAGGAACCC-3′, which amplified the genomic sequence of a region containing an E-box in chromosome 22. This E-box is located in a chromosomal region without any detectable genes (14Bouchard C. Dittrich O. Kiermaier A. Dohmann K. Menkel A. Eilers M. Lücher B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Human mina53 (from the third amino acid Lys to the carboxyl-terminal end) was expressed using pET/hmina53 in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and isolated by SDS-PAGE. Rabbits were immunized with the recombinant polypeptide. The glutathione S-transferase fusion Mina53 was expressed using pGEX-hmina53 in E. coli JM109 and isolated by a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal anti-Mina53 antibody was purified from rabbit serum using Sepharose 4B conjugated with recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Mina53 polypeptide as described previously (23Tsuneoka M. Yamamoto A. Fujiki Y. Tashiro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antibody-1 against c-Myc was described previously (13Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Anti-c-Myc antibody-2 (N262) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody (C23) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-15) (Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased. Cells were trypsinized and extracted in 3% SDS solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. Cell extracts were separated on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After treatment with antibodies, bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). For indirect immunofluoresence staining, HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips in a 6-well plate were fixed in methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Anti-Mina53 rabbit antibody and mouse anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody were added and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. After washing in 0.1% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline three times, Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were added, incubated for 120 min at 37 °C, and washed with 0.1% skim milk three times. Finally, cells were embedded in Immunon (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and observed via fluorescence microscopy. RNA with 21 nucleotides was chemically synthesized (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan). The siRNA sequences targeting human Mina53 and rat Mina53 are in positions 45–63 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon and the 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang of deoxythymidine. A control siRNA sequence was an inverted sequence of the siRNA directed to human mina53. siRNAs were annealed and transfected essentially as described previously by Elbashir et al. (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells in an exponentially growing phase were trypsinized and transferred to a 12-well plate. Transfection was carried out with 100 pmol of siRNA per well using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to their instructions, except that HeLa cells were cultured for 20 h for transfection without serum, and 3Y1MycB cells were cultured for 10 h. To conditionally activate c-Myc activity, the estrogen-inducible Myc system (25Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) was used. The chimeric protein c-MycER consists of human c-Myc and the estrogen binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. c-MycER anchors to cytoskeletal components of cells in the absence of estrogen. When estrogen or its derivative, OHT, binds to the chimeric protein, it becomes free to function as c-Myc. The human glioblastoma cell line T98G was used as the parental cells into which ectopic c-Myc activity was introduced. A T98G cell line expressing c-MycER protein (T98Gmycer-2 cells) was established. Total RNAs from T98Gmycer-2 cells in an exponentially growing phase in the presence or absence of OHT for 20 h were processed by a cDNA micro array analysis. Specific signals for Myc target genes, ornithine decarboxylase (11Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and nucleolin (26Greasley P.J. Bonnard C. Amati B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were increased by 2.6- and 1.6-fold, respectively, with c-MycER activation. These results suggest that Myc target genes could be detected in this experimental system. To shed light on a new facet of c-Myc functions, we focused on human EST sequences among genes stimulated by c-MycER activation. The signal for EST clone W27666 was stimulated by 1.9-fold with c-Myc activation. This stimulation rate was similar to those of the Myc-targeted genes, ornithine decarboxylase and nucleolin, measured in this study. cDNA encoding the 5′ upstream part of EST clone W27666 was isolated using the 5′-RACE protocol from a library of HEL cells. We isolated two kinds of cDNAs with different sequences at the 5′ terminus. From the results of the nucleotide sequences from 5′-RACE experiments and ESTs, we predicted the whole sequence of the mRNA molecule. Using primers consistent with 5′-part and 3′-part sequences of the predicted molecule, a 2.3-kb-length cDNA was amplified from total RNA of HEL cells by RT-PCR protocol. The amplified cDNA was cloned into a vector and sequenced. The majority of cDNA clones encode a protein of 465 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 52,800.28 Da (Fig. 1 A). The subcellular localization of this protein was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence staining with the specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this protein is localized in the nucleus. For these reasons, we refer to this gene and protein as mina53 and Mina53 (Myc-induced nuclear antigen with a molecular mass of 53 kDa). In addition to the diffuse localization in the nucleus, strong dotted staining was observed within the nucleus and supposed to be nucleoli. Double staining with anti-nucleolin antibody indicated that these dots were consistent with nucleoli. Nuclear and nucleolar localization of Mina53 was also observed when green fluorescent protein-Mina53 fusion protein was expressed (data not shown). These results suggest that Mina53 is a nuclear protein, some of which is concentrated in nucleoli. The cDNA encoding a 464-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 52,672.15 Da was also cloned. This protein lacks Gln-297 of the major protein. We also detected a cDNA that has 101 bp inserted in the middle part of the mina53cDNA. There is a stop codon in the inserted sequence, and the cDNA encodes 262 amino acids of Mina53 protein from the initiation codon and 18 additional novel amino acids at the 3′ end. Although the amount of this mRNA was small, we detected this mRNA molecule in cDNA libraries made from a human ovary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma cell line (MCAS) and a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (WiDr) (data not shown). A mouse cDNA that appeared to be an orthologue of human mina53 was found by a Blast search (GenBankTM NM_025910). A rat EST (GenBankTMH32933) that is 300 bp in length and is homologous to the 3′-untranslated region of mouse and humanmina53 was also found. Using primers that were predicted to amplify rat mina53 mRNA, we isolated ratmina53 cDNA from RCN-9 cells by RT-PCR protocol. The predicted amino acid sequences for Mina53 from the three species were aligned (Fig. 1 A). The open reading frames of rat and mousemina53 encode 465 amino acid proteins, as did humanmina53. Human and mouse amino acid sequences of Mina53 proteins were 72% identical to each other, those of human and rat were 75% identical, and those of rat and mouse were 86% identical, suggesting that the mina53 is conserved in mammals. A nucleotide 3 bp upstream of the methionine initiation codon is A inmina53 of all the three species, conforming to a Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The expression profile ofmina53 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis after T98G cells were stimulated by serum (Fig.2 A). Serum stimulation of serum-starved T98G cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in the expression of mina53 mRNA. The increase was detectable at 6 h after serum addition and peaked at 12 h. The increase of c-myc mRNA level was detected at 3 h after serum addition and peaked at 12 h. These results suggest that up-regulation of mina53 mRNA followed the increase of c-myc mRNA. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells are terminally differentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) in which the c-mycexpression level reduces (28Hozumi M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1983; 38: 121-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 29Hickstein D.D. Back A.L. Collins S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21812-"
https://openalex.org/W2136602436,"Despite numerous reports suggesting that β1 integrin receptors undergo differential glycosylation, the potential role of N-linked carbohydrates in modulating integrin function has been largely ignored. In the present study, we find that β1 integrins are differentially glycosylated during phorbol ester (PMA)-stimulated differentiation of myeloid cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage. PMA treatment of two myeloid cell lines, U937 and THP-1, induces a down-regulation in expression of the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase. Correspondingly, the β1 integrin subunit becomes hyposialylated, suggesting that the β1 integrin is a substrate for this enzyme. The expression of hyposialylated β1 integrin isoforms is temporally correlated with enhanced binding of myeloid cells to fibronectin, and, importantly, fibronectin binding is inhibited when the Golgi disrupter, brefeldin A, is used to block the expression of the hyposialylated form. Consistent with the observation that cells with hyposialylated integrins are more adhesive to fibronectin, we demonstrate that the enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues from purified α5β1integrins stimulates fibronectin binding by these integrins. These data support the hypothesis that unsialylated β1 integrins are more adhesive to fibronectin, although desialylation of α5 subunits could also contribute to increased fibronectin binding.

Following treatment with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA),1 U937 and THP-1 cells express proteins characteristic of terminally differentiated cells, including components of the respiratory burst oxidase (gp91phox, p67phox, and p47phox), granule proteins (myeloperoxidase and elastase) and cell adhesion receptors (CD11, CD18, and CD49e) (1Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boles B.K. Ritzenthaler J. Birkenmeier T. Roman J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L703-L712PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the expression of these proteins, PMA-treated cells acquire functions characteristic of mature phagocytes, including respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis, and increased adhesiveness to endothelial cells as well as to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin. In vivo, the increased adhesiveness of monocyte/macrophage cells contributes to the extravasation of cells from the vasculature and may further tether cells at sites of inflammation within the tissues. The PMA-induced adhesion of myeloid cells to extracellular matrix components is mediated by the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors. Integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of one α and one β subunit (3Shimizu Y. Rose D.M. Ginsberg M.H. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 325-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of integrin heterodimers is dictated by the pairing of various α and β subunits; for example, the α5β1 integrin (VLA5) associates with fibronectin, whereas the α2β1 integrin (VLA2) binds to either collagen or laminin. The binding of integrins to ligand, followed by receptor clustering, initiates signal transduction events that ultimately regulate many fundamental cellular processes, including initiation of gene transcription, cell survival, cell motility/invasiveness, and cytoskeletal reorganization. The mechanisms that underlie the PMA-induced adhesion of differentiated myeloid cells to fibronectin have not been well-defined. Several groups have reported that sustained PMA treatment of U937 cells stimulates both the transcription and cell surface expression of the α5 and β1 integrin subunits (2Boles B.K. Ritzenthaler J. Birkenmeier T. Roman J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L703-L712PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bellon T. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rubio M.A. Jochems G. Bernabeu C. Corbi A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Ferreira O.C., Jr. Valinsky J.E. Sheridan K. Wayner E.A. Bianco C. Garcia-Pardo A. Exp.

However, untreated U937 cells express an abundant amount of the α5β1 integrin heterodimer, and yet these cells do not bind to fibronectin. This finding suggests that these receptors are in an inactive state. Increased expression may therefore contribute to enhanced binding but is unlikely to fully account for the robust cell adhesion that occurs following PMA treatment. Intriguingly, it has been shown that PMA treatment of U937 and THP-1 cells induces the synthesis of a β1 integrin subunit with alteredN-glycosylation (8Van de Water L. Aronson D. Braman V. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5730-5737PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, PMA not only increases the expression of β1 integrins but also directs the synthesis of β1 integrins that are structurally different from the β1 integrins expressed by untreated cells. In the present study we provide evidence implicating differentially glycosylated β1 integrins as mediators of the PMA-dependent fibronectin binding of U937 and THP-1 cells. Our studies show that PMA treatment causes a down-regulation in the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme that adds the negatively charged sugar, α2–6-linked sialic acid, to glycoproteins. In turn, β1 integrins that are synthesized following PMA treatment are hyposialylated and demonstrate enhanced fibronectin-binding capability. Collectively, our results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of β1 integrin function during myeloid differentiation. A U937 cell subclone selected for sensitivity to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor was obtained from Dr. Andrew Kraft (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). U937 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin, whereas THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. The PMA-resistant cell line, PRU, was derived from U937 cell cultures by treating U937 cells with 100 ng/ml PMA for 36 h and then by selecting cells that did not adhere to the tissue culture dish. The PMA-containing media was replaced with normal media, and cells were grown for 72 h. This population of cells was then challenged again with 100 ng/ml PMA for 36 h, and nonadherent cells were again collected. The nonadherent cells were diluted and seeded into 96-well dishes to obtain single-cell clones. Clones were subsequently expanded and evaluated for resistance to PMA-induced cell adhesion. U937 cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml PMA for 15 h. Cells were then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mm sodium fluoride, and 200 μm sodium pervanadate (“lysis buffer”). Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford assay (Sigma Chemical Co.). One to two hundred micrograms of cell lysate were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1–2 h with 3% nonfat dry milk. After blocking, blots were incubated for 2–4 h with a monoclonal antibody specific for the β1 integrin (Transduction Labs) or with a polyclonal antibody specific for ST6Gal I (provided by Dr. Karen Colley). Blots were then washed several times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). Following the washes, blots were incubated for 1 h with a horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), then washed again with TBST. Blots were incubated with a luminescent HRP substrate (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, and positive signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Cell lysates were boiled in buffer containing 1% SDS to denature cellular proteins. Cell lysates were then diluted 5-fold in PBS, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The deglycosylating enzyme, PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was added to a final concentration of 10 units/ml, and lysates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cell lysates were treated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 milliunits/ml protease-free Clostridium perfringens sialidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Desialylated or control lysates were then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis. Six hundred micrograms of cell lysate protein was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of either biotinylated SNA or biotinylated MAA (Vector Laboratories). 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma Chemical Co.) was then added, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Lectin/glycoprotein complexes were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by one wash with PBS. Glycoproteins were released from the complexes by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The glycoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, then immunoblotted to detect the β1 integrin. Cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml PMA then were seeded onto tissue culture dishes that had been precoated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were allowed to adhere for 15 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, nonadherent cells were removed from the dishes by washing the dishes with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed for 40 min in 3.7% formaldehyde then stained for 40 min with 0.1% crystal violet. Stained cells were subsequently solubilized in 10% acetic acid, and absorbance spectrophotometry (540 nm) was used to quantify the amount of dye in each sample. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a function blocking antibody specific for either the β1 integrin subunit (Invitrogen) or the β2 or β3 integrin subunits (Chemicon International). A nonspecific, isotype-matched mouse IgG (Chemicon International) was included as a control. Following incubation with the function-blocking antibody (final concentration = 10 μg/ml), 50 ng/ml PMA was added to the samples, and cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated dishes. Cell adhesion was quantified as described above. Cells were resuspended in media containing 50 ng/ml PMA and were then placed in low attachment tissue culture dishes (BD Transduction Laboratories) to eliminate cell adhesion to the dishes. At the designated time points, aliquots of cells were removed from the nonattaching dishes and seeded onto standard tissue culture dishes that had been precoated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were allowed to adhere for 40 min, and then adhesion was quantified as described above. At selected time points during the adhesion time course experiment, brefeldin A (Sigma) was added to the media at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Purified α5β1 integrins (Chemicon International) were resuspended to a final concentration of 4.4 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (“ELISA buffer”), adjusted to pH 6.5. Two hundred milliunits of agarose-conjugated Vibrio choleraeneuraminidase (Calbiochem) was added to the integrin solution, and samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with rotation. As a control, an equivalent amount of α5β1integrin was incubated in pH 6.5 ELISA buffer for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence of neuraminidase. Following the 3-h incubation, the buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4 by dilution with pH 8.0 ELISA buffer. Samples were centrifuged to precipitate the agarose-conjugated neuraminidase, and the integrin-containing supernatants were loaded onto 12-well tissue culture dishes that had been precoated with varying amounts of fibronectin. A final amount of 350 ng of neuraminidase-treated α5β1 integrin (or control integrin) was added to each fibronectin-coated well. Treated or untreated samples were also loaded onto wells that had been precoated with denatured BSA, rather than fibronectin, to control for nonspecific binding. Purified integrins were allowed to adhere to BSA or fibronectin for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with ELISA buffer. The anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody, MAB2000, was subsequently added to the wells (1:1000 dilution, Chemicon International), and the samples were incubated for an additional hour at 37 °C. The MAB2000 antibody recognizes both native and denatured β1 integrins and will precipitate α5β1 from both control and PMA-treated U937 and THP-1 cells (data not shown); therefore, this antibody is insensitive to changes in glycosylation. Following the incubation with MAB2000, wells were washed three times with ELISA buffer. An HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed three times and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the colorimetric HRP substrate, Chromogen (BIOSOURCE International). The amount of integrin bound to matrix-coated wells was quantitated by absorbance spectroscopy using a wavelength of 450 nm. Values for specific binding were obtained by subtracting the BSA-dependent binding (“nonspecific”) from the total fibronectin binding. U937 or THP-1 myeloid cells were incubated for 15 h in the presence of 50 ng/ml PMA, a treatment that is known to induce the differentiation of myeloid cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Following this incubation, PMA-treated and untreated cells (control) were lysed, and lysates were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE. β1 integrins were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mature β1 integrins harvested from PMA-treated U937 and THP-1 cells migrated more rapidly during SDS-PAGE than β1 integrins from untreated U937 and THP-1 cells. The electrophoretic mobility of the precursor β1 integrin isoform was unaffected by PMA treatment. To determine whether the change in the mobility of mature β1 integrins was due to altered N-glycosylation, lysates were treated with PNGase F, an enzyme that removes N-linked carbohydrates from glycoproteins. Subsequent Western blot analysis of PNGase F-treated lysates revealed that deglycosylated β1 integrins from control and PMA-treated cells had identical mobility (Fig.1B), indicating that the differential mobility of glycosylated integrins was due to an alteration in the composition ofN-linked carbohydrates. Most probably, altered glycosylation occurred at the level of the Golgi, in that the partially glycosylated precursor β1 integrin, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized isoform (9Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lenter M. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not exhibit differential electrophoretic mobility in response to PMA. One of the hallmarks of myeloid differentiation is increased cell adhesiveness to a variety of extracellular matrix components. To determine whether the expression of an altered β1integrin glycoform was associated with myeloid differentiation, we evaluated the effects of PMA on the electrophoretic mobility of β1 integrins harvested from the PRU cell line, a U937 subclone that does not exhibit increased cell adhesiveness in response to PMA (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to PMA-sensitive U937 and THP-1 cells, PMA did not cause altered electrophoretic mobility of mature β1 integrins from PRU cells (Fig. 1A). Previous studies of β1integrin glycosylation in other cell types have suggested that β1 integrins can undergo changes in the content of sialic acids (11Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moss L. Prakobphol A. Wiedmann T.W. Fisher S.J. Damsky C.H. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Wadsworth S. Halvorson M.J. Chang A.C. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar, 14Symington B.E. Symington F.W. Rohrschneider L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13258-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether PMA caused a difference in β1 integrin sialylation, we used a lectin affinity approach. Briefly, cell lysates containing an equal amount of β1 integrin (see Fig. 1A) were incubated with a biotinylated lectin, followed by the addition of streptavidin coupled to agarose beads. Lectin/glycoprotein complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The β1integrin was then detected by Western blot analysis. Two lectins were examined; SNA, a lectin that recognizes α2–6-linked sialic acids, and MAA, a lectin that binds to α2–3-linked sialic acids. As shown in Fig. 2A, β1integrins from untreated U937 and THP-1 cells were precipitated by SNA, suggesting that the β1 integrins of undifferentiated myeloid cells typically carry α2–6-linked sialic acid residues. However, SNA failed to precipitate β1 integrins from the lysates of PMA-treated U937 and THP-1 cells. These data suggest that PMA treatment of U937 and THP-1 cells stimulated the expression of β1 integrins that lack in α2–6 sialic acids. Unlike U937 and THP-1 cells, PMA-resistant PRU cells did not express hyposialylated β1 integrins following PMA treatment (Fig.2A), consistent with previous data suggesting that the β1 integrins of PRU cells do not undergo altered glycosylation in response to PMA (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the differential recognition of β1 integrins by the SNA lectin, the α2–3-specific lectin MAA failed to precipitate β1 integrins from any of the cell lysates tested. The SNA lectin analyses suggested that the more rapid electrophoretic mobility of β1 integrins from PMA-treated U937 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 1A) resulted from a PMA-induced loss in α2–6 sialic acids. To further confirm that altered sialylation represented the major PMA-induced change in glycosylation, we compared the electrophoretic mobility of β1 integrins harvested from PMA-treated cells with that of β1 integrins from control cell lysates that had been desialylated by the enzyme, C. perfringens sialidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of sialidase. Following this incubation, the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE then Western blot analysis was done for the β1 integrin. As shown in Fig. 2B, the electrophoretic mobility of control cell β1 integrins that had been enzymatically desialylated was essentially identical to that of the hyposialylated β1 integrins expressed by PMA-treated cells. Given that PMA treatment of U937 and THP-1 cells induced the expression of β1 integrins that were lacking in α2–6 sialic acids, we hypothesized that PMA caused a down-regulation in the enzyme that directs α2–6 sialylation, the ST6Gal 1 sialyltransferase. Accordingly, we used Western blot analysis to examine the protein levels of ST6Gal 1 in treated and untreated cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3, PMA caused a down-regulation of ST6Gal 1 in U937 and THP-1 cell lines but not in the PMA-resistant PRU cell line. Duplicate samples were also blotted for β-actin as a loading control. To determine whether the expression of a hyposialylated β1integrin glycoform was correlated with an alteration in integrin function, we examined cell adhesion to fibronectin. U937, THP-1, and PRU cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PMA for 15 h and were then examined for adhesiveness to fibronectin using a standard colorimetric assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown, U937 and THP-1 demonstrated enhanced binding to fibronectin following PMA treatment, whereas the binding of PRU cells was unaffected by PMA (Fig. 4A). The PMA-dependent binding of U937 cells to fibronectin resulted from some change in the activity of β1integrins, because binding was inhibited by antibodies that block the function of β1 but not β2 or β3 integrins (Fig. 4B). We next examined whether the expression of a hyposialylated β1 integrin isoform was temporally correlated with PMA-induced cell binding to fibronectin. To this end, we established a time course for PMA-stimulated cell adhesion to fibronectin. Briefly, cells were treated with PMA and then held in low attachment tissue culture dishes for varying time points. Cells were subsequently seeded onto fibronectin-coated standard tissue culture dishes, and adhesion was quantitated as described previously. As shown, PMA rapidly stimulated the binding of cells to fibronectin (Fig.5A). However, after this initial increase, cell adhesiveness appeared to diminish between 3 and 5 h and then rise again from 7 to 15 h. We anticipated that the expression of a hyposialylated integrin would be associated with the later, more prolonged phase of cell adhesion, rather than the early, rapid phase, given that trafficking of integrins through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi typically requires several hours in most cell types (15Heino J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21806-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17536-17542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ignotz R.A. Massague J. Cell. 1987; 51: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18Bellis S.L. Newman E. Friedman E.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of a hyposialylated integrin was temporally correlated with the delayed phase of cell adhesion, we performed a Western blot analysis of β1 integrins expressed at various time points following PMA treatment (Fig. 5B). At 4 h, there was no apparent alteration in glycosylation, as evidenced by a lack of change in β1 integrin electrophoretic mobility. At 7 h following PMA treatment, the more rapidly migrating β1isoform (the hyposialylated form) was observed, although clearly some wild type integrin was still present. Nearly all of the β1 integrin appeared to be hyposialylated at 12 following PMA treatment (Fig. 5B), and expression of the hyposialylated form was sustained at 15 h (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that the expression of a hyposialylated integrin begins between 4 and 7 h following PMA treatment and reaches a maximum by 12–15 h. Thus, the expression of the hyposialylated glycoform is temporally correlated with the delayed phase of PMA-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. To further address the hypothesis that the expression of a hyposialylated β1 integrin glycoform is associated with altered integrin function, we treated cells with brefeldin A, a reagent that disrupts the Golgi apparatus, and then performed cell adhesion assays. We anticipated that brefeldin A treatment would block the expression of the hyposialylated β1 integrin glycoform, and thus inhibit the delayed, but not the early, phase of cell adhesion to fibronectin. Accordingly, we examined PMA-dependent cell binding to fibronectin at two time points following brefeldin A treatments. First, we pretreated cells for 2 h with 20 μg/ml brefeldin A. PMA was then added to the brefeldin A-containing media, and cells were incubated with both PMA and brefeldin A for an additional hour. As shown in Fig.6, brefeldin A had no effect on cell adhesion to fibronectin following a 1-h treatment with PMA. These data suggest that PMA-induced cell adhesion at this time point does not require the synthesis of a new integrin species. In addition, these data indicate that the amount of β1 integrin turnover that occurs within the 3-h brefeldin A treatment does not substantially affect cell adhesion to fibronectin. We next assessed the effect of brefeldin A on cell adhesion at 8 h following PMA treatment. Brefeldin A was added at 5 h following the initiation of PMA treatment, a time point when binding is diminished, and then cell adhesion was examined 3 h later. As shown, brefeldin A significantly inhibited the enhanced cell adhesion that occurs at 8 h following PMA treatment. These data suggest that the expression of a new integrin species, presumably the hyposialylated β1 integrin isoform, was required for the delayed phase of PMA-induced cell adhesiveness. Previous studies have shown that the enzymatic removal of sialic acids from the cell surface can modulate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix ligands (19Pretzlaff R.K. Xue V.W. Rowin M.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because multiple cell surface receptors are likely to be affected by the desialylating enzyme, it is not currently clear to what extent desialylation modifies β1 integrin function directly. To address the hypothesis that unsialylated β1integrins exhibit better binding to fibronectin, we developed a novel method to desialylate purified β1 integrins and then monitor fibronectin binding using a modified ELISA assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Briefly, purified α5β1 integrins (that were confirmed to carry α2–6 sialic acid residues, see Fig.7C) were treated with or without sialidase and were then added to fibronectin-coated dishes and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound integrins were detected by ELISA assay, using the anti-β1 integrin antibody, MAB2000 (Chemicon International). As shown in Fig.7A, α5β1 integrins that had been desialylated demonstrated significantly enhanced attachment to fibronectin, relative to α5β1 integrins with α2–6-linked sialic acid sugars. These data imply that unsialylated β1 integrins are more adhesive to fibronectin, although desialylation of α5 subunits may also contribute to increased ligand binding. Importantly, the results garnered from binding assays with purified integrins suggest that sialic acid residues play a direct role in the ligand/receptor interaction. To verify that α2–6 sialic acid sugars were cleaved from β1 integrins by the sialidase enzyme, β1integrins were Western blotted to assay for changes in electrophoretic mobility. As shown in Fig. 7B, sialidase-treated β1 integrins had a more rapid electrophoretic mobility than untreated β1 integrins, consistent with the loss of sialic acid residues. In addition, a marked reduction was noted in the amount of β1 integrins precipitated by the SNA lectin (Fig. 7C), further confirming that sialidase treatment was highly efficient in removing α2–6 sialic acid sugars. In the present study we have investigated the mechanisms that underlie the PMA-induced adhesion of myeloid cells to fibronectin. In particular, we have shown that PMA treatment has a multiphasic effect on cell adhesiveness. PMA induces a rapid increase in adhesion, followed by a diminution at 3–5 h, and then a second phase of enhanced adhesion that begins by about 7 h, and is sustained for at least 15 h. Our results suggest that this second phase of enhanced cell adhesion is due to the PMA-dependent expression of a β1 integrin glycoform that is lacking in the negatively charged sugar, α2–6 sialic acid. The expression of this hyposialylated β1 integrin glycoform is highly correlated temporally with the delayed phase of cell adhesion. Expression of the hyposialylated form begins at some time between 4 and 7 h following PMA treatment, is expressed with increasingly greater abundance until ∼12 h, and is sustained for at least 15 h. Importantly, the delayed phase of PMA-dependent cell adhesion is inhibited when the Golgi disrupter, brefeldin A, is used to block the expression of the hyposialylated form. In contrast to the delayed phase, the rapid phase of PMA-dependent fibronectin binding does not appear to be dependent upon the expression of a variant integrin glycoform, because brefeldin A had no significant effect when adhesion is assayed at early time points following PMA treatment (Fig. 6). Moreover, the hyposialylated integrin glycoform is not expressed within the first 4 h following PMA treatment (Fig. 5B). It is likely that the rapid increase in cell adhesiveness is due to the PMA-dependent activation of pre-existing integrin receptors. It has been well-established, particularly in hematopoietic cells, that integrins are activated by “inside-out” signaling events (21Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 22Stewart M. Thiel M. Hogg N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Alternately, it has been suggested that PMA may stimulate cell adhesion by modulating events that lie downstream of the integrin-ligand interaction (23Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Clearly, further experiments will be required to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the early phase of PMA-dependent myeloid cell adhesion. Our results suggest that the PMA-dependent expression of a hyposialylated β1 integrin glycoform is due, at least in part, to the down-regulation of the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase. Expression of the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase is known to be developmentally regulated (25Dall'Olio F. Malagolini N., Di Stefano G. Ciambella M. Serafini-Cessi F. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Vertino-Bell A. Ren J. Black J.D. Lau J.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the levels of this enzyme vary in response to cell differentiation status (27Taniguchi A. Higai K. Hasegawa Y. Utsumi K. Matsumoto K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Dall'Olio F. Malagolini N. Guerrini S. Lau J.T. Serafini-Cessi F. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Dall'Olio F. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our study, two myeloid cell lines that normally undergo differentiation in response to PMA (U937 and THP-1 cells) were shown to have decreased levels of ST6Gal I following PMA treatment. Consistent with these results, PMA has been previously shown to down-regulate ST6Gal I in HL-60 myeloid cells (27Taniguchi A. Higai K. Hasegawa Y. Utsumi K. Matsumoto K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike U937 and THP-1 cells, myeloid cells that have been selected for PMA resistance (PRU cells) do not down-regulate ST6Gal I in response to PMA, do not express hyposialylated β1integrins, and, finally, do not bind to fibronectin following PMA treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that the β1 integrin is an important substrate for ST6Gal I and that integrin function may be regulated by the level of α2–6 sialylation. Several studies support a role for integrin carbohydrate groups in regulating the association between integrins and ligand. Akiyamaet al. (30Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with glycosylation inhibitors blocked cell adhesion to fibronectin. Similarly, Zheng et al. (20Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that ligand binding was altered when N-linked carbohydrates were enzymatically cleaved from cell surface α5β1 integrins. In our study, purified α5β1 integrins were treated with sialidase enzyme to recapitulate the hyposialylated integrins expressed by PMA-treated myeloid cells. Importantly, enzymatically desialylated α5β1 integrins demonstrated enhanced binding to fibronectin, consistent with the observation that myeloid cells expressing hyposialylated β1 integrins adhere better to fibronectin. The enhanced binding of desialylated, purified integrins supports the hypothesis that the presence of sialic acids can directly modulate the ligand/receptor interaction. Accumulating evidence suggests that, in hematopoietic cells, sialylation of cell surface receptors is inversely correlated with cell adhesion to extracellular matrix ligands (13Wadsworth S. Halvorson M.J. Chang A.C. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pretzlaff R.K. Xue V.W. Rowin M.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Le Marer N. Skacel P.O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although this has not been universally observed (14Symington B.E. Symington F.W. Rohrschneider L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13258-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one study, the enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues from the surface of HL60 cells stimulated cell adhesion to fibronectin (19Pretzlaff R.K. Xue V.W. Rowin M.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This enhanced binding was thought to be due to altered activity of the β1 integrin, because β1 integrins from sialidase-treated cells expressed elevated levels of a β1-specific activation epitope. The mechanism by which sialylation of β1 integrins alters integrin function is currently unclear. It has been suggested that sialic acid residues can mask important functional domains on membrane receptors (32Razi N. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternately, sialic acids, due to their negative charge, could affect protein conformation. Clearly, β1 integrin function can be modulated by pharmacologic or enzymatic reagents that alter the composition of integrin carbohydrates. However, there is also substantial evidence that, in vivo, β1 integrins undergo changes in carbohydrate composition in response to physiologic stimuli. Variant β1 integrin glycoforms have been observed in multiple cell types, and the expression of a variant glycoform is typically associated with a profound change in cell phenotype (11Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moss L. Prakobphol A. Wiedmann T.W. Fisher S.J. Damsky C.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, changes in β1 integrin sialylation have been observed in differentiating thymocytes (13Wadsworth S. Halvorson M.J. Chang A.C. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar). Modifications in β1 integrin glycosylation are also correlated with alterations in cell migratory or invasive capability. The highly invasive cytotrophoblasts harvested from early stage human placentas have hyposialylated β1 integrins, as compared with β1 integrins expressed by the less invasive cytotrophoblasts of later stage placentas (12Moss L. Prakobphol A. Wiedmann T.W. Fisher S.J. Damsky C.H. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, the β1 integrins of activated keratinocytes, which demonstrate enhanced migration on fibronectin, have a different glycosylation pattern than naive keratinocytes (34Kim L.T. Ishihara S. Lee C.C. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Grinnell F. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 743-753PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, variant β1 glycoforms have been observed in numerous transformed and metastatic cells (11Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 35von Lampe B. Stallmach A. Riecken E.O. Gut. 1993; 34: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 36Veiga S.S. Chammas R. Cella N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The finding that variant β1 integrins are expressed by multiple and diverse cell types, under conditions that promote long term changes in cell adhesiveness and motility, strongly suggests that variant β1 glycoforms are functionally important. Although our results implicate differentially α2–6-sialylated β1 integrin subunits in regulating fibronectin receptor function, the potential role of differentially glycosylated integrin α subunits has not yet been clarified. It was previously reported that the α5 integrin subunits expressed by G361 melanoma cells are modified by α2–8-linked oligosialic acids (41Nadanaka S. Sato C. Kitajima K. Katagiri K. Irie S. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33657-33664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The enzymatic removal of these polysialic acid moieties inhibited G361 cell adhesion to fibronectin, implicating α5carbohydrates in ligand binding (41Nadanaka S. Sato C. Kitajima K. Katagiri K. Irie S. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33657-33664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation of α5 may also indirectly modulate fibronectin binding by mediating the association of α5 with other membrane components. Wang et al. (42Wang X. Sun P., Al- Qamari A. Tai T. Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8436-8444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that epithelial cell adhesion to fibronectin was inhibited by the binding of GT1b gangliosides to the carbohydrate domain of integrin α5. Finally, N-linked carbohydrates may regulate the localization of α5 subunits to a glycolipid-rich plasma membrane microdomain (43Kazui A. Ono M. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that glycosylation of α5 integrin subunits may be important for fibronectin binding; however, it remains to be determined whether α5 integrins undergo differential glycosylation in response to signal transduction cascades, as we have observed for β1 integrins. In light of evidence implicating glycosylation, and particularly sialylation, as a modulator of cell adhesion, we propose that inducible changes in carbohydrate composition represent an important and novel mechanism for regulation of the β1 integrin receptor. Our studies suggest that activation of a PMA-stimulated signaling cascade causes the down-regulation of the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, which, in turn, leads to the expression of hyposialylated β1integrins that bind fibronectin more actively. The expression of hyposialylated β1 integrin glycoforms likely plays a key role in mediating the prolonged fibronectin-binding capability of differentiated myeloid cells."

We have shown previously that nitric oxide (NO) regulates the activity of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of NF-κB by NO sensitizes A549 and Jurkat T cells to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. The molecular basis of NF-κB inhibition is different in the two cell types. In A549 cells, NO functions at the nuclear level to inhibit NF-κB byS-nitrosylation. In Jurkat cells, NO inhibits the NF-κB activating pathway in the cytoplasm at a step proximal to the degradation of IκBα. The inhibition of NF-κB is reflected in the level of intracellular S-nitrosothiols, which are constitutively metabolized. These data suggest that NO can influence cell death by modulating NF-κB activity with the sites of inhibition being cell type-specific.

These data suggest that NO/redox exerts control over NF-κB at multiple loci within the signal transduction pathways that transmit inflammatory signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. p21ras, JNK kinase, and the p50 monomer (of p50-p65) have been identified as sites ofS-nitrosylation that mediate the stimulation or inhibition of NF-κB by NO (15Matthews J.R.

A. 2000; 97: 14382-14387Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Additional molecular mechanisms by which NO can inhibit NF-κB (e.g. the effect on IκB kinase(s)) also exist (19Peng H.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on NF-κB thus depends upon the activating stimulus or signal, cell type, and local redox milieu (11Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). NO is a known regulator of both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways. For instance, NO functions as an anti-apoptotic mediator by inhibiting casapase-3 activation via nitrosylation of the procaspase-3 precursor (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L.M. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). With an appropriate cellular stimulus (i.e. Fas ligation), denitrosylation of procaspase-3 occurs, thereby activating caspase-3 and initiating cellular apoptosis. Alternatively, NO may stimulate apoptosis by increasing cellular p53 levels (via an effect on proteasomal degradation) (21Glockzin S. von Knethen A. Scheffner M. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19581-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), by activating cytochrome c (22Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), or perhaps by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (23Brookes P.S. Salinas E.P. Darley-Usmar K. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Anderson P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20474-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Previously, we have described an apoptotic model of nitrosative stress, which is produced by cytokine up-regulation of NOS2 (24Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and we have also reported that NO inhibits NF-κB in cells byS-nitrosylation (17Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine whether NO inhibition of NF-κB byS-nitrosylation contributes to apoptosis. Using two different human cell lines (A549 respiratory epithelial and Jurkat T cells), we demonstrate that nitrosative stress sensitizes cells to TNFα-mediated apoptosis and provide evidence for the role of NF-κB inhibition in this process. We also show that the mechanism of NO inhibition of NF-κB is, in fact, different in the two cell lines. In A549 cells, NO functions at the nuclear level by inhibiting NF-κB DNA binding through a reversible, redox-based modification of the p50-p65 heterodimer (consistent with S-nitrosylation). In Jurkat T cells, NO functions in the cytoplasm by inhibiting IκBα degradation, thus preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. A549 (CCL-185) and Jurkat T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were grown in F12K media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Jurkat T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cultures were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The pNFκB-Luc and pRL-CMV (RL, Renilla luciferase) plasmids were purchased from Stratagene and Promega, respectively. Apoptotic cells were determined using a modified annexin V protocol (Molecular Probes). Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells) or A549 cells (50–75% confluent) were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates. After the indicated treatments, cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1× binding buffer. 5 μl each of annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin were added, and the cells were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min in the dark. The cells were analyzed for annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin fluorescence by FACS (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) analysis using standard filters. A549 cells were grown to ∼75% confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed with serum-free media and transfected with 1 μg of pNFκB-Luc and 0.5 μg of pRL-CMV using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h in complete media prior to the indicated treatments. Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells) were transfected with 5 μg of pNFκB-Luc and 0.5 μg of pRL-CMV using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were grown for 48 h in complete media prior to the indicated treatments. Luciferase activity in both cell lysates was determined using a standard kit (Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system, Promega). The activity of the NF-κB reporter luciferase was standardized to that ofRenilla luciferase. Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was done according to Osborn et al.(25Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Extracts were prepared with or without the addition of 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) (1 mm) to extraction buffers. Specifically, cells were grown to near confluence in 10-cm culture plates. After the indicated treatments, cells were washed once in cold PBS and harvested by gentle scraping. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and rapidly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, the frozen pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cell suspension was placed on ice for 10 min to allow for lysis. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected. The nuclear pellet was reconstituted in 15 μl of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and placed on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected (nuclear extract). Nuclear extracts were diluted with 40 μl of Buffer D (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the BCA method (Pierce), and extracts were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Eight μg of nuclear protein was used per reaction. Reaction buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol with 1 μg of pdI·pdC, 1 μg of pd(N)6, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Promega) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 kinase. 1 μl of radiolabeled NF-κB probe (activity 30,000–80,000 cpm/μl) was added to the reaction mixture, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl of a 15% Ficoll solution with indicator dyes. Samples were loaded onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate EDTA (TBE) buffer and run at 200 V for 2 h. Gels were transferred to Whatman No. 2MM filter paper, vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 2 h, and exposed to Kodak XOMAT film for 2–4 h at −80 °C. A549 cells were seeded onto two-well chamber slides and grown to ∼50% confluence in complete media. After the indicated treatments, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol (−20 °C) for 5 min. Jurkat cells were affixed to slides using a cytospin (600 ×g for 6 min) after the indicated treatment(s). The cells were then fixed in 75% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Prior to immunostaining, both A549 and Jurkat cell slides were rinsed with PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum for 2 h at 25 °C. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the NF-κB p65 subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 25 °C. Immunoreactivity with the primary antibody was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were mounted in antifade solution and visualized with a confocal microscope (Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning). Equal amounts (40–60 μg) of cytoplasmic proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel. After transferring to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:500 dilution. Immunoreactivity was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad). Treatment with 1 mmS-nitrosocysteine (CSNO) or 1 mm DETA-NONOate (NONOate) significantly decreased TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activity in A549 cells (Fig. 1A). NO also attenuated NF-κB activation in TNFα-stimulated Jurkat cells, albeit at a slightly lower NO concentration (0.5 mm CSNO or NONOate) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the inhibition of NF-κB by NO is likely to be a generalized phenomenon. Lower concentrations of NO had no effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, nor did NO alone alter basal NF-κB activity in either cell type (data not shown). The fact that Jurkat cells are more sensitive to NO then A549 cells raises the possibility that different mechanisms of NF-κB inhibition operate in the two cell lines. We sought to determine whether apoptosis is influenced by NO in A549 and Jurkat cells. Using an annexin V assay, we showed that the amount of apoptosis (percentage of annexin V+ cells) did not change in either cell line after TNFα or NO (CSNO or NONOate) treatment alone (Fig.2). However, the combination of TNFα and NO (at concentrations required to inhibit NF-κB) significantly increased apoptosis in both cell types (Fig. 2). In both cell lines, co-treatment with CSNO induced apoptosis to a greater degree then NONOate. In keeping with the lack of effect on NF-κB activity, lower concentrations of NO (10 or 100 μm) did not alter apoptosis in TNFα-stimulated cells. Transcriptional inhibitors are known to sensitize cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis in part by preventing NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes (26Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence that the mechanism for NO-induced apoptosis in TNFα-stimulated cells is NF-κB inhibition, we compared the effects of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D with NO in TNFα-stimulated A549 and Jurkat cells. Treatment with TNFα and actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml) significantly increased apoptotic death in both cell lines (as compared with TNFα or actinomycin D alone) with the amount of apoptosis similar to that seen with TNFα and NO (Fig.3). Proteasome inhibitors prevent the degradation of IκBα and thereby provide a more specific means of blocking NF-κB transcription (27Grisham M.B. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Conner E.M. Brand S. Wong H.L. Pien C. Mazzola L.M. Destree A. Parent L. Adams J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar to NO, treatment of TNFα-stimulated Jurkat cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin both inhibited NF-κB activation (by ∼85%) and significantly increased apoptosis (Fig. 3). That neither lactacystin nor another proteasome inhibitor, MG-130, inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription or induced apoptosis in TNFα-stimulated A549 cells (data not shown) provides added assurance that the apoptosis-inducing effects of these compounds reflect NF-κB inhibition. An increase in endogenous NOS2 activity and NO production, which is dependent on NF-κB, has been shown to promote apoptosis in macrophages (24Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The increase in apoptotic death correlated with a marked rise in intracellular SNOs. However, the response to NOS2 activity was quite different in A549 cells. After 16 h of cytokine stimulation, A549 cells demonstrated a marked increase in NOS2 expression and activity (as measured by NOx production) (data not shown) but no increase in apoptosis (control 3.8 ± 0.1 versus cytokine-stimulated 4.1 ± 1.0%) and only a modest rise in intracellular SNOs (Fig.4). This level of nitrosative stress is not adequate to induce apoptosis directly (24Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and thus corroborate the lack of effect of NOS inhibitors on NF-κB-dependent transcription in cytokine-stimulated A549 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of A549 cells with exogenous NO (1 mm CSNO or NONOate) increased intracellular SNOs ∼10-fold (Fig. 4), analogous to levels required for apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages (24Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Lower concentrations of exogenous NO did not increase intracellular SNO above baseline, nor did co-treatment with TNFα alter SNO levels (data not shown). These data indicate that the requirement for high amounts of exogenous NO to promote apoptosis is well rationalized by the inability of lower concentrations (even 0.1 mm) to produce a nitrosative stress. Activation of downstream caspases has been implicated in both NO- and TNFα-mediated apoptosis (6De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 28Callsen D. Brune B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that Fas-induced activation of caspase-3 is coupled to denitrosylation of procaspase-3 in lymphocytes (20Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L.M. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, Jurkat T cells showed a modest increase in caspase-3 activity after TNFα stimulation (analogous to Fas ligation) (Fig.5A). However, the TNFα-induced increase in caspase-3 activity was not affected by concurrent CSNO treatment. Further, caspase-3 activity was not detectable in A549 cells following treatment with TNFα, CSNO, TNFα and CSNO, or Fas ligation (data not shown). These data imply that the mechanism by which NO induces apoptosis in TNFα-stimulated cells appears to be largely independent of caspase-3. NO can sensitize cells to apoptosis by both cyclic GMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms (29Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the induction of apoptosis by TNFα and NO in Jurkat T and A549 cells is cyclic GMP-mediated, the cells were co-treated with TNFα and the cyclic GMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm). No increase in apoptosis was seen in either cell line under these conditions (Fig. 5B). Moreover, there was no attenuation in TNFα- and CSNO-induced apoptosis in the presence of the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10 μm) (Fig.5B). These results argue against a role for cGMP in the induction of apoptosis by NO in TNFα-stimulated cells. We and others have shown that NO can inhibit NF-κB by nitrosylation of a critical cysteine on the p50 subunit of the p50-p65 heterodimer (15Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 17Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30delaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Punzalan C. Kuo P.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4101-4108PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrosylation of NF-κB (p50-p65) functions at the nuclear level and is reversible by reduction of the nitrosylated cysteine. This inhibitory mechanism appears to predominate in A549 cells as the NO-induced decrease in NF-κB DNA binding (in TNFα-stimulated cells) is reversed by treatment of nuclear protein extracts with the reducing agent DTT (Fig.6A). Furthermore, nuclear translocation of NF-κB is not inhibited (as demonstrated by p65 immunofluorescent staining) nor is IκBα degradation affected after NO treatment of TNFα-stimulated A549 cells, indicating that inhibition is occurring at the nuclear level (Fig. 6, B andC). NO treatment of TNFα-stimulated Jurkat cells also attenuates NF-κB DNA binding, but the effect is not reversed by DTT treatment (Fig.6A). In addition, NO treatment prevents both the TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the degradation of IκBα (Fig. 6, B and C). These observations strongly suggest that the target for NO inhibition of NF-κB in Jurkat cells resides in the cytoplasm, proximal to the proteasomal degradation of IκBα. Nitrosative stress has been causally linked to apoptosis, but the molecular details are not well understood. The results of this study indicate that the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor, NF-κB, is one mechanism by which NO can initiate apoptosis. NO does not, however, induce apoptosis alone. Rather, it works in concert with TNFα to relieve the inhibitory effects of NF-κB. The inhibition of NF-κB has been shown previously to promote TNFα-induced cell death (2Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 3Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 4Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar), but the inhibition was achieved through nonphysiological interventions. This study is the first to link a physiological regulator of NF-κB activity (that is, NO bioactivity) with the NF-κB-dependent control of apoptosis. The mechanism of NO inhibition of NF-κB is different in the two cell lines studied. In A549 cells, NO has no effect on IκBα degradation or NF-κB nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of NF-κB is restored by treatment of nuclear proteins with the reducing agent DTT. This mechanism of inhibition was identified previously withS-nitrosylation (15Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 17Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30delaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Punzalan C. Kuo P.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4101-4108PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, NO does not directly interfere with NF-κB DNA binding in Jurkat cells. Instead, NO inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB by blocking TNFα-induced release of IκBα; thus, inhibition probably occurs at a step proximal to the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of IκBα. These results emphasize that multiple components of the pathway transmitting TNF signals from the membrane (TNF receptor) to the nucleus (NF-κB binding) are potentially susceptible to NO regulation. The existence of multiple redox-sensitive steps in the NF-κB activating pathway has been described previously. In the nucleus, NF-κB DNA binding can only occur if a target cysteine (cysteine 62) on the p50 monomer is reduced (31Matthews J.R. Kaszubska W. Turcatti G. Wells T.N. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Glutathiolation or nitrosylation of this residue has been demonstrated to inhibit NF-κB DNA bindingin vivo (17Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 32Klatt P. Pineda Molina E. Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an oxidative environment in the cytoplasm can activate NF-κB through effects on the IκB kinase complex (IKK) (33Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray P.B., Jr. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 34Oka S. Kamata H. Kamata K. Yagisawa H. Hirata H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Oxidative activation of NF-κB is, however, cell- and stimulus-specific (14Anderson M.T. Staal F.J. Gitler C. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11527-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 35Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). If oxidation of a target cysteine in the IKK complex is required for activation in Jurkat cells, nitrosylation of this same cysteine might prevent activation. Indeed, there is recent precedent for an oxidative modification in the transcriptional activator OxyR eliciting a response different from nitrosylation (36Kim S.O. Merchant K. Nudelman R. Beyer W.F. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Hausladen A. Stamler J.S. Cell. 2002; 109: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Alternatively, different components of the IKK complex may be targeted for posttranslational modification by oxidation and nitrosylation, respectively. Induction of NOS2 is NF-κB-dependent (37Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). One might therefore envision a feedback loop whereby NO down-regulates its own synthesis. However, NOS inhibition had no effect on κB-dependent transcription in the NOS2-stimulated cells (data not shown), and although exogenous NO donors initiated apoptosis in TNFα-stimulated A549 cells, the cytokine-induced increase in NOS2 activity did not. An explanation for these data can be found in the levels of intracellular SNOs (a surrogate marker of nitrosative stress) under the various conditions. In the NOS2-stimulated cells, SNOs were only 3-fold higher than in controls. In previous studies, we determined that at least 10-fold increases in SNO were necessary to initiate apoptosis (24Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a level achieved in A549 cells by treatment with 1 mm NO donor (CSNO or NONOate). The more modest rise in intracellular SNOs with NOS2 stimulation occurred despite a 20-fold increase in cellular NO production. In addition, 0.1 mm NO donor did not increase intracellular SNOs. These results indicate that intracellular SNOs are actively metabolized and are furthermore compatible with the emerging evidence that SNO levels are precisely controlled with a balance between production and breakdown (or cellular export). Cell-specific differences in the activity of nitrosative defense enzymes might explain the varying susceptibility of cells to NO-induced apoptosis. In particular, GSNO reductase, a recently described SNO-metabolizing enzyme, is very active in A549 cells (38Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrate that NO sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. The mechanism for this sensitization is consistent with the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB. In addition, we show that at least two targets for NO inhibition of the NF-κB activating pathway exist, one in the cytoplasm (possibly the IKK complex) and the other in the nucleus (p50-p65). Finally, our data expand on the link between the TNF receptor family and NO signaling in the context of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2024445068,"PAAD domains are found in diverse proteins of unknown function and are structurally related to a superfamily of protein interaction modules that includes death domains, death effector domains, and Caspase activation and recruitment domains. Using bioinformatics strategies, cDNAs were identified that encode a novel protein of 110 kDa containing a PAAD domain followed by a putative nucleotide-binding (NACHT) domain and several leucine-rich repeat domains. This protein thus resembles Cryopyrin, a protein implicated in hereditary hyperinflammation syndromes, and was termed PAN2 for PAAD andNACHT-containing protein 2. When expressed in HEK293 cells, PAN2 suppressed NF-κB induction by the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), suggesting that this protein operates at a point of convergence in these two cytokine signaling pathways. This PAN2-mediated suppression of NF-κB was evident both in reporter gene assays that measured NF-κB transcriptional activity and electromobility shift assays that measured NF-κB DNA binding activity. PAN2 also suppressed NF-κB induction resulting from overexpression of several adapter proteins and protein kinases involved in the TNF or IL-1 receptor signal transduction, including TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP, IRAK2, and NF-κB-inducing kinase as well as the IκB kinases IKKα and IKKβ. PAN2 also inhibited the cytokine-mediated activation of IKKα and IKKβ as measured byin vitro kinase assays. Furthermore, PAN2 association with IKKα was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a direct effect on the IKK complex. These observations suggest a role for PAN2 in modulating NF-κB activity in cells, thus providing the insights into the potential functions of PAAD family proteins and their roles in controlling inflammatory responses. PAAD domains are found in diverse proteins of unknown function and are structurally related to a superfamily of protein interaction modules that includes death domains, death effector domains, and Caspase activation and recruitment domains. Using bioinformatics strategies, cDNAs were identified that encode a novel protein of 110 kDa containing a PAAD domain followed by a putative nucleotide-binding (NACHT) domain and several leucine-rich repeat domains. This protein thus resembles Cryopyrin, a protein implicated in hereditary hyperinflammation syndromes, and was termed PAN2 for PAAD andNACHT-containing protein 2. When expressed in HEK293 cells, PAN2 suppressed NF-κB induction by the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), suggesting that this protein operates at a point of convergence in these two cytokine signaling pathways. This PAN2-mediated suppression of NF-κB was evident both in reporter gene assays that measured NF-κB transcriptional activity and electromobility shift assays that measured NF-κB DNA binding activity. PAN2 also suppressed NF-κB induction resulting from overexpression of several adapter proteins and protein kinases involved in the TNF or IL-1 receptor signal transduction, including TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP, IRAK2, and NF-κB-inducing kinase as well as the IκB kinases IKKα and IKKβ. PAN2 also inhibited the cytokine-mediated activation of IKKα and IKKβ as measured byin vitro kinase assays. Furthermore, PAN2 association with IKKα was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a direct effect on the IKK complex. These observations suggest a role for PAN2 in modulating NF-κB activity in cells, thus providing the insights into the potential functions of PAAD family proteins and their roles in controlling inflammatory responses.

Pio F. Chu Z.-L. Reed J.C. Godzik A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 85-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This protein fold, which is also known as PYRIN or DAPIN (2Staub E. Dahl E. Rosenthal A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 83-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Bertin J. DiStefano P.S.

Biol. 2001; 11: R118-R120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), is predicted to form an α-helical bundle resembling death domains, death effector domains, and Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). The PAAD domain thus constitutes the fourth branch of this superfamily of structurally similar protein modules, which participate in homotypic protein-protein interactions involved in signal transduction by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokine receptors and pathways connected to activation of Caspase family cell death proteases and to kinases important for induction of NF-κB family transcription factors (for reviewed, see Ref. 5Aravind L. Dixit V.M. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 47-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The founding member of this family of proteins is Pyrin, which contains a PAAD domain at its N terminus followed by a B-box zinc finger and SPRY domain, a motif found in ryanodine receptors that is involved in Ca2+ release (6Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Pyrin was identified by genetic analysis of families affected with familial Mediterranean fever, a hereditary hyperinflammatory response syndrome (7Consortium T.I.F. Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). The mutations identified in familial Mediterranean fever patients fall within the region C-terminal to the PAAD domain. Recently hereditary mutations have been identified in the CIAS gene, which encodes the PAAD-containing protein Cryopyrin (8Hoffman H.M. Mueller J.L. Broide D.H. Wanderer A.A. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). These mutations are predicted to produce mutant Cryopyrin proteins in patients affected with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome with mutations residing downstream of the N-terminal PAAD domain. Thus, PAAD-containing proteins appear to regulate pathways relevant to inflammation, although the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Providing further evidence of a potential link to inflammatory cell function, PAADs are also found in a group of interferon-inducible genes that includes myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen, absent in melanoma 2, and interferon-γ-inducible protein 16. PAAD-containing proteins have also been implicated in apoptosis regulation. The PAAD domain, for example, is present in (a) ASC, a proapoptotic adapter protein that contains both a PAAD and a CARD and that interacts with Pyrin (9Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and (b) NAC (CARD7/DEFCAP/NALP), an apoptosis-promoting protein that contains PAAD and CARD modules (together with additional domains) and that reportedly enhances activation of Caspase-9 either directly or indirectly through interactions with the Caspase-9 activator Apaf1 (4Martinon F. Hofmann K. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R118-R120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,10Chu Z.-L. Pio F. Xie Z. Welsh K. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Godzik A.

Ward P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A zebrafish Caspase also contains a PAAD within its N-terminal prodomain (12Inohara N. Nunez G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 509-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting possible links of PAADs to apoptosis. However, no evidence of direct involvement of PAAD domains in apoptosis has been obtained to date. In total, at least 34 genes encoding PAAD-containing proteins are predicted to reside in the human genome (1Pawlowski K. Pio F. Chu Z.-L. Reed J.C. Godzik A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 85-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 2A. Godzik and J. C. Reed, unpublished data. Fourteen of these PAAD family proteins, including Cryopyrin, have a conserved architecture that includes an N-terminal PAAD followed by a nucleotide-binding fold known as the NACHT domain (13Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Trends Biol. Sci. 2000; 25: 223-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and then variable numbers of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains as well as other domains in some members. We have termed these proteins PANs for PAADand NACHT domain proteins. The topological organization of domains in the PANs is reminiscent of proteins previously implicated in NF-κB induction or Caspase activation such as Nod1 (CARD4), Nod2 (inflammatory bowel disease protein 1), and CLAN (Ipaf1, CARD12), which contain a CARD followed by NACHT and LRR domains (14Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S.

Genomics. 2001; 75: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In those proteins, the N-terminal CARD is essential for the effector functions of these proteins as inducers of NF-κB or activators of Caspases. In this report, we explored the effects of one of the members of this family, PAN2, finding evidence that this protein modulates NF-κB induction via its PAAD domain. Using the sequence of the 100-residue N-terminal region of the Pyrin protein, a cascade of PSI-BLAST searches was performed using new hits as queries for subsequent searches until no new hits were found. This procedure, called Saturated BLAST (17Li W.Z. Pio F. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), revealed several genomic loci and EST clones potentially capable of encoding PAAD domains in the publicly available nucleotide databases (HTGS, Genome Survey Sequences, EST, and draft human genome). For genomic data, the amino acid sequences of the predicted PAAD-containing proteins were tentatively deduced using the GENSCAN program for intron-exon prediction (18Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). Several examples were found of proteins that are predicted to contain a PAAD domain together with a NACHT domain, thus constituting members of the PAN family. In this report, we describe PAN2, which is encoded within the genomic locusAC022066 on chromosome 19 with partial or complete open reading frames for this protein encompassed in representative EST clones BE018433,AA421452, and AI204456. Plasmids were generated using PCR procedures with primers designed to incorporate appropriate restriction enzyme sites. Polymerase chain reaction products were then digested and cloned into pcDNA3Myc vector. All plasmids were sequence-verified. Panels of first-strand cDNAs (CLONTECH Panel I and II) generated from the mRNA of various human tissues were used as templates to amplify a region of PAN2 corresponding to the nucleotide-binding domain (amino acids (aa) 147–465) using the forward and reverse oligonucleotides 5′-CCACGTACAGTGATTATTCAAGGACC-3′ and 5′-CAAATAGAACAAGGCGGCACAGA-3′, respectively. Alternatively, total RNA from HeLa cells was subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCRs to amplify a partial clone of PAN2 (aa 1–620) using the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-ATGGCAGCCTCTTTCTTCTCTGATTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CGACGTAGAGCTGTGTTCATCCTCTTTCTTAA-3′. The resulting PCR product was excised from agarose gels and cloned into pcDNA3Myc, and its identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A polyclonal anti-PAN2 antiserum was generated by repeated immunization of rabbits with an 18-mer synthetic peptide spanning aa 139–157 of PAN2 protein (FAPKETGKQPRTVIIQGPQ) conjugated to maleimide-activated carrier proteins keyhole limpet hemocyanin and ovalbumin (Pierce). Total protein lysates from various untransfected cell lines, from 293 cells transiently transfected with Myc-PAN2 (as a positive control), and from stably transfected 293-Neo and 293-PAN2 cell lines were prepared, normalized for total protein content (100 μg), and size-fractionated in an 8% polyacrylamide gel under standard SDS-PAGE conditions. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated with a 1:1000 (v/v) dilution of anti-PAN2 antiserum or anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Detection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence. Typically 1 × 104 HEK293 cells were plated in 96-well plates and transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For NF-κB reporter assays, cells were transfected with 50 ng of pNF-κB-luc and 10 ng of pTK-RL reporter vectors (Stratagene) and various amounts of the relevant expression plasmids as described in the figure legends, maintaining the total amount of DNA constant using pcDNA3Myc empty vector. The β-catenin reporter assays were performed in the same way using 100 ng of β-catenin reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pTK-RL, and 500 ng of β-catenin expression vector (19Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). At 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with TNFα or IL-1β (both 20 ng/ml) for 6 h where indicated. Activities from firefly and Renillaluciferases were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For stable transfections, 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-cm plates and transfected with 2.5 μg of pMyc-PAN2 or pMyc empty vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). After 2 days, transfected cells were split 1:3 into 10-cm dishes and grown in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 until individual colonies appeared. Several well separated clones were recovered and analyzed by immunoblotting to assess relative levels of PAN2. One clone expressing PAN2 was identified (293-PAN2) and used to perform electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). A clone transfected with pcDNA3Myc plasmid (293-Neo) was also randomly picked for use as a control. 293T cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of various combinations of plasmids as described above and then harvested 36 h after transfection. Alternatively stably transfected 293-Neo and 293-PAN2 cells were used. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation, clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies immobilized on agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C followed by three washes in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc or anti-IκB kinase α (IKKα) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Stably transfected 293-Neo and 293-PAN2 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates, cultured overnight in 1% fetal bovine serum, and then left untreated or treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 30 min or with 100 ng/ml IL-1β for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells, and EMSAs were carried out as described previously (20Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-κB binding site (Promega) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). After purification with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences), the labeled probe (15 fmol) was incubated with 2 μg of nuclear extracts for 25 min at room temperature. The nuclear extracts from TNF-treated cells were also incubated with specific antibodies recognizing the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before the binding reaction or with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA probe as specific competitor. All complexes were separated by electrophoresis in non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C. After drying, gels were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. 293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of FLAG-IKKα expression vector and either pMyc empty vector, increasing amounts of pMyc-PAN2, or 0.5 μg of the indicated Myc-tagged PAN2 deletion mutants. At 36 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 15 min. Cells were resuspended in kinase assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Brij 97 (polyoxyethylene alcohol), 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and then washed once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase assays were performed in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–54) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 3 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed to x-ray film. The same membranes were subsequently probed with anti-FLAG antibody to determine the amounts of FLAG-IKKα present. Cell lysates were normalized for total protein content (30 μg) and analyzed by immunoblotting to confirm expression of Myc-PAN2 and Myc-tagged PAN2 mutants. Using bioinformatics strategies, we identified several genes potentially capable of encoding predicted proteins having PAAD and NACHT domains, thus constituting members of the PAN family, which includes NAC, Cryopyrin, PAN2, and 11 other related proteins, all sharing significant sequence homology. An HTGS clone (accession numberAC022066) allowed us to obtain genomic sequence data forPAN2, and the analysis of this HTGS clone with the GENSCAN program provided an intron-exon prediction encompassing the N-terminal segment of PAN2. To independently verify expression ofPAN2, a set of primers was designed based on the predicted partial cDNA sequence and used to perform reverse transcriptase-PCR using HeLa cell RNA. The PCR product was cloned into a plasmid (pcDNA3Myc) and sequenced, verifying that it contained nucleotides 1–1860 of the PAN2 cDNA. To further define the expressed product of the PAN2 gene, a BLAST search of the human EST database was performed using this partial cDNA as a query. Several EST clones were identified that overlapped all or part of the PAN2 partial cDNA sequence. One of these clones contained an insert of 3.4 kbp and was obtained for complete sequencing, revealing an open reading frame of 2985 nucleotides encoding the 994-aa PAN2 protein (Fig.1 A). The authenticity of this open reading frame was confirmed by in vitro translation (not shown). The initiating AUG codon of this open reading frame was preceded by a 5′-untranslated region of 57 bp, whereas the stop codon (2985 bp) was followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 348 bp and a poly(A) tail (submitted to GenBankTM, accession numberAY072792). This cDNA is substantially similar to a recently deposited sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF442488). The predicted PAN2 protein contains a PAAD domain at its N terminus (aa 1–94), a central NACHT domain (aa 147–465), and eight tandem C-terminal LRR domains (aa 605–995) (Fig.1 B). Using the cDNA sequence of the 3.4-kbp PAN2 clone, we deduced the exon-intron organization of the gene (Fig. 1 C). The PAN2 gene spans 30 kbp on chromosome 19 and contains at least 10 exons, including 9 coding and at least 1 non-coding exon (the possibility of additional 5′-untranslated region exons cannot be excluded). Interestingly, none of the standard gene prediction programs was able to predict the complete PAN2 cDNA sequence from genomic data. Most often the PAAD-containing exon is predicted to be part of an intron or a promoter region in an upstream gene coding for an uncharacterized protein from the Mucin family. Since the Mucin family contains multiple copies of a 50-aa repeat, it is possible that the genomic sequence in this region was not assembled correctly. To analyze the expression of PAN2, first-strand cDNAs generated from equivalent amounts of RNA from a variety of normal human tissues were used as templates to amplify a region of thePAN2 cDNA corresponding to the NACHT domain (aa 147–465). This analysis revealed that PAN2 is expressed at highest levels in spleen but also in placenta, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, and thymus (Fig.2 A). We also generated a polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to aa 139–157 of PAN2. This antiserum recognized PAN2 as a single band of ∼110 kDa (which is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 113.4 kDa). The slower migration of plasmid-derived PAN2 compared with the endogenous protein is due to the Myc epitope tag appended to the latter (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblot analysis of a panel of human cell lines of various tissue origins revealed widespread expression of the PAN2 protein (Fig. 2 C). We sought evidence that PAN2 might modulate activation of Caspases involved in either apoptosis or inflammation but failed to observe consistent effects in transient transfection assays (not shown). Because some members of the PAAD family proteins are involved in hyperinflammatory diseases (21Kastner D.L. O'Shea J.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 241-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we asked whether PAN2 could regulate NF-κB induction given that activation of this family of heterodimeric transcription factors is commonly involved in immune and inflammatory cell biology (for review, see Ref. 22Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with a PAN2-encoding plasmid together with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene plasmid. Cells were stimulated with IL-1β or TNFα, or they were co-transfected with plasmids encoding various signal transducing proteins within the TNFα receptor (TRAF2 and RIP) or the IL-1β receptor/Toll family receptor (MyD88, IRAK2, and TRAF6) pathway (for review, see Ref. 23Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, PAN2 potently inhibited NF-κB induction by TNFα (Fig. 3 A) and to a lesser extent by IL-1β (Fig. 3 B). PAN2 overexpression also markedly reduced NF-κB activity induced by intracellular adapter proteins (TRAF2, TRAF6, and MyD88) and kinases (RIP and IRAK2) that functionally connect TNF and IL-1R receptors to NF-κB responses (Fig. 3, A and B). These effects of PAN2 were specific in that the activity of other transcription factors such as β-catenin and p53 were not suppressed (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Moreover, immunoblotting confirmed that PAN2 did not interfere with the production of the TRAF2, TRAF6, MyD88, RIP, or IRAK proteins in transfected cells (not shown), excluding reduced expression as a trivial explanation for the observations. NF-κB induction results from activation of the IKK complex, which phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB and targets it for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby releasing NF-κB (for review, see Ref. 24Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). The IKK complex contains two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ. These kinases are known to become activated by Nik, a TRAF-binding protein kinase implicated in NF-κB induction by both TNF and IL-1/Toll family receptors (20Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether PAN2 overexpression alters the ability of Nik, IKKα, and IKKβ to induce NF-κB activity in cells. Using transient transfection and reporter gene assays, similar to the experiment described above, we showed that PAN2 caused dose-dependent suppression of NF-κB induction by these kinases (Fig. 3 C). These observations imply that PAN2 interferes with a distal event at a point of convergence of cytokine signal transduction pathways involved in NF-κB induction. To determine whether the observed reduction in NF-κB activity correlated with reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity in PAN2-overexpressing cells, an EMSA was performed using a32P-labeled double strand DNA oligonucleotide encompassing NF-κB binding sites. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells that had been stably transfected with either control or PAN2-encoding plasmids and then stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β. Incubation of the nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled NF-κB probe then permitted measurements of the relative levels of the NF-κB DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig.4 A, TNFα stimulated increases in NF-κB DNA binding activity in control transfected cells. In contrast, NF-κB DNA binding activity was markedly reduced in cells stably overexpressing PAN2. Incubating the protein-DNA complexes with antibodies recognizing various members of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors provided evidence that p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB are included in the DNA-protein complexes, producing a supershift effect in EMSAs. Similar results were obtained by stimulating the stably transfected cells with IL-1β (Fig.4 C). Although IL-1β is less potent than TNFα at inducing NFκB in these cells, the extent of inhibition by PAN2 was comparable for these two cytokines. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates revealed that 293-Neo and 293-PAN2 cell lines express equivalent levels of NF-κB p50/p65 proteins, excluding the possibility that a reduced level of these proteins accounts for the results (Fig. 4,B–D). We conclude from these experiments that PAN2 inhibits the induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity by TNFα and IL-1β. To explore the region within PAN2 responsible for inhibition of NF-κB activation, we constructed plasmids encoding Myc-tagged deletion mutants of PAN2 containing the PAAD domain alone (aa 1–94), a mutant lacking the PAAD domain (ΔPAAD, aa 147–994), a mutant lacking the leucine-rich repeats (ΔLRR, aa 1–620), and a mutant containing only the LRRs (aa 605–994) (Fig. 5 A). These plasmids were then transiently expressed in HEK293 cells in equal amounts using a plasmid dose at which PAN2 suppresses TNFα induction of NF-κB by ∼50% so that either loss or gain of function could be detected. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation was inhibited to similar extents by full-length PAN2, the PAAD domain only, and PAN2 lacking the LRRs. In contrast, the PAN2 mutant lacking the PAAD domain displayed reduced activity, and a mutant encompassing only the LRR was completely inactive at suppressing TNFα-mediated induction of NF-κB activity. The failure of the LRR region to inhibit TNFα-mediated NF-κB induction was not due to a failure to produce comparable amounts of this protein compared with the other PAN2 mutants as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (Fig.5 C). Since the functional analysis of PAN2 suggested that it can suppress NF-κB activity induced by overexpression of IKKα or IKKβ, we explored whether PAN2 might associate with components of the IKK complex. Using lysates from HEK293 cells in which PAN2 was co-expressed with epitope-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed, revealing association of IKKα with PAN2 (Fig.6 A). Under these conditions, association of PAN2 with IKKβ or IKKγ was not detected. Immunoblot analysis of the lysates confirmed production of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ at comparable levels, excluding differences in the levels of expression of these proteins as an explanation for the selective association with IKKα. We were also able to detect the interaction of PAN2 with the endogenous IKKα (Fig. 6 B). In contrast to IKKα, PAN2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with other proteins such as p105 or Nik (not shown), further demonstrating specificity. Next we measured the effect of PAN2 on the activity of IKKα usingin vitro kinase assays. For these experiments, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding epitope-tagged IKKα or IKKβ together with either a control plasmid or various amounts of a PAN2-encoding plasmid. After 36 h, cells were left untreated or stimulated with TNFα for 15 min, then cell lysates were prepared, and either IKKα or IKKβ was immunoprecipitated. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then used for in vitrokinase assays where they were incubated with the exogenous substrate (GST-IκBα-(1–54)) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, examining phosphorylation of GST-IκBα substrate as well as phosphorylation of the kinases. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis to verify loading of equivalent amounts of proteins. As shown in Fig.7 A, TNFα induced increases in both the phosphorylation and kinase activity of IKKα in control-transfected cells. In contrast, TNFα-inducible IKKα activity and phosphorylation were suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner by PAN2. Similar results were obtained for IKKβ where PAN2 overexpression potentially suppressed IKKβ activity below base-line levels in TNFα-stimulated HEK293 cells (Fig. 7 B). To determine whether the PAAD domain of PAN2 is necessary for inhibition of IKKα activity, we compared the effects of full-length PAN2 with deletion mutants of PAN2 comprising the PAAD alone or lacking the PADD domain (ΔPAAD). As an additional control, a fragment of PAN2 representing only the LRRs was also tested. Plasmids encoding full-length and deletion mutants of PAN2 were transfected into 293 cells together with FLAG-tagged IKKα (in a 1:1 ratio), and kinase assays were performed as described above. As shown in Fig.7 C, both PAAD-only and ΔPAAD mutants inhibited IKKα activity (measured by in vitro phosphorylation of IKKα and GST-IκBα-(1–54)), although somewhat less potently than full-length PAN2. In contrast, a mutant encompassing only the LRR was almost inactive at suppressing IKKα activity, although all mutants were expressed to a comparable levels (Fig. 7 C, bottom panel). We conclude that the PAAD domain is sufficient to suppress NF-κB, but other regions of the PAN2 protein can also interfere with cytokine-mediated induction of NF-κB. This report provides evidence that the PAAD-containing protein PAN2 regulates NF-κB activity by affecting the IκB kinases. Gene transfer-mediated increases in the levels of PAN2 suppressed NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to TNFα and IL-1β, implying that PAN2 operates at a point of convergence of these cytokine signal transduction pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, PAN2 also suppressed induction of NF-κB activity by several signal transduction mediators within the TNF and IL-1 receptor pathways, including TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP, IRAK2, and Nik. Furthermore, PAN2 associates with IKKα and suppresses cytokine-mediated activation of this kinase, which plays a critical role in controlling degradation of IκB, thus releasing NF-κB. Although PAN2 did not associate with IKKβ in co-immunoprecipitation assays, it nevertheless suppressed its activation. This observation is consistent with reports that have suggested that IKKα operates upstream of IKKβ in some cytokine signaling pathways (25OMahony A. Lin X. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At this point, we do not know whether the association of PAN2 with IKKα is direct versus indirect, requiring additional proteins analogous to the structurally similar CARD family proteins Nod1 and Nod2, which interact with the IKK complex indirectly via the adapter protein Cardiak (RIP2, Rick) (26Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Indirect association might explain why only IKKα was co-immunoprecipitated with PAN2 instead of the entire IKK complex of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ. In this regard, it is also possible that interaction of PAN2 with IKKα dissociates the IKK complex, explaining why PAN2 suppresses activation of both IKKα and IKKβ. The architecture of PAN2 is similar to multiple proteins in animals and plants that contain various N-terminal effector domains followed by a NACHT domain and LRRs (27Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). The N-terminal effector domains range from CARDs in mammalian Nod1 (CARD4), Nod2 (inflammatory bowel disease protein 1), and CLAN (Ipaf, CARD12) to leucine zippers and Toll/IL-1 receptor domains in plants. Many of these proteins are presumably involved in innate immunity where their LRRs bind ligands produced by bacterial pathogens. For Nod1 and Nod2, for instance, it has been suggested that their LRRs bind lipopolysaccharide, triggering activation of the Nod1 and Nod2 proteins and inducing NF-κB (28Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 29Hugot J.-P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.-P. Belaiche J.

Nature. 2001; 411: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (4692) Google Scholar). One model for how these proteins become activated envisions the unliganded LRRs functioning as negative regulatory domains that suppress oligomerization of the NACHT domains until appropriate stimulatory ligands bind, relieving this autorepression. If PAN family proteins such as Cryopyrin and PAN2 operate in the same way, then we might expect their LRRs to recognize pathogen products, changing the activity state of these proteins. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that PAN2 functions as a stimulator rather than inhibitor of NF-κB under some circumstances. However, as shown here, a truncation mutant of PAN2 lacking the LRRs suppressed (rather than enhancing) TNFα-mediated induction of NF-κB activity. Nevertheless, a recent report suggested that Cryopyrin can activate NF-κB when co-expressed with the PAAD/CARD protein ASC (30Manji G.A. Wang L. Geddes B.J. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S.

In contrast, we have been unable to detect interactions of PAN2 with ASC. 3L. Fiorentino, C. Stehlik, and J. C. Reed, unpublished data. If PANs operate as suppressers of NF-κB in vivo, then one might speculate that the hereditary mutations associated with the PAN family protein Cryopyrin and the PAAD-containing protein Pyrin alter the functions of these proteins so that they are no longer capable of properly suppressing NF-κB, thereby explaining the hyperinflammatory syndromes associated with mutations in the genes encoding these proteins (21Kastner D.L. O'Shea J.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 241-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that at least some members of the PAAD family function in a negative feedback mechanism that ensures that NF-κB activity is produced in short bursts that limit inflammatory responses. It seems likely that PAADs may function as either inducers or suppressers of NF-κB depending on the balance of homotypic interactions between the PAAD domains of this large family of proteins, which presumably set thresholds within cells for NF-κB induction and inflammatory responses. In this regard, we analyzed the levels of endogenous PAN2 in HeLa and 293 cells after stimulation with TNFα, IL-1β, lipopolysaccharide, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but no change in expression levels was observed (data not shown), suggesting that PAN2 protein is not induced by stimuli known to trigger NF-κB activation in these cell lines. Thus PAN2 activation may occur through a mechanism that involves modification of the protein at a post-translational level, its translocation in a particular cellular compartment, or its interactions with other proteins. Further work is needed to explore how PAN2 is regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli and to determine the specific biological contexts in which PAN2 operates. We thank M. Karin (University of California San Diego) for valuable reagents and H. Chan, Y. Kim, J. Zapata, R. Newman, and G. Canettieri for helpful suggestions and discussions."

Mammalian G6Pases are conserved, highly hydrophobic proteins of 357 amino acid residues tightly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Human G6Pase is anchored to the ER by 9 transmembrane helices with the amino (N) terminus in the lumen and the carboxyl (C) terminus in the cytoplasm (5Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W.

The crystal structure of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase (VCPO) from the plant pathogenic fungus Curvularia inaequalis shows that the active site residues in this peroxidase are contained within the phosphatase signature motif (9Hemrika W.

In the active site of VCPO, His496, which is predicted to bind covalently to vanadate or phosphate, acts as a nucleophile, Lys353, Arg360, and Arg490 stabilize the penta-coordinated transition state, and His404 plays a role in leaving group protonation.

However, the H404A mutant also has no phosphatase activity. Further, the amino acid residue in VCPO that covalently binds to vanadate or phosphate remains to be identified.Based on the crystal structure of VCPO, the amino acids predicted to participate in G6Pase catalysis include Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, and His176, corresponding to Lys353, Arg360, His404, Arg490, and His496 in VCPO (reviewed in Refs. 3Chou J.Y.

In this study, we examined further the possibility that any of the active site mutants retain residual enzymatic activity by adopting an adenoviral expression system that increases the sensitivity of the expression assay by 10-fold. Again, we show that mutations of Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, or His176 in G6Pase completely abolish phosphatase activity. Therefore, the structural requirements for the active site residues in G6Pase and VCPO differed because mutations of Lys353, Arg360, or Arg490 in VCPO only markedly reduced enzymatic activity.During catalysis, a His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated to generate a phosphate-enzyme intermediate (19Nordlie R.C.

However, the residue in G6Pase that accepts the phosphate moiety during catalysis has defied molecular characterization. In this study, we affinity purify the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate using a recombinant adenovirus carrying a tagged G6Pase. We further show that His176 is the amino acid in G6Pase that acts as the nucleophile forming the phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate during catalysis.DISCUSSIONG6Pase catalyzes the hydrolysis of G6P to glucose and phosphate, the terminal step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (1Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Google Scholar). A key enzyme in glucose homeostasis, the mechanism of G6Pase catalysis, has been studied for decades. It was established that during catalysis G6Pase becomes phosphorylated by G6P to generate an enzyme-phosphate intermediate (19Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol.

In this study, we affinity purify the [32P] phosphate-G6Pase intermediate and show that it migrates as a 40-kDa polypeptide on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel. We further show that this intermediate is not formed when either His119 or His176 in human G6Pase is mutated. Finally, we demonstrate that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently bound the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate during catalysis.Previous attempts to identify the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate in anin vitro expression system has been hampered by the low efficiency of the expression system. To circumvent this, we used an adenoviral system, which increased the expression efficiency by at least 10-fold. Further, we inserted a His-tag at the N terminus of recombinant G6Pase, which enabled the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate to be purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel chelate resin. Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to isolate the [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate after incubating microsomes expressing WT G6Pase with [32P]G6P. We also show that this intermediate was not detectable in microsomes expressing either H119A or H176A mutant G6Pase, demonstrating that His119 as well as His176 is essential in phosphatase action. However, the results failed to identify the phosphate-accepting His residue in G6Pase.Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to reproducibly demonstrate the formation of the phosphate-enzyme intermediate during catalysis. However, the affinity purified intermediate contained low amounts of contaminants that interfered with cyanogen bromide analysis. We therefore generated a recombinant adenovirus-carrying human G6Pase containing a 5′-His-tag and a 3′-FLAG-tag. Using this doubly tagged Ad-G6Pase we were able to isolate highly purified non-glycosylated [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate by immunoprecipitation followed by affinity chromatography. Cleavage of this intermediate by cyanogen bromide yielded a [32P]phosphate-labeled peptide of 17 kDa with an isoelectric point above 9, corresponding to the cyanogen bromide peptide predicted to contain His176. Our results firmly establish that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently binds the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate.Sequence alignment of mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases has identified a phosphatase signature motif (7Stukey J.

The vital role of this motif in catalysis was predicted by the crystal structure of VCPO (9Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Mammalian G6Pases are conserved, highly hydrophobic proteins of 357 amino acid residues tightly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Human G6Pase is anchored to the ER by 9 transmembrane helices with the amino (N) terminus in the lumen and the carboxyl (C) terminus in the cytoplasm (5Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W.

Sequence alignment reveals that mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases share a conserved phosphatase signature motif (7Stukey J. Carman G.M. Prot.

The crystal structure of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase (VCPO) from the plant pathogenic fungus Curvularia inaequalis shows that the active site residues in this peroxidase are contained within the phosphatase signature motif (9Hemrika W.

In the active site of VCPO, His496, which is predicted to bind covalently to vanadate or phosphate, acts as a nucleophile, Lys353, Arg360, and Arg490 stabilize the penta-coordinated transition state, and His404 plays a role in leaving group protonation. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression studies of phosphatase activity of active site mutants of VCPO (10Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol.

However, the H404A mutant also has no phosphatase activity. Further, the amino acid residue in VCPO that covalently binds to vanadate or phosphate remains to be identified. Based on the crystal structure of VCPO, the amino acids predicted to participate in G6Pase catalysis include Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, and His176, corresponding to Lys353, Arg360, His404, Arg490, and His496 in VCPO (reviewed in Refs. 3Chou J.Y.

In this study, we examined further the possibility that any of the active site mutants retain residual enzymatic activity by adopting an adenoviral expression system that increases the sensitivity of the expression assay by 10-fold. Again, we show that mutations of Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, or His176 in G6Pase completely abolish phosphatase activity. Therefore, the structural requirements for the active site residues in G6Pase and VCPO differed because mutations of Lys353, Arg360, or Arg490 in VCPO only markedly reduced enzymatic activity. During catalysis, a His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated to generate a phosphate-enzyme intermediate (19Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3136-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Feldman F. Butler L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Countaway J.L.

The formation of this intermediate has been demonstrated by labeling liver microsomes with [32P]G6P (21Countaway J.L. Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the residue in G6Pase that accepts the phosphate moiety during catalysis has defied molecular characterization. In this study, we affinity purify the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate using a recombinant adenovirus carrying a tagged G6Pase. We further show that His176 is the amino acid in G6Pase that acts as the nucleophile forming the phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate during catalysis. DISCUSSIONG6Pase catalyzes the hydrolysis of G6P to glucose and phosphate, the terminal step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (1Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Google Scholar). A key enzyme in glucose homeostasis, the mechanism of G6Pase catalysis, has been studied for decades. It was established that during catalysis G6Pase becomes phosphorylated by G6P to generate an enzyme-phosphate intermediate (19Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3136-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Feldman F. Butler L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Countaway J.L.

Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further, it was predicted that the active center of G6Pase comprises Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, and His176 (7Stukey J. Carman G.M. Prot. Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Hemrika W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5047-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, identification of the phosphate acceptor in G6Pase has been elusive. In this study, we affinity purify the [32P] phosphate-G6Pase intermediate and show that it migrates as a 40-kDa polypeptide on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel. We further show that this intermediate is not formed when either His119 or His176 in human G6Pase is mutated. Finally, we demonstrate that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently bound the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate during catalysis.Previous attempts to identify the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate in anin vitro expression system has been hampered by the low efficiency of the expression system. To circumvent this, we used an adenoviral system, which increased the expression efficiency by at least 10-fold. Further, we inserted a His-tag at the N terminus of recombinant G6Pase, which enabled the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate to be purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel chelate resin. Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to isolate the [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate after incubating microsomes expressing WT G6Pase with [32P]G6P. We also show that this intermediate was not detectable in microsomes expressing either H119A or H176A mutant G6Pase, demonstrating that His119 as well as His176 is essential in phosphatase action. However, the results failed to identify the phosphate-accepting His residue in G6Pase.Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to reproducibly demonstrate the formation of the phosphate-enzyme intermediate during catalysis. However, the affinity purified intermediate contained low amounts of contaminants that interfered with cyanogen bromide analysis. We therefore generated a recombinant adenovirus-carrying human G6Pase containing a 5′-His-tag and a 3′-FLAG-tag. Using this doubly tagged Ad-G6Pase we were able to isolate highly purified non-glycosylated [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate by immunoprecipitation followed by affinity chromatography. Cleavage of this intermediate by cyanogen bromide yielded a [32P]phosphate-labeled peptide of 17 kDa with an isoelectric point above 9, corresponding to the cyanogen bromide peptide predicted to contain His176. Our results firmly establish that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently binds the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate.Sequence alignment of mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases has identified a phosphatase signature motif (7Stukey J.

The vital role of this motif in catalysis was predicted by the crystal structure of VCPO (9Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

In this study, we affinity purify the [32P] phosphate-G6Pase intermediate and show that it migrates as a 40-kDa polypeptide on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel. We further show that this intermediate is not formed when either His119 or His176 in human G6Pase is mutated. Finally, we demonstrate that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently bound the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate during catalysis. Previous attempts to identify the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate in anin vitro expression system has been hampered by the low efficiency of the expression system. To circumvent this, we used an adenoviral system, which increased the expression efficiency by at least 10-fold. Further, we inserted a His-tag at the N terminus of recombinant G6Pase, which enabled the phosphate-G6Pase intermediate to be purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel chelate resin. Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to isolate the [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate after incubating microsomes expressing WT G6Pase with [32P]G6P. We also show that this intermediate was not detectable in microsomes expressing either H119A or H176A mutant G6Pase, demonstrating that His119 as well as His176 is essential in phosphatase action. However, the results failed to identify the phosphate-accepting His residue in G6Pase. Using the His-tagged Ad-G6Pase, we were able to reproducibly demonstrate the formation of the phosphate-enzyme intermediate during catalysis. However, the affinity purified intermediate contained low amounts of contaminants that interfered with cyanogen bromide analysis. We therefore generated a recombinant adenovirus-carrying human G6Pase containing a 5′-His-tag and a 3′-FLAG-tag. Using this doubly tagged Ad-G6Pase we were able to isolate highly purified non-glycosylated [32P]phosphate-G6Pase intermediate by immunoprecipitation followed by affinity chromatography. Cleavage of this intermediate by cyanogen bromide yielded a [32P]phosphate-labeled peptide of 17 kDa with an isoelectric point above 9, corresponding to the cyanogen bromide peptide predicted to contain His176. Our results firmly establish that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently binds the phosphate moiety forming the phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate. Sequence alignment of mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases has identified a phosphatase signature motif (7Stukey J. Carman G.M. Prot.

The vital role of this motif in catalysis was predicted by the crystal structure of VCPO (9Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Based on the crystal structure of VCPO, it was predicted that G6Pase catalysis involves Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, and His176 (7Stukey J. Carman G.M. Prot.

Human G6Pase is a membrane protein anchored to the ER by 9 transmembrane helices (5Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

The 9-helical model places all active site residues except Lys76 (in helix 2) on the luminal side of the ER (Fig. 1), confirming the view that the active site of G6Pase is not accessible from the cytoplasm. In contrast to G6Pase, VCPO is a soluble protein. Therefore, the active center of G6Pase and VCPO may vary. Transient expression assays using either the pSVL (5Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B.

On the other hand, K353A, R360A, and R490A mutants in VCPO retained residual phosphatase activity (10Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol.

While Lys353 in VCPO forms hydrogen bonds with phosphate and stabilizes the transition state, the corresponding residue, Lys76, in G6Pase is located within transmembrane helix 2. Therefore, it is unclear whether Lys76 plays a role in G6Pase catalysis similar to that of Lys353 in VCPO. Accordingly, in the current version of the G6Pase reaction mechanism, His176 is the nucleophile forming a phosphohistidine enzyme-intermediate, Arg83 and Arg170 donate hydrogen bonds to phosphate and stabilize the transition state, and His119 provides the proton needed to liberate the glucose moiety (Fig. 4). Deficiency in G6Pase causes GSD-Ia, and a large number of G6Pase mutations have been identified in GSD-Ia patients (reviewed in Refs. 3Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol.

We have previously shown that the active site and 21 of the 30 helical missense mutations, including H179P in helix 5, completely abolish G6Pase activity, establishing that the structural integrity of transmembrane helices is vital to G6Pase catalysis (17Shieh J.-J.

The crucial role of His179 in G6Pase catalysis was confirmed in this study showing that substituting His179 with an Ala residue also completely abolished G6Pase activity. In addition to His119, His176, and His179, six additional His residues are conserved among human, canine, mouse, and rat G6Pases (13Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

However H9A, H52A, H197T, H252A, H307A, and H353A mutants retained significant G6Pase activity, indicating that these His residues do not play critical roles in G6Pase catalysis. In summary, we have isolated and characterized the phosphate-enzyme intermediate and demonstrated that His176 is the nucleophile that covalently bound the phosphate during catalysis forming a phosphohistidine-G6Pase intermediate."

Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The deacetylation activity of Sir2 contributes to its transcriptional silencing activity at the telomeric, ribosomal DNA, and silent mating type loci in yeast and contributes to the cellular aging processes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans (6Gottschling D.E.

In addition to gene silencing, Sir2 helps to mediate DNA repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (12Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2001; 14: 1021-1026Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the biological function of Sir2 is not restricted to transcriptional silencing and DNA double strand break repair. First, Sir2 homologues with NAD-dependent protein/histone deacetylase activity are found in several bacteria and Archaea that do not possess histones (13Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that an archaeal Sir2 homologue deacetylates the archaeal non-histone chromatin protein, Alba, and thereby modulates its DNA binding affinity (14Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Second, there are multiple Sir2 homologues in eukaryotes. For instance, there are at least seven and five Sir2 homologues in humans and yeast, respectively (13Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Third, eukaryotic Sir2 homologues have a broad substrate specificity that allows them to remove acetyl groups from non-histone proteins including p53 and bovine serum albumin (BSA)1(15Vaziri H.

It has been shown that human Sir2, SirT1, represses p53-dependent apoptosis upon DNA damage and oxidative stress by deacetylating p53 (15Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A.

Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Finally, inArabidopsis, the inhibition of a Sir2 homologue results in atypical body axis formation and vascularization (18Grozinger C.M. Chao E.D. Blackwell H.E. Moazed D. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38837-38843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In addition, the product of Sir2, O-acetyl ADP-ribose, has been shown to delay or block the cell cycle in embryonic development (19Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of considerable interest to understand how Sir2 removes an acetyl group from its acetylated lysines in its protein substrates, transfers the acetyl group to NAD, and forms the final product,O-acetyl ADP-ribose, which could be an important metabolite in cell signaling. Two Sir2 crystal structures have been reported recently, namely Sir2 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus bound to NAD (Sir2-Af1) and the catalytic core of human SirT2 (17Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 20Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mass spectrometry analysis indicates that 1′-O-acetyl ADP-ribose could be the final product of Sir2 reaction (21Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). On the basis of these and other biochemical studies, several catalytic mechanisms for Sir2 have been proposed (21Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although all the proposed mechanisms include the hydrolysis of the high energy bond between nicotinamide and ADP-ribose followed by formation of an acetate-ADP-ribose intermediate to produce O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, the detailed reaction mechanism is ambiguous. Furthermore, the individual roles of the Sir2 active site residues during catalysis are unclear. For instance, it has been proposed that Sir2 may function like a serine protease in that a conserved serine residue could act as a catalytic base in the cleavage of the glycosidic linkage in nicotinamide ribose (17Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, this residue is far from the cleavage site and buried within the core of the protein. More importantly, the identity of the true product of Sir2 reaction is unclear since mass spectrometric analysis cannot distinguish the position of the acetyl group within the nicotinamide ribose. Indeed, the regio-isomer of 2′- and 3′-O-acetyl ADP-ribose has recently been proposed as the final product of the Sir2 catalyzed reaction on the basis of NMR studies (23Sauve A.A. Celic I. Avalos J. Deng H. Boeke J.D. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15456-15463Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 24Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) To understand the NAD-dependent deacetylase mechanism more clearly, we have carried out structural and functional studies on Sir2 homologues from A. fulgidus (Sir2-Af1). A. fulgidus is a sulfur-metabolizing hyperthermophile with an optimum growth temperature at 83 °C (25Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 10: 172-173Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The entire genome sequence of A. fulgidus has been recently determined, and the genomic DNA analyses reveal that two Sir2 homologues, Sir2-Af1 and Sir2-Af2, are present in this Archaea bacterium (26Klenk H.-P. Venter J.C. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The Sir2 from S. cerevisiae share sequence identity of 24 and 27% with Sir2-Af1 and Sir2-Af2, respectively. Biochemical studies confirm that these proteins have NAD-dependent protein deacetylase activities; the Sir2-Af1 deacetylates the acetyl group from the acetylated BSA, whereas Sir2-Af2 removes the acetylated N-terminal tail of histone (2Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here, we have undertaken an analysis of the enzymatic and structural consequences of mutagenesis of active site residues to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of Sir2-Af1. In addition, we provide direct crystallographic evidence that 2′-O-acetyl ADP-ribose is formed in the active site as a result of the catalytic reaction. The reported Sir2-Af1 sequence was used to construct two oligonucleotide primers (primer 1, CATGCTAGGGGATCCATGGACGAAAAACTGTTGAAA; primer 2, TCGCATGAGAAGCTTTAAAGACAGAGCTTTCCTGAC) that were used in a PCR to amplify Sir2-Af1 from purified A. fulgidus chromosomal DNA (26Klenk H.-P. Venter J.C. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was restricted using BamHI andHindIII and subcloned into pQE-30 vector. The entire Sir2-Af1 was sequenced to confirm that no mutation occurred during the PCR. We found that the stop codon was mutated to Leu during the PCR reaction, resulting in the introduction of four extra residues, Leu-Lys-Leu-Asn, at the C terminus. All the mutants reported here were generated by PCR-based methods using the appropriate primers, and the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. During the course of PCR, a mutant where three residues (D102G/F159A/R170A) were mutated was also generated. For the convenience, we named this one as a triple mutant throughout the text. The plasmid containing wild type or mutant Sir2 gene was transformed into XL1Blue, and the cell was grown in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A600of 0.6 was reached before induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The N-terminal His-tagged proteins were purified as suggested (Qiagen). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonicator in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h. The mutant proteins were purified by nickel column instead of heat treatment. The imidazole gradient with solutions containing 20–250 mm imidazole in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was applied to the column. The eluted proteins were further purified using Mono-S by NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) and, finally, by gel filtration equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. The proteins were finally concentrated to 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and stored at −70 °C until use. All the crystals used in this study were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Concentrated proteins were initially mixed with NAD to a final concentration of 5 mm and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before crystallization. The monoclinic form of crystals was obtained by mixing the protein solution with an equal volume of the buffer used in the crystallization well (100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 14% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 20% isopropanol) and equilibrated with 1 ml of reservoir solution at 18 °C. Crystals with a size of 0.05 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm appeared within 2–3 days. Hexagonal I form crystals were obtained from a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 13–18% polyethylene glycol 8000. Incubation of hexagonal I form crystals with 500 mmN-acetyl lysine, 100 mm HEPES, and 13–18% polyethylene glycol 8000 at 18 °C for 4–5 days resulted in an alteration of the unit cell dimensions and space group to the hexagonal II form. The detailed statistics are summarized in Table I. An asymmetric unit of the monoclinic form contains a single molecule, and an asymmetric unit of the hexagonal form contains two molecules.Table IStatistics from crystallographic analysisWild typeS24AH80NF159ATriple (I)Triple (II)Data set Resolution (Å)50–1.740–1.840–1.750–1.4750–2.850–2.6 Space groupP21P21P21P21P32P3121 A35.1135.7135.6835.9284.0484.72 B84.7685.2985.5585.5184.0484.72 C44.7444.8544.7944.8695.92193.09 β109.21112.08111.99112.35–– Total observations877076026470651981128752081444 Unique observations261952167124483368831403819629 Data coverage (%)94.893.88988.075.377.3 Rsym3.13.23.83.16.45.3 Mean I/ς (I)42.526.218.831.218.316.2Refinement Resolution range40–1.740–1.840–1.740–1.4740–2.840–2.6 Number of reflections (I > 0)261732166824436368471403119681 Rworking18.9118.9918.2220.4722.9022.89 Rfree22.0221.6721.8323.1032.8130.6 Number of protein atoms194219411940193638393850 Number of water/ligand/ion atoms260/36/1277/36/1285/36/1347/36/10/72/2158/78/2 r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.0050.0050.0050.0050.010.008 r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.231.191.221.161.741.50 r.m.s.d. for bonded main chain atom1.291.191.161.281.261.35Rsym = ∑h∑i‖Ih,i −Ih‖I∑h∑iIh,i, where Ih is the mean intensity of the iobservations of symmetry-related reflections of h.

All data were measured at −190 °C using a flash-frozen crystal on a RaxisIV image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator or at beamline B6 at Pohang accelerated light source. Determination of unit cell parameters and integration of reflections was performed using the program DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38523) Google Scholar) from the HKL package. Data were scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The structure of each crystal was solved by molecular replacement using the AMORE with diffraction data in the 15–4-Å resolution range (28Collaborative Computational Project B Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

In each case, the initial R factor for the molecular replacement solution was 37–38% for all the data lower than or equal to 3.0-Å resolution. With a correctly positioned model, Fo − Fc and 2 Fo − Fc maps were calculated, and manual adjustment of the model was performed using the programs CHAIN and O (29Sack J.S. J. Mol.

The model was further refined using CNS with Engh and Huber stereochemical parameters (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The deacetylase activity of Sir2-Af1 was measured by detecting the release of [3H]acetate from3H-acetylated BSA using a reported protocol (17Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In short, 2 μg of purified Sir2 proteins were incubated with 50 μg of [3H]acetyl-labeled BSA for 60 min at 50 °C in buffer containing 50 mm citrate, pH 6.0, 5 mmP2O74−, 500 μm NAD, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1m HCl and 400 mm acetic acid. The released3H product was extracted with ethyl acetate and counted in a scintillation counter. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mm citrate, 500 μm NAD, 500 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.37–1.48 μmenzyme were incubated at 50 °C. The acetylated BSA (5–200 μm final concentration) were added to the mixture, and the amount of [3H]acetate from [3H]acetylated BSA was measured at various temperatures and times. The Km and kcatvalues were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots using the ENZFITTER data analysis program (32Letherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Nonlinear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC/P 52. Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987Google Scholar). Conformational changes for each protein (55.5 μm) were monitored at various temperatures by scanning with a circular dichroism spectrometer (Jasco J-715). The temperature was raised from 40 to 110 °C over a 70-min period, and detection was set on 222 nm. Measured data fitting was performed using Sigma-plot 2000. Binding constants of the NAD to wild type and mutant Sir2 were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry using the Micro Calorimetry system (MicroCal). Purified Sir2 was extensively dialyzed against buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before binding assay. Briefly, 4.5 mm NAD in the same buffer was titrated into a 0.13–0.23 mm solution of Sir2 protein at 40 °C. Titration curves, typically consisting of 20 points, were fitted to the two-state binding model using the program ORIGIN (MicroCal). Initially, we obtained a hexagonal form of crystals of Sir2-Af1 by use of the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 15–20% isopropanol at 4 °C. This crystal belongs to the space group of p65, with dimensions of a =b = 45.5 Å and c = 235.5 Å and diffracted to 2.7-Å resolution at spring 8 synchrotron station. The structure of the crystal was determined by the method of multiwave anomalous diffraction to 2.7 Å using Zn2+ as an anomalous scatterer (data not shown). The map generated from the multiwave anomalous diffraction phases was excellent in most of the regions, and we were able to build the complete model and NAD on the experimental map. However, the resulting model did not refine well for unknown reasons and produced poor refinement statistics; the final R-factor and R-free were 26.5 and 36.5%, respectively, and only 68% of total residues fell in the most favorable regions in a Ramachandran plot. This partially refined structure was virtually identical to the open form structure of Sir2-Af1 reported by Min et al. (17Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Refinement using the structure from Min et al. (PDB code1ICI) did not improve the statistics or the quality of the model (see below for the overall structure). We then adjusted the crystallization conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and this change together with the extra four residues introduced at the C terminus as the result of the PCR reaction, used to produce Sir2-Af1, altered the packing of the molecules and yielded a monoclinic form of a crystal. This had a significantly improved diffraction limit, and the crystal diffracted to 1.47-Å resolution. In addition, we also crystallized a triple Sir2 mutant (D102G/F159A/R170A). This resulted in the formation of a hexagonal form I crystal that was different from our original crystal (Table I). Finally, hexagonal form II was obtained by performing the crystallization in the presence ofN-acetyl lysine (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The overall structure of the protein consists of two domains, a large domain with an α/β or Rossman fold composed of six α-helices and six parallel β-strands and a small domain with three antiparallel β-strand, two α-helices, and a zinc atom (Fig. 1a). When the structures of monoclinic and hexagonal (I) forms were compared with the open form of Sir2, most of the regions were very similar, showing root mean square deviations of 1.6 Å (monoclinic form) to 1.3 Å (hexagonal I form) for all Cα atoms. However, significant differences were observed in the loop region (located from residues 29 to 48) that is situated over the NAD binding site. When the loop segment alone was compared with that of open form, the root mean square deviations for Cα atoms were 4.5 Å (monoclinic form) and 3.2 Å (hexagonal I form). The electron density in the loop region is well defined in all three crystal forms, and the average temperature factor in this region is similar to that of the whole molecule. Nevertheless, the notable conformational differences in the loop segment of different crystal forms indicate that this is most flexible region in the molecule (Fig.1a). In the monoclinic form, residues 30–34 in the loop were closer to the active site than the equivalent regions in the open form, whereas residues 41–48 were slightly further away from the active site. The most noticeable movement included the rearrangement of the positions of Phe-32 (7 Å), Arg-33, and Trp-39 (14 Å) toward the nicotinamide ribose in the active site (Fig. 1, b and c). Because several residues in the loop more tightly surround NAD in the active site, the monoclinic form adopts a “closed” loop conformation relative to the open form. In both hexagonal I and II forms, the loop segment in the hexagon forms intermediate conformations between the open and closed form; residues 30–33 adopted conformations more similar to the closed form, whereas the conformations of residues 38–48 were more similar to the open form. Although an excess of NAD was added to Sir2 before crystallization, we observed only the ADP-ribose density in the monoclinic form and not the NAD density (Fig. 1b). It is possible that the nicotinamide ring in this structure was disordered and, therefore, not visible. However, several lines of evidence suggest that this was not the case. First, the hydroxyl group linked to C1′ of nicotinamide ribose was tightly packed by the surrounding residues, and there was insufficient space to accommodate the nicotinamide ring. Second, the high resolution electron density clearly showed that the bound ligand was an α-form, whereas the NAD we added was a β-form. Thus, we presume that during the crystallization, β-NAD was converted to ADP-ribose. In contrast to the monoclinic crystals, the active site in hexagonal form I crystals contained enough space for the nicotinamide ring to fit in. Furthermore, in the hexagonal form 1 crystals, the ADP-ribose was still in the β-form. We assume therefore, that NAD was bound in this crystal form. However, we did not observe the nicotinamide ring, and thus, we presume that if it was indeed present, it was disordered. The ADP-ribose bound to the active site of Sir2 in a similar manner to that described for NAD (17Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) in that it was oriented in an inverted direction compared with most other NAD-binding proteins. In general, ADP-ribose binds extensively to a pocket formed by several conserved residues at the interface between the large and small domains of NAD-binding proteins. Previously, the NAD binding site in Sir2-Af1 was divided into three sites, site A for binding of adenine ribose, site B for binding of nicotinamide ribose, and site C, which does not make any direct interaction with NAD but forms a core inside the pocket. This provides local stability to the residues that interact with the adenine ribose and phosphate moiety. In the three different crystal forms we studied, the interactions between the pocket residues and the ligand in site A were highly conserved. The adenine base was surrounded by residues Gly-22, Ala-25, Gly-185, Pro-212, and Lys-228, and the adenine base and ribose made a direct hydrogen bond to the main or side chains of Glu-26, Asn-211, Asp-213, and Ala-229. The interactions between residues in site C were also conserved in all the crystal forms. Ser-24 formed direct hydrogen bonds with His-80 and Asp-101 (Fig. 1c). A buried water molecule mediated the interactions in Ser-24, His-80, Asn-99, and Asp-101. Large fractions of the side chains in these residues were buried. The fractional accessible surface area for the side chains of these residues was 2% for Ser-24, 7% for Asn-99, 6% for Asp-101, and 0% for His-80. The most significant differences between the structures derived from the different crystal forms were observed in the interactions in site B as a result of the closure of the flexible loop (Fig. 1c). The O1′ of nicotinamide ribose made hydrogen bonds with NE of Trp-39 and NH1 from Arg-33. The NH1 group of Arg-33 also interacted with O2′A and O4′ of nicotinamide ribose. The aromatic ring of Phe-159 was about 3.4 Å away from O1′ of the ribose ring. Side chains of Phe-32 and Val-190 were also close to the ribose ring. The OH3′ of ribose made a hydrogen bond to ND1 of His-116. The ribose ring adopted the C2′ exo conformation rather than the C3′ endo conformation seen in the open form. It is unclear why ADP-ribose was observed instead of NAD. It is possible that the weak ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of Sir2 may lead to the cleavage. However, ADP-ribose instead of NAD was also seen in some mutant structures such as Ser-24, in which the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is almost abrogated (data not shown, see below). Furthermore, the NAD-dependent deacetylation reaction occurred between NAD and excessN-acetyl lysine in hexagonal I form (see below). Thus, formation of ADP-ribose may be due to the crystallization conditions facilitating hydrolysis of the relatively unstable glycosidic bond between nicotinamide and ribose. On the basis of structural and sequence conservation, we carried out mutational studies on Sir2-Af1 to identify the functional residues that are involved in catalysis (Fig.2). Our data show that the Arg-33 to Ala mutant retained about 80% activity, suggesting that the interactions between Arg-33 and nicotinamide ribose contribute little to catalysis. Glu-45 does not interact with NAD directly, and its mutation did not affect the activity. Strikingly, however, replacement of His-116 with Asn/Asp and Phe-159 with Ala significantly affected the deacetylation activity. and therefore, these residues are likely to be involved in the enzyme reaction. Specifically, the replacement of His-116 with either Asp or Asn reduced the activity 30–50-fold, suggesting that this residue has a key catalytic role. His-116 formed a hydrogen bond to the O3′ of NAD, and this interaction was observed in all three structural forms. The removal of the aromatic ring from Phe-159 also dramatically reduced the activity. Although the side chain is close to the ribose ring (3.4 Å from O1), it did not make any direct interactions with NAD, and its side chain was partly buried (∼50%). To find out more about the role of Phe-159, we examined the kinetic parameters of wild type Sir2-Af1 and the F159A mutant (TableII). The Km value of the mutant enzyme was twice that of wild type enzyme"

At low concentrations, agonist stimulation of membrane receptors generates intracellular ROS and repetitive oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in human endothelial cells. The present study was performed to examine whether ROS are important in the generation or maintenance of [Ca2+]i oscillations in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) stimulated by histamine. Histamine (1 μm) increased the fluorescence of 2′,7′-dihydrodichlorofluorescin diacetate in HAEC, an indicator of ROS production. This was partially inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 10 μm), by the farnesyltransferase inhibitor H-Ampamb-Phe-Met-OH (2 μm), and in HAEC transiently expressing Rac1N17, a dominant negative allele of the protein Rac1, which is essential for NADPH oxidase activity. In indo 1-loaded HAEC, 1 μm histamine triggered [Ca2+]i oscillations that were blocked by DPI or H-Ampamb-Phe-Met-OH. Histamine-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations were not observed in HAEC lacking functional Rac1 protein but were observed when transfected cells were simultaneously exposed to a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (10 μm), which by itself did not alter either [Ca2+]i or levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3). Thus, histamine generates ROS in HAEC at least partially via NADPH oxidase activation.

Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), bradykinin (31Carter T.D. Bogle R.G. Bjaaland T. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and thrombin (32Rink T.J. Hallam T.J. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) stimulate repetitive oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in endothelial cells. The initiation of each Ca2+ spike appears to be due chiefly to the generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3(33Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), and the maintenance of oscillations may be related to repetitive cycles of fast activation and slow inactivation of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor by Ca2+ (34Sneyd J. Keizer J. Sanderson M.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1463-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation, that NADPH oxidase-generated ROS increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to Ins-1,4,5-P3, suggests a potential link between oxidase stimulation and Ca2+ signaling. The following study was therefore performed to determine whether NADPH oxidase-generated ROS affect [Ca2+]i oscillations during histamine stimulation in human endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that histamine, like many other agonists (15–28), stimulates the production of ROS in endothelial cells. Histamine-stimulated ROS production results, at least in part, from activation of the NADPH oxidase and Rac1 signaling, because it is inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, by an FTase inhibitor, and in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein.The generation of ROS by the NADPH oxidase was previously reported when endothelial cells were stimulated by thrombin (28Holland J.A.

Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C906-C914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of tumor necrosis factor, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS were found to be important in activating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in endothelial cells (24Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation was previously shown to be redox-sensitive in HeLa cells (36Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, transient expression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant increased NF-κB transcriptional activity, whereas basal and cytokine-stimulated NF-κB activity was inhibited in dominant negative Rac1 mutants. This is interesting, because we previously showed that [Ca2+]i oscillations regulate NF-κB activity during histamine stimulation in HAEC (39Hu Q. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33995-33998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and now show that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are critical to the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations during histamine stimulation.The effect of NADPH oxidase activation on [Ca2+]ioscillations may derive from the sensitization of the ER Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor by oxidase-derived ROS. Ins-1,4,5-P3 is critical to the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in non-excitable cells (33Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Like many other agonists, histamine binds to membrane receptors and activates phospholipase C to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and to generate diacylglycerol and Ins-1,4,5-P3 (44Pollock W.K. Wreggett K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 after agonist stimulation leads to the release of ER Ca2+. [Ca2+]i oscillations are believed to depend on Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptors releasing Ca2+ in “hotspots” in the ER (45Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and the subsequent diffusion of this Ca2+ to adjacent sites in the ER, increasing the local sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3receptor and inducing further Ca2+ release. Changes in the sensitivity of the ER to Ins-1,4,5-P3 are likely to be important in the generation of repetitive [Ca2+]ispikes. Redox sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor has previously been reported in hepatocytes (46Renard-Rooney D.C. Joseph S.K. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 47Renard D.C. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 48Nomura T. Higashi K. Hoshino M. Saso K. Itou M. Hoek J.B. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 325A-329ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we previously showed that NADPH oxidase activation increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to Ins-1,4,5-P3 in HAEC. The finding, that 10 μmH2O2 “restores” [Ca2+]i oscillations in histamine-stimulated HAEC expressing the dominant negative form of Rac1 but does not affect Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels in histamine-stimulated HAEC, is consistent with the notion that histamine-stimulated ROS increase Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor sensitivity and thereby affect the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations.Histamine-stimulated ROS may also affect upstream signaling pathways in HAEC. For example, we recently showed that activation of phospholipase D (PLD), which exhibits redox sensitivity in endothelial cells (49Parinandi N.L. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Shi S. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), regulates [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency in HAEC during histamine stimulation (50Hu Q. Natarajan V. Ziegelstein R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not likely that the effect of histamine-stimulated ROS on the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations is related to PLD signaling, however, because time-dependent activation of PLD by histamine in HAEC is not rapid enough to affect generation of oscillations. Stimulation of HAEC by histamine activates PLD by 5 min, but no significant effect is observed 1 min after stimulation. Moreover, inhibition of PLD decreases oscillation frequency, but does not inhibit the generation of [Ca2+]ioscillations during histamine stimulation (50Hu Q. Natarajan V. Ziegelstein R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, histamine-stimulated ROS may modulate [Ca2+]ioscillations by an effect on PLC-γ, because generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 by agonists like bradykinin appears to be secondary to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (51Venema V.J., Ju, H. Sun J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and H2O2 is known to activate PLC-γ (52Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We do not believe this mechanism is likely to play a role during histamine stimulation, because 1 μm histamine stimulated only weak tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and histamine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 was not inhibited by DPI, by an FTase inhibitor, or in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein (data not shown).ROS may also be important in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations, because of an effect on other redox-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms that are activated by histamine. For example, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) may be important in histamine-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. It was previously shown that blocking ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release inhibits [Ca2+]i oscillations in endothelial cells stimulated by histamine (53Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Frieden M. Spitaler M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Redox regulation of the RyR is well-established in cardiac and skeletal muscle, with sulfhydryl oxidation, S-nitrosylation, or modification of sulfhydryl groups of the RyR by other oxidants increasing Ca2+ release channel activity (54Anzai K. Ogawa K. Ozawa T. Yamamoto H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hyper-reactive cysteine moieties may represent biochemical components of a transmembrane redox sensor within the RyR channel complex that conveys information about localized changes in redox potential produced by different stimuli (55Pessah I.N. Feng W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 56Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).The finding that ROS play a role in agonist-stimulated Ca2+signaling is novel and important in cell biology, reinforcing the relatively new concept that ROS are not only important pathophysiologically but also play major roles in cell signaling. It was recently shown, for example, that epidermal growth factor increases [Ca2+]i in fibroblasts without affecting inositol phosphates but rather via the production of H2O2 regulated by Rac and RhoA (57Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Cheong C. Park Y.M. Ha K.S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding is interesting in light of our previous work showing that H2O2 increases the sensitivity of the ER Ca2+ store to Ins-1,4,5-P3 (29Hu Q. Zheng G. Zweier J.L. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15749-15757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that H2O2 generates [Ca2+]ioscillations in endothelial cells (43Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), even though H2O2 itself does not stimulate Ins-1,4,5-P3 production, as shown in this work and by others (58Vercellotti G.M. Severson S.P. Duane P. Moldow C.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar).The present study shows that elevated levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 alone may not be sufficient to initiate repetitive [Ca2+]i spiking behavior in HAEC during histamine stimulation. Although histamine increases levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 (44Pollock W.K. Wreggett K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the generation of ROS during histamine stimulation is necessary for oscillations to be triggered. More specifically, it appears that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are important in histamine-triggered Ca2+ signaling, because oscillations were not observed in the presence of DPI, an FTase inhibitor or in dominant negative Rac1 transfected cells. The critical role of ROS in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations is further supported by the finding that 10 μmH2O2 “restored” [Ca2+]i oscillations in histamine-stimulated HAEC expressing the dominant negative form of Rac1, even though this concentration of H2O2 alone did not affect Ca2+ signaling or Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels. Taken together, these data suggest that histamine activates an NADPH oxidase in HAEC, resulting in the production of ROS that increase the sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor to Ins-1,4,5-P3 and thereby play a role in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations. There is increasing evidence that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 play an important role in cell signaling (1Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Both vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells are capable of generating ROS (5Irani K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). A number of enzyme systems likely contribute to ROS generation in endothelial cells, including arachidonic acid-metabolizing systems (6Cosentino F. Sill J.C. Katusic Z.S.

IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The endothelial NADPH oxidase shares some structural features of the multicomponent NADPH oxidase of phagocytes, most of which have been identified in endothelial cells at the RNA or protein level (12Jones S.A.

Among these include the small GTP-binding protein Rac1, which is necessary for enzyme function. Whereas the oxidase of phagocytes generates large quantities of ROS that are necessary to eliminate engulfed microorganisms, the NADPH oxidase of non-phagocytic cells generates low levels of ROS that appear to have a cell signaling function.

We recently showed that activation of endothelial NADPH oxidase increases the sensitivity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) (29Hu Q. Zheng G.

This effect was blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and was not observed in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein. At low concentrations, agonists like histamine (30Jacob R. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), bradykinin (31Carter T.D.

[Ca2+]i oscillations are believed to depend on Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptors releasing Ca2+ in “hotspots” in the ER (45Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and the subsequent diffusion of this Ca2+ to adjacent sites in the ER, increasing the local sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3receptor and inducing further Ca2+ release. Changes in the sensitivity of the ER to Ins-1,4,5-P3 are likely to be important in the generation of repetitive [Ca2+]ispikes. Redox sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor has previously been reported in hepatocytes (46Renard-Rooney D.C. Joseph S.K. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 47Renard D.C. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 48Nomura T. Higashi K. Hoshino M. Saso K. Itou M. Hoek J.B. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 325A-329ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we previously showed that NADPH oxidase activation increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to Ins-1,4,5-P3 in HAEC. The finding, that 10 μmH2O2 “restores” [Ca2+]i oscillations in histamine-stimulated HAEC expressing the dominant negative form of Rac1 but does not affect Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels in histamine-stimulated HAEC, is consistent with the notion that histamine-stimulated ROS increase Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor sensitivity and thereby affect the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations.Histamine-stimulated ROS may also affect upstream signaling pathways in HAEC. For example, we recently showed that activation of phospholipase D (PLD), which exhibits redox sensitivity in endothelial cells (49Parinandi N.L. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Shi S. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), regulates [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency in HAEC during histamine stimulation (50Hu Q. Natarajan V. Ziegelstein R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not likely that the effect of histamine-stimulated ROS on the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations is related to PLD signaling, however, because time-dependent activation of PLD by histamine in HAEC is not rapid enough to affect generation of oscillations. Stimulation of HAEC by histamine activates PLD by 5 min, but no significant effect is observed 1 min after stimulation. Moreover, inhibition of PLD decreases oscillation frequency, but does not inhibit the generation of [Ca2+]ioscillations during histamine stimulation (50Hu Q. Natarajan V. Ziegelstein R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, histamine-stimulated ROS may modulate [Ca2+]ioscillations by an effect on PLC-γ, because generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 by agonists like bradykinin appears to be secondary to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (51Venema V.J., Ju, H. Sun J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and H2O2 is known to activate PLC-γ (52Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We do not believe this mechanism is likely to play a role during histamine stimulation, because 1 μm histamine stimulated only weak tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and histamine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 was not inhibited by DPI, by an FTase inhibitor, or in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein (data not shown).ROS may also be important in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations, because of an effect on other redox-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms that are activated by histamine. For example, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) may be important in histamine-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. It was previously shown that blocking ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release inhibits [Ca2+]i oscillations in endothelial cells stimulated by histamine (53Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Frieden M. Spitaler M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Redox regulation of the RyR is well-established in cardiac and skeletal muscle, with sulfhydryl oxidation, S-nitrosylation, or modification of sulfhydryl groups of the RyR by other oxidants increasing Ca2+ release channel activity (54Anzai K. Ogawa K. Ozawa T. Yamamoto H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hyper-reactive cysteine moieties may represent biochemical components of a transmembrane redox sensor within the RyR channel complex that conveys information about localized changes in redox potential produced by different stimuli (55Pessah I.N. Feng W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 56Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).The finding that ROS play a role in agonist-stimulated Ca2+signaling is novel and important in cell biology, reinforcing the relatively new concept that ROS are not only important pathophysiologically but also play major roles in cell signaling. It was recently shown, for example, that epidermal growth factor increases [Ca2+]i in fibroblasts without affecting inositol phosphates but rather via the production of H2O2 regulated by Rac and RhoA (57Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Cheong C. Park Y.M. Ha K.S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding is interesting in light of our previous work showing that H2O2 increases the sensitivity of the ER Ca2+ store to Ins-1,4,5-P3 (29Hu Q. Zheng G. Zweier J.L. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15749-15757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that H2O2 generates [Ca2+]ioscillations in endothelial cells (43Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), even though H2O2 itself does not stimulate Ins-1,4,5-P3 production, as shown in this work and by others (58Vercellotti G.M. Severson S.P. Duane P. Moldow C.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar).The present study shows that elevated levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 alone may not be sufficient to initiate repetitive [Ca2+]i spiking behavior in HAEC during histamine stimulation. Although histamine increases levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 (44Pollock W.K. Wreggett K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the generation of ROS during histamine stimulation is necessary for oscillations to be triggered. More specifically, it appears that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are important in histamine-triggered Ca2+ signaling, because oscillations were not observed in the presence of DPI, an FTase inhibitor or in dominant negative Rac1 transfected cells. The critical role of ROS in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations is further supported by the finding that 10 μmH2O2 “restored” [Ca2+]i oscillations in histamine-stimulated HAEC expressing the dominant negative form of Rac1, even though this concentration of H2O2 alone did not affect Ca2+ signaling or Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels. Taken together, these data suggest that histamine activates an NADPH oxidase in HAEC, resulting in the production of ROS that increase the sensitivity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor to Ins-1,4,5-P3 and thereby play a role in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations. This study shows that histamine, like many other agonists (15–28), stimulates the production of ROS in endothelial cells. Histamine-stimulated ROS production results, at least in part, from activation of the NADPH oxidase and Rac1 signaling, because it is inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, by an FTase inhibitor, and in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein. The generation of ROS by the NADPH oxidase was previously reported when endothelial cells were stimulated by thrombin (28Holland J.A. Meyer J.W. Chang M.M. O'Donnell R.W. Johnson D.K. Ziegler L.M. Endothelium. 1998; 6: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor (21Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or tumor necrosis factor-α (7Corda S. Laplace C. Vicaut E. Duranteau J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C906-C914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of tumor necrosis factor, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS were found to be important in activating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in endothelial cells (24Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation was previously shown to be redox-sensitive in HeLa cells (36Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, transient expression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant increased NF-κB transcriptional activity, whereas basal and cytokine-stimulated NF-κB activity was inhibited in dominant negative Rac1 mutants. This is interesting, because we previously showed that [Ca2+]i oscillations regulate NF-κB activity during histamine stimulation in HAEC (39Hu Q. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33995-33998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and now show that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are critical to the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations during histamine stimulation. The effect of NADPH oxidase activation on [Ca2+]ioscillations may derive from the sensitization of the ER Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor by oxidase-derived ROS. Ins-1,4,5-P3 is critical to the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in non-excitable cells (33Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Like many other agonists, histamine binds to membrane receptors and activates phospholipase C to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and to generate diacylglycerol and Ins-1,4,5-P3 (44Pollock W.K. Wreggett K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 after agonist stimulation leads to the release of ER Ca2+. [Ca2+]i oscillations are believed to depend on Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptors releasing Ca2+ in “hotspots” in the ER (45Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D.

Alternatively, histamine-stimulated ROS may modulate [Ca2+]ioscillations by an effect on PLC-γ, because generation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 by agonists like bradykinin appears to be secondary to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (51Venema V.J., Ju, H.

Stimulation of glycolysis has been regarded as the main response that increases energy production during hypoxia; however, there is an obvious conflict during ischemia, because both the oxygen and glucose supply are insufficient. In this study, we found that exposure of HepG2 cells and normal fibroblasts to hypoxia induces cellular tolerance to glucose starvation. The tolerance induced by hypoxia is dependent on several amino acids, indicating a switch from glucose to amino acids as the energy source. When antisense RNA expression vector for 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase or protein kinase B/Akt was transfected into HepG2 cells, the induction of tolerance to glucose was greatly inhibited, indicating that the tolerance was dependent on 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B/Akt. Similar tolerance was induced by nitric oxide exposure. The tolerance induced was observed in various cells and may represent a previously unknown physiological response related to hypoxia-preconditioning and tumor progression:austerity.

Bunn H.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Basically, the reactions of tissues are classified into two categories: 1) improvement of the oxygen supply and 2) adaptation to anaerobic conditions. Reactions that improve the oxygen supply include vasodilatation, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis, and adaptation reactions to anaerobic conditions include a metabolic switch to anaerobic glycolysis, repression of anabolism, and cell cycle arrest. These reactions are governed by various reactions, both physiological and biochemical. The hypoxia response is very important to understanding tumor tissue biology. Tumor cells are continuously exposed to hypoxia, because the oxygen demand of tumors always exceeds their supply due to their unregulated growth caused by genetic and epigenetic alterations (3Hahnfeldt P. Panigrahy D. Folkman J. Hlatky L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4770-4775PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). That is why angiogenesis is so critical for tumor progression and why anti-angiogenesis is regarded as such a promising novel strategy for cancer therapy (5Folkman J. Ann. Surg. 1972; 175: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Although the results of studies of the hypoxia response thus far provide a good explanation for the survival strategy of tissues during pure oxygen deficiency caused by high altitude and pulmonary diseases, it is still difficult to explain fully the adaptive reactions of tumor tissue. This is particularly true of hypovascular tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, in which even the liver metastases are hypovascular (6Warshaw A.L. Fernandez-del Castillo C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Because of the chronic oxygen deficiency due to increased demand as a result of cancer growth or insufficient angiogenesis, the supply of both oxygen and nutrients may be insufficient. The only known response of energy metabolism to hypoxia is a switch to anaerobic glycolysis (7Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), but what is the source of the glucose? Most is supplied by the bloodstream, and utilization of glycogen stores and gluconeogenesis are alternatives. Glycogen storage in tumor tissue is generally very limited, and it is unimaginable that glycogen could be the main source of glucose in tumors during chronic hypoxia. Glutamine is suspected of being the main energy source in tumors (8Kovacevic Z. McGivan J.D. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 547-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but it is most efficiently used for energy production under aerobic conditions (9Kallinowski F. Runkel S. Fortmeyer H.P. Forster H. Vaupel P. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1987; 113: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus cells and tissues, such as those of tumors, are confronted by an insufficiency of both oxygen and nutrients, and the switch to glycolysis seems inadequate to explain the adaptation. Repeated brief exposure of organs to ischemia has been found to confer strong tolerance to subsequent ischemia and is referred to as “ischemic preconditioning” (10Hale S.L. Kloner R.A. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1994; 9: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore suspected that hypoxia might induce other reactions that confer tolerance to glucose insufficiency. Our primary purpose in the present study was to determine how cells respond to insufficient supplies of oxygen and nutrients. Nitric oxide (NO)1 has been found to be a mediator of vasodilatation (11Moncada S. Verh. K. Acad. Geneeskd. Belg. 2000; 62: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar). It also blocks apoptosis under certain conditions (12Ogura T. DeGeorge G. Tatemichi M. Esumi H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression (13Chin K. Kurashima Y. Ogura T. Tajiri H. Yoshida S. Esumi H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity (14Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), resulting in destruction of mitochondria without cell death (15Esumi H. Chin K. Kurashima Y. Hasegawa F. Ogura T. Yoneda M. Ozawa T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 42: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we speculated that NO might activate some unknown pathway that generates energy without consuming oxygen, and therefore might be a mediator of cellular responses to an insufficient blood supply. In the present study, we examined the effects of hypoxia and NO on the cellular response to nutrient deprivation to determine whether there are any unknown physiological adaptations of cells to overcome deprivation of both oxygen and nutrients. HepG2 cells were obtained from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, and WI-38 cells were purchased from ATCC. All cells were maintained under the standard culture conditions recommended by the suppliers. When nutrient starvation had been achieved, cells were seeded into 12-well dishes (Falcon). After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was changed to either DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS (Sigma), minimum Eagle’s medium nonessential amino acid mixture (Invitrogen), glutamine and antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen), or DMEM-base with the same supplements as above.S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO4) to create a 1 m stock solution, and it was frozen at −20 °C until used. The same volume of Me2SO4 was added to control cultures. After detaching the cells from each well by trypsinization, they were counted with a hemocytometer, and viable cells were identified by dye-exclusion with trypan blue (Invitrogen). Hypoxia was achieved by culturing cells under 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Organic acids in the culture medium were analyzed after a 24-h culture of cells in 10-cm plastic dishes with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS with or without addition of SNAP. The organic acid fraction was prepared by addition of perchloric acid to a final concentration of 1%. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and filtration through a filter having a 0.45-μm pore size. The filtrate was then subjected to HPLC analysis on a Shodex column KC-811 (YMC Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). In some experiments, lactate was determined with a kit from Sigma. The 1% O2culture was conducted in a humidified incubator under 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. The antisense RNA expression vectors for Akt1 and Akt2 were constructed as described previously (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNAs for Akt1 and Akt2 were ligated into pCR3 vector (Invitrogen) in an antisense orientation. Similarly, cDNA for AMPK α1 and the α2 subunit was cloned in the antisense orientation into the XhoI/EcoRV site of pCDNA3.1 vector and the EcoRI site of pCR3.0 vector, respectively. All expression vectors were verified by sequencing. The cDNA for AMPK α1 and α2 was obtained by reverse transcription-coupled PCR using the following primers and the mRNA fraction of human fetal brain (CLONTECH). The primers for the α1 subunit were 5′-ggctcgagcctggagaaagatggcgacag-3′ and 5′-ccgaatcttagtaaagacagctgagaacttcc-3′ covering −11 to 942 nucleotides, and for α2 they were 5′-gaagatggctgagaagcaga-3′ and 5′-aactagagacagatcaqacgg-3′, covering the entire coding sequence (−4 to 1672 nucleotides). HepG2 cells were transfected with the above expression vectors by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, and selection was achieved by adding G418 (Invitrogen) at 640 μg/ml for at least 2 weeks. The total amounts of Akt protein and phosphorylated Akt were determined by Western blot analysis as described previously (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar) using Akt-specific and Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt-specific antisera (New England Biolabs). Antisera against AMPK α1 and α2 subunits were prepared by injecting denatured α1 and α2 subunits into rabbits. AMPK α1 and α2 subunits were purified from Escherichia coli transfected with expression vector containing the 11–942 nucleotides of α1 subunit cDNA or the entire coding sequence (−4 to 1672 nucleotides) of α2 subunit cDNA constructed in a pET 19b vector (Novagen) having the His tag. His-tagged subunits were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography and preparative SDS-PAGE. The cross-reactivity of both sera was minimized by absorbing them with another antigen. The details of the antibody preparation will be published elsewhere. AMPK activity was assayed essentially based on the method of Davies et al. (17Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) using SAMS peptide as the substrate, with modifications. The details of the modifications will be published elsewhere, but briefly are as follows. Glutathione S-transferase-SAMS fusion protein expressed inE. coli was used as the substrate instead of synthetic SAMS peptide. GST-SAMS fusion protein was prepared by constructing an expression vector having a cDNA coding for SAMS peptide at the 3′-end of the glutathione S-transferase of pGEX vector and transfecting it into E. coli. The fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography after extraction. After the AMPK enzyme reaction, GST-SAMS fusion protein was recovered by binding to glutathione-Sepharose and precipitation by centrifugation. Radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The DNA binding activity of HIF-1 was assessed by electromobility shift assay, essentially based on the method described previously (18Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells exposed to 30 μm CoCl2 or 200 μm desferrioxamine in DMEM at atmospheric oxygen tension or cultured at 1% oxygen for 12 h were used or HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM or DMEM-base either at atmospheric or 1% oxygen tension for 12 h. All of the data were analyzed by unpaired Student’s t test where possible, and differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered significant. S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) and N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine were purchased from Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan. d-Glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, d-glucosamine, andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine were purchased from Sigma and were more than 99% pure. As shown in Fig.1a, when human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum at the atmospheric oxygen concentration with 5% CO2, most of the cells underwent necrotic cell death within 24 h. However, under 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 94% N2, the cells survived much longer (Fig. 1a), and the surviving cells grew normally upon addition of glucose. There was a significant increase in cell survival when 0.5 mm or 0.25 mm SNAP, an NO generator, was included in the culture medium (Fig. 1b). Because NO strongly inhibits cytochromec oxidase and hypoxia limits oxygen utilization, cells were exposed to various concentrations of NaCN, a specific inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, to assess its effect on survival (Fig.1c); however, it did not affect cell survival up to 4 mm, at which concentration oxygen consumption was completely blocked, the same as with 0.5 mm SNAP (data not shown). SNAP is an NO generator but also produces N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine as a by-product and nitrite as an oxidized product of NO; however, these products alone had negligible effects on cell survival (data not shown). NaCN did not alter cell survival, but 0.5 mm SNAP enhanced cell survival even at low oxygen concentrations (1%). The half-life of NO and the release of NO from SNAP are greatly influenced by the oxygen concentration (19Ioannidis I. Batz M. Paul T. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. De Groot H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When the effect of NO on cell survival under 1% O2 was examined at various SNAP concentrations, SNAP was found to enhance cell survival at much lower concentrations (Fig.1d), and a clear additive effect of SNAP and hypoxia was seen under these conditions. By contrast, the high concentration of SNAP was cytotoxic at both atmospheric and hypoxic oxygen tension (Fig.1d). Glycolysis has long been considered the major pathway of energy production under hypoxic conditions, and consistent with this, when glucose was present accumulation of the glycolytic products lactate and acetate was greatly increased under 1% O2 and/or in the presence of SNAP (Table I). As shown in Fig. 2, NO again prolonged the survival of cells exposed to 5 μm iodoacetate, a strong inhibitor of glycolysis (Fig. 2a). This enhanced cell survival was reproduced by hypoxia but not by NaCN. Similar prolonged cell survival was also observed with WI-38 human fibroblasts (Fig. 2b). WI-38 cells exposed to 5 μm iodoacetate alone formed blebs within 6 h and died shortly thereafter. NaCN did not alter this cell death, but cells treated with both iodoacetate and SNAP maintained their morphology and viability until 24 h and died only after 48 h. These results clearly indicate that the glycogen utilization is not the mechanism of the enhanced survival.Table IOrganic acid accumulation in HepG2 cell mediumOrganic acids, μmol/24 h/1 × 106 cellLactateAcetate21% O28.51.410.5 mmSNAP14.51-aStatistical significance atp < 0.01 from 21% O2 culture.1.951-aStatistical significance atp < 0.01 from 21% O2 culture.1% O215.01-aStatistical significance atp < 0.01 from 21% O2 culture.2.631-aStatistical significance atp < 0.01 from 21% O2 culture.All the values are means of at least two independent experiments.1-a Statistical significance atp < 0.01 from 21% O2 culture. Open table in a new tab All the values are means of at least two independent experiments. Another possible mechanism of the improved cell survival is enhanced utilization of amino acids or fatty acids for energy production. To test this possibility, we conducted a series of experiments in which amino acids, fatty acids, or both were withdrawn from the cell culture. When all amino acids were present, there was clear hypoxia-induced tolerance (Fig.3a). The same observations were made in HLE human hepatoma cells (data not shown) and showed that amino acids are essential for induction of tolerance. Accordingly, experiments were conducted with medium supplemented with only one amino acid and no serum. When cells were cultured at atmospheric oxygen tension, they all died, whereas significant numbers of cells survived during hypoxia in the presence of certain amino acids, including glutamine, arginine, serine, cystine, proline, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid (Fig. 3b). When a fatty acid mixture was included in the medium, cell survival was slightly enhanced under normoxic conditions but not under hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Both hypoxia and exposure to NO activate the hypoxia-response transcription factor, HIF-1. HIF-1 activates a series of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and the glucose transporter, and probably also modulates a series of genes whose products shift energy metabolism away from glycolysis. Cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine are known to activate HIF-1, but neither compound induced tolerance (Fig. 4a) despite clearly activating HIF-1, as shown in Fig. 4b. HIF-1 was also clearly activated by exposure to NO or hypoxia in the presence of glucose, but relatively weakly activated in the absence of glucose (Fig. 4c). All these findings suggest that HIF-1 activation is insufficient for induction of tolerance, and it does not seem to be involved in tolerance. AMPK was examined for possible involvement in tolerance because it is a heterotrimeric serine-threonine protein kinase that is activated under various stress conditions under which the cellular ATP level decreases. The AMPK activity of parental HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells transfected with the control vector pCR3.0 slightly decreased after glucose starvation but increased significantly in response to hypoxia or SNAP even after glucose starvation (Table II). When an antisense RNA expression vector for the α1 or α2 subunit of AMPK was transfected into HepG2 cells (HepG2/α1A cells and HepG2/α2A cells, respectively), the cells grew normally in ordinary DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS but started to die within 24 h in glucose-free medium under normoxia, the same as the parental HepG2 cells (data not shown). As mentioned previously, however, HepG2 cells survive much longer when cultured under 1% O2 conditions. By contrast, HepG2/α1A and HepG2/α2A cells died much sooner than HepG2 cells transfected with control vector pCR3.0 (HepG2/pCR), although the AMPK α2 antisense vector was less effective than α1 (Fig. 5a). Similar reduction of cell survival was observed in HepG2/α1A and HepG2/α2A cells during SNAP-induced tolerance to glucose starvation (data not shown). The basal level of expression of each AMPK α subunit in the respective transfectants was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig.5b), and the expression of each of the respective isoforms in transfectants was found to decrease slightly but significantly. Because it is currently impossible to assay differential AMPK isotype activity, total AMPK activity after glucose starvation at 1% oxygen and during SNAP exposure was determined. Basal activity at the beginning of starvation was slightly lower in HepG2/α1A cells than in HepG2/pCR cells, but after 6 h of glucose starvation, its activity in HepG2/α1A and HepG2/α2A cells was higher than in the HepG2/pCR cells (Table II). When cells were exposed to either hypoxia or SNAP during glucose starvation, AMPK activity was found to be markedly increased in HepG2/pCR and HepG2/α1A cells but to a lesser extent in HepG2/α2A cells during 6 h of starvation. These complicated changes in AMPK activity indicated that AMPK activity assessed by SAMS peptide alone does not explain the mechanisms of prolonged cell survival under hypoxia or SNAP treatment.Table IIAMPK activity of HepG2 cells and AMPK a1 and a2 antisense RNA-transfected cells under various conditionsConditionsHepG2α1Aα2AControl0.090 ± 0.0150.076 ± 0.0112-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.0.082 ± 0.022Hypoxia0.073 ± 0.00990.063 ± 0.00662-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.0.062 ± 0.00402-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.SNAP0.059 ± 0.0054b0.050 ± 0.0110.054 ± 0.0053Glc-0.063 ± 0.0048b0.085 ± 0.0112-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.0.170 ± 0.0592-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.Glc-/hypoxia0.110 ± 0.0035c0.133 ± 0.00662-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.0.132 ± 0.015dGlc-/SNAP0.170 ± 0.018b0.183 ± 0.0140.109 ± 0.0162-aStatistically significant difference from HepG2 cells cultured in DMEM under normoxia.Activity is expressed as nmol of phosphate incorporated per mg of protein/min.

The results of the statistical analyses are shown only for comparisons among HepG2 cells under various conditions and comparisons among three cell lines under the same conditions. PKB/Akt is known to be involved in the cell survival reaction under various stress conditions, and we previously discovered (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar) that PKB/Akt is involved in the tolerance of pancreatic cancer cells to nutrient starvation. In this study we investigated the possibility that PKB/Akt is also involved in the mechanisms of tolerance. PKB/Akt was found to be phosphorylated strongly during glucose starvation, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and the PKB/Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin but not by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the AMPK inhibitor adenosine arabinoside (Fig.6a). These findings strongly suggest that PKB/Akt might be involved in the sensing mechanisms in a PI3-kinase-dependent fashion. Based on the above findings, antisense expression vectors for Akt1 and Akt2 were transfected into HepG2 cells, and as expected, induction of tolerance to glucose starvation was markedly inhibited in the HepG2 cells transfected with the Akt1 antisense expression vector but not in the cells transfected with Akt2 antisense expression vector (Fig. 6b). The amount of total Akt protein expression in both transfectants and the parental HepG2 cells was examined by Western blot analysis, but the amounts had not changed significantly (Fig. 6c). When wild-type sense expression vectors for Akt1 and the constitutive active fragment of AMPK α1 were transfected into HepG2 cells, cell survival during normoxia and glucose starvation was significantly higher, but the effects were only minimal and transient (data not shown). The present work clearly showed that exposure to NO and/or hypoxia clearly conferred tolerance to glucose starvation in both normal and cancer cell lines. This result is paradoxical because it has long been believed that glycolysis is the main mechanism for energy production when oxygen consumption is restricted. Restriction of oxygen consumption can also be achieved with cyanide, which strongly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase. However, cyanide did not confer any protective effect on cell survival during glucose starvation. These findings strongly suggest that hypoxia and/or NO might induce a previously known biological response to an insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply (famine response). HIF-1 is a key molecule in the hypoxia response, and both hypoxia and NO activate HIF-1 (18Kimura H. Weisz A. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. Ogura T. D'Acquisto F. Addeo R. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Blood. 2000; 95: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seemed reasonable to hypothesize that HIF-1 is also a key molecule in the induction of tolerance. However, HIF-1 activation is insufficient to induce tolerance, because CoCl2 and desferrioxamine clearly activated HIF-1 but did not induce tolerance to glucose starvation, and it was not activated effectively during glucose starvation. By contrast, the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside strongly induced tolerance to glucose starvation, but it did not activate HIF-1 at all (20Hashimoto K. Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 290: 263-267Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas methylene blue and LY83583 inhibited HIF-1 activation by NO, but not by hypoxia, they inhibited the induction of tolerance to glucose starvation by both stimuli. 2H. Esumi, K. Izuishi, K. Kato, K. Hashimoto, Y. Kurashima, A. Kishimoto, T. Ogura, and T. Ozawa, unpublished data. These findings support the notion that induction of tolerance is independent of HIF-1 activation, although its dependence on HIF-1 activation cannot be completely ruled out until definitive results are obtained, such as in an experiment using HIF-1 knockout cells. A transforming growth factor β-like signaling pathway through PI3-kinase and PKB/Akt regulates Dauer larva formation in nematodes (21Larsen P.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1567-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dauer larva formation is an adaptive response to harsh conditions that is achieved by changing both the energy metabolism fo the organism and the cell cycle program (21Larsen P.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1567-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gallant J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 393-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The PI3-kinase-PKB/Akt pathway is also a well known tumor survival pathway (23Rouault J.P. Kuwabara P.E. Sinilnikova O.M. Duret L. Thierry-Mieg D. Billaud M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When activation of PKB/Akt was examined, it was found to be activated by glucose starvation, and similar activation was found when amino acids were withdrawn (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the PKB/Akt pathway might be involved in the mechanism that senses the state of nutrient availability. Although wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, had no effect on cell survival during glucose starvation, the antisense RNA expression vector for Akt1 partially but significantly inhibited tolerance induction, suggesting that Akt may modulate the induction of tolerance instead of being involved in it directly. The reason the total amount of Akt did not change significantly after transfecting antisense RNA expression vectors remains unknown, but it may be due to the inability to differentiate two isoforms, as shown by Western blot. Interaction between the regulation of Akt1 and Akt2 is another possibility. The results of this study clearly show that AMPK is involved in the induction of tolerance to glucose starvation, but how it is involved is not yet clear. Because AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses, the AMPK pathway may be the primary sensor of hypoxia and glucose starvation and mediate subsequent responses (24Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Actually, the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside has been found to strongly induce tolerance to glucose starvation in an AMPK α2-dependent manner (20Hashimoto K. Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 290: 263-267Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There was an obvious contradiction. When AMPK activity was examined with GST-SAMS fusion protein as a substrate, it was found to be decreased in HepG2/α1A cells but not in HepG2/α2A cells, although the amount of AMPK α subunit protein was decreased in each of the respective antisense-transfected cells. At present, there is no method for differentially determining the enzymatic activity of each isozyme composed of the α1 and α2 and β and γ isoforms, and this limitation might be the source of the apparent contradiction. There may also be interactions between α1 and α2 expression under various stress conditions. A new member of the AMPK family, SNARK, that has kinase activity against SAMS peptide has recently been identified, and its activity may be another reason for the apparent contradiction (25Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Sharma M. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is also not known whether there is interaction or cross-talk between the Akt and AMPK pathways, but both share targets, including glucose synthetase, glucose transporter, and amino acid transporters (6Warshaw A.L. Fernandez-del Castillo C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). In the present study we tested the possibility that AMPK might be responsible for the phosphorylation of Akt with an AMPK inhibitor, adenosine arabinoside, but it had no effect on Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that AMPK is not upstream of Akt activation during nutrient starvation. The present study showed that the tolerance to glucose starvation was dependent on amino acids. Some tumors are known to utilize glutamine for energy production better than glucose (8Kovacevic Z. McGivan J.D. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 547-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and this seems to be consistent with our findings. However, because the biochemical mechanisms for energy production from amino acids were analyzed mostly during normoxia, how energy is produced from amino acids under hypoxia remains to be elucidated. Aspartic acid was reported recently (26Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Roeser N.F. Nissim I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to be protective of renal tubules subjected to ischemia, and the biochemical mechanisms for this effect was suggested to be anaerobic respiration in which fumarate is reduced to succinate. Our own findings may be related to this observation, but further biochemical investigation is needed. Another important question involves the source of the amino acids when the blood supply is restricted in vivo. Autophagy is one of the best known biological responses to starvation, and many organisms survive nutrient starvation by degrading their own constituents (27Grinde B. Experientia (Basel). 1985; 41: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We recently found that exposing cells to NO or nutrient starvation up-regulates some matrix metalloproteinases. 3Y. Ishii, T. Ogura, F. Ohtsuka, and H. Esumi, submitted for publication. The notion that degradation of the extracellular matrix supplies amino acids to cancer cells for energy production is an interesting hypothesis. The present findings are still preliminary, but they are quite important from both a biological and medical viewpoint. Once the mechanisms for induction of tolerance (austerity) are elucidated, they will open a new field of research in regard to the prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. Tolerance to nutrient starvation might be part of the biological response to an insufficient blood supply, and in the future it might be possible to include it in the so-called hypoxia response, but to avoid confusion it might be wise to call it a “famine (extreme poverty) response” for the time being. It is also possible that the tolerance to nutrient starvation is not restricted to glucose and that the tolerance can be referred to as “austerity,” which might cover energy production, energy consumption, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation."

It is believed that caveolin-2 is an “accessory protein” that functions in conjunction with caveolin-1. At the level of the ER, caveolin-2 interacts with caveolin-1 to form a high molecular mass hetero-oligomeric complex that is targeted to lipid rafts and drives the formation of caveolae. However, caveolin-2 is not required for caveolae formation, implying that it may fulfill some unknown regulatory role. Here, we present the first evidence that caveolin-2 is a phosphoprotein. We show that caveolin-2 undergoes Src-induced phosphorylation on tyrosine 19. To study this phosphorylation event in vivo, we generated a novel phospho-specific antibody probe that only recognizes phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19). We then used NIH-3T3 cells stably overexpressing c-Src to examine the localization and biochemical properties of phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19). Our results indicate that phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) is localized near focal adhesions, remains associated with lipid rafts/caveolae, but no longer forms a high molecular mass hetero-oligomer with caveolin-1. Instead, phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) behaves as a monomer/dimer in velocity gradients. Thus, we conclude that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) may function as a signal that is recognized by the cellular machinery to induce the dissociation of caveolin-2 from caveolin-1 oligomers. We also demonstrate that (i) insulin-stimulation of adipocytes and (ii) integrin ligation of endothelial cells can both induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19). During integrin ligation, phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) co-localizes with activated FAK at focal adhesions. Thus, phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) may function as a docking site for Src homology domain-2 (SH2) domain containing proteins during signal transduction. In support of this notion, we identify several SH2 domain containing proteins, namely c-Src, NCK, and Ras-GAP, that interact with caveolin-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that caveolin-2 and Ras-GAP are constitutively associated in c-Src expressing NIH-3T3 cells, but not in untransfected NIH-3T3 cells.

One known function for tyrosine phosphorylation is to confer docking sites for Src homology domain-2 (SH2)-containing proteins. Numerous downstream signaling molecules possessing either intrinsic kinase activity or an adapter function are then recruited to the plasma membrane and utilize their SH2 domains to form hetero-oligomeric signaling complexes with activated RTKs. Numerous RTKs, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and insulin receptor (Ins-R), as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs; Src-family tyrosine kinases) are now known to be concentrated within specialized plasma membrane-associated microdomains, known as lipid rafts and caveolae. It is believed that lipid rafts/caveolae serve as integrated platforms to recruit and concentrate signaling molecules, allowing them to form preassembled complexes. Caveolins, a family of 21–24-kDa integral membrane proteins, are known to play an active role in this process by directly interacting with and modulating the activity of many of these signaling molecules. The caveolin gene family consists of caveolin-1, -2, and -3 (1Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P.

Caveolin-1 and -2 are co-expressed in most cell types and tightly interact with each other to form a high molecular mass hetero-oligomeric complex. In contrast, the expression of caveolin-3 is muscle-specific, and it forms a high molecular mass homo-oligomeric complex (4Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J.

Caveolin-2 is 38% identical and 56% similar to caveolin-1, being the most divergent member of the caveolin gene family (7Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Unlike caveolin-1 and -3, caveolin-2 does not have the capacity to form caveolae by itself. In Cav-1(−/−) cells, caveolin-2 is retained intracellularly at the level of the Golgi complex where it undergoes proteasomal degradation (8Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G., Li, M. Pestell R.G., Di Vizio D. Hou H., Jr. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, caveolin-2 is considered to be an accessory protein for caveolin-1. Historically, caveolin-1 was first identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (9Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). By using microsequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that tyrosine 14 is the principal site for Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (10Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 14 and its flanking region closely resembles the known recognition motifs for tyrosine kinases (KYVDSEGHLpY: (R/K/Q)X2–4(D/E)X2–3pY); therefore, we speculated that phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14) might have a functional role in signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we generated and characterized a novel phospho-specific mAb probe that selectively recognizes phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14). Using this phospho-specific mAb, we and others have now shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 also occurs in normal cells, but in a tightly regulated fashion. For example, EGF, insulin, and integrin ligation, as well as osmotic shock, all have been shown to induce the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 (11–13). Moreover, phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14) directly binds to the SH2 domain-containing protein Grb7, thereby augmenting both anchorage-independent growth and EGF-stimulated cell migration (12Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physical association of caveolin-2 with caveolin-1 raises the possibility that caveolin-2 may also be a cellular target for tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases. Several indirect lines of evidence support this hypothesis as: (i) caveolin-2 forms a high molecular mass hetero-oligomer through a direct interaction with caveolin-1, and (ii) like caveolin-1, the caveolin-2 protein sequence contains a highly conserved motif for recognition by tyrosine kinases at its extreme N terminus (centered around tyrosine 19;QLFMADDApY). Therefore, we speculated that caveolin-2 might be phosphorylated by Src family kinases, thus contributing to the recruitment of signaling molecules to the cytoplasmic face of lipid rafts/caveolae microdomains. The cDNAs for caveolin-1, -2, and -3 subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based vector, pCB7, were as we described previously (4Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J.

A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially: fibronectin (Sigma; S-5171), poly-l-lysine (Sigma; P-1274), insulin (Sigma; St. Louis, MO), donor bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences), fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), prestained protein markers (Invitrogen), and Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). A polyclonal antibody to phosphocaveolin-2 (Tyr(P)19) was generated by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated murine caveolin-2 peptide (residues 14–25; MADDA(pY)SHHSGC). This sequence is extremely similar in human caveolin-2 (MDDDSYSHHSGL), but is completely divergent in human and mouse caveolin-1. IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography. Briefly, a synthetic phospho-peptide was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a free C-terminal cysteine residue. New Zealand White rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously with 200 μg of immunogen and adjuvant on weeks 0, 4, 8, and 10. Anti-sera were collected on weeks 6, 10, and 12 and pooled for total IgG isolation. Specific IgGs were differentially purified by affinity chromatography against their respective phospho- and non-phosphopeptides coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). Normal NIH 3T3 cells and NIH 3T3 stably expressing c-Src cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 10% donor calf serum (17Koleske A.J.

A construct encoding C-terminally Myc-tagged murine caveolin-2 (Y19A) was generated by PCR mutagenesis using mutated oligonucleotides. These constructs (∼400 ng) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells alone or in combination with c-Src, using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were scraped into boiling sample buffer. Recombinant expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide)/Western blotting. Caveolin-2 was detected using anti-caveolin-2 IgG (mAb 65) that recognizes full-length caveolin-2 (4Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E.

Also, Myc epitope-tagged forms of murine caveolin-2 (WT and the (Y19A) mutant) were detected using the monoclonal antibody, 9E10, that recognizes the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with caveolin-2 (WT) or caveolin-2 (Y19A), alone or in combination with c-Src (WT). Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were processed for immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (AmershamBiosciences). Briefly, cells were lysed in IP buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside with phosphatase inhibitor (50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were precleared by addition of 50 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose in TNET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 30 min at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 s at 15,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added together with anti-Myc IgG (A-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; a rabbit pAb). Samples were then incubated for an additional 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with IP buffer, and samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with a well characterized mAb directed against phosphotyrosine (PY20; BD Transduction Laboratories). For insulin stimulation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 8) were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. Insulin (150 nm) was then added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were collected and processed for SDS-PAGE/Western blot. For the integrin ligation experiments, HMECs were grown to ∼70% confluence and then incubated in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were then trypsinized, collected in serum-free media, and re-seeded onto fibronectin (100 μg/ml) or poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) precoated coverslips. After seeding, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. All reactions were performed at room temperature. NIH 3T3 cells (untransfected or stably expressing c-Src) were briefly washed three times with PBS and fixed for 45 min in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS, 10 min each. Cells were then incubated with PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin containing: (i) a 1:200 dilution of anti-phosphocaveolin-2 IgG (pAb) and anti-caveolin-2 IgG (mAb 65) and (ii) lissamine rhodamine B sulfonylchloride-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml). The primary antibody incubation was for 60 min, and the secondary antibody incubation was for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS between incubations. Slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent and observed under CCD camera. Other double labeling experiments were carried out in a similar fashion. Using an Olympus IX80 microscope with a 60× Plan Neofluar objective and a Photometrics cooled CCD camera with a 35-mm shutter, the images were acquired and processed using IP Lab on a Power Mac 8500. For each sample, three to five two-dimensional images were acquired, deconvolved, and then combined into one image. Cells were lysed in boiling sample buffer (21Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Samples were then collected and boiled for a total of 5 min. Samples were sonicated briefly. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm). Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (∼500-fold diluted in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (∼5,000-fold diluted). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). For the peptide competition assay, peptides stocks were prepared in Me2SO. Each peptide (∼100 μg/ml; a 100-fold molar excess of peptide) was mixed with the primary antibody solution prior to Western blotting. See Fig. 3A for a detailed description of the competing peptides that were used.

While guanidino-methylated arginines (MA) including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG-methyl-l-arginine (NMA) are potent competitive inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and are released upon protein degradation, it is unknown whether their intracellular concentrations are sufficient to critically regulate neuronal NO production and secondary cellular function or injury. Therefore, we determine the intrinsic neuronal MA concentrations and their effects on neuronal NOS function and excitotoxic injury. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the Km for l-arginine is 2.38 μm with a Vmax of 0.229 μmol mg−1 min−1, whileKi values of 0.67 μm and 0.50 μm were determined for ADMA and NMA, respectively.

While these MA are known to inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS) at pharmacological concentrations, questions remain regarding whether they have significant effects at their intrinsic cellular concentrations.

In addition, data demonstrating the importance of ADMA in disease pathophysiology are correlative, and there is no direct evidence that these arginine analogues modulate in vivo NO generation and NOS function.NO is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger synthesized from the guanidino group of l-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. It is involved in the control of vascular tone and blood pressure, platelet function, neurotransmission, and host defense. In neurons, the NOS concentration and activity is relatively high, and these cells are particularly sensitive to NO-mediated injury through excitotoxicity and other diseases (9Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M.

Nature. 1993; 364: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of NO in the nervous system, there has been a lack of knowledge regarding the intracellular concentration of MA with no prior measurements in neurons. It is unknown if significant MA formation occurs in neurons and, in particular, if the levels of the critical NOS inhibiting MA, NMA, or ADMA are sufficient to modulate NO production from nNOS.ADMA and NMA are endogenously derived from the proteolysis of methylated arginine residues on various proteins (4Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The methylation is carried out by a group of enzymes referred to as protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). Subsequent proteolysis of proteins containing methylarginine groups leads to the release of free methylarginine into the cytoplasm. Plasma NMA and ADMA enter the cell through the y+ cationic amino acid transporter, and these methylarginines compete with each other as well as withl-arginine for transport. It has been reported that plasma concentrations of ADMA and NMA are in the range of 0.5–1 μm (4Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, the levels of ADMA and NMA in neuronal tissue are not known. Interestingly, it is known that myelin basic protein, which is highly expressed in neuronal tissue, is a principal target of the PRMT 2 isoform. In addition to the substrate specificity of PRMT 2, it also has specificity in its catalytic activity, with this myelin basic protein specific enzyme preferentially catalyzing the formation of NMA (4Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). With this in mind, one might postulate that nervous tissue may have relatively high levels of NMA in addition to levels of ADMA also found in other tissues. Despite the apparent bioavailability of these inhibitors, little is known regarding their endogenous regulation of nNOS (11Faraci F.M. Brian J.E. Heistad D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1522-H1527PubMed Google Scholar, 12Das I. Khan N.S. Puri B.K. Hirsch S.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 215: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Questions also remain regarding the exact extent of concentration-dependent inhibition of NOS by MA. Considering the importance of NO in neuronal signaling and, when present in excess as a mediator of brain injury, it is of great importance to determine the levels of methylarginines and how they regulate neuronal NOS function.To address these questions, we determine the concentrations ofl-arginine and MA in brain tissue and in neurons. From measurements of initial rates of NO formation, the kinetic parameters of substrate-dependent NO formation and its inhibition by NMA and ADMA are determined. The dose-dependent effects of MA on the inhibition of nNOS are characterized with measurements of the NOS products NO and l-citrulline. Both in isolated enzyme preparations and in primary cultured neurons it is determined that endogenous MA critically modulate the function of NOS. This regulation is shown to be of critical importance in preventing NO-mediated neuronal injury.DISCUSSIONWhile NO is formed in neurons and is a critical mediator of neuronal signaling, at high levels it can induce neuronal injury. It is well known that NO is synthesized by thel-arginine-dependent enzyme nNOS; however, questions remain regarding the processes that regulate the activity of this critical enzyme. While methylarginines can exert competitive inhibition of the NOS isoforms, it was unknown if the levels of the endogenous MA, NMA, and ADMA are sufficient to exert inhibition of nNOS and if the levels of these compounds regulate NO formation from NOS and protect against neuronal injury. Therefore, in the current study we measured the levels of MA in the brain and in neuronal cells and then determined the effects of these levels on nNOS function. We directly measured the dose-dependent inhibition of NO formation from nNOS by NMA and ADMA and in kinetic studies and determined theKi value of each of these inhibitors enabling the prediction of the extent of inhibition for any level of inhibitor. Furthermore, we observe in neurons that the intrinsic levels of MA modulate NO production and prevent excitotoxic injury.With a novel method for measuring MA levels based on electrochemical detection using anion exchange chromatography of derivatized amino acids the intracellular concentrations of l-arginine and MA were determined in cerebellar granule neurons and brain tissue. Significant MA concentrations were detected with values of 10 μm for NMA and 5 μm for ADMA withl-arginine levels of 90 μm in neurons with similar levels in brain (Fig. 1). When cultured neurons were pretreated with the PRMT inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine, more than a 2-fold decrease in NMA and ADMA levels was observed (Fig. 1). These results provide the first demonstration that neuronal cells have significant concentrations of endogenous MA, and these levels can be modulated by regulation of PRMT.To be able to predict the effect of any given l-arginine level and ADMA or NMMA level on NO production from nNOS, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and the effects of these MA NOS inhibitors were determined. Although the Vmax andKm of nNOS have been determined by several groups, questions still remain regarding the apparent Kivalues for the MA NOS inhibitors. While there is prior agreement that MA are competitive NOS inhibitors, there is controversy regarding theKi with over 10-fold variation in prior values reported in the literature for NMMA that range from 0.4 to 6.2 μm, and there is little data available regarding ADMA (22Tsikas D. Boger R.H. Sandmann J. Bode-Boger S.M. Frolich J.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Reif D.W. McCreedy S.A. Arch. Biochem.

Commun. 1991; 177: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed measurements of the initial rates of NO formation from nNOS as a function of l-arginine and ADMA or NMA levels. The Km value forl-arginine was determined to be 2.38 μm with a Vmax of 0.229 μmol mg−1min−1 (Fig. 2A), while Kivalues of 0.67 μm and 0.50 μm were determined for the inhibitors ADMA and NMA, respectively (Fig. 2,B–C).EPR measurements of 15NO formation from 15N guanidino l-arginine were performed to further elucidate the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of NMA or ADMA on NO production from nNOS and to determine whether the endogenous MA levels are sufficient to exert sustained inhibition of NO production. While from the Ki values measured it would be predicted that there would be inhibition of initial rates, in view of the controversy over the physiological effects of these intrinsic inhibitors, it is critically important to determine whether this effect is sustained over time. Since NOS is regulated by feedback inhibition secondary to NO binding to the heme and this process could be altered by the methylarginines that bind in proximity to the heme, it is essential to perform a definitive measurement of NO formation over time. Both NMA and ADMA exhibited prominent dose-dependent inhibition of NO formation from nNOS in the presence of cellularl-arginine levels, and this inhibition was sustained over time. NMA and ADMA exerted partial inhibition of NO production at 10 μm concentration, with almost complete inhibition at 100 μm (Fig. 3). To precisely determine the effects of the physiological levels of methylarginines and l-arginine on nNOS-mediated NO generation, experiments were performed in the presence of the physiological MA levels. Both ADMA and NMA inhibited the rate and total production of NO from the enzyme (Fig. 4, A–B). When present together, the physiological ADMA and NMA levels inhibited NO production by greater than 50%. This indicates that under basal conditions these endogenous methylarginines exert an important inhibitory influence on NO production in neurons. To confirm these observations and rule out any possible alteration or perturbation caused by trapping NO by either hemoglobin or the EPR spin trap Fe-MGD, these observations were further confirmed with measurements of the formation of the NOS product l-citrulline, where again >50% inhibition was seen in the presence of the physiological levels of both inhibitors (Fig 4C). Thus, it was observed that endogenous levels of MA exert prominent inhibition of nNOS function and that this inhibition is sustained over time.The levels of endogenous methylarginines present in neurons were thus shown to be sufficient to modulate the function of nNOS. In addition to the experiments with purified nNOS, we sought to determine whether these inhibitory actions of ADMA and NMA could be observed in primary neuronal cells. Exposure of cerebellar granule cells to NMDA has been shown to generate NO resulting in cellular injury (9Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). We observed that pretreatment with ADMA or NMA decreases NO production and ameliorates NO-mediated injury. Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with SAHC, a PRMT inhibitor, resulted in depletion of intracellular MA with increased NO production and increased cell injury following NMDA exposure. Taken together these results demonstrate that the endogenous MA pool is capable of modulating NO production and may play a critical role in regulating NOS function.Because of the prominent inhibition that ADMA and NMA offer and the potential for these concentrations to further rise following cellular injury with proteolysis, it will be important to study their involvement in a variety of pathological conditions associated with nNOS activation. In addition to regulating basal NO production, these endogenous NOS inhibitors may also provide a critical feedback mechanism to protect the brain against a vicious cycle whereby excess NOS activation and NO production from injured neurons would otherwise lead to uncontrolled expanded injury of neighboring neurons. Since pharmacological modulation of NMA and ADMA production by SAHC resulted in a prominent change in NO production and secondary cytotoxicity, therapeutic agents that target the production and metabolism of these endogenous inhibitors would be expected to be particularly useful in modulating neuronal function and protecting against neuronal injury.The data presented suggests that PRMT may play a critical role in modulating NO production through its regulation of the methylarginine pool. This may be of significant importance when considering pathological conditions, such as stroke, where excess NO production is involved. In fact, it has recently been shown that following ischemic injury in the urethra, MA levels are raised with subsequent impairment of smooth muscle relaxation resulting from MA-mediated NOS inhibition (28Masuda H. Tsujii T. Okuno T. Kihara K. Goto M. Azuma H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This MA regulatory cascade may represent a novel pathway whereby the cell can suppress excess NO production and minimize NO-mediated cellular injury. However, one must also consider the role of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of MA, in controlling MA bioavailability. DDAH catalyzes the conversion of both NMA and ADMA tol-citrulline. DDAH has been shown to be expressed in neuronal tissue and may play an important role in regulating NOS function through its effects on MA. It has been reported that two isoforms of DDAH exist (DDAH I and DDAH II) in human tissues, it appears that DDAH I predominates in tissues expressing nNOS while DDAH II is observed in eNOS-expressing tissues (4Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).In conclusion, these results provide the first direct evidence regarding the importance of MA levels in the brain and their involvement as modulators of NOS function and NO production under both normal and pathological conditions. These results also demonstrate the need for future studies, to address how the MA regulatory enzymes, DDAH and PRMT, function to regulate intrinsic MA levels under both normal and pathological conditions. The biological significance of guanidino-methylated arginine derivatives (MA)1 has been known since the inhibitory actions of NG-methyl-l-arginine (NMA) on macrophage-induced cytotoxicity were first demonstrated (1Hibbs J.B.

NMA and ADMA exerted partial inhibition of NO production at 10 μm concentration, with almost complete inhibition at 100 μm (Fig. 3). To precisely determine the effects of the physiological levels of methylarginines and l-arginine on nNOS-mediated NO generation, experiments were performed in the presence of the physiological MA levels. Both ADMA and NMA inhibited the rate and total production of NO from the enzyme (Fig. 4, A–B). When present together, the physiological ADMA and NMA levels inhibited NO production by greater than 50%. This indicates that under basal conditions these endogenous methylarginines exert an important inhibitory influence on NO production in neurons. To confirm these observations and rule out any possible alteration or perturbation caused by trapping NO by either hemoglobin or the EPR spin trap Fe-MGD, these observations were further confirmed with measurements of the formation of the NOS product l-citrulline, where again >50% inhibition was seen in the presence of the physiological levels of both inhibitors (Fig 4C). Thus, it was observed that endogenous levels of MA exert prominent inhibition of nNOS function and that this inhibition is sustained over time.The levels of endogenous methylarginines present in neurons were thus shown to be sufficient to modulate the function of nNOS. In addition to the experiments with purified nNOS, we sought to determine whether these inhibitory actions of ADMA and NMA could be observed in primary neuronal cells. Exposure of cerebellar granule cells to NMDA has been shown to generate NO resulting in cellular injury (9Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). We observed that pretreatment with ADMA or NMA decreases NO production and ameliorates NO-mediated injury. Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with SAHC, a PRMT inhibitor, resulted in depletion of intracellular MA with increased NO production and increased cell injury following NMDA exposure. Taken together these results demonstrate that the endogenous MA pool is capable of modulating NO production and may play a critical role in regulating NOS function.Because of the prominent inhibition that ADMA and NMA offer and the potential for these concentrations to further rise following cellular injury with proteolysis, it will be important to study their involvement in a variety of pathological conditions associated with nNOS activation. In addition to regulating basal NO production, these endogenous NOS inhibitors may also provide a critical feedback mechanism to protect the brain against a vicious cycle whereby excess NOS activation and NO production from injured neurons would otherwise lead to uncontrolled expanded injury of neighboring neurons. Since pharmacological modulation of NMA and ADMA production by SAHC resulted in a prominent change in NO production and secondary cytotoxicity, therapeutic agents that target the production and metabolism of these endogenous inhibitors would be expected to be particularly useful in modulating neuronal function and protecting against neuronal injury.The data presented suggests that PRMT may play a critical role in modulating NO production through its regulation of the methylarginine pool. This may be of significant importance when considering pathological conditions, such as stroke, where excess NO production is involved. In fact, it has recently been shown that following ischemic injury in the urethra, MA levels are raised with subsequent impairment of smooth muscle relaxation resulting from MA-mediated NOS inhibition (28Masuda H. Tsujii T. Okuno T. Kihara K. Goto M. Azuma H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This MA regulatory cascade may represent a novel pathway whereby the cell can suppress excess NO production and minimize NO-mediated cellular injury. However, one must also consider the role of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of MA, in controlling MA bioavailability. DDAH catalyzes the conversion of both NMA and ADMA tol-citrulline. DDAH has been shown to be expressed in neuronal tissue and may play an important role in regulating NOS function through its effects on MA. It has been reported that two isoforms of DDAH exist (DDAH I and DDAH II) in human tissues, it appears that DDAH I predominates in tissues expressing nNOS while DDAH II is observed in eNOS-expressing tissues (4Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).In conclusion, these results provide the first direct evidence regarding the importance of MA levels in the brain and their involvement as modulators of NOS function and NO production under both normal and pathological conditions. These results also demonstrate the need for future studies, to address how the MA regulatory enzymes, DDAH and PRMT, function to regulate intrinsic MA levels under both normal and pathological conditions. While NO is formed in neurons and is a critical mediator of neuronal signaling, at high levels it can induce neuronal injury. It is well known that NO is synthesized by thel-arginine-dependent enzyme nNOS; however, questions remain regarding the processes that regulate the activity of this critical enzyme. While methylarginines can exert competitive inhibition of the NOS isoforms, it was unknown if the levels of the endogenous MA, NMA, and ADMA are sufficient to exert inhibition of nNOS and if the levels of these compounds regulate NO formation from NOS and protect against neuronal injury. Therefore, in the current study we measured the levels of MA in the brain and in neuronal cells and then determined the effects of these levels on nNOS function. We directly measured the dose-dependent inhibition of NO formation from nNOS by NMA and ADMA and in kinetic studies and determined theKi value of each of these inhibitors enabling the prediction of the extent of inhibition for any level of inhibitor. Furthermore, we observe in neurons that the intrinsic levels of MA modulate NO production and prevent excitotoxic injury. With a novel method for measuring MA levels based on electrochemical detection using anion exchange chromatography of derivatized amino acids the intracellular concentrations of l-arginine and MA were determined in cerebellar granule neurons and brain tissue. Significant MA concentrations were detected with values of 10 μm for NMA and 5 μm for ADMA withl-arginine levels of 90 μm in neurons with similar levels in brain (Fig. 1). When cultured neurons were pretreated with the PRMT inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine, more than a 2-fold decrease in NMA and ADMA levels was observed (Fig. 1). These results provide the first demonstration that neuronal cells have significant concentrations of endogenous MA, and these levels can be modulated by regulation of PRMT. To be able to predict the effect of any given l-arginine level and ADMA or NMMA level on NO production from nNOS, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and the effects of these MA NOS inhibitors were determined. Although the Vmax andKm of nNOS have been determined by several groups, questions still remain regarding the apparent Kivalues for the MA NOS inhibitors. While there is prior agreement that MA are competitive NOS inhibitors, there is controversy regarding theKi with over 10-fold variation in prior values reported in the literature for NMMA that range from 0.4 to 6.2 μm, and there is little data available regarding ADMA (22Tsikas D. Boger R.H. Sandmann J. Bode-Boger S.M. Frolich J.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Reif D.W. McCreedy S.A. Arch. Biochem.

Commun. 1991; 177: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed measurements of the initial rates of NO formation from nNOS as a function of l-arginine and ADMA or NMA levels. The Km value forl-arginine was determined to be 2.38 μm with a Vmax of 0.229 μmol mg−1min−1 (Fig. 2A), while Kivalues of 0.67 μm and 0.50 μm were determined for the inhibitors ADMA and NMA, respectively (Fig. 2,B–C). EPR measurements of 15NO formation from 15N guanidino l-arginine were performed to further elucidate the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of NMA or ADMA on NO production from nNOS and to determine whether the endogenous MA levels are sufficient to exert sustained inhibition of NO production. While from the Ki values measured it would be predicted that there would be inhibition of initial rates, in view of the controversy over the physiological effects of these intrinsic inhibitors, it is critically important to determine whether this effect is sustained over time. Since NOS is regulated by feedback inhibition secondary to NO binding to the heme and this process could be altered by the methylarginines that bind in proximity to the heme, it is essential to perform a definitive measurement of NO formation over time. Both NMA and ADMA exhibited prominent dose-dependent inhibition of NO formation from nNOS in the presence of cellularl-arginine levels, and this inhibition was sustained over time.

PKK contains N-terminal kinase and C-terminal ankyrin repeats domains linked to an intermediate region. Here we report that the kinase domain of PKK is highly homologous to that of two mediators of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, RICK and RIP, but these related kinases have different C-terminal domains for binding to upstream factors. We find that expression of PKK, like RICK and RIP, induces NF-κB activation. Mutational analysis revealed that the kinase domain of PKK is essential for NF-κB activation, whereas replacement of serine residues in the putative activation loop did not affect the ability of PKK to activate NF-κB. A catalytic inactive PKK mutant inhibited NF-κB activation induced by phorbol ester and Ca2+-ionophore, but it did not block that mediated by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, or Nod1. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by dominant negative PKK was reverted by co-expression of PKCβI, suggesting a functional association between PKK and PKCβI. PKK-mediated NF-κB activation required IKKα and IKKβ but not IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Moreover, NF-κB activation induced by PKK was not inhibited by dominant negative Bimp1 and proceeded in the absence of Bcl10, two components of a recently described PKC signaling pathway. These results suggest that PKK is a member of the RICK/RIP family of kinases, which is involved in a PKC-activated NF-κB signaling pathway that is independent of Bcl10 and IKKγ.

We report here that PKK is highly homologous to RIP and RICK. Expression of PKK induces the activation of NF-κB, and this activity requires the kinase domain. We also provide evidence that PKK mediates the NF-κB activation induced by phorbol ester and Ca2+-ionophore and specifically by PKCβI.

Briefly, Rat1 fibroblasts, its derivative 5R cell line, MEFs, as well as HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 33 ng of the reporter construct pBVIx-Luc plus indicated amounts of each expression plasmid and 330 ng of pEF-BOS-β-gal in triplicate as described (8Inohara N.

The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 vector such that it was constant within each individual experiment. 24 h post-transfection cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured as described (8Inohara N.

Results were normalized for transfection efficiency with values obtained with pEF-BOS-β-gal. To identify novel RICK-like molecules, public protein and nucleotide databases were searched for homologous proteins using the entire human RICK sequence (9Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As expected, we identified RIP (E values: 4 × 10−29 and 3 × 10−29 for human and mouse RIP, respectively) and its homologue RIP3 (E values: 1 × 10−31 and 5 × 10−30 for human and mouse RIP3, respectively) as molecules with significant homology to RICK (Fig.1). In addition the search identified PKK, a kinase of unknown function, as the most homologous protein to RICK in available databases (E = 4 × 10−51 for mouse PKK and 4 × 10−50 for human PKK). We also identified zebrafish orthologues of PKK and RICK. The domain structure of the fish PKK and RICK was identical to that of their mammalian orthologues (Fig. 1A). Significantly, zebrafish PKK was more homologous to human RICK (E = 5 × 10−50) than human RICK to human RIP or RIP3 (Fig. 1B). As expected from the homology between RICK and RIP, PKK also exhibited significant similarity to RIP (E = 4 × 10−31) and RIP3 (E = 5 × 10−32 and 3 × 10−30for human and mouse, respectively) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that PKK is a novel member of the RICK/RIP family of kinases. Further analysis of protein sequences revealed that the homology between PKK and RICK-related kinases was restricted to their kinase domains in that no significant similarity was identified in the IM and C-terminal domains. Consistent with these findings, RICK and RIP have C-terminal CARD and DD, respectively, whereas PKK contains 11 ankyrin repeats in its C terminus (Fig. 1A). The IM region of RICK and RIP is serine/threonine rich and essential for the interaction with IKKγ and NF-κB-inducing activity (8Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y.

Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IM region of PKK was also serine/threonine rich, but it did not exhibit any significant amino acid homology to that of RICK and RIP. Given the amino acid and structural homology between PKK and RICK-related kinases, we first tested whether expression of PKK activates NF-κB. Transfection of the wild-type (WT) PKK cDNA into HEK293T cells induced activation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner as measured with a reporter luciferase construct (Fig.2A). The induction of NF-κB by PKK was specific in that transfection of the PKK cDNA did not induce transactivation of NF-AT, NF-IL6, p53, IRF-1, and class II MHC-dependent promoters (Fig. 2B). In control experiments the transcriptional activity of the reporter constructs was stimulated by expression of proteins known to induce their activation (Fig. 2B). We also found that expression of PKK induced significant activation of AP-1 (Fig. 2B) as did expression of MEKK1, a known activator of AP-1 (26Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify the domains of PKK that are required for NF-κB activation, a series of deletion mutants carrying each domain alone or in combination were constructed (Fig.3A). Expression of PKK mutants containing the kinase domain resulted in NF-κB activation, whereas mutants containing the IM region and/or ankyrin repeats-containing domain (ARD) alone were inactive (Fig. 3C). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the lack of activity of the mutants could not be explained by different expression levels of the mutant proteins (Fig.3C, inset). Thus, the kinase domain of PKK is necessary and sufficient for NF-κB activation, suggesting that the catalytic region acts as an effector domain in PKK signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, replacement of the conserved aspartate residue (D143) in the catalytic site for alanine rendered PKK inactive (Fig.3C). Human and mouse PKK contain a SXXXS motif (SHDLS) at positions 173–177 in their putative activation loops (Fig.3B). The corresponding serine residues of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinases and IKKs are often phosphorylated by other serine protein kinases, resulting in kinase transactivation (30Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 31Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Substitution of the conserved serine residues S173 and S177 as well as S171 for alanine did not alter the ability of PKK to induce NF-κB when compared with the wild-type kinase (Fig. 3C). Similarly, replacement of S171, S173, and S177 for glutamic acid residues, which are associated with constitutive activation of serine-threonine kinases, did not enhance the ability of PKK to induce NF-κB (Fig. 3C). Close inspection of zebrafish PKK revealed that the fish kinase lacks serines at positions 171 and 173 and tyrosine residues in its putative activation loop (Fig.3B). This finding indicates that the canonical motif in the activation loop of kinases is not evolutionarily conserved in PKK. Together, these observations suggest that the ability of PKK to activate NF-κB is not regulated by phosphorylation of its putative activation loop. PKK is known to interact with PKCβI, suggesting that these proteins may function in a common signaling pathway (14Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that Bimp1, Bcl10, and MALT1 are components of a receptor-mediated signaling pathway that links PKC activation to NF-κB induction (17McAllister-Lucas L.M. Inohara N. Lucas P.C. Ruland J. Benito A., Li, Q. Chen S. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Verma I.M. Mak T.W. Núñez G. J. Biol.

Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether PKK regulates an NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by Bimp1, Bcl10, and MALT1 in HEK293T cells that are known to express endogenous PKK (15Bähr C. Rohwer A. Stempka L. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36350-36357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Treatment of HEK293T cells with PMA/Ca2+-ionophore induced NF-κB activation, which was inhibited by the PKK mutant carrying an alanine substitution at the catalytic aspartate residue (D143A) (Fig.4A). The inhibitory effect was specific in that expression of PKK D143A did not block NF-κB activation induced by Bimp1, Bcl10, oligomerized MALT1, TNFα (Fig.4A), IL-1β, or Nod1. 2A. Muto, N. Inohara, and G. Núñez, unpublished results. Additional control experiments shown in Fig. 4A revealed that activation of NF-κB induced by PKK, Bimp1, Bcl10, activated MALT1, PMA/Ca2+-ionophore, or TNFα could be inhibited by a dominant interfering form of IKKβ but not by that of MyD88, an essential mediator of IL-1/Toll receptor signaling (32Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W., Li, S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Because PKK associates with PKCβI (14Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we tested if the PKK D143A mutant inhibits PMA-induced NF-κB activation through a functional interaction with PKCβI. Expression of PKCβI reverted the effect of the PKK D143A mutant, whereas a kinase negative mutant of PKCβI (K371M) and PKCε did not (Fig. 4B). The mechanism by which PKCβI reverts the dominant negative effect of the PKK mutant is unclear. A possible explanation is that overexpressed catalytically active PKCβI competes out dominant negative PKK for cellular factor(s) necessary for function. The selective effect of PKCβI is consistent with the observation that PKK interacts with PKCβI (14Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but not with PKCε. 2A. Muto, N. Inohara, and G. Núñez, unpublished results. In addition, activation of AP-1 induced by PMA/Ca2+-ionophore was specifically inhibited by PKK dominant negative (Fig.4C), suggesting that PKK also acts in a PMA-induced AP-1 signaling pathway activated by PKCβI. NF-κB activation by RICK and RIP is mediated by the IKK complex, a universal regulator that phosphorylates IκBα resulting in degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar, 8Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB activation by PKK is also dependent on IKKs, PKK was co-expressed with the catalytic inactive forms of IKKα and IKKβ. NF-κB activation induced by PKK as well as that induced by PMA/Ca2+-ionophore, IL-1β and TNFα, was inhibited by catalytic inactive IKKα and IKKβ (Fig.5A). In control experiments, PKK-mediated NF-κB activation was not affected by dominant negative forms of Bimp1 or MyD88 (Fig. 5A). The ability of PKK to activate NF-κB was also determined in MEFs lacking IKKα and IKKβ. Whereas PKK activated NF-κB in WT fibroblasts, it was unable to induce NF-κB in cells lacking IKKβ or in cells lacking both the IKKα and IKKβ proteins (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that NF-κB activation induced by PKK requires catalytic IKKs. However, we found that purified PKK did not phosphorylate IKKα or IKKβ in vitro, 2A. Muto, N. Inohara, and G. Núñez, unpublished results.suggesting that PKK does not function through direct phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex. Next we tested if NF-κB activation by PKK requires IKKγ, a regulatory component of the IKK complex (18Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D.

PKK was co-expressed with a truncated mutant of IKKγ (residues 134–419) that inhibits NF-κB activation induced by RIP and RICK (8Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, co-expression of the IKKγ mutant did not inhibit PKK-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5A). To verify the latter result, we tested the ability of PKK to activate NF-κB in parental Rat1 fibroblasts and IKKγ-deficient 5R cells, a Rat1 derivative cell line that is defective in IKKγ (22Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Expression of PKK induced NF-κB activity not only in parental Rat1 cells but also in 5R cells (Fig.5C). As controls, stimulation with TNFα, IL-1β, or LPS, or expression of Nod1 (all of which require IKKγ) induced NF-κB activation in parental Rat1 but not in 5R cells (Fig.5C). It was shown in Fig. 3 that the IM region of PKK is not essential for NF-κB activation. In contrast, the same region of RIP and RICK is essential for NF-κB activation and mediates the interaction with IKKγ (8Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y.

Thus, unlike in RICK and RIP, the IM region of PKK and IKKγ are dispensable for NF-κB activation. Bimp1 and its interacting partners Bcl10 and MALT1 have been shown to act downstream of PKC in a signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation (17McAllister-Lucas L.M. Inohara N. Lucas P.C. Ruland J. Benito A., Li, Q. Chen S. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Verma I.M. Mak T.W. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30589-30597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Ruland J.

In Fig. 4A we showed that NF-κB activation induced by expression of Bimp1, Bcl10, and activated MALT1 is unaffected by dominant negative PKK. Conversely, Fig.5A demonstrated that a dominant negative form of Bimp1 had no effect on PKK-mediated NF-κB activation. To determine whether PKK could act upstream of Bcl10, we tested the ability of PKK to induce NF-κB in MEFs deficient in Bcl10 (18Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Both PKK and Nod1 induced NF-κB activation in both Bcl10+/- and Bcl10−/− MEFs (Fig. 5D). In control experiments shown in Fig. 5D, Bcl10 was required for NF-κB activation induced by Bimp1, a protein that acts upstream of Bcl10 to activate NF-κB (17McAllister-Lucas L.M. Inohara N. Lucas P.C. Ruland J. Benito A., Li, Q. Chen S. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Verma I.M. Mak T.W. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30589-30597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Together with the results shown in Fig.4A, these results suggest that PKK functions in a PKC signaling pathway of NF-κB activation that is independent from Bcl10. We provide evidence that PKK is an NF-κB-activating kinase. The activity of PKK is consistent with its homology to RICK and RIP, two serine-threonine kinases that activate NF-κB. Another member of the family, RIP3, has been shown to activate or inhibit NF-κB activation, probably depending on the cellular context (36Yu P.W Huang B.C. Shen M. Quast J. Chan E., Xu, X. Nolan G.P. Payan D.G. Luo Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Sun X. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6500-6508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PKK appears to represent the fourth member of the RIP/RICK family of NF-κB activating kinases. Unlike RIP and RICK (8Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), the catalytic activity of PKK was required for NF-κB activation. These results indicate that PKK is unique among the RICK-related kinases and suggest that the mechanism by which PKK activates NF-κB is distinct from that utilized by RIP and RICK. We hypothesize that PKK activates NF-κB through the phosphorylation of protein target(s). PKK was originally identified as a binding partner of PKCβI, and it was suggested to function in a PKC signaling pathway (14Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposed model, we show that a dominant negative mutant of PKK inhibits PMA/Ca2+-ionophore-mediated NF-κB activation, an effect that was reverted by expression of PKCβI. Several studies have implicated PKCβI in the activation of NF-κB in cells derived from several tissues including the heart and kidney (39Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A.

We hypothesize that PKK functions in these tissues to regulate a Bcl10-independent PKCβI-mediated signaling pathway of NF-κB activation. Bcl10 appears to regulate PKC signaling pathways involved in antigen receptor stimulation and neurogenesis (18Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G.

The physiological upstream signals that activate PKK through PKCβI remain to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2007410245,"DNA damage, an important initiator of neuronal death, has been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative conditions. We previously delineated several pathways that control embryonic cortical neuronal death evoked by the DNA-damaging agent, camptothecin. In this model, the tumor suppressor p53 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated independently and cooperate to mediate the conserved death pathway. To further our understanding, we presently examined whether the c-Jun/JNK pathway modulates death and whether this pathway is regulated by CDKs, p53, and Bax. We show that c-Jun/JNK is activated following DNA damage. Moreover, the c-Jun pathway is one mediator of death, because expression of dominant negative c-Jun and cdc42, and JNK pathway inhibitors are neuroprotective. Although previous evidences indicate that JNK3 is required for neuronal death under certain conditions, we show that JNK3 deficiency only partially mediates c-Jun phosphorylation and its deficiency does not protect neurons from death. Interestingly, we provide evidence that CDK activity regulates c-Jun but does not affect upstream pathways that lead to JNK phosphorylation. Finally, c-Jun activation is independent of p53 and Bax. Accordingly, we propose that c-Jun is regulated by the JNK and CDK pathways and that both must be activated for efficient c-Jun activation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1973241705,"Tunicamycin is a reversible inhibitor of polyprenol-phosphate: N-acetylhexosamine-1-phosphate translocases and is produced by several Streptomycesspecies. We have examined tunicamycin biosynthesis, an important but poorly characterized biosynthetic pathway. Biosynthetic precursors have been identified by incorporating radioactive and stable isotopes, and by determining the labeling pattern using electrospray ionization-collision induced dissociation-mass spectrometry (ESI-CID-MS), and proton, deuterium, and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Preparation and analysis of [uracil-5-2H]-labeled tunicamycin established the complete ESI-CID-MS fragmentation pathway for the major components of the tunicamycin complex. Competitive metabolic experiments indicate that 7 deuteriums incorporate into tunicamycin from [6,6′-2H,2H]-labeled d-glucose, 6 of which arise from d-GlcNAc and 1 from uridine and/ord-ribose. Inverse correlation NMR experiments (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)) of13C-labeled tunicamycin enriched fromd-[1-13C]glucose suggest that the unique tunicamine 11-carbon dialdose sugar backbone arises from a 5-carbon furanose precursor derived from uridine and a 6-carbonN-acetylamino-pyranose precursor derived from UDP-d-N-acetylglucosamine. The equivalent incorporation of 13C into both the α-1′′ and β-11′ anomeric carbons of tunicamycin supports a direct biosynthesis via 6-carbon metabolism. It also indicates that the tunicamine motif and the α-1′′-linked GlcNAc residue are both derived from the same metabolic pool of UDP-GlcNAc, without significant differential metabolic processing. A biosynthetic pathway is therefore proposed for tunicamycin for the first time: an initial formation of the 11-carbon tunicamine sugar motif from uridine and UDP-GlcNAc via uridine-5′-aldehyde and UDP-4-keto-6-ene-N-acetylhexosamine, respectively, and subsequent formation of the anomeric-to-anomeric α, β-1′′,11′-glycosidic bond.

Tunicamycins are nucleotide antibiotics produced by severalStreptomyces species. They are potent inhibitors of the UDP-GlcNAc:polyprenol phosphate GlcNAc-1-P translocase family and are often used to block protein N-glycosylation. The structures are highly unusual but well characterized (1Tamura G. Tamura G. Tunicamycins. Japan Scientific Press, Tokyo1982: 10-31Google Scholar, 2Tkacz J.S. Tunicamycin and Related Antibiotics.in: Hohn F.E. Antibiotics VI. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 255-278Crossref Google Scholar, 3Eckardt K. J. Nat. Prod. 1983; 46: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and are composed of uracil, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a unique 11-carbon 2-aminodialdose sugar called tunicamine, and an amide-linked fatty acid. The αβ1,1′-glycosidic linkage between tunicamine and the GlcNAc substituent is also unique to the tunicamycin family of compounds. Tunicamycin structural variants occur that differ only in the nature of the N-linked acyl chain. We have recently introduced a structure-based naming system that identifies each tunicamycin by its signature fatty acid, i.e. Tun 13:1–Tun 18:1 (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about tunicamycin structure and function, no previous analysis of tunicamycin biosynthesis has been reported. The key to understanding the biosynthesis of tunicamycin is the origin of the 11-carbon tunicamine dialdose sugar and the kinetics for the formation of the α,β-1′′,11′-glycosidic bond. A large number of natural products of Streptomyces origin are synthesized from 2-carbon units via a polyketide-type reaction sequence (5Khosla C. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 8127-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, other long chain sugars such as sialic acids, ketodeoxyoctulosonate (KDO) and ketodeoxyheptulosonate are synthesized from aldol condensation of lower sugars with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 1The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ESI-CID-MS, electrospray ionization-collision induced dissociation-mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; LC- ESI-CID-MS, liquid chromatography-ESI-CID-MS; pseudoGalN, pseudo-aminogalactopyranosyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CID, collision-induced dissociations; GlcN, [1-14C]glucosamine; amu, atomic mass units. 1The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ESI-CID-MS, electrospray ionization-collision induced dissociation-mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; LC- ESI-CID-MS, liquid chromatography-ESI-CID-MS; pseudoGalN, pseudo-aminogalactopyranosyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CID, collision-induced dissociations; GlcN, [1-14C]glucosamine; amu, atomic mass units. (6Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the biosynthesis of similar nucleoside antibiotics, polyoxins and nikkomycins, occurs by ligation of PEP and uridine-5-aldehyde, generating 8-carbon octofuranuloseuronic acid nucleoside as an intermediate (7Isono K. Suhadolnik R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Isono K. Sato T. Hirasawa K. Funayama S. Suzuki S. J. Am. Chem.

Here, metabolic radiolabeling experiments and stable isotope incorporations have been applied to unravel the metabolic origin of the 11-carbon dialdose sugar, tunicamine. We report that [2-14C]uridine and [1-14C]glucosamine are efficiently incorporated into tunicamycin by resting cells ofStreptomyces chartreusis and that the [1-14C]glucosamine feeds into both the 11-carbon tunicamine and the attached α-1′′-GlcNAc residue. Stable isotope incorporations using 2H- or 13C-labeled glucose and competitive metabolic experiments were monitored by LC-ESI-CID-MS and NMR (H-1, C-13, and HSQC) spectroscopy. The isotopic labeling patterns were consistent with carbon-carbon bond formation between a 5-carbon precursor derived from uridine and a 6-carbon hexose intermediate, the latter most probably derived from UDP-GlcNAc. Heteronuclear C-13/H-1 NMR correlations showed an equal incorporation of 13C label from [1-13C]glucose into both the β-11′ and α-1′′ anomeric carbons, indicating that both arise from a common precursor pool. Hence, both the pseudo-aminogalactopyranosyl (pseudoGalN) ring of tunicamine and the α-1′′-linked GlcNAc residue are initially derived from the sugar nucleotide UDP-GlcNAc. Based on the results of these experiments a biosynthetic pathway is proposed for tunicamycin for the first time. Tunicamycin was obtained commercially from Sigma or by methanol extraction from mycelia of S. chartreusisNRRL 3882. d-[1-14C]glucosamine,d-[6,6′-2H,2H]glucose, andd-[1-13C]glucose were purchased from Sigma. [2-14C]Uridine was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO. Other chemicals, substituted uridine analogs, solvents, TLC plates, and culturing materials were supplied by Sigma. Putative tunicamycin- or corynetoxin-producing strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Streptomyces lysosuperificus, ATCC 31396; Clavibacter toxicus, ATCC 49908 and 49909) and ARS Northern Region Research Laboratory (S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882 and 12338; and Streptomyces clavuligerus, NRRL 3585). They were maintained on solid TYD agar (1.5%) and grown aerobically in liquid TYD medium at 28 °C. The medium contains tryptone (2 g·liters−1), yeast extract (2 g·liters−1), glucose (6 g·liters−1), and MgCl2·6H2O (0.3 g·liters−1) (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The optimal time for tunicamycin production in liquid TYD culture by S. chartreusis was 5–7 days. After growing S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882 in liquid TYD for 5 days, acid insoluble tunicamycin complex was precipitated by acidifying the cultures (0.2m HCl). Mycelia and the acid precipitate were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min), washed twice by resuspending in dilute HCl (0.2 m), and extracted by vortexing with methanol. Following centrifugation to remove cell debris, the methanolic supernatant was evaporated to dryness (40 °C) and then redissolved in fresh methanol (200 μl). Preparative thin layer chromatography (Silica 60 plates with a fluorescent indicator) was used to purify the tunicamycin complex (butanol:ethanol:water, 5:2:3 by volume). Where necessary, further purification was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC as previously described (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Streptomycetes were cultured in liquid TYD medium for 5 days prior to the addition of radiolabeled precursors. The labeled tunicamycin complex was acid precipitated after another 2 days of growth and analyzed by thin layer chromatography-autoradiography.d-[1-14C]glucosamine-labeled tunicamycin was selectively de-O-glycosylated and deacylated with 2m HCl at 100 °C for 3 h, as described by Tamura (1Tamura G. Tamura G. Tunicamycins. Japan Scientific Press, Tokyo1982: 10-31Google Scholar). For the stable isotope experiments, 2H- or13C-labeled glucose was substituted for the 0.6% glucose in TYD medium in 100- and 50-ml cultures, respectively. The tunicamycins were acid precipitated, and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS and NMR as described below. In some experiments the 99.9% deuterated glucose was diluted to 50% isotopic purity in order to better assess NMR proton-proton couplings. S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882 cells were grown in 0.6%d-[6,6′-2H,2H]glucose-substituted TYD medium in 10-ml shaken cultures. The unlabeled competitive metabolite, uridine, GlcNAc, ribose, glycerol, or succinate was added to the culture medium at the start of the growth period in a 3 molar excess of the deuterated glucose. The cultures were grown for 7 days at 28 °C, except for the ribose-competed culture that took 14 days to grow to completion. Tunicamycin complex was recovered and purified as above. Results of the isotopic enrichment were assessed by LC-ESI-CID-MS. Tunicamycin (0.5 mg) was exchanged in 0.5 ml D2O at 60 °C for 7 days in the presence of 0.4 m triethylamine. After evaporation to dryness, the hydroxyl protons were twice exchanged by lyophilization from deuterated water. Proton NMR analysis showed a 100% non-reversible exchange of the proton at position 5 in the uracil moiety of tunicamycin. LC-ESI-MS was undertaken on an HP 1100 Mass Spectrometric Detection system as described previously (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reversed-phase chromatography used a Spheri-5 ODS column with an elution gradient 45–55% acetonitrile: 1% aqueous acetic acid over 20 min at 1 ml·min−1, with atmospheric pressure interface-electrospray (API-ES) ionization and positive ion detection over a 100–1000 mass range. Collision-induced fragmentations were generated with a modified fragmenter voltage ramp as follows: 50 amu, 150 V; 250 amu, 150 V; 255 amu, 170 V; 750 amu, 170 V; 755 amu, 190 V; 1000 amu, 190 V; 1005 amu, 220 V. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas at 350 °C and 13 liters·min−1 at a nebulizer pressure of 60 p.s.i.g. Standard and metabolically labeled tunicamycins were deuterium exchanged by lyophilization from D2O and redissolved in deuterated methanol. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz instrument using pulse sequences supplied by Bruker. HSQC spectra were obtained using Echo/Antiecho-TPPI utilizing gradient selection with decoupling during acquisition. S. lysosuperificus, S. clavuligerus, andS. chartreusis strains NRRL 3882 and 12338 were initially screened for tunicamycin production by metabolic incorporation of [2-14C]uridine. The [2-14C]tunicamycin was precipitated from cultures with mild acid (tunicamycin is insoluble under these conditions), water-washed, and redissolved in methanol prior to analysis by thin layer chromatography-autoradiography (Fig.1). The [2-14C]tunicamycins eluted as a single spot and were readily separated from uridine by twice eluting with butanol:ethanol:water. The [2-14C]uridine was taken up by S. chartreusisstrains 3882 and 12338 in liquid TYD culture containing 0.6% glucose and incorporated into tunicamycin with high efficiency (2% incorporation of radiolabel) (Fig. 1 A). This was particularly efficient in S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882, allowing incorporation of [2-14C]uridine and subsequent isolation of [2-14C]tunicamycin on a preparative (nCi) scale (Fig. 1 B). Mycelium extracts and acid-precipitated culture supernatants from the S. chartreusis strains were also analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and showed identical profiles of tunicamycin N-acyl components (Fig. 1 C). These co-eluted with tunicamycin standards and were structurally confirmed by LC-ESI-MS (data not shown). As reported earlier, neither S. lysosuperificus nor S. clavuligerus produced detectable amounts of tunicamycin when grown in liquid TYD culture (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have previously developed a reverse-phase, positive-ion detected LC-ESI-MS assay for tunicamycins (4Tsvetanova B. Price N.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, collision-induced dissociations (CID) were used to promote further MS fragmentations (LC-ESI-CID-MS) and were applied to localize the metabolic incorporation of stable isotopes into the tunicamycins (Fig.2). To establish fragmentation pathways [uracil-5-2H]tunicamycins were prepared by a novel application of Heller's deuterium exchange procedure (10Heller S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin complex (0.5 mg) was isotopically exchanged in D2O in the presence of triethylamine as a non-reactive volatile base. After incubation (7 days, 60 °C) 100% exchange of deuterium at position 5 in the uracil ring was confirmed by LC-MS (Fig.2) and proton NMR (data not shown). LC-ESI-CID-MS analyses of unlabeled tunicamycins and [uracil-5-2H]tunicamycins are shown in Fig.2 B. Molecular ions were observed as associated sodium adducts [M + Na]+ plus a diagnostically useful [MH − 221]+ fragment ion. The latter arises from fragmentation across the αβ1′′,11′-glycosidic bond which generates oxonium ions for the N-acyl uracil-tunicaminyl moieties of each tunicamycin component. The parent ions, de-glycosylated oxonium ions ([MH-221]+) and associated [MH-221–2H2O]+ fragments retain the uracil moiety and are observed at 1 mass unit higher in the spectrum of the [uracil-5-2H]tunicamycins (Fig.1 B). The uracil moiety is subsequently lost as a neutral fragment, and the remaining fragment ions are unaffected by the 5-deuterium label, confirming the selective incorporation. The uracil neutral loss is also evident as a protonated ion at m/z 113 and 114 for the [uracil-5-2H]tunicamycin. The ESI-CID-MS fragmentation pathway for tunicamycin Tun 16:1A is shown in Fig. 2, A and C. A 1,2-elimination of the uracil base generates a [C11H17O7NAcyl]+ion (m/z 512) followed by 3,4-elimination of the 3′-OH group, similar to that observed for oligonucleotides by McLuckey and Habibi-Goudarzi (11Habibi-Goudarzi S. McLuckey S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1995; 6: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12McLuckey S.A. Habibi-Goudarzi S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 115: 12085-12095Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A second loss of H2O then occurs from the pseudo-aminogalactopyranosyl motif of the tunicamine backbone to generate [C11H13O5NAcyl]+(m/z 476). Fragmentation across the C-4′–C-5′ bond results in a neutral loss of the pseudo-ribosyl moiety, [C4H4O2] (84 amu). The resulting cation, [C7H9O3NAcyl]+(m/z 392), fragments across the C-7′–C-8′ bond to generate [C4H5ONAcyl]+(m/z 320) plus a neutral fragment [C3H4O2] (72 amu). The [C4H5ONAcyl]+ ion is resonance stabilized and consequently was often observed as the base peak. An acyloxy ion is then formed by neutral loss of [C4H5ON] from the C-10′ amide bond. Importantly, corresponding fragments differing by 14 amu (i.e. one CH2) are seen for tunicamycins with other N-acyl chains, i.e. these fragments retain their attached N-acyl group after dissociation of the uracil moiety and are therefore characteristic for each parent tunicamycin species. This fragmentation pattern was confirmed by ESI-CID-MS of tunicamycins metabolically labeled from [1-13C]glucose (Fig.3). An overall incorporation of two13C carbons was observed (i.e. m/z 869 for Tun 16:1, rather thanm/z 867), and these were localized to the anomeric carbons C-1′′ and C-11′. This is supported bym/z 625 rather than m/z 624 for the N-acyltunicamine-uracil oxonium fragment and bym/z 205 instead of m/z 204 for the GlcNAc oxonium ion. No major incorporations were observed in either the uracil ring (m/z 113) or theN-acyl chain (m/z 237). Fragments arising from the N-acyltunicamine-uracil parent ions (e.g. m/z 588, 512, 476, 392, and 320) are also all observed 1 amu higher in the 13C-labeled tunicamycins (Fig. 3). The subsequent neutral loss of 84 amu, rather than 83 amu, from [C4H5ONAcyl]+further indicates the position of the C-11′ anomeric carbon. Radiolabeling experiments indicated that S. chartreusis efficiently metabolizes [1-14C]glucosamine (GlcN) into tunicamycin (Fig.4 A). Uptake and incorporation of the labeled GlcN by resting cells in TYD were apparently little affected by glucose catabolite repression. Radiolabeled tunicamycin was isolated by mild acid precipitation and preparative TLC and subsequently acid hydrolyzed to cleave the 1′′,11′-glycosidic bond. Analysis of the radiolabeled products by TLC indicated that [1-14C]GlcN fed into both the 11-carbon tunicamine moiety and the attached GlcNAc residue. Two radiolabeled spots were observed that co-migrated with free glucosamine and tunicamine-uracil (Fig.4 A). The latter slow-moving spot quenched the fluorescent indicator in the TLC plates because of the attached uracil group and co-migrated with a tunicamine-uracil standard. Hence, it is clear that tunicamycin can be metabolically radiolabeled from GlcN and that the GlcN is incorporated into both the αβ-1,1-linked GlcNAc residue and the tunicamine-uracil core. These data suggest that tunicamine is derived from GlcN at the 6-carbon level rather than by a polyketide extension mechanism. Establishment of the tunicamycin MS fragmentation pathways permitted the localization of stable isotope incorporations by LC-ESI-CID-MS. Culturing S. chartreusis NRRL 3882 on TYD containing 0.6% [6,6′-2H,2H]glucose and isolation of the labeled tunicamycin fraction by mild acid precipitation resulted in the formation of deuterium-enriched tunicamycins. MS fragmentation analysis showed molecular ions (e.g. m/z 874 in Fig. 4, B.2) increased by 7 mass units relative to the corresponding unlabeled tunicamycins (m/z 867. Fig. 4, B.1), indicating an average of seven deuterium incorporations overall. The initial neutral loss from across the 1′′,11′-glycosidic bond generated fragment ions 4 mass units larger (i.e. m/z 628) than the corresponding controls (m/z 624). Hence, three deuteriums (labeled D1, D2, D3 in Fig.4 C) are associated with the α-1′′-linked GlcNAc residue, and the four others (D4, D5, D6, andD7) are associated with the N-acylated tunicaminyl-uracil moiety (Fig. 4 C). The oxonium ion generated from the α-1′′-GlcNAc residue, typically observed at m/z 204 in standard tunicamycin, was present at m/z 206 in the deuterated tunicamycins. Hence, although three deuteriums (D1,D2, D3) are associated with the initial loss of the GlcNAc neutral fragment, only two (Fig. 4 C,D1 and D2) remain on the GlcNAc oxonium ion. Deuteriums D1 and D2 presumably incorporate into C-6′′ of the α-1′′-GlcNAc residue via the following pathway: [6,6-2H,2H]Glc → [6,6-2H,2H]Glc-6-P → [6,6-2H,2H]Fru-6-P → [6,6-2H,2H]GlcN-6-P →→→ UDP-[6,6-2H,2H]GlcNAc. The remaining deuterium, D3, is assigned as the exchangeable anomeric proton and is presumably incorporated from [6,6′-2H,2H]glucose via 3-carbon metabolism. Subsequent fragmentations showed that deuterium is not incorporated into the uracil ring (m/z 113) (see also Fig. 2), so D4, D5, D6, and D7 are presumably all localized to the N-acyltunicamine motif. Deuteriums D4 and D5 are incorporated at tunicamine C-6′ by the direct metabolism of [6,6-2H,2H]Glc via [6,6-2H,2H]GlcNAc, verifying the earlier finding of [14C] GlcNAc incorporating into the tunicamine (Fig. 4 A). Hence, D4 and D5are on fragments larger than [C4H5ONAcyl]+ but are lost with the 72 amu neutral fragmentation across the C-7′,8′ bond. The β-11′-anomeric deuterium D6 is analogous to D3, and incorporation again occurs following metabolism of [6,6-2H,2H]glucose to 3-carbon compounds. To further assign the localizations described above, competitive metabolic experiments were conducted. S. chartreusis cells were grown on TYD containing [6,6-2H,2H]glucose, as described, but were supplemented with a 3-fold equivalent excess of an unlabeled competitive metabolite: GlcNAc, uridine, ribose, glycerol, or succinate (Fig. 4 B.3, TableI). These unlabeled precursors compete metabolically for the incorporation of labeled [6,6-2H,2H]glucose into the tunicamycins, which resulted in selective editing of deuterium atoms. The competed [6,6-2H,2H]glucose-labeled tunicamycins were analyzed by LC-CID-ESI-MS as described above. Unlabeled GlcNAc competed with the [6,6-2H,2H]glucose label so that the observed tunicamycin molecular ions are only 1 mass unit greater than corresponding unlabeled controls, and 6 mass units less than a labeled control experiment (Fig. 4 B). Fragmentation analysis indicates that this remaining deuterium was located in the tunicaminyl moiety rather than in the α-1′′-GlcNAc group. Hence, unlabeled GlcNAc competes for the incorporation of three deuteriums into the α-1′′-GlcNAc and three into tunicamine. These data support the concept that the tunicamycin pseudoGalN pyranose ring is metabolically derived from GlcNAc (presumably via UDP-GlcNAc).Table IESI-CID-MS analysis of competitive metabolic experimentsUnlabeled tunicamycin[5-2H-uracil] tunicamycin[1-13C]-glucose-labeled tunicamycin[6,6′-2H,2H]-glucose-labeled tunicamycinGlcNAc metabolic chaseUridine metabolic chaseSuccinate metabolic chaseGlycerol metabolic chaseRibose metabolic chase853854 (+1)855 (+2)860 (+7)854 (+1)859 (+6)858 (+5)858 (+5)859 (+6)610611 (+1)611 (+1)614 (+4)611 (+1)613 (+3)613 (+3)613 (+3)613 (+3)574575 (+1)575 (+1)578 (+4)575 (+1)577 (+3)577 (+3)577 (+3)-462462 (+0)463 (+1)466 (+4)463 (+1)465 (+3)465 (+3)465 (+3)465 (+3)378378 (+0)379 (+1)382 (+4)379 (+1)381 (+3)381 (+3)381 (+3)381 (+3)306306 (+0)307 (+1)307 (+1)306 (+0)307 (+1)306 (+0)306 (+0)306 (+0)223223 (+0)223 (+0)224 (+1)223 (+0)224 (+1)223 (+0)223 (+0)223 (+0)204204 (+0)205 (+1)206 (+2)204 (+0)206 (+2)206 (+2)206 (+2)206 (+2)113114 (+1)113 (+0)113 (+0)113 (+0)113 (+0)113 (+0)113 (+0)113 (+0)S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882 was cultured in TYD media containing isotopically-labeled glucose as the metabolic precursor and a 3-fold molar excess of an unlabeled competitive metabolite: GlcNAc, uridine, succinate, glycerol, or ribose as indicated.

Open table in a new tab S. chartreusis, NRRL 3882 was cultured in TYD media containing isotopically-labeled glucose as the metabolic precursor and a 3-fold molar excess of an unlabeled competitive metabolite: GlcNAc, uridine, succinate, glycerol, or ribose as indicated. Labeled tunicamycins were acid precipitated and methanol extracted after 5 days and analyzed by LC-ESI-CID-MS. In each case, the MS fragment ion masses shown are for tunicamycin Tun 15:1A and are analogous to those deduced for Tun 16:1A in Fig. 2. Numbers in parentheses indicate the mass increases relative to control unlabeled tunicamycin Tun 15:1A. Unlabeled uridine or ribose competed for the incorporation of [6,6-2H,2H]glucose and gave tunicamycins with six deuteriums (Table I). MS fragmentation analysis indicated that the deuterium whose incorporation was blocked, D7, was located in the pseudoribosyl moiety. Hence, the D7 label was predominantly lost on the 72 amu neutral fragment (Fig. 4 B.3), suggesting that it is located at the tunicamine C-5′. This was also deduced from the fact that three deuteriums were located in the α-1′′-GlcNAc residue and three others in the tunicaminyl core, again with no incorporation into the uracil ring. Hence, these data support the hypothesis that the tunicamine-uracil core is derived from 5,6-ligation of uridine and UDP-GlcNAc and confirm the earlier radiolabeling experiments showing that [14C]glucosamine is efficiently incorporated into the GlcNAc and tunicaminyl moieties byS. chartreusis. The deuterium label was also sometimes observed in the [C4H5ONAcyl]+ fragments and the acyloxy ions (Table I). This was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the fatty acid component following methanolysis (data not shown) and by NMR analysis (see later). This is presumably because D7 occupies two locations (D7a and D7b) that average out as 1 mass unit. To address whether biosynthesis of the tunicamine backbone might occur by 2- or 3-carbon extensions, the [6,6-2H,2H]glucose label was metabolically competed with glycerol or succinate (Table I). Glycerol or succinate suppress the catabolism of the deuterated glucose into 3-carbon compounds so that incorporations occur predominantly via a 6-carbon metabolism. The presence of glycerol or succinate competed five deuteriums from tunicamycin overall, two from the α-1′′-GlcNAc and three from the N-acyltunicamine-uracil. Thus, the geminal deuteriums D1 and D2 are retained in the GlcNAc moiety, and similarly D4 and D5 are retained in the tunicamine pseudoGalNAc ring because they arise directly from a 6-carbon metabolism. In contrast, D3 and D6 are competed out of the tunicamycins, presumably because glycerol or succinate block the conversion of [6,6-2H,2H]glucose to 1-deuteroglucose via 3-carbon intermediates. The remaining deuterium, D7, is competed from the N-acyl chains (i.e. at D7b), but the label is retained at the tunicamine C-5′ (i.e. at D7a). This is evident from the neutral loss of [C3H12H3O2] (75 amu) rather than the usual 72 amu observed in the controls. This presumably occurs by metabolism of [6,6-2H,2H]glucose into [5,5-2H,2H]ribose via the pentose phosphate pathway, and hence into [5,5-2H,2H]uridine. The biosynthetic pathway proposed below (Fig. 6) calls for an enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of uridine to uridine-5-aldehyde prior to 5,6-bond formation. Hence, assuming stereoselectivity, only one deuterium should be lost from [5,5-2H,2H]uridine prior to incorporation into tunicamycins. NMR provides a tool to comprehensively assign the localization of stable isotopes into tunicamycins. Key features are the 6′-CH2 and 6′′-CH2 groups of the tunicamine and α-1′′-GlcNAc, respectively; the origin of the C-5′pseudo-ribosyl bridge; and the β-1′-N-, β-11′-O-, and α-1′′-O- anomeric assignments. Isotopically-labeled tunicamycins were isolated from cultures of S. chartreusis grown on TYD enriched with [1-13C]glucose. Following purification by preparative TLC, the isolates were analyzed by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and HSQC 13C-1H correlation spectroscopy. The methylene groups were assigned as gemin"

In a previous study we demonstrated that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation inhibited phorbol ester-stimulated avidity modulation of β1 integrin in several leukocyte cell lines. Both RhoA and Rap1 require post-translational modification by geranylgeranylation for full function. In this report we identify Rap1, not RhoA, as a critical geranylgeranylated protein mediating phorbol ester-stimulated β1 and β2integrin-dependent adhesion of Jurkat cells. Overexpression of the Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein, SPA-1, or inactivated form of Rap1 (N17Rap1) blocked phorbol ester-stimulated adhesion of Jurkat cells to fibronectin (α4β1) and ICAM-1 (αLβ2). With high concentrations of fibronectin as ligand, Jurkat cells adhered spontaneously without phorbol ester stimulation. Unlike the phorbol ester-stimulated adhesion, adhesion induced by high density ligand was not dependent upon Rap1 activation or actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Thus, the “inside-out” adhesion signal induced by phorbol ester and the “outside-in” signal induced by high density ligand involve different pathways.

Thus, the “inside-out” adhesion signal induced by phorbol ester and the “outside-in” signal induced by high density ligand involve different pathways. The essential role of leukocyte integrin receptors in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion in the inflammatory and immune systems is well established. The adhesive capacity of leukocyte integrins is highly regulated. Integrin receptors in a low adhesive state do not mediate strong adhesion to other cells or ligands. However, when leukocytes are appropriately activated, there is often a detectable increase in integrin adhesiveness within a few seconds to minutes. Some activation stimuli induce a measurable change in integrin receptor affinity, whereas others mediate their effects without altering affinity but instead utilize post-receptor events involving cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of receptors that serve to increase overall adhesivity. Increases in integrin adhesivity produced by post-receptor events without changes in receptor affinity have been defined as increased avidity. Post-receptor events also regulate “outside-in” signaling in which integrins transduce information from the exterior to the interior of the cell, engaging classic signaling pathways that control growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytokine expression. Whether leukocyte integrin adhesivity is regulated primarily by affinity or avidity modulation is still somewhat controversial (1van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Google Scholar). For a given leukocyte cell type, different activation stimuli may modulate integrin adhesivity by one or the other mechanism. For example, the functional activity of β1 integrins on human T-cells can be regulated by treatment with certain divalent cations or activating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FN, fibronectin; ΔGRD, GAP-related domain; PKC, protein kinase C; MacMARCKS, macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PGGT, protein geranylgeranyl transferase; DTSSP, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate); GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FN, fibronectin; ΔGRD, GAP-related domain; PKC, protein kinase C; MacMARCKS, macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; PGGT, protein geranylgeranyl transferase; DTSSP, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate); GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which directly increase the affinity of β1 integrins for their ligands, presumably by altering receptor conformation (2Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) generally promotes β1-dependent leukocyte adhesion by targeting events that occur following receptor occupancy without significantly affecting the affinity of the receptor for the ligand (3Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Google Scholar). Moreover, for the same stimulus, integrin receptors of one subfamily may respond differently from those of another. For example, Weber et al. (4Weber C. Katayama J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Google Scholar) noted that there was differential regulation of β1 and β2 integrin adhesiveness in eosinophils stimulated by the same chemoattractant. β2 integrin-mediated adhesion was dependent upon affinity modulation, whereas β1 integrin-mediated adhesion involved post-receptor events. For leukocyte β1integrins, the regulation of adhesivity may be mediated predominantly by post-receptor events such as diffusion/clustering in the membrane and subsequent cytoskeletal interactions rather than by affinity modulation (3Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Google Scholar). Activation of leukocyte β2 integrins also involves avidity modulation, although affinity mechanisms clearly apply (5Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Google Scholar). Although a number of cytoplasmic protein regulators of integrin affinity have been identified and characterized in a variety of cell types (1van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways involved in avidity modulation in leukocytes have not been fully elucidated. One current model of avidity modulation proposes that leukocyte integrins are loosely restrained in the plasma membrane in an inactive, non-clustered state by interaction of the β-subunit cytoplasmic tail with cortical actin cytoskeleton (1van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Google Scholar). Regulatory proteins such as MacMARCKS (6Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Google Scholar) and L-plastin (7Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Google Scholar) maintain the cortical cytoskeleton. Diverse stimuli trigger activation of the integrin receptors by “inside-out” signaling, resulting in activation of PKC, phosphorylation of L-plastin and MacMARCKS, increases in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of calpain. These signals promote the release of integrin receptors from the cytoskeletal constraints, allowing diffusion of the receptors within the membrane. With increased diffusion there is clustering of receptors upon contact with immobilized ligand, augmenting cellular avidity for the ligand-coated surface. Subsequently, other signaling components such as cytohesin-1 (8Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar), Rack1 (9Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Google Scholar), and GTPases are recruited to the clusters, leading to adhesion strengthening, actin stress fiber formation, spreading, acquisition of “activation” epitopes, and assembly of signaling molecules. All of these events may take place without significant changes in receptor affinity. Several Ras/Rho small GTPases have also been reported to regulate leukocyte integrin avidity. H-Ras and Rac were shown to be involved in stimulated β2 integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion (10Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Google Scholar). Previous studies (11Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Google Scholar) have established a critical role for RhoA in integrin clustering, adhesion, and spreading in a wide variety of adherent cell types. However, studies of leukocyte adhesion using C3 exoenzyme to inactivate RhoA specifically have yielded conflicting results. Blockade of RhoA function by the C3 exoenzyme was reported to inhibit β2 integrin-dependent stimulated neutrophil adhesion (12Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Google Scholar). However, in other studies treatment with C3 exoenzyme did not affect β2integrin-dependent adhesion of neutrophils (13Anderson S.I. Hotchin N.A. Nash G.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2737-2745Google Scholar) or JY lymphocytic cells (14Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4208-4216Google Scholar) or β1integrin-dependent adhesion of peripheral blood T-cells (15Woodside D.G. Wooten D.K. McIntyre B.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1211-1221Google Scholar) or U937 monocytic cells (16Aepfelbacher M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 78-80Google Scholar). Finally, several recent studies have implicated Rap1, a small GTPase with 53% amino acid sequence homology to K-Ras, in stimulated β1 (17Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kanda E. Yamamoto K. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10453-10462Google Scholar, 18Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J.

Santos E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 613-624Google Scholar). In a previous study (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar) we demonstrated that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation inhibited phorbol ester-stimulated avidity modulation of β1 integrin in several leukocyte cell lines. Both RhoA and Rap1 require post-translational modification by geranylgeranylation for full function. In this report we identify Rap1, not RhoA, as a critical geranylgeranylated protein mediating phorbol ester-stimulated β1-dependent adhesion of Jurkat T-cells. We show further that adhesion to fibronectin (FN) stimulated by PMA and “spontaneous” adhesion induced by binding to a high concentration of FN involve different mechanisms. Unlike PMA-stimulated adhesion, adhesion induced by binding to high density ligand is not dependent upon Rap1 activation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, PKC activation, or tyrosine phosphorylation. Jurkat cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA)) and N17Rap1-transfected Jurkat cells ((10) a gift from Dr. T. Kinashi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). The blocking anti-β1 integrin subunit (CD29) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5D1 was generated in our laboratory (24Schwartz B.R. Karsan A. Bombeli T. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4842-4848Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 8A2 is an adhesion-activating antibody directed to β1 integrin subunit (25Kovach N.L. Carlos T.M. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 499-509Google Scholar). Phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma) was used at 100 ng/ml or as specified. All-trans-geranylgeraniol was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Lovastatin was purchased fromCalbiochem and was converted to open acid form before use (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar). The protein geranylgeranyltransferase (PGGT) inhibitor-1, GGTI-298, was a gift from S. Sebti (University of South Florida, Tampa, FL). Y-27632 is a specific RhoA kinase inhibitor (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Google Scholar) and was a gift of Welfide Corp. (Osaka, Japan). The pLXSN-SPA-1, pLXSN-SPA-1-ΔGRD, and the pLNSX plasmids were gifts of Dr. N. Minato (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar). The plasmids were transfected into the ecotropic packaging line, PE501 (a gift of A. D. Miller, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), by calcium phosphate precipitation. The viral supernatants were harvested and used to transduce the amphotropic line PA317 (ATCC) in the presence of 9 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Polyclonal and monoclonal retrovirus-producing cell lines were obtained by selection in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Retroviral supernatants from the PA317 cell lines were used to infect Jurkat cells. Following selection in 1 mg/ml G418, the expression level of SPA-1 was determined with anti-SPA-1 antibody (gift of N. Minato). Polyclonal retrovirus-infected Jurkat cells were used in order to avoid artifacts because of retroviral integration. 2.0 × 106 Jurkat cells were first treated with 10 μm lovastatin for 2 days to deplete the endogenous isoprenyl groups. They were then incubated with or without 10 μm of the PGGT-I inhibitor (GGTI-298) in the presence of 25 μCi of [3H]geranylgeraniol pyrophosphate for 2 days, a period determined previously (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar) as sufficient to restore integrin function. Following labeling in this manner, the cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and the lysate was analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. The [3H]geranylgeraniol-labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography (28Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11963-11967Google Scholar). Cells (2.0 × 106) were treated with 10 μg/ml C3 transferase (Calbiochem) as described previously (29Laudanna C. MochlyRosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 250 μl of cold lysis buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and the lysate was then sonicated. Aliquots (100 μg of protein) of the lysate were incubated with 32P-NAD (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 10 μg of C3 transferase at 37 °C for 30 min before Laemmli buffer was added. The samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and run on SDS-PAGE. [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Leukocyte adhesion to FN or to recombinant ICAM-1 was performed as follows. Human FN (Collaborative Research, Inc., Bedford, MA) as noted or 100 μg/ml ICAM-1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was coated onto a 96-well Pro-BindTM assay plate (Falcon, BD Biosciences) by incubating overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Immediately before use, plates were washed three times with PBS. After centrifugation for 7 min at 300 ×g, the infected Jurkat cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phenol red-free medium and then labeled by incubation with 5 μl of the fluorescent dye calcein-AM (1 mg/ml in Me2SO, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed twice with phenol red-free medium. After incubation with PMA or the β1-activating mAb 8A2 (2 μg/ml) for 30 min in control medium at room temperature, cells (∼1 × 105/well) were added to triplicate wells. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the total population of cells in the well was analyzed using a fluorescence plate reader (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Unbound cells were removed by washing the plate three times with phenol red-free medium, and the plate was then reanalyzed to determine the fluorescence of bound cells. After subtraction of background, the percent adherence was calculated as the emission at 530 nm of bound cells divided by the emission of total cells. Small G-protein activation was detected with an activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cells were lysed with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer (MLB) containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CA-630, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mm sodium fluoride. The lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with Raf-1-PBD-agarose to detect Rap1 or Ras activation or with PAK-1-PBD-agarose for Rac. After washing three times with MLB, the pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Rap1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-Rac antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Because Raf-1-PBD has a much higher binding efficiency for Ras than it has for Rap1 (30Esser D.B.B. Wolthuis R.M.F. Wittinghofer A. Cool R.H. Bayer P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13453-13462Google Scholar), in the Rap1-GTP loading experiment, the cell lysate was pre-cleared by immunoprecipitation of Ras with the anti-Ras antibody. An assay to detect stimulated β1 integrin diffusion/clustering was developed based upon the report from Rehemtulla et al. (31Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Google Scholar). Briefly, control or treated cells were incubated with the cross-linker 3,3′-diothiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) (Pierce), which covalently links molecules within 12 Å. Following cross-linking, cells were lysed, and limiting anti-β1 mAb was added. More integrin receptor was immunoprecipitated if β1 integrin receptors were either freely diffusible, allowing “capture” by the cross-linker, or clustered. In contrast, with excess anti-β1 mAb equivalent amounts of integrin receptor were immunoprecipitated, regardless of receptor mobility or clustering. Jurkat cells (2.0 × 106) were untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml PMA or with cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature before adding 1.25 mg/ml of DTSSP. After cross-linking for 3 h at room temperature, DTSSP was removed by washing the cells three times with PBS. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-β1 mAb 8A2 at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was then performed with an anti-β1 integrin mAb (Calbiochem). Significance was determined using two-tailed Student'st-test with unequal variance, using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). We have shown previously (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar) that protein geranylgeranylation was necessary for PMA-stimulated, β1 integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion. Because stimulated adhesion was blocked by pretreatment with the PGGT-1 inhibitor GGTI-298, we first determined the effect of that inhibitor on protein geranylgeranylation in Jurkat cells. In the absence of GGTI-298, two bands with apparent molecular weights between 20 and 30 kDa were labeled by [3H]geranylgeraniol pyrophosphate (data not shown). Treatment with the PGGT-1 inhibitor GGTI-298 markedly reduced labeling of the more slowly migrating band. RhoA is a 22-kDa geranylgeranylated protein that has been implicated in β2integrin-dependent adhesion (32Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Google Scholar). Our previous study (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar) had shown that GGTI-298 inhibited RhoA protein geranylgeranylation in Jurkat cells at the same dose as it inhibited PMA-stimulated cell adhesion. Consequently, we examined the involvement of the Rho signaling pathway in PMA-stimulated β1integrin-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion. Treatment with C3 exoenzyme in vivo significantly reduced the amount of RhoA protein labeled with 32P in vitro, demonstrating that the C3 transferase had penetrated the intact Jurkat cells and had ADP-ribosylated RhoA (data not shown). However, treatment with C3 exoenzyme at a concentration at which most RhoA protein was ADP-ribosylated in vivo did not inhibit PMA-stimulated adhesion to FN (Fig. 1). In addition, the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632 did not reduce PMA-stimulated adhesion. These results indicated RhoA and RhoA kinase activation were not required for PMA-stimulated, β1integrin-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion to FN (Fig. 1). The geranylgeranylation of Rap1 was also inhibited by GGTI-298 at the same time course and dose as GGTI-298-inhibited cell adhesion (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar). We investigated the role of Rap1 by transducing cells with the Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP), SPA-1 (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar). Tsukamoto et al. (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that overexpression of SPA-1 blocked Rap1 activation through its GAP activity in 293T cells and that a mutant SPA-1 without a GAP-related domain, ΔGRD, was without effect. As shown in Fig.2, PMA activated Rap1 from the GDP- to GTP-binding form. Compared with the vector control, overexpression of SPA-1 suppressed Rap1 activation in both resting and PMA-stimulated cells. However, the mutant SPA-1-ΔGRD enhanced production of Rap1-GTP. SPA-1 did not inhibit the GTP loading of Ras or Rac GTPases (Fig. 2). Overexpression of SPA-1 significantly reduced PMA-stimulated Jurkat cell adhesion to FN (Figs. 1 and3 A). There was some increased adhesion with PMA compared with basal adhesion in the SPA-1-overexpressing cells, but maximal adhesion was much lower than that of vector control or that of SPA-1-ΔGRD (Fig. 3 B). The SPA-1-ΔGRD mutant moderately increased cell adhesion compared with vector control (Fig. 3 B), consistent with its effect on Rap1-GTP binding in vivo (Fig. 2). Cells overexpressing an inactivated form of Rap1, N17Rap1, evidenced reduced adhesion in response to PMA (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to its effect on PMA stimulation, overexpression of SPA-1 had no effect on adhesion induced by the activating mAb 8A2 (Fig. 3 A). Previous reports (33Bleijs D.A. van Duijnhoven G.C. van Vliet S.J. Thijssen J.P. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10338-10346Google Scholar) showed that low doses of cytochalasin D induced cell adhesion, whereas higher doses inhibited it. We found that overexpression of SPA-1 did not block cytochalasin D-induced adhesion (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5, PMA treatment of Jurkat cells markedly increased the amount of β1 integrin immunoprecipitated by limiting amounts of anti-β1mAb in the presence of cross-linker, indicating an increase in diffusion, clustering, or both. Cytochalasin D treatment also markedly increased β1 integrin immunoprecipitated in resting cells, consistent with dissolution of basal cytoskeletal restraints, allowing increased diffusion and capture by cross-linker. SPA-1 did not block cytochalasin D- or PMA-induced integrin diffusion/clustering as detected by this technique (Fig. 5).Figure 5SPA-1 does not block PMA - or cytochalasin D-induced β1 integrin diffusion. 2 × 106 Jurkat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA or 1 μg/ml cytochalasin D (Cyto D) for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking experiment was performed with 1.25 mg/ml DTSSP at room temperature for 3 h. Immunoprecipitation with limiting amount of antibody was performed with 1:1000 dilution of the anti-β1 integrin subunit mAb 8A2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6, overexpression of SPA-1 reduced αLβ2integrin-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion to ICAM-1 as well as α4β1-dependent adhesion to FN. Thus, the effect of SPA-1, and hence the role of Rap1, involves β2 as well as β1 integrin receptor activation. As shown in Fig.7 A, the adhesive behavior of Jurkat cells differed dramatically with the concentration of FN coating the wells. PMA stimulation markedly increased adhesion of vector control and SPA-1-ΔGRD cells, but not of SPA-1 cells, to wells coated with 1 μg/ml FN. When the concentration of FN used to coat the wells was increased from 1 (“low”) to 2 (“high”) μg/ml, the adhesion of unstimulated vector control cells increased from 5 to 65% and unstimulated SPA-1-ΔGRD cells from 16 to 79% and even that of the SPA-1 cells increased from 1 to 51%. Although overexpression of SPA-1 reduced both unstimulated and PMA-stimulated adhesion to low FN, SPA-1 had little effect on the adhesion of SPA-1 cells to high FN. At 1 μg/ml FN the PMA-stimulated adhesion of SPA-1 cells was only 22%, and those of the vector control and SPA-1-ΔGRD were 74 and 86%, respectively. For PMA-stimulated SPA-1 cells, adhesion increased to 88% at 2 μg/ml FN, which was comparable with that of vector control (89%) and SPA-1-ΔGRD (93%) cells. We next examined Rap1 activation at a high concentration of FN. Rap1 was not activated in any of the cells adherent to high FN, based on the GTP-loading assay. In the same experiment PMA did induce Rap1 activation in control and SPA-1-ΔGRD but not in SPA-1 cells (Fig.7 B). Of note, SPA-1-ΔGRD also increased basal Rap1 activation (Fig. 7 B). This is consistent with the enhanced basal adhesion observed in SPA-1-ΔGRD-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). PMA-stimulated cell adhesion was dependent upon the activation of Rap1 (Fig. 3 A), whereas adhesion induced by high FN was independent of Rap1 activation (Fig. 7 A). The inactivated form of Rap1, N17Rap1, also failed to inhibit unstimulated adhesion to high density of FN (5 μg/ml). Unstimulated adhesion of control cells was 12% to low FN and 30% to high FN. Adhesion of N17Rap1 cells to low FN was 4.5 versus 28% to high FN (means of eight replicates). These results suggested that PMA-stimulated and high density ligand-induced adhesion involved distinct mechanisms. This was supported by the observation that PMA-stimulated adhesion was inhibited by cytochalasin D, whereas adhesion to high density FN was not affected (Fig.8 A). Additional studies were performed to determine the signaling pathways involved in Jurkat cell adhesion at high density FN, which was not dependent upon Rap1 or cytoskeletal reorganization. Both PMA-stimulated adhesion to low FN and unstimulated adhesion to high FN were blocked by deoxyglucose and azide (Fig. 8 B), indicating that both required active cell metabolism. PMA-stimulated adhesion to low FN was reduced by treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, and the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, whereas neither agent affected unstimulated adhesion to high FN (Fig. 8 B). We had determined previously (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar) that a 20–30-kDa protein(s) whose geranylgeranylation was catalyzed by PGGT-1 was a candidate to regulate PMA-stimulated, β1 integrin-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion. Geranylgeranylation of both RhoA and Rap1 proteins was inhibited when PMA-stimulated cell adhesion was blocked by lovastatin or the PGGT-1 inhibitor GGTI-298 (23Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33334-33340Google Scholar). However, treatment of cells with C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates RhoA protein and prevents RhoA interaction with its downstream protein, did not inhibit PMA-stimulated adhesion to FN (Fig. 1). This suggested that RhoA activation was not required for PMA-stimulated, β1integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion. That conclusion was further supported by the observation that inhibition of RhoA kinase, the downstream effector of RhoA, with the specific inhibitor Y-27632 did not inhibit PMA-stimulated β1 integrin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 1). In addition, we have shown that RhoA activation is not required for stimulated β2integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion but is instead involved in the process of de-adhesion (34Liu L. Schwartz B.R. Lin N. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2330-2336Google Scholar). With RhoA excluded as the geranylgeranylated protein mediating PMA-stimulated Jurkat adhesion, we focused on Rap1. Tsukamato et al. (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar) first implicated Rap1 in cell adhesion with the observation that overexpression of SPA-1, a Rap1-specific GAP, blocked granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-induced promyelocytic 32D cell adhesion to culture dishes. Reedquist et al. (18Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Google Scholar) reported that Rap1 was involved in CD31-induced, β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of Jurkat cells. Rap1 was also shown to be the activation signal for PMA-stimulated, LFA-1-dependent adhesion of Jurkat cells to ICAM-1 (10Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Google Scholar), for lipopolysaccharide-induced, β2integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading of macrophages (21Schmidt A. Caron E. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Google Scholar), and for erythropoietin- or interleukin-3-induced, β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of 32D cells (17Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kanda E. Yamamoto K. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10453-10462Google Scholar). Constitutively activated Rap1, V12Rap1, was recently shown to increase β1 and β2integrin-dependent adhesion of lymphocytes (19Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we found that overexpression of the Rap1-specific GAP, SPA-1, in Jurkat cells markedly reduced PMA-stimulated, α4β1-mediated adhesion to FN, a process dependent upon avidity modulation. The effect of SPA-1 on cell adhesion was further confirmed with the inactivated form of Rap1, N17Rap1 (Fig.3 C) (10Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Google Scholar). Both N17Rap1- and SPA-1-transfected Jurkat cells exhibited significantly lower adhesion when stimulated with PMA (Fig.3, A and C). The results with N17Rap1 confirm that SPA-1 is involved in cell adhesion by regulating Rap1 activation. In contrast, the transfection of SPA-1 did not inhibit Jurkat cell adhesion to FN by the β1 integrin-activating mAb 8A2, which directly modulates β1 integrin affinity (Fig.3 A). Because the overexpression of SPA-1 also reduced β2 integrin-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion to ICAM-1, we conclude that Rap1 activation is involved in inside-out activation of both β1 and β2 integrins by PMA in Jurkat cells. Previous studies (35Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Google Scholar) have shown that low dose cytochalasin D stimulates β1 and β2integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion, presumably by releasing cytoskeletal restraints and allowing diffusion of integrin receptors in the membrane with subsequent ligand-induced clustering. We found that overexpression of SPA-1 did not inhibit cytochalasin D-induced adhesion (Fig. 4). Like PMA, cytochalasin D also induced β1 integrin receptor mobility in the plasma membrane, and overexpression of SPA-1 did not block this effect induced by either PMA or cytochalasin D (Fig. 5). Thus, blockade of Rap1 by overexpression of SPA-1 did not interfere with the process of integrin release from the cytoskeleton. PMA stimulated a dose-dependent adhesion of both the vector control and the SPA-1-ΔGRD-infected cells to FN (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, SPA-1-ΔGRD-infected cells exhibited greater Rap1 activation and increased adhesion when compared with vector control (Figs. 3 and 7), consistent with overexpressed SPA-1-ΔGRD functioning as a dominant-negative mutant of endogenous SPA-1. However, with overexpression of SPA-1 there was an initial stimulation at the very low dose of 1 ng/ml PMA but no further stimulation at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml PMA. Taken together, these results support the suggestion by van Kooyk and Figdor (1van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Google Scholar) that PMA modulates leukocyte integrin-dependent adhesion by a multistep process. In the first step, similar to cytochalasin D, PMA activation loosens actin cytoskeletal restraints, thereby allowing diffusion of integrin receptors. This suggestion is supported by the cross-linking experiment. Both PMA and cytochalasin D increased capture of β1 integrin by a cross-linker, as assessed by immunoprecipitation with a limiting amount of anti-β1integrin mAb, consistent with greater diffusion. Notably, overexpression of SPA-1 did not block this effect of cytochalasin D or PMA. Zhou and Li (6Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Google Scholar) reported that PMA induced integrin receptor diffusion through activation of PKC and phosphorylation of MacMARCKS. Because SPA-1 overexpression has no effect on the initial diffusion, we speculate that PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS and Rap1 activation are either two independent signals or that Rap1 activation is downstream of MacMARCKS phosphorylation. The second step in the process of PMA stimulation of integrin-dependent adhesion involves integrin clustering, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and a complex assembly to promote efficient binding to ligand. Because overexpression of SPA-1 blocked PMA-stimulated Rap1 activation and stable adhesion, but did not inhibit β1 integrin diffusion/clustering, we propose that activation of Rap1 plays a role in this second step. After cells bind to ligand(s) via integrin receptors, there is outside-in signaling, which engages classic signaling pathways controlling growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytokine expression (36Buckley C.D. Rainger G.E. Bradfield P.F. Nash G.B. Simmons D.L. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 167-176Google Scholar). Previous studies (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar, 37Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs D.A. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R.R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-506Google Scholar) have also noted spontaneous α4β1-dependent adhesion to high density ligand. Our results suggest that adhesion to wells coated with the high concentration of FN involved a mechanism distinct from PMA-stimulated inside-out signaling. With increasing concentrations of FN, spontaneous, unstimulated adhesion of Jurkat cells increased markedly for cells overexpressing SPA-1 as well as for control and SPA-1-ΔGRD-infected cells (Fig. 7 A). Although overexpression of SPA-1 blocked PMA-stimulated adhesion to wells coated with lower concentrations of FN, it had little effect at the higher concentrations of FN (Figs. 3 B and 7 A). Notably, Tsukamato et al. (27Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Google Scholar) reported that adhesion of HeLa cells to high FN induced Rap1 activation, despite overexpression of SPA-1. Although their studies did not specifically address the integrin dependence of the adhesion process, it is likely that these cells utilized β1 integrin to adhere to FN. In our studies, however, overexpression of SPA-1 did not block Jurkat cell adhesion to high density FN, and adhesion to high density FN alone did not induce Rap1 activation. These results suggest that leukocyte adhesion induced by high density ligand in the absent of exogenous stimulation does not involve Rap1. In addition, the outside-in signal leading to spontaneous adhesion was different from the inside-out signaling triggered by PMA in that it was not blocked by cytochalasin D (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, and the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, significantly inhibited PMA-stimulated adhesion but had much less or no effect on high FN-induced adhesion (Fig. 8 B). Because mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Rho kinase have been reported to modulate integrin-dependent adhesion, we tested the effect of mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD 98050, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, and the RhoA kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, on both PMA-stimulated and FN-induced adhesion. None of these inhibitors inhibited either of these two pathways (data not shown). Hence, it is unlikely the activation of these kinases is essential for cell adhesion in this model system. Fig. 9 depicts a model for these two adhesive mechanisms. With PMA-stimulated adhesion (Fig. 9 A), the integrins are first released from the cytoskeletal restraints, and their diffusion rate in the plasma membrane is increased. The increased diffusion accounts for the small initial increase in cell adhesion. PMA may activate this process through phosphorylation of MacMARCKS (6Zhou X. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Google Scholar), whereas low dose cytochalasin D directly releases integrins from the cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin polymerization. In this initial step, the adhesion complex is not supported by a reorganized actin cytoskeleton, so the cells are not stably adhered. In the second step, integrin receptors are clustered; the phosphorylated MacMARCKS is dephosphorylated, and the adhesion complex is supported by a reorganized actin cytoskeleton, leading to stable strong adhesion. Thus, when actin cytoskeleton-dependent re-structuring was disrupted by the high concentration of cytochalasin D, cell adhesion was inhibited. Our studies indicate that Rap1 activation is required for this second step, perhaps in part modulating receptor affinity as suggested by Guerrero et al. (22Guerrero C. Fernandez-Medarde A. Rojas J.M. Font de Mora J. Esteban L.M. Santos E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 613-624Google Scholar). Adhesion induced by outside-in signaling with high density ligand is clearly distinct from PMA-stimulated, inside-out signaling. In contrast to PMA-stimulated adhesion, it is not dependent upon Rap1 activation or reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. It was also not blocked by treatment with inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (genistein), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY-294002), PKC (staurosporine), mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD-98059) or Rho kinase (Y-27632). It is surprising that such relatively small changes in ligand densityin vitro (i.e. from 1 to 2 μg/ml FN in this study or from 200 to 700 sites/μm2 of VCAM-1 in the study by Grabovsky et al. (37Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs D.A. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R.R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-506Google Scholar), so dramatically affect integrin-dependent adhesion. Unstimulated adhesion induced by high ligand density was nearly comparable with PMA-stimulated adhesion at low ligand density and was independent of Rap1 activation or cytoskeletal rearrangement. Because leukocytes might reasonably encounter high density ligand on the surface of endothelial cells or in tissue, further characterization of this novel pathway of adhesion is warranted.

Van Alphen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 51-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) which is strictly asymmetric with respect to its lipid composition. Whereas the inner membrane (IM) is composed on both sides of phospholipids, the OM consists of a phospholipid inner leaflet and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer leaflet. The LPS consists of an oligo- or polysaccharide portion covalently linked to a lipid component termed lipid A, which anchors the molecule in the membrane (2Rietschel E.Th. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Za¨hringer U. Seydel U., Di Padova F. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). In wild-type strains, the polysaccharide portion consists of an O-specific chain and the core oligosaccharide. Rough mutant strains do not express theO-specific chain, but retain core oligosaccharides of varying length. The LPS of various rough mutants are characterized by chemotypes in a sequence of decreasing length of the core sugar as Ra (complete core), Rb, Rc, Rd, and Re. Deep-rough LPS (Re LPS) represents the minimal structure of LPS consisting of only lipid A and two 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) monosaccharides (3Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The OM protects the cell from harmful agents like antibiotics and toxins and against changes in osmotic pressure. Transmembrane proteins, the porins, allowing the uptake and disposal of small hydrophilic compounds such as nutrients and waste products (4Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are assembled in the OM. In Escherichia coli OmpF and OmpC represent the general diffusion pores. The phosphoporin PhoE is synthesized when cells are grown under phosphate limitation (5Overbeeke N. Lugtenberg B. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PhoE has a molecular weight of Mr 36,822 and an exclusion size ofMr ∼600 and is weakly anion selective (6Benz R. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PhoE has been solved (7Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The channel-forming motif of PhoE is a 16-strand anti-parallel β-barrel. Short β-hairpin turns define the periplasmic end of the barrel, whereas long irregular loops are found at the cell surface. The functional unit of this protein is a trimer. Outer membrane proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytoplasm. After their translocation across the IM via the Sec machinery (8Bernstein H.D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and processing to mature protein, they are assembled into the OM. The amino-terminal signal sequence is removed during or after translocation through the IM (9Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Re mutants contain reduced amounts of PhoE (10Tommassen J. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 118-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other outer membrane proteins (11Ames G.F.L. Spudich E.N. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 406-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From in vitro studies it is known that the efficiency of assembly of porins in the OM decreases from strains with an LPS with a complete core sugar moiety to those with an LPS with a short sugar moiety. For PhoE a decrease of 95% was found for a Re mutant in comparison to a Ra mutant (12De Cock H. van Blokland S. Tommassen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12885-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown in anin vitro model that the chemical structure and the biophysical properties of LPS are important for a correct and efficient folding of PhoE into a native-like, trimerization-competent, folded monomeric form (13De Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The folding of in vitro synthesized non-native PhoE protein into a native-like monomeric form was more efficient with LPS of chemotype Ra (Ra LPS) as compared to Re LPS, lacking a large part of the core. The absence or presence of a negative charge at the first heptose in the core region seemed to be of special importance in this respect. Also, the efficiency of folding and trimerization of OmpF porin in vitro was shown to depend on the LPS structure (14Sen K. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 926-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the effect of the chemical structure of LPS, in particular that of the length of the core sugar moiety on the pore formation by PhoE trimers and its pore function in the OM. To this end, electrical measurements were performed on reconstituted OM as asymmetric planar membranes according to the Montal-Mueller technique. For porin from Paracoccus denitrificans, the role of LPS in pore formation and pore function has been shown earlier (15Wiese A. Schro¨der G. Brandenburg K. Hirsch A. Welte W. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Wiese A. Reiners J.O. Brandenburg K. Kawahara K. Za¨hringer U. Seydel U. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These authors prepared membranes from Re LPS from S. entericaserovar Minnesota (S. minnesota) strain R595 or monosaccharide-type fraction of glycosphingolipid (GSL-1), which substitutes for LPS in the OM of Sphingomonas paucimobilis(17Kawahara K. Matsuura M. Danbara H. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1990; 43: 250PubMed Google Scholar), on one side and a phospholipid mixture (PL) resembling the composition of the inner leaflet on the other side. It was found that the pore formation rate in glycolipid/PL membranes was by an order of magnitude higher than in symmetric PL membranes. The influence of the length of the saccharide portion was, however, not investigated. Therefore, we then focused on the effect of the core oligosaccharide on pore formation rate of PhoE and on the voltage-dependent gating of the pores formed. Instead of LPS from E. coli, that from S. minnesota, which has a high homology to LPS from E. coli, was used because of the availability of a series of LPS with variable length of the sugar moiety (Fig.1B). We found that in general the pore formation rate increased with increasing length of the sugar moiety, whereas only slight differences in the pore formation rate could be observed for Re LPS from various strains. The voltage-dependent gating of PhoE pores was strongly dependent on the composition of the lipid matrix. In general, the voltage necessary for closure of PhoE was ‖VC‖ ≥ 50 mV. Therefore, the transmembrane voltage across the bacterial OM of VOM = 26 mV (inside negative) (18Sen K. Hellman J. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1182-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) seems to be too low to initiate voltage-dependent closure of PhoE; however, the transmembrane voltage across the IM of VIM = 140–160 mV (inside negative) (19Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would lead to closure of accidentally incorporated porins in the IM. Thus, porin gating could be an important mechanism for self-protection of Gram-negative bacteria. Rough mutant LPS from S. minnesota strains R595 (LPS R595), R7 (LPS R7), R5 (LPS R5), R345 (LPS R345), R60 (LPS R60), E. coli strain F515 (LPS F515), and P. mirabilis strain R45 (LPS R45) were used in experiments with asymmetric PL/LPS membranes. The chemical structure of various Re LPS used in our experiments is shown in Fig. 1A, those of the core region of different chemotypes of LPS from S. minnesota in Fig. 1B. LPS was extracted by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (20Galanos C. Lu¨deritz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) and purified, lyophilized, and transformed into the triethylamine salt form. The amount of the nonstoichiometric substitutions was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from E. coli, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) from egg yolk lecithin (sodium salt), and synthetic diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. The mature form of PhoE protein was expressed and isolated from E. coli strain Bl21(DE3) cells containing plasmid pCJ2 and refolded into a trypsin-resistant form as described previously (21Jansen C. Heutink M. Tommassen J. De Cock H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3792-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After refolding, the proteins were treated with trypsin (30 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C followed by an incubation with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0 °C for 1 h to inhibit the protease. After concentration of the protein solution with centriprep 10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA, United States), the solution was dialyzed against buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.46 mm Tween 20) with 3 changes at 4 °C. Refolded proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose HR (Amersham Biosciences) using a Gradifrac (Amersham Biosciences), and bound protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of buffer A to 0.5 m NaCl. Peak fractions containing the refolded protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C. Aliquots of protein solution (∼0.5 mg/ml protein) were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, samples containing refolded proteins incubated in 2% SDS-sample buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, 56 °C or 100 °C, were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously (21Jansen C. Heutink M. Tommassen J. De Cock H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3792-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Refolded protein consisted mostly of heat-stable trimers (Fig.2, T) with small amounts of folded monomers (Fig. 2, m*, lane 1) and very low amounts of dimeric forms (Fig. 2, D, hardly visible inlane 1). Heating for 10 min at 56 °C will denature monomeric, dimeric, and small amounts of heat-unstable forms of PhoE, resulting in detection of heat-stable trimers (Fig, 2, T,lane 2). After heating for 10 min at 100 °C all forms were denatured, resulting in detection of denatured PhoE monomers (Fig.2, m, lane 3). PhoE was diluted in aqueous solution containing 0.15 mg/ml Triton X-100 and stored at 4 °C for at least 3 days before usage. For the investigation of pore formation by PhoE and its pore function in different lipid matrices, planar bilayers according to the Montal- Mueller technique (22Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously (23Wiese A. Seydel U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 355-370PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, asymmetric bilayers were formed by opposing two lipid monolayers, one from LPS, the other from PL, prepared on aqueous subphases (1.5 ml each) from chloroformic solutions of the lipids at a small aperture (typically 150 μm diameter) in a thin Teflon septum (12.5 μm thickness). PL is composed of PE, PG, and DPG in molar ratios of 81:17:2 resembling the phospholipid composition of the inner leaflet of the outer membrane of S. entericaserovar Typhimurium (24Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For electrical measurements, the planar membranes were voltage clamped via a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes connected to the head stage of a patch-clamp amplifier. In all cases the compartment opposite where the porin was added was grounded. If not otherwise mentioned, measurements were performed at a temperature of 37 °C with subphases consisting of 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.0. The specific electrical conductivity of this bathing solution at 37 °C was 17.2 millisiemens cm−1. At the beginning of each experiment the correct membrane formation was checked by measuring membrane current and capacitance. Only membranes with a basic current of less than ±2.5 pA at a clamp voltage of ±100 mV were used for the experiments. PhoE was added to the PL side of the bilayer. To investigate the influence of the lipid matrix on pore formation, 20 ng PhoE were added to the PL side of various PL/LPS membranes. Fig. 3represents a typical current trace for pore formation by PhoE added to the PL side of an asymmetric lipid bilayer with Ra LPS from S. minnesota strain R60 on the opposite side at a clamp voltage of 20 mV. 90 s after porin addition, the current increased stepwise. About 6 min after porin addition the pore formation rate declined, and pore formation stopped about 30 min after porin addition. The number of pores was calculated from the current traces as the quotient of membrane and single-channel current. When PhoE (up to an amount of 2 μg) was added to the LPS side of a PL/LPS membrane, no increase in membrane current was observed. Control experiments with 4.5 μg Triton X-100 showed no changes in membrane current. The histogram of amplitudes of current steps is shown in Fig.4 exemplarily for PL/LPS R60 membranes. The single-channel current was derived from the histogram by gauss approximation. Table I summarizes the mean current increments of single PhoE trimers in different lipid matrices. For all membranes, nearly no differences in the single-channel current were observed. Only for lipid matrices containing LPS R5 and PG slightly, but not significantly, smaller single-channel currents were determined.Table ISingle-channel Current ΛLipidLPS F515LPS R45LPS R595LPS R7LPS R5LPS R345LPS R60PGΛ/pA10.811.210.610.09.010.411.27.6ΔΛ/pA5.03.25.31.45.07.82.45.2The single-channel currents Λ of PhoE at a clamp-voltage of 20 mV in different lipid matrices composed on the one side of PL and on the other of different chemotypes of LPS from S. minnesota, Re LPS from various Gram-negative species, i.e., E. coli strain F515, P. mirabilis strain R45, and PG as a charged phospholipid were obtained by gauss-approximation from the histograms of amplitudes of current steps.

The mean number of pores formed by PhoE in different lipid matrices made from PL on the side of porin addition and of rough mutant LPS fromS. minnesota on the opposite side at a clamp voltage of 20 mV at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after porin addition are presented in Fig.5A. Each value represents the mean number of pores found in 3–5 successful experiments. Because of membrane rupture at an early stage, many experiments could not be considered. In general, membrane stability decreased with increasing length of the core sugar moiety. Furthermore, we were not successful forming stable bilayers using LPS from S. minnesota strains R4. The mean number of pores formed within 20 min decreases from LPS R60, which is set to 100%, over LPS R345 (71%), LPS R5 (16%), and LPS R7 (24%) to LPS R595 (6%). The sequence of the traces representing the data obtained with the various LPS chemotypes is the same at any time point, i.e. they do not cross. According to Student’s t test, the significance level of the number of pores incorporated up to 20 min between the two most different chemotypes, LPS R60 and LPS R595, is <0.01. The corresponding significance levels between two neighboring traces are ≤0.61 (e.g. 0.61 for LPS R60 and LPS R345, 0.60 for LPS R345 and LPS R7, 0.48 for LPS R7 and LPS R5, and 0.23 for LPS R5 and LPS R595) because of the large error bars. The significance levels between more distant traces are smaller than 0.15, with the exception of the value between LPS R345 and LPS R5 (0.34). In Fig. 5B, the mean numbers of PhoE pores (determined as described before) in lipid matrices composed of PL on the side of porin addition and Re LPS from various Gram-negative species (i.e. S. minnesota strain R595, E. coli strain F515, and P. mirabilis strain R45) on the other side are depicted. PG has been used as an example of a negatively charged phospholipid. The number of pores at 20 min decreased from 15% in the case of LPS F515, 9% (LPS R45), and 6% (LPS R595) to, in the case of PG, 2% of the values found for LPS R60. The value for symmetrical PL/PL membranes is comparable to those found for PL/PG membranes (data not shown). Furthermore, it should be mentioned that in general the final number of pores reached increases from Re LPS to Ra LPS. For LPS with a short sugar moiety this finish is reached 15 to 20 min after porin addition. For LPS with a longer sugar moiety, in particular for LPS R60 and LPS R345, the maximum is reached about 20–30 min after porin addition. The effect of the Mg2+ concentration on pore formation by PhoE was determined for PL/LPS F515 membranes prepared in different subphases containing 1, 5, and 15 mm MgCl2, respectively. The rate of pore formation after the addition of 20 ng PhoE decreased drastically with increasing Mg2+concentration (data not shown). About 20 min after porin addition, the increase in membrane current ceased. To characterize the voltage-dependent closure of PhoE, current/voltage characteristics of the PhoE trimers were recorded by applying a triangular voltage (3.2 mV/s) with an amplitude of 200 mV. All curves were recorded at least twice from independent membrane preparations. The recordings were repeated several times in each experiment (until the membrane broke), and the depicted curves in Fig.6 are in each case averages over all respective data. The plotted current is normalized to the current determined at a clamp voltage of +40 mV at which all pores were found in the open state. At small absolute clamp voltages (‖V‖ < 50 mV) the membrane current was proportional to the transmembrane voltage. At higher absolute clamp voltages an underproportional increase, a steady state, or a decrease of membrane current was detected because of the closure of porin channels. The current/voltage characteristics show a hysteretic behavior. The efficiency of voltage-dependent closure can be taken from the onset and the shape of the hysteresis loops. In Fig. 6A current/voltage characteristics of PhoE incorporated into different lipid bilayers made from PL on the side of porin addition and from rough mutant LPS from various S. minnesota strains on the other side are shown. To better distinguish between different traces the respective clamp voltages at which deviation from linearity in the positive and in the negative voltage ranges occurred because of channel closing. VC+ and VC− are given in the figure legend. At negative clamp voltages nearly no voltage-dependent closure of the porin channels occurred. In the positive range at clamp voltages above 50 mV, a hysteretic current/voltage characteristic was observed. The efficiency of voltage-dependent closure increased with the length of the sugar portion of the LPS from LPS R595 over LPS R7 to LPS R5. In the case of LPS R345, the efficiency of voltage-dependent closure decreased in comparison to LPS R5. In the case of LPS R60, we were not able to successfully record a current/voltage characteristic because of the instability of the lipid bilayer. In Fig. 6B, the current/voltage characteristics of PhoE incorporated into lipid bilayers containing Re LPS from various species (i.e. S. minnesota strain R595, E. coli strain F515, and P. mirabilis strain R45), PG as a negatively charged phospholipid, and PL (reconstitution of the cytoplasmic membrane) on the one side and PL on the other side are depicted. For all LPS, except that from S. minnesota strain R595, an effective closure of PhoE was also observed at negative clamp voltages of about −100 to −120 mV. At positive clamp voltages for LPS F515 a strong decrease in membrane current occurred. For LPS R45 and LPS R595 only a steady state was reached, and accordingly the hysteretic character of the current trace was much smaller. For both phospholipid systems effective closure of PhoE was observed in the positive voltage range. At negative clamp voltages, gating was much more pronounced in PL/PG than in PL/PL membranes, yielding almost symmetric current/voltage characteristics in the former and an asymmetric characteristic in the latter case. In the past, several investigations have been published aiming at an understanding of the role of LPS in the biogenesis of porins. Performing in vitro folding studies, it has been shown that LPS is required for correct and efficient folding of PhoE into a folded monomeric intermediate (13De Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that LPS influences folding and trimerization of OmpF protein (25Sen K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11295-11300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation we observed that the composition of the lipid bilayer, and particularly the chemical structure of LPS used for membrane reconstitution, plays an important and probably major role in the incorporation and/or late steps of pore formation by PhoE. Furthermore, we found that the electrical properties of the trimer are influenced by the composition of the lipid matrix. It was shown previously in in vitro studies that the efficiency of assembly of an in vitro synthesized PhoE protein into the OM of different E. coli mutants decreases by about 95% from Ra to Re mutants (12De Cock H. van Blokland S. Tommassen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12885-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In that system, folding, trimerization, and insertion into the OM could not be distinguished. Subsequently it was shown that LPS was required in an early step in folding, the formation of the folded monomer (26De Cock H. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5567-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Re LPS was far less efficient in supporting the folding of PhoE as compared with Ra LPS (13De Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These monomers represent genuine intermediates since they could be trimerized into native-like trimers after incubation with OM, in which they appeared to be inserted since they could not be extracted with urea. Now we observe that the composition of the lipid matrix has a strong influence on late steps in the biogenesis, insertion, and/or pore formation of in vitro folded and LPS-free porin since the efficiency of pore formation by PhoE differs in lipid matrices containing different chemotypes of LPS from S. minnesota. In general, the number of pores incorporated at a given time decreased from Ra LPS (LPS R60) to Re LPS (LPS R595) (Fig5A). The brought distribution of the mean number of pores at a given time in a particular membrane system can be explained by differences in the time for diffusion of the porins from the locus of addition to the subphase to the membrane surface in repetitive experiments. Because of the partly overlapping error bars, a quantitative correlation between pore formation and lipid composition can not be established between traces corresponding to neighboring chemotypes. However, with increasing distance between the chemotypes the significance levels decrease to p < 0.01 between LPS R60 and LPS R595. Therefore, from the fact that the sequence in the number of pores incorporated into the various lipid matrices was the same at any time, it can be deduced that the lipid matrix determines the efficiency of porin assembly into the OM. The presence of LPS with a longer core sugar moiety on the membrane leaflet opposite porin addition thus promotes all steps in porin assembly. Now, as the composition of the lipid bilayer, in particular the LPS chemotype on the side opposite to porin addition, determines the pore formation rate, the question arises as to which physicochemical membrane properties are responsible for this observation. Here in the first place membrane fluidity and surface charge density have to be considered. It has been shown earlier that an increase in membrane fluidity increases the formation of lytic membrane pores by the complement system (27Wiese A. Gru¨newald P. Schaper K.J. Seydel U. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this parameter cannot explain the positive correlation between pore formation and the length of the core sugar moiety, because membrane fluidity varies only slightly for the LPS used in the present investigation (28Brandenburg K. Kusumoto S. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the least efficient pore formation was observed in PL/PG and PL/PL membranes that have the highest fluidity of all lipids used. In the case of asymmetric PL/LPS bilayers, a potential gradient arises from the higher surface charge density on the LPS side as compared with the PL side. Thus, for the influence of the core sugar moiety on pore formation, a positive correlation between the number of negative charges and the pore formation by PhoE can be stated. LPS R60 and LPS R345, which give rise to the highest pore formation, carry at least 5 negative charges. LPS R7, LPS R5, and LPS F515, with 4 negative charges each, are in the intermediate range. LPS R595 and LPS R45, carrying less than 4 charges each, show even smaller pore formation rates. Also, the decrease in pore formation at higher Mg2+ concentration could be explained by a reduction of negative charges on the LPS side. However, it should be mentioned that the higher pore formation rate in PL/LPS R60 membranes compared with PL/LPS R345 membranes, as well as the same rate in PL/LPS R595 and PL/LPS R45 membranes, cannot be explained by differences in the respective LPS charges. Furthermore, it can be taken from the current/voltage characteristics that a high external potential does not induce any further pore formation (Fig. 6,A and B). This effect might be explained assuming that the potential gradient is not responsible for the differences in pore formation rates. Rather, specific interactions between the divalent cations and the negative charges at the outer side of the porin and the negative groups of the glycolipids stabilizing the porin in its functional transmembrane configuration (29Weiss M.S. Abele U. Weckesser J. Welte W. Schiltz E. Schulz G.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 30Weiss M.S. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 493-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) are responsible for the differences in pore formation rates. These specific interactions might also explain why the number of pores found in PL/LPS R7 membranes is slightly higher than in PL/LPS R5 membranes, although the core region of the latter carries an additional glucose. In addition to membrane fluidity and negative surface charge, several further structural parameters of LPS that might influence pore formation are known. Thus, the tendency of the lipid A portion of the LPS to form nonlamellar structures (31Brandenburg K. Richter W. Koch M.H.J. Meyer H.W. Seydel U. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 91: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) might influence the stability of the LPS side of the PL/LPS bilayer. For the S. minnesotachemotypes, which have identical lipid A portions, membrane stability might be further reduced by the increasing length of the core sugar because of the increasing hydrophilicity of the LPS and repulsion between increasing numbers of negative charges. Within the context of membrane stability, the reduced pore formation by PhoE in PL/LPS F515 bilayers prepared in subphases containing higher amounts of Mg2+ can be understood on the basis of an increased membrane stability attributed to cross linking of LPS molecules by the divalent cations (4Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reduction of the stability of the LPS layer might do one of the following: (i) allow pore formation by porins already inserted into the PL side or (ii) influence the stability of the entire membrane and thus facilitate insertion and pore formation. The former possibility seems to be unlikely, because lower amounts of PhoE (10Tommassen J. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 118-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Korteland J. Lugtenberg B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 774: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and other outer membrane proteins (11Ames G.F.L. Spudich E.N. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 406-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been found in Re mutants than in wild-type bacteria, indicating that these proteins do not insert into the membrane. The differences in pore formation between PL/LPS R595 and PL/LPS R45 membranes on the one and PL/LPS F515 membranes (Fig. 5B) on the other hand can be explained by the additional 4-amino-4-deoxy-β-l-arabinose at the lipid A portion that leads to a reduction of the net negative charge from 4 to 3.5. However, the second 4-amino-4-deoxy-β-l-arabinose on the first Kdo of LPS R45, which causes a further reduction of the charge to 3, has no influence on pore formation. This might be explained by a compensation of the destabilizing contribution of the higher charge of LPS R595 by the stabilizing effect of an additional fatty acid (Fig.1A). Our findings also answer a question raised by Korteland and Lugtenberg (32Korteland J. Lugtenberg B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 774: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These authors had shown in in vivo studies that the uptake of negatively charged substrates by PhoE was more efficient in Re mutants. They stated that these findings are a consequence of one of the following: (i) an increased effective diameter of the pore (ii) an increased amount of open, functional pores or (iii) the absence of sterical hindrance by the sugar and the loss of negatively charged phosphate groups leading to reduced charge repulsion. From our data it is obvious that the diameter of the pore does not change (TableI), the number of open pores does not increase (Fig. 5), and therefore, the absence of a sterical hindrance and reduced charge repulsion seem to be more likely. In Gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic space is highly anionic compared with the external medium, mainly because of the anionic membrane-derived oligosaccharides. Membrane-derived oligosaccharides contribute to the Donnan potential across the outer membrane VOM, which was determined for E. coli in the presence of an external cation concentration of 100 mmto be 26 mV (inside negative) (18Sen K. Hellman J. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1182-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the IM, a voltage of ∼150 mV (inside negative) is discussed (19Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all lipid matrices used in this study, the voltage required for voltage-dependent closure is ‖V‖ > 50 mV (Fig. 6,A and B). Thus, from our data it may be concluded that all PhoE porins incorporated into the OM are in the open state, and therefore, they have no function for the regulation of the transmembrane voltage. Interestingly, in the case of PL/PL membranes the voltage required for closure of PhoE is ≤125 mV in both directions, which is in the same order of magnitude as the proposed transmembrane voltage across the IM. Similar values have also been found in patch-clamp experiments on giant vesicles made from azolectin (33Berrier C. Besnard M. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, as was previously suggested (34Eppens E.F. Saint N. Van Gelder P. van Boxtel R. Tommassen J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), if trimers were missorted to the IM, pores would be closed to prevent a short circuit destroying the electrochemical potential across the IM. The IM is thus protected by the following two mechanisms: (i) the reduced pore formation in phospholipid membranes as compared with PL/LPS membranes and (ii) the voltage-dependent closure of PhoE accidentally incorporated into the IM. From the asymmetry of the current/voltage characteristics of PhoE incorporated into symmetric PL/PL membranes, a directed incorporation of the porin can be deduced as it has been discussed in more detail with the porin from P. denitrificans (15Wiese A. Schro¨der G. Brandenburg K. Hirsch A. Welte W. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), very likely with extracellular loops facing outwards. For porin from P. denitrificans, a correlation between the surface charge density of the glycolipid leaflet and porin gating was found when the LPS side of the membrane was at a negative potential with regard to the PL side (15Wiese A. Schro¨der G. Brandenburg K. Hirsch A. Welte W. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Wiese A. Reiners J.O. Brandenburg K. Kawahara K. Za¨hringer U. Seydel U. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies were, however, restricted to Re LPS and GSL-1. In Fig. 6B it can be seen that under the same conditions (positive voltage,i.e. LPS side negative) PhoE channel closing is most pronounced for LPS F515, which carries 4 negative charges, and decreases over LPS R595 to LPS R45, which carries 3 negative charges. However, for PhoE incorporated into the PL/LPS bilayers containing LPS from various strains of S. minnesota (Fig.6A), channel closing is more efficient for PL/LPS R5 membranes followed by PL/LPS R7, and is least efficient in PL/LPS R595 membranes, given that all LPS carry 3 to 4 negative charges and the increase in negative charge from these LPS to LPS R345 does lead to a decreased gating compared with LPS R5. Furthermore, the gating was most efficient for PL/PG membranes despite the fact that the absolute value of the surface charge density is lower than for LPS R45. Interestingly, in the positive voltage range the clamp voltage necessary to induce pore closure of PhoE in lipid bilayers containing on one side LPS from S. minnesota strains R595, R7, or R5 seems to decrease with increasing length of the sugar moiety. These data indicate that not only for the pore formation but also for the gating, not the surface charge density, but particular functional groups of the LPS are decisive. Specific interactions between LPS and the extracellular loops could influence their conformational changes, which according to studies using atomic force microscopy are involved in the gating process (35Mu¨ller D.J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For negative clamp voltages down to −200 mV for all membranes made from LPS from S. minnesota, almost no voltage-dependent closure can be seen. This observation is in complete contrast to the data obtained for LPS F515, LPS R45, and PG showing a pronounced closing in the negative voltage range (Fig.6B). This effect might be explained by mechanical stress caused by the additional fatty acid of LPS from S. minnesotacompared with that from E. coli. An influence of the acyl chain region of the lipid matrix on porin gating has also been observed for porin from P. denitrificans (15Wiese A. Schro¨der G. Brandenburg K. Hirsch A. Welte W. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) where gating was completely inhibited at temperatures below the phase transition temperature of the LPS. Thus, the additional fatty acid may have a similar effect on the porin channel as acyl chain rigidification. Our data clearly emphasize the role of LPS in pore formation by and function of PhoE. In particular, from the qualitatively different incorporation rates it can be deduced that LPS is the parameter governing the formation of porin channels in the reconstituted OM and that no particular insertion sites are required and, thus, LPS has an important function for the late steps in porin biogenesis. The LPS chemical structure does, however, not only influence pore formation, but also channel gating. Thus, it is of unique importance to consider the asymmetric composition of the OM of Gram-negative bacteria with LPS on one side and PL on the other side when aiming at the determination of porin function in reconstitution systems."
https://openalex.org/W1998549696,"Bisindolylmaleimides (Bis) were originally described as protein kinase C inhibitors. Several studies have shown that Bis potentiate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family-mediated apoptosis in lymphoid and dendritic cells, but the inhibition of protein kinase C cannot account for these effects (Zhou, T., Song, L., Yang, P., Wang, Z., Lui, D., and Jope, R. S. (1999) Nat. Med. 5, 42–48). We investigated the effect of four Bis derivatives (I, II, VIII, and IX) in human prostatic carcinoma cell lines and found that Bis IX was the most potent inducer of apoptosis under simultaneous treatment with TNF-α, agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Bis IX synergistically induced caspase activity in combination with apoptosis-inducing ligands and converted the phenotype of cell lines from apoptosis-resistant to -sensitive. Bis IX induced p53 accumulation in LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of prostate), which expresses wild-type p53 that was not accompanied by the induction of p53-responsive genes, p21/WAF1, and Mdm2. Moreover, the induction of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 by doxorubicin was abrogated by simultaneous treatment with Bis IX. These effects apparently result from general inhibition of transcription by Bis IX. We have shown by Northern blot analysis that the transcription activity of the hygromycin gene after transient transfection of pcDNA3.1-Hygro plasmid in 293 and HeLa cells was inhibited by Bis IX in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DNA binding activity of Bis IX was prevented by actinomycin D, suggesting that actinomycin D and Bis IX have similar mechanisms of interaction with DNA. In addition, we found that actinomycin D and Bis IX induced caspase activity to the same extent during TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In summary, these results suggest that Bis IX potentiates TNF receptor family-mediated cell death in part as an inhibitor of transcription.

Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) estimated the potentiating effect of nine Bis derivatives on Fas-mediated apoptosis in astrocytoma 1321N1 cells and found that some Bis derivatives were capable of substantially facilitating Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells. The greatest potentiation was found with Bis VIII and IX; Bis III, X, and XI produced intermediate potentiation, whereas Bis I, II, and IV did not potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis. The Bis derivatives tested were described as potent inhibitors of PKC, but three other PKC inhibitors structurally unrelated to Bis were tested and were ineffective in potentiating Fas-mediated apoptosis. Based on these results, the authors concluded that the inhibition of PKC could not account for the potentiation of Fas-mediated apoptosis by Bis. The authors also showed that Bis VIII potentiated TNF-mediated apoptosis in 1321N1 cells and greatly facilitated Fas-mediated apoptosis in several human T cell lines and in activated T cells. In contrast, Bis VIII did not facilitate apoptosis in 1321N1 cells treated with dexamethasone or irradiation. They concluded that Bis VIII selectively facilitates apoptosis induced by activation of the TNF receptor family. In addition, several Bis derivatives (I, II, III, IV, and VIII) have been found to facilitate Fas- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human dendritic cells (5Willerns F. Amraoui Z. Vanderheyde N. Verhasselt V. Askoy E. Scaffidi C. Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Goldman M. Blood. 2000; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bis VIII has also been described to potentiate TNF-α-, Fas-, and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells (6Meng X.W. Helderbrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the critical factors involved in the effects of Bis are still not understood. The objective of the current study was to determine whether Bis can potentiate TNF receptor family-mediated apoptosis in human prostatic carcinoma cell lines. We examined the effect of Bis I, II, VIII, and IX in three human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, DU145, LNCaP, and PC3. These experiments showed that Bis IX was the most potent inducer of apoptosis under simultaneous treatment with TNF-α, agonistic anti-Fas mAb (IPO-4), and TRAIL. Further, Bis IX binds to the mitochondria and inhibits transcription by binding with DNA to the actinomycin D (act D)-related sites. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms by which Bis IX potentiates TNF receptor family-mediated apoptosis. The human prostatic carcinoma cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 were cultured in RPMI 1640 as has been described previously (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). Human TRAIL was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ), TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and agonistic anti-Fas (IgM) mAb was described previously (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). Bis I, II, VIII, and IX were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Cycloheximide and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. To measure cell viability, we used calcein AM assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously (8Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson M.C. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was estimated by caspase activation using both fluorogenic substrates and Western blot analysis and proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase as described previously (9Rokhlin O.W. Gudkov A.V. Kwek S. Glover R.A. Gewies A.S. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In order to measure caspase activity with fluorogenic substrates, cytosolic extracts were prepared in 1% Triton X-100 buffer, pH 7.2 containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. 40 μg of protein lysate was incubated for 60 min in assay buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose) with 40 μm fluorescent substrates (Biomol): Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate that is cleaved by caspase-3, -7, and to some extent -8; Ac-VEID-AMC as a substrate for caspase-6; and Ac-LEHD-AMC as a substrate for caspase-9. Western blot detection of proteins was performed as described previously (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with the corresponding mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies: anti-cytochrome c, anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PharMingen), cytochrome oxidase (subunit II; Molecular Probes), anti-caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-caspase-2, (R&D Systems), anti-caspase-8, (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), anti-caspase-7, and anti-caspase-9 (Oncogene, Uniondale, NY). The blots were counterstained with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubation of the membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Mitochondria and mitochondria-free cytosol were prepared as described (10Gewies A. Rokhlin O.W. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2163-2168PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold Mito-buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) by homogenization in a small glass homogenizer with Teflon pestle. The homogenates were first spun at 800 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris and were then spun twice at 16,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatants were used as mitochondria-free cytosol, and the absence of mitochondria in the cytosol was examined with anti-cytochrome oxidase antibodies by Western blot analysis. Pelleted mitochondria were washed twice with Mito-buffer, 10 μm Bis IX was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with different amounts of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions in 200 μl of Mito buffer, and fluorescence was measured with an FL600 fluorimeter using an excitation wave length at 485 nm and emission wave length at 645 nm. In addition, different amounts of cardiolipin (CDL) were incubated with Bis IX for 30 min, and fluorescence was then measured. LNCaP cells were grown on glass slides coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) and treated with Bis IX (10 μm) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and fluorescent Bis IX was observed in cells using either a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope or Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a fluorescence microscopy filter (no. 14) and Spot 2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). 293 and HeLa cells were transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection protocol (Invitrogen). Four hours after transfection, serum-free medium was changed to medium containing serum. After 20 h of incubation with drugs (24 h after transfection), RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis of RNA samples was performed by resolving RNA samples (10 μg/lane) on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotting onto Hybond-N nylon membrane as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled probe containing hygromycin gene sequence was generated using primers pcDNA3.1-1739 5′-dtgtgtcagttagggtgtgg-3′ as forward and pcDNA3.1–3564 5′-dgcaattaatgtggagttag-3′ as reverse. The SV40 promoter controls expression of the hygromycin gene in pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) with random priming protocol. The probes were detected using PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). We have shown previously that LNCaP and DU145 are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Bis could modulate this resistance. LNCaP and DU145 were treated with four different Bis derivatives: I, II, VIII, and IX. Cells were treated either with Bis alone or in combination with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies (IPO-4). As shown in Fig. 1, the most prominent effect was detected with Bis IX. This compound in combination with IPO-4 induced cell death in almost 80% of the cells. Importantly, Bis IX alone induced cell death in only 20% of the cells, whereas anti-Fas alone induced cell death in 5–10% of the cells. These results indicate that of the four different Bis derivatives tested, Bis IX was the most active compound in converting LNCaP and DU145 cells from Fas-resistant to Fas-sensitive. We subsequently investigated whether Bis IX could potentiate TNF-α− and TRAIL-induced cell death. We have previously reported that PC3 is sensitive to Fas- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar), LNCaP is sensitive to TNF-α treatment but resistant to Fas- and TRAIL-mediated cell death, and DU145 is resistant to treatment with all three ligands (9Rokhlin O.W. Gudkov A.V. Kwek S. Glover R.A. Gewies A.S. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,11Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N.V. Tagiyev A.F. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Prostate. 2002; 52: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also investigated whether Bis IX could potentiate cell death in sensitive cell lines under treatment with low concentrations of death-inducing ligands that by themselves cannot induce cell death. As shown in Fig. 2, Bis IX alone can kill only 20–30% of cells after 24 h of treatment. Importantly, Bis IX in combination with TNF-α, anti-Fas mAb, and TRAIL was found to be capable of enhancing cell death in up to 60–90% of all cell lines tested after 24 h of treatment. Only in DU145 did we not observe the potentiating effect of Bis IX under simultaneous treatment with TNF-α. The highest potentiating effect of Bis IX was observed after treatment of cells in the presence of TRAIL. However, the killing effect of Bis IX alone was found to be sharply increased after 48 h of treatment. Although the potentiating effect of Bis IX was still observed after 48 h of treatment in combination with death-inducing ligands, this effect was not as prominent after 48 h as it was after 24 h of treatment. These data suggest that Bis IX affects some factor(s) that is responsible for resistance to all three death-inducing ligands. We next investigated the activation of caspases under Bis IX treatment in combination with TNF-α, anti-Fas mAb, and TRAIL. Caspase activity was estimated using three different fluorogenic substrates. PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 were treated for 2 and 8 h either with Bis IX and ligands separately or simultaneously. Low levels of caspase activity were detected after 2 h of treatment (data not shown), but caspase activity was sharply increased after 8 h of treatment (Fig.3). As seen in Fig. 3, Bis IX alone only induced VEIDase activity in LNCaP. However, Bis IX dramatically increased DEVDase activity under simultaneous treatment with TNF-α, anti-Fas, and TRAIL in all cell lines. Bis IX also increased VEIDase activity in PC3 and LNCaP, but VEIDase activity in DU145 was found to be low. Although LEHDase activity was lower in PC3 and LNCaP compared with DEVDase and VEIDase activities, Bis IX clearly increased LEHDase activity under simultaneous treatment with apoptosis-inducing ligands. These results indicate that Bis IX potentiates activation of caspases and suggest that the mechanism of cell death is caspase-dependent. Some cytotoxic drugs induce cell death via up-regulation of death receptors (12Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bis IX-mediated cell death occurs by this mechanism, we attempted to investigate the levels of death receptor expression under Bis IX treatment by flow cytometric analysis. During these experiments we unexpectedly found very high levels of fluorescence in the cells treated with Bis IX but not stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled Abs. This high level of fluorescence was noted only on the PE channel (emission at 575/26 nm) but not on the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel (emission at 530/30 nm); red fluorescence (PE channel) of LNCaP treated with Bis IX increased 50× compared with untreated cells. Cells were incubated with 10 μm Bis for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS, and the fluorescence of Bis I, II, VIII, and IX was measured using both flow cytometric analysis and a fluorimetric assay (FL600, Bio-Tek Instruments). The fluorescence was excited at 485 nm and analyzed at 530, 590, and 645 nm. We found that after incubation with cells the red fluorescence of Bis IX (emission at 590 and 645 nm) sharply increased, whereas the fluorescence of Bis I, II, and VIII remained at lower levels (Table I). These data show that all Bis samples tested became fluorescent in the cells, and the highest level of fluorescence was noted for Bis IX.Table IFluorescence properties of Bis I, II, VIII, and IXEmissionFluorimeterFlow cytometer530590645FITC(530/30)PE(575/26)Bis I40013900252000.63.6Bis II22012200225000.32.5Bis VIII15026900469000.28.2Bis IX040900664000.816.9Fluorescence was measured by fluorimeter using excitation wave length at 485 nm and emission wave lengths at 530, 590, and 645 nm.

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FITC and PE channels (excitation wave length at 488 nm). The values presented are mean values derived from at least three different experiments. Because Bis IX was fluorescent inside cells, we next analyzed the distribution of Bis IX inside the cells by fluorescent microscopy using Zeiss Axioskop 2. Fig.4 reveals that Bis IX was found in a punctate pattern within the cells, both perinuclear and extending down the long processes of the cell, which is typical of a mitochondrial-staining pattern. To further analyze the localization of Bis IX in the cells, we treated cells with Bis IX for 2 h, isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, and examined the fluorescence in both fractions. We found fluorescence in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the cytosol (data not shown). However, these experiments were difficult to quantitate because it is not known how much Bis-IX is retained in the cell fractions after isolation. To quantitatively compare fluorescence in mitochondria and cytosol, we first isolated these fractions, incubated them with Bis IX, and measured the fluorescence. In addition, Bis IX fluorescence was measured in the presence of CDL, which is known to be a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid. As shown in TableII, 25 μg of CDL yielded approximately the same level of fluorescence as 25 μg of mitochondria. However, the percent of phospholipid by weight in mitochondria is ∼20, and CDL consists of 20% of the mitochondria phospholipids. Thus, 25 μg of mitochondria should contain only 1 μg of CDL, and these results cannot explain the level of Bis IX fluorescence in mitochondria. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that some other compound(s) in addition to CDL determines the high levels of Bis IX fluorescence in mitochondria. As will be shown later, Bis IX became fluorescent in the presence of DNA. These data may explain why Bis IX fluorescence was higher in the mitochondria than in the presence of CDL.Table IIFluorescence of mitochondria, cytosol, and cardiolipin (CDL) in the presence of Bis IX (10 μm)Concentration (μg/ml)MitochondriaCytosolCDL2533,000317039,00012.514,530188028,0006.256550100015,3503.12307040076001.5691017035900.7856002080The values presented are derived from at least two different experiments.

We have shown previously that LNCaP is sensitive to TNF-α treatment and that TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP is p53-dependent (9Rokhlin O.W. Gudkov A.V. Kwek S. Glover R.A. Gewies A.S. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that LNCaP became resistant to TNF-α treatment after culturing in androgen-free conditions (AFC) (Fig.5). As can be seen from Fig. 5, 35% of LNCaP cells were killed by TNF-α when they were cultured in medium supplemented with FCS, but no cell death was observed after culturing in AFC for 14 days. To test whether Bis IX was capable of potentiating cell death in AFC, we treated LNCaP with Bis IX either alone or in combination with TNF-α after culturing LNCaP in AFC. As shown in Fig. 5, Bis IX dramatically increased the sensitivity to TNF-α treatment in LNCaP cultured in AFC. In the presence of 4 μm Bis IX the sensitivity of LNCaP was similar to LNCaP cultured in FCS when cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α. We then investigated the levels of p53 in LNCaP after Bis IX treatment during culturing of these cells in both FCS and in AFC. Surprisingly, we found that Bis IX treatment increased p53 levels in cells cultured in medium supplemented with FCS but not in LNCaP cultured in AFC. To further examine whether Bis IX-induced p53 expression is androgen-dependent, we investigated p53 expression in LNCaP cultured in AFC in the presence of different concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). As shown in Fig.6A, the induction of p53 by Bis IX treatment was found to be androgen-dependent because 10 nm DHT restored the capacity of Bis IX to increase the levels of p53. We next investigated whether p53 accumulation is androgen-dependent specifically in cells treated with Bis IX or if p53 induction by other well known inducers of p53, doxorubicin (Dox), and gamma irradiation is androgen-dependent as well. As shown in Fig. 6B, Dox induced p53 expression regardless of the presence of androgens. The same results were obtained with gamma irradiation (data not shown). These data suggest that androgen-dependent accumulation of p53 is not a general phenomenon in response to inducers of p53 but rather that it is Bis IX-specific. The next question we asked was whether p53 accumulation after Bis IX treatment was capable of transactivating the target genes p21/WAF1 and Mdm2. As shown in Fig. 6C, Dox induced increased expression of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2. In contrast, the treatment of LNCaP with Bis IX did not result in induction of p21/WAF 1 and Mdm2 despite the accumulation of p53. Most importantly, the increased expression of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 mediated by Dox was eliminated by simultaneous treatment with Bis IX and Dox. These unexpected data raise the possibility that Bis IX mediated its effect as an inhibitor of transcription. Different inhibitors of RNA polymerase II, including act D at high doses, can trigger accumulation of p53 with concomitant inhibition of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 protein levels because of an inhibition of mRNA synthesis (13Ljungman M. Zhang F. Chen F. Rainbow A.J. McKay B.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14An W.G. Chuman Y. Fojo T. Blagosklonny M.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Bis IX acts as an inhibitor of transcription, we treated LNCaP with Bis IX (4 μm), act D (4 μm), and cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/ml) and examined the levels of p53, p21/WAF1, and Mdm2 by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, both act D and Bis IX induced accumulation of p53 to the same levels and decreased the levels of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2. Compared with act D and Bis IX, CHX modulated the levels of these proteins differently. These differences cannot be explained by increased proteolysis of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 in the presence of p53 accumulation. CHX did not induce accumulation of p53, but the levels of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 were markedly decreased after CHX treatment. Further, both act D and Bis IX induced accumulation of p53, but the levels of p21/WAF1 and Mdm2 were not decreased to the same extent as with CHX treatment. To further examine whether Bis IX is a general inhibitor of transcription, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector. We then treated the transfected cells with act D and Bis IX and investigated the expression of hygromycin gene by Northern blot analysis. We found that both act D and Bis IX inhibited the expression of this gene (Fig.8). The same results were obtained with 293 cells (data not shown).Figure 8Bis IX and act D inhibit expression of hygromycin gene.HeLa cells were transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector. Four hours after transfection, cells were treated with act D or Bis IX. Bar 1, untransfected cells;bar 2, transfected no treatment with drugs; bar 3, Bis IX (4 μm); bar 4, Bis IX (10 μm); bar 5, Bis IX (20 μm);bar 6, act D (4 μm).

The right panelshows the amount of transcript as a percent of control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the binding of Bis IX to DNA by measuring the fluorescence of Bis IX in the presence of different concentrations of DNA. We have also used Bis II as a control because Bis II did not potentiate cell death. As shown in Fig.9A, Bis IX became fluorescent in the presence of DNA, and this fluorescence was found to be dose-dependent. We then investigated whether act D could interfere with Bis IX binding to DNA. As shown in Fig. 9B, act D prevented the binding of Bis IX to DNA. These data suggest that act D and Bis IX interact with overlapping or identical sites on DNA. Despite the finding that Bis IX binds DNA and became fluorescent in the presence of DNA in solution, we did not observe the Bis IX fluorescence in nuclei (Fig. 4). Bis IX, as an inhibitor of transcription, appears to interact only with DNA sites that are not covered by chromosomal proteins. The number of available Bis IX binding sites on chromosomal DNA may be too few to make this interaction detectable with fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, Bis IX can be readily detected in mitochondria because Bis IX became fluorescent not only in the presence of DNA, that is “naked” in mitochondria but also in the presence of mitochondria-specific cardiolipin. To compare the effects of Bis IX and act D on caspase activity, we treated the TRAIL-resistant cell line DU145 for 8 h with Bis IX and act D either alone or simultaneously with TRAIL. Caspase activity was measured in cell lysates both with caspase substrates and by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.10, both Bis IX and act D induced caspase activity to the same extent in combination with TRAIL treatment. The same results were obtained after treatment of LNCaP with Bis IX and act D in combination with anti-Fas mAb (data not shown). These results suggest that Bis IX potentiates TNF receptor family-mediated cell death as an inhibitor of transcription and therefore down-regulates the production of apoptosis suppressor factor(s) acting in resistant cells. One promising approach for treating apoptosis-resistant tumor cells is to use cytotoxic drugs to sensitize cells to death-inducing ligands (15El-Deiry W.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). From this point of view, the study by Zhou et al. (4Zhou T. Song L. Yang P. Wang Z. Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) is very promising. That Bis VIII potentiated Fas-mediated apoptosis in human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells, different tumor T cell lines, and activated T cells is intriguing. Moreover, Bis VIII has activity in vivo by preventing the development of symptoms of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Although Bis derivatives were originally synthesized as PKC inhibitors (1Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F.

Based on our own previous work in receptor/ligand-induced cell death (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A.

Tagiyev A.F. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Prostate. 2002; 52: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was of great interest to investigate whether Bis could modulate the resistance of human prostatic carcinoma cells to TNF receptor family-induced apoptosis. Certain cytotoxic drugs can induce cell death through up-regulation of death receptors (12Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, we found that the expression of Fas receptor (CD 95), TRAIL-R1, and TRAIL-R2 was decreased by 30–50% under Bis IX treatment for 24 h (data not shown). These results show that, in contrast to the effect of cytotoxic drugs that increase the surface expression of death receptors (12Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), Bis IX mediates its effect by another mechanism(s). Our data suggest that Bis IX inhibits the production of some factor(s) that is responsible for the resistance to all three death-inducing ligands: TNF-α, Fas, and TRAIL. The capacity of different Bis derivatives to overcome the resistance of tumor cells to TNF family death ligands is not cell type-specific. Bis VIII enhanced apoptosis after treatment of Jurkat cells with agonistic antibodies to Fas, TNF-α, and TRAIL (6Meng X.W. Helderbrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bis III was found to inhibit FLIPL accumulation in dendritic cells and sensitize Fas- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (5Willerns F. Amraoui Z. Vanderheyde N. Verhasselt V. Askoy E. Scaffidi C. Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Goldman M. Blood. 2000; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Bis VIII potentiated both Fas- and TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells (4Zhou T. Song L. Yang P. Wang Z. Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At the same time the mechanisms by which Bis acts in different cell types may be different. For example, Bis I, II, and IV were active on dendritic cells (5Willerns F. Amraoui Z. Vanderheyde N. Verhasselt V. Askoy E. Scaffidi C. Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Goldman M. Blood. 2000; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but T cells were not affected by these Bis derivatives (4Zhou T. Song L. Yang P. Wang Z. Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Bis VIII and IX showed the same activity in potentiating Fas-mediated apoptosis in 1321N1 cells (4Zhou T. Song L. Yang P. Wang Z. Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas we found that in DU145 Bis IX was 3× more active than Bis VIII. Bis VIII was shown to potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells without enhancing DISC formation (6Meng X.W. Helderbrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although Bis VIII can alter the phosphorylation status of Fas-associated polypeptide with death domain (FADD), the total amount of FADD in the DISC was unchanged after treatment (6Meng X.W. Helderbrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, Bis VIII apparently accomplishes its effect downstream of the DISC. We exploited the fluorescent properties of Bis IX to examine the distribution of Bis IX in cells. Bis IX was found to bind to mitochondria. The ability of Bis to bind to mitochondria has also been shown in one other study (17Chen C-S. Poenie M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15812-15822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Localization of fluorescent derivatives of bisindolylmaleimide (fim-1, fim-2, rim-1), synthesized by Chen and Poenie (17Chen C-S. Poenie M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15812-15822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were investigated and compared with staining patterns with antibodies to PKC. Fim-1 stained mitochondria, but no staining was identified with antibodies to PKC. Thus, the ability of Bis to interact with mitochondria does not appear to be linked to the capacity to interact with PKC. To further investigate the mechanism of Bis IX-mediated cell death, we examined the effect of Bis IX using the androgen-dependent cell line LNCaP. We have previously shown that TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP is p53-dependent (9Rokhlin O.W. Gudkov A.V. Kwek S. Glover R.A. Gewies A.S. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that LNCaP became resistant to treatment with TNF-α after culturing in AFC. We therefore compared the effect of Bis IX on LNCaP cultured in regular medium and in AFC. We found that Bis IX dramatically increased the sensitivity to TNF-α treatment in LNCaP cultured in AFC. This effect was not dependent on an accumulation of p53, and Bis IX was found to mediate its effect as an inhibitor of transcription. We have shown previously that cycloheximide converted the phenotype of prostate cancer cell lines from Fas- and TNF-α-resistant to -sensitive (7Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kieffer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that resistance to Fas- and TNF-α-mediated apoptosis dominates over-sensitivity in cell hybrids, and these findings suggest that the resistance may be regulated by an apoptosis suppressor factor(s) (18Rokhlin O.W. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. Sidorenko S.P. Glover R, A. Gudkov A.V. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3941-3943PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we found that Bis IX potentiates cell death in prostate tumor cell lines that are resistant to Fas-, TNF-α−, and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Bis IX alone cannot induce caspase activity. However, eight hours of treatment with Bis IX in the presence of death-inducing ligands was found to be sufficient to induce caspase activity in resistant cells. These results suggest that this resistance is dependent on the presence of a labile protein(s) that determines the resistance to TNF receptor family-mediated killing. We have examined the levels of FLIPL, FLIPS, IAP1, IAP2, and XIAP, which are known to inhibit apoptosis in some cell lines (19Kim K. Fisher M.J., Xu, S-O. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the levels of these proteins were unchanged after treatment with Bis IX (data not shown). It remains to be determined which protein(s) is modulated under Bis IX treatment. It is well known that an effective therapy for androgen-independent prostate cancer is urgently needed. There are a limited number of agents that are cytotoxic to prostate tumor cells. However, these agents typically induce death in proliferating cells. Bis IX (or other Bis derivatives) may be good candidates for treatment of prostate tumor cells for the following reasons. First, Bis IX is capable of potentiating TNF receptor family-induced apoptosis in LNCaP even after androgen withdrawal when cells stop proliferating. Second, the effect of Bis IX is p53-independent; Bis IX potentiated TNF receptor family-induced apoptosis not only in LNCaP, which expresses wild-type p53, but also in PC3, which is p53-null, and in DU145, which expresses two different p53 mutants. Third, inhibition of transcription by Bis IX in normal cells should not have significant consequences. This point of view is supported by Zhou et al. (4Zhou T. Song L. Yang P. Wang Z. Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); in their experiments rats were injected with 250 μg of Bis VIII every other day for five doses without side effects. In addition, they showed that Bis VIIIin vivo did not have a substantial effect on activated T cells from Fas-deficient lpr/lpr mice. Moreover, Bis VIII selectively potentiated apoptosis in activated T cells while having little effect on non-activated T cells. TRAIL-based therapy is a promising approach (15El-Deiry W.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), and simultaneous treatment with bisindolylmaleimides and TRAIL may be useful therapeutically, specifically for treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer."
