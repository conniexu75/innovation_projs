https://openalex.org/W2805920171,"Additive manufacturing with fused deposition modeling (FDM) is currently optimized for a wide range of research and commercial applications. The major disadvantage of FDM-created products is their low quality and structural defects (porosity), which impose an obstacle to utilizing them in functional prototyping and direct digital manufacturing of objects intended to contact with gases and liquids. This article describes a simple and efficient approach for assessing the quality of 3D printed objects. Using this approach it was shown that the wall permeability of a printed object depends on its geometric shape and is gradually reduced in a following series: cylinder > cube > pyramid > sphere > cone. Filament feed rate, wall geometry and G-code-defined wall structure were found as primary parameters that influence the quality of 3D-printed products. Optimization of these parameters led to an overall increase in quality and improvement of sealing properties. It was demonstrated that high quality of 3D printed objects can be achieved using routinely available printers and standard filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2806063230,"Aims/Hypotheses We hypothesized that there is decreased synthesis of glutathione (GSH) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) especially in the presence of microvascular complications, and this is dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia. Methods In this case-control study, we recruited 16 patients with T2DM (7 without and 9 with microvascular complications), and 8 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls. We measured GSH synthesis rate using an infusion of [2H2]-glycine as isotopic tracer and collection of blood samples for liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis. Results Compared to the controls, T2DM patients had lower erythrocyte GSH concentrations (0.90 ± 0.42 vs. 0.35 ± 0.30 mmol/L; P = 0.001) and absolute synthesis rates (1.03 ± 0.55 vs. 0.50 ± 0.69 mmol/L/day; P = 0.01), but not fractional synthesis rates (114 ± 45 vs. 143 ± 82%/day; P = 0.07). The magnitudes of changes in patients with complications were greater for both GSH concentrations and absolute synthesis rates (P-values ≤ 0.01) compared to controls. There were no differences in GSH concentrations and synthesis rates between T2DM patients with and without complications (P-values > 0.1). Fasting glucose and HbA1c did not correlate with GSH concentration or synthesis rates (P-values > 0.17). Conclusions Compared to non-diabetic controls, patients with T2DM have glutathione deficiency, especially if they have microvascular complications. This is probably due to reduced synthesis and increased irreversible utilization by non-glycemic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2807603805,"Two experiments addressed the issue of age-related differences and emotion-specific patterns in emotion regulation during adolescence. Experiment 1 examined emotion-specific patterns in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction strategies in 14-year-old adolescents (N = 50). Adolescents were instructed to answer spontaneously or to downregulate their responses by using either distraction or cognitive reappraisal strategies before viewing negative pictures and were asked to rate their emotional state after picture presentation. Results showed that reappraisal effectiveness was modulated by emotional content but distraction was not. Reappraisal was more effective than distraction at regulating fear or anxiety (threat-related pictures) but was similar to distraction regarding other emotions. Using the same paradigm, Experiment 2 examined in 12-year-old (N = 56), 13-year-old (N = 49) and 15-year-old adolescents (N = 54) the age-related differences a) in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction when implemented and b) in the everyday use of regulation strategies using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Results revealed that regulation effectiveness was equivalent for both strategies in 12-year-olds, whereas a large improvement in reappraisal effectiveness was observed in 13- and 15-year-olds. No age differences were observed in the reported use of reappraisal, but older adolescents less frequently reported using distraction and more frequently reported using the rumination strategy. Taken together, these experiments provide new findings regarding the use and the effectiveness of cognitive regulation strategies during adolescence in terms of age differences and emotion specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2805422302,"Background Nursing notes have not been widely used in prediction models for clinical outcomes, despite containing rich information. Advances in natural language processing have made it possible to extract information from large scale unstructured data like nursing notes. This study extracted the sentiment—impressions and attitudes—of nurses, and examined how sentiment relates to 30-day mortality and survival. Methods This study applied a sentiment analysis algorithm to nursing notes extracted from MIMIC-III, a public intensive care unit (ICU) database. A multiple logistic regression model was fitted to the data to correlate measured sentiment with 30-day mortality while controlling for gender, type of ICU, and SAPS-II score. The association between measured sentiment and 30-day mortality was further examined in assessing the predictive performance of sentiment score as a feature in a classifier, and in a survival analysis for different levels of measured sentiment. Results Nursing notes from 27,477 ICU patients, with an overall 30-day mortality of 11.02%, were extracted. In the presence of known predictors of 30-day mortality, mean sentiment polarity was a highly significant predictor in a multiple logistic regression model (Adjusted OR = 0.4626, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.4244, 0.5041]) and led to improved predictive accuracy (AUROC = 0.8189 versus 0.8092, 95% BCI of difference: [0.0070, 0.0126]). The Kaplan Meier survival curves showed that mean sentiment polarity quartiles are positively correlated with patient survival (log-rank test: p < 0.001). Conclusions This study showed that quantitative measures of unstructured clinical notes, such as sentiment of clinicians, correlate with 30-day mortality and survival, thus can also serve as a predictor of patient outcomes in the ICU. Therefore, further research is warranted to study and make use of the wealth of data that clinical notes have to offer."
https://openalex.org/W2805561068,"In this study, we analyze first whether there is a common spatial distribution of child maltreatment (CM) and intimate partner violence (IPV), and second, whether the risks of CM and IPV are influenced by the same neighborhood characteristics, and if these risks spatially overlap. To this end we used geocoded data of CM referrals (N = 588) and IPV incidents (N = 1450) in the city of Valencia (Spain). As neighborhood proxies, we used 552 census block groups. Neighborhood characteristics analyzed at the aggregated level (census block groups) were: Neighborhood concentrated disadvantage (neighborhood economic status, neighborhood education level, and policing activity), immigrant concentration, and residential instability. A Bayesian joint modeling approach was used to examine the spatial distribution of CM and IPV, and a Bayesian random-effects modeling approach was used to analyze the influence of neighborhood-level characteristics on small-area variations of CM and IPV risks. For CM, 98% of the total between-area variation in risk was captured by a shared spatial component, while for IPV the shared component was 77%. The risks of CM and IPV were higher in neighborhoods characterized by lower levels of economic status and education, and higher levels of policing activity, immigrant concentration, and residential instability. The correlation between the log relative risk of CM and IPV was .85. Most census block groups had either low or high risks in both outcomes (with only 10.5% of the areas with mismatched risks). These results show that certain neighborhood characteristics are associated with an increase in the risk of family violence, regardless of whether this violence is against children or against intimate partners. Identifying these high-risk areas can inform a more integrated community-level response to both types of family violence. Future research should consider a community-level approach to address both types of family violence, as opposed to individual-level intervention addressing each type of violence separately."
https://openalex.org/W2805266681,"Introduction Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have gained an increased share over warfarin for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. We studied DOAC adoption across providers and medical specialties. Methods Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of Medicare Part D public use files (PUF), 2013 to 2015. We summarized prescription data for claims and drug payment, stratified by drug class, specialty and calendar year. We treated DOAC claims as a count outcome and explored patterns of expansion across prescribers via a truncated negative binomial regression. We described dispersion and spread in DOAC prescribing, across hospital referral regions (HRRs), including the p90/p10 ratios, and the median absolute deviation from the median. Results In 2015 part D PUF, oral anticoagulant claims have climbed to approximately 24.4 million with a payment cost of approximately $3.3 billion. DOAC claims comprised 31.0% of oral anticoagulant claims, showing a relative increase of approximately 127% compared to 2013. The upper decile of prescribers accounted for half of the oral anticoagulant prescriptions and the resulting cost. The median cost per DOAC claim in 2015 was $367.4 (interquartile range 323.9 to 445.9), as opposed to $12.3 (interquartile range 9.2 to 16.5) for warfarin. The median cost per standardized (30-day supply) prescription was $317.0 (interquartile range 303.8 to 324.3) and $8.0 (6.7 to 9.8) for DOACs and warfarin, respectively. DOAC adoption differs by specialty. Cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists and orthopedics had the highest predicted DOAC share per 100 claims (53.8, 72.9 and 71.5, respectively in 2015); nephrologists, family practitioners and geriatricians the lowest (22.3, 21.5 and 20.7, respectively in 2015). The p90/p10 ratio and the median absolute deviation from the median varied across HRRs and correlated positively with the prevalence of stroke and atrial fibrillation in the Medicare population. Conclusions DOACs have been increasing their share year-over-year, but adoption varies across specialties. In prevalent areas for stroke and atrial fibrillation, prescription dispersion magnifies, and this may signify a rapid adoption by top providers."
https://openalex.org/W2807491384,"The nature of the relationship between fatigue and its risk factors is poorly understood. In the present study the genetic and environmental association between anxiety-depression, musculoskeletal (MS) pain and fatigue was examined, and the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between these phenotypes was investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal twin design.The sample consisted of 746 monozygotic (MZ) and 770 dizygotic (DZ) twins in the age group of 50-65 (mean = 57.11 years, SD = 4.5). Continuous measures of fatigue symptoms and the other phenotypes were employed. Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on the phenotypes, and the associations among them, were determined. Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13-19 years earlier.Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40-0.53 range were demonstrated. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors between the four phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between anxiety-depression and fatigue, and between MS pain and fatigue, was independent of neuroticism.Evidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report fatigue symptoms, genetically linked to neuroticism, anxiety-depression, and MS pain, was found. Both unique and pleiotropic effects appear to be involved in the genetic architecture of the phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2805823221,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the major causes of cancer related deaths. Although ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and/or high-cost magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been shown to improve early detection of liver cancer and mortality rates in high-risk individuals, such imaging based methods are limited by high rates of false positivity leading to unnecessary patient anxiety and invasive procedures. Complementary blood biomarkers could increase the accuracy of early detection. Although Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in blood is widely used in HCC screening and diagnosis, the false-negative rate as high as 30% and 40% is found in advanced HCC and early stage HCC respectively. We detected AFP messenger RNA (mRNA) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patient plasma using designed molecular beacons and a novel tethered lipoplex nanoparticle (TLN) biochip. Together with glypican-3 (GPC-3) mRNA, another well-known HCC marker, we observed much improved performance of AFP protein-based HCC detection. Comparing normal donors (N = 38) and HCC patients (N = 40), our TLN biochip using EV AFP and GPC-3 mRNAs provided an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.995, better than that of a single marker. This 2-mRNA combination also provided a perfect positive predictive value (PPV = 1) at a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.95 and 20% prevalence, while the blood AFP protein or plasma EV GPC3 mRNA alone could only provide a PPV of 0.61 and 0.79 respectively at the same conditions. Thus, this facile new method may complement current models for risk stratification in liver cancer screening, therapeutic monitoring, and after-treatment surveillance. However, large scale validation will need to be conducted to confirm its clinical potential."
https://openalex.org/W2807341474,"Chemical cues are arguably the most fundamental means of animal communication and play an important role in mate choice and kin recognition. Consequently, there is growing interest in the use of gas chromatography (GC) to investigate the chemical basis of eco-evolutionary interactions. Both GC-MS (mass spectrometry) and FID (flame ionization detection) are commonly used to characterise the chemical composition of biological samples such as skin swabs. The resulting chromatograms comprise peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with GC-FID data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present GCalignR, a user-friendly R package for aligning GC-FID data based on retention times. The package was developed specifically for ecological and evolutionary studies that seek to investigate similarity patterns across multiple and often highly variable biological samples, for example representing different sexes, age classes or reproductive stages. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that GCalignR performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that GCalignR will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields."
https://openalex.org/W2807095618,"Olive mill waste (OMW), a byproduct from the extraction of olive oil, causes serious environmental problems for its disposal, and extensive efforts have been made to find cost-effective solutions for its management. Biochars produced from OMW were applied as soil amendment and found in many cases to successfully increase plant productivity and suppress diseases. This work aims to characterize biochars obtained by pyrolysis of OMW at 300 °C to 1000 °C using 13C NMR spectroscopy, LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). Chemical characterization revealed that biochar composition varied according to the increase of pyrolysis temperature (PT). Thermal treated materials showed a progressive reduction of alkyl C fractions coupled to the enrichment in aromatic C products. In addition, numerous compounds present in the organic feedstock (fatty acids, phenolic compounds, triterpene acids) reduced (PT = 300 °C) or completely disappeared (PT ≥ 500 °C) in biochars as compared to untreated OMW. PT also affected surface morphology of biochars by increasing porosity and heterogeneity of pore size. The effects of biochars extracts on the growth of different organisms (two plants, one nematode and four fungal species) were also evaluated. When tested on different living organisms, biochars and OMW showed opposite effects. The root growth of Lepidium sativum and Brassica rapa, as well as the survival of the nematode Meloidogyne incognita, were inhibited by the untreated material or biochar produced at 300 °C, but toxicity decreased at higher PTs. Conversely, growth of Aspergillus, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia and Trichoderma fungi was stimulated by organic feedstock, while being inhibited by thermally treated biochars. Our findings showed a pattern of association between specific biochar chemical traits and its biological effects that, once mechanistically explained and tested in field conditions, may lead to effective applications in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2952391360,"Describing and understanding close proximity interactions between infant and family members can provide key information on transmission opportunities of respiratory infections within households. Among respiratory infections, pertussis represents a public health priority. Pertussis infection can be particularly harmful to young, unvaccinated infants and for these patients, family members represent the main sources of transmission. Here, we report on the use of wearable proximity sensors based on RFID technology to measure face-to-face proximity between family members within 16 households with infants younger than 6 months for 2–5 consecutive days of data collection. The sensors were deployed over the course of approximately 1 year, in the context of a national research project aimed at the improvement of infant pertussis prevention strategies. We investigated differences in close-range interactions between family members and we assessed whether demographic variables or feeding practices affect contact patterns between parents and infants. A total of 5,958 contact events were recorded between 55 individuals: 16 infants, 4 siblings, 31 parents and 4 grandparents. The aggregated contact networks, obtained for each household, showed a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity with the infant by family members. Contact matrices defined by age and by family role showed that most of the contacts occurred between the infant and other family members (70%), while 30% of contacts was among family members (infants excluded). Many contacts were observed between infants and adults, in particular between infant and mother, followed by father, siblings and grandparents. A larger number of contacts and longer contact durations between infant and other family members were observed in families adopting exclusive breastfeeding, compared to families in which the infant receives artificial or mixed feeding. Our results demonstrate how a high-resolution measurement of contact matrices within infants’ households is feasible using wearable proximity sensing devices. Moreover, our findings suggest the mother is responsible for the large majority of the infant’s contact pattern, thus being the main potential source of infection for a transmissible disease. As the contribution to the infants’ contact pattern by other family members is very variable, vaccination against pertussis during pregnancy is probably the best strategy to protect young, unvaccinated infants."
https://openalex.org/W2806024978,"Directed migration of cells relies on their ability to sense directional guidance cues and to interact with pericellular structures in order to transduce contractile cytoskeletal- into mechanical forces. These biomechanical processes depend highly on microenvironmental factors such as exposure to 2D surfaces or 3D matrices. In vivo, the majority of cells are exposed to 3D environments. Data on 3D cell migration are mostly derived from intravital microscopy or collagen-based in vitro assays. Both approaches offer only limited controllability of experimental conditions. Here, we developed an automated microfluidic system that allows positioning of cells in 3D microenvironments containing highly controlled diffusion-based chemokine gradients. Tracking migration in such gradients was feasible in real time at the single cell level. Moreover, the setup allowed on-chip immunocytochemistry and thus linking of functional with phenotypical properties in individual cells. Spatially defined retrieval of cells from the device allows down-stream off-chip analysis. Using dendritic cells as a model, our setup specifically allowed us for the first time to quantitate key migration characteristics of cells exposed to identical gradients of the chemokine CCL19 yet placed on 2D vs in 3D environments. Migration properties between 2D and 3D migration were distinct. Morphological features of cells migrating in an in vitro 3D environment were similar to those of cells migrating in animal tissues, but different from cells migrating on a surface. Our system thus offers a highly controllable in vitro-mimic of a 3D environment that cells traffic in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2805538637,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an impairment of episodic memory, but the mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Animal models of MDD find impaired adult neurogenesis (AN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), and AN in DG has been suggested to play a critical role in reducing the interference between overlapping memories through pattern separation. Here, we study the effect of reduced AN in MDD on the accuracy of episodic memory using computational modeling. We focus on how memory is affected when periods with a normal rate of AN (asymptomatic states) alternate with periods with a low rate (depressive episodes), which has never been studied before. Also, unlike previous models of adult neurogenesis, which consider memories as static patterns, we model episodic memory as sequences of neural activity patterns. In our model, AN adds additional random components to the memory patterns, which results in the decorrelation of similar patterns. Consistent with previous studies, higher rates of AN lead to higher memory accuracy in our model, which implies that memories stored in the depressive state are impaired. Intriguingly, our model makes the novel prediction that memories stored in an earlier asymptomatic state are also impaired by a later depressive episode. This retrograde effect exacerbates with increased duration of the depressive episode. Finally, pattern separation at the sensory processing stage does not improve, but rather worsens, the accuracy of episodic memory retrieval, suggesting an explanation for why AN is found in brain areas serving memory rather than sensory function. In conclusion, while cognitive retrieval biases might contribute to episodic memory deficits in MDD, our model suggests a mechanistic explanation that affects all episodic memories, regardless of emotional relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2805953153,"Background There is evidence that glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease involving the whole visual pathway. We prospectively examined potential benefits of volumetry of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a new 7T scanner. Methods 20 patients with normal tension glaucoma and 16 control individuals were examined. LGN volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic tract (OT) and the optic radiation (OR) and their correlation with RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) thickness were analyzed. Results LGN volume was significantly reduced in NTG (60.9 vs 88.3; p < 0.05). FA of the OT (right: 0.35 vs 0.66, left: 0.36 vs 0.67; p < 0.05) and of the OR (right: 0.41 vs 0.70, left: 0.41 vs 0.69; p < 0.05) was also significantly reduced. Nasal RNFL thickness correlated with the volume of the contralateral LGN (r = 0.471, p = 0.05). Temporal RNFL thickness correlated with the volume of the ipsilateral LGN (r = 0.603, p = 0.015). Conclusion NTG leads to significant atrophy of the LGN compared to controls. FA of the optic tract and the optic radiation is reduced in NTG as sign of axonal degeneration. RNFL thickness but not FA correlates with LGN volume."
https://openalex.org/W2805978715,"Background Animal bites and stings contribute significantly to mortality in certain parts of the world. India accounts for the highest number of snakebites and related mortality globally. We report on mortality due to bite or sting of a venomous animal from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar which estimated the causes of death using verbal autopsy. Methodology/principal findings Interviews were conducted for all deaths that occurred from January 2012 to March 2014 in 109,689 households (87.1% participation) covering 627,658 population in 1,017 clusters representative of the state using the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium shortened verbal autopsy questionnaire. Cause of death was assigned using the SmartVA automated algorithm. The annualized mortality rate per 100,000 population due to snakebite, scorpion sting and other animals adjusted for age, sex and urban-rural population distribution of the state; and detailed contextual information on snakebites are reported. Deaths due to bite/sting of a venomous animal accounted for 10.7% of all deaths due to unintentional injuries, with an adjusted mortality rate of 6.2 (95% CI 6.0–6.3) per 100,000 population. The adjusted snakebite mortality rate was 4.4 (95% CI 4.3–4.6) which was significantly higher in the rural areas (4.8, 95% CI 4.7–5.0) and in females (5.5, 95% CI 5.3–5.7). Snakebites accounted for 7.6% of all unintentional injury deaths across all ages but for 33.3% of the deaths in 10–14 years age group. A similar proportion of snakebite deaths occurred while sleeping (30.2%), playing (30.2%) and during field/outdoor activities (27.9%). In these cases, 8.2% people were already dead when found, 34.7% had died before treatment could be provided, and 28 (57.1%) had died post treatment among whom 46.4% had sought treatment at a health facility, 25% with a traditional healer, and the rest from both. Death before reaching a health provider, non-availability of medicines or doctor, referral patterns, and sex-differentials in the context of snakebite deaths are reported. None of the verbatim specifically mentioned anti-venom being used for treatment. The adjusted mortality rate for scorpion sting was 0.9 (95% CI 0.8–0.9). Conclusions The findings from this large representative sample documents the magnitude of snakebite mortality in Bihar and highlight the circumstances surrounding the snakebite events that could facilitate prevention and intervention opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2807534121,"The standard functional tool for gait assessment in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials has been the 25-Foot Timed Walk Test, a measure of gait speed. Straight-line gait assessment may not reflect adequately upon balance and coordination. Walking tests with turns may add additional information towards understanding gait and balance status, and be more reflective of ambulation in the community. Understanding the impact of turn parameters on patient-reported outcomes of balance and walking would help MS clinicians better formulate treatment plans for persons with gait limitations. In this study, ninety-one persons with MS (Expanded Disability Status Score; EDSS, range: 0–6.5) were enrolled in an initial cross-sectional study. Twenty-four subjects (EDSS, range:1.0–6.0) completed a follow-up visit an average of 12 months later. Spatiotemporal gait analysis was collected at both visits using APDM Opal wireless body-worn sensors while performing the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). For both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, regression analyses determined the impact on the addition of turning parameters to stride velocity (SV), in the prediction of self-reported balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)) and walking limitation (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12)). The addition of 6MWT peak turn velocity (PTV) to 6MWT SV increased the predictive power of the 6MWT for the ABC from 20% to 33%, and increased the predictive power from 28% to 41% for the MSWS-12. TUG PTV added to TUG SV also strengthened the relationship of the TUG for the ABC from 19% to 28%, and 27% to 36% for the MSWS-12. For those with 1 year follow-up, percent change in turn number of steps (TNS%Δ) during the 6MWT added to 6MWT SV%Δ improved the modeling of ABC%Δ from 24% to 33%. 6MWT PTV%Δ added to 6MWT SV%Δ increased the predictive power of MSWS-12%Δ from 8% to 27%. Conclusively, turn parameters improved modeling of self-perceived balance confidence and walking limitations when added to the commonly utilized measure of gait speed. Tests of longer durations with multiple turns, as opposed to shorter durations with a single turn, modeled longitudinal change more accurately. Turn speed and stability should be qualitatively assessed during the clinic visit, and use of multi-faceted tests such as the TUG or 6MWT may be required to fully understand gait deterioration in persons with MS."
https://openalex.org/W2806032658,"There are racial, ethnic and geographical differences in complete blood count (CBC) reference intervals (RIs) and therefore it is necessary to establish RIs that are population specific. Several studies have been carried out in Africa to derive CBC RIs but many were not conducted with the rigor recommended for RI studies hence limiting the adoption and generalizability of the results.By use of a Beckman Coulter ACT 5 DIFF CP analyser, we measured CBC parameters in samples collected from 528 healthy black African volunteers in a largely urban population. The latent abnormal values exclusion (LAVE) method was used for secondary exclusion of individuals who may have had sub-clinical diseases. The RIs were derived by both parametric and non-parametric methods with and without LAVE for comparative purposes.Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were lower while platelet counts were higher in females across the 4 age stratifications. The lower limits for Hb and red blood cell parameters significantly increased after applying the LAVE method which eliminated individuals with latent anemia and inflammation. We adopted RIs by parametric method because 90% confidence intervals of the RI limits were invariably narrower than those by the non-parametric method. The male and female RIs for Hb after applying the LAVE method were 14.5-18.7 g/dL and 12.0-16.5 g/dL respectively while the platelet count RIs were 133-356 and 152-443 x10(3) per μL respectively.Consistent with other studies from Sub-Saharan Africa, Hb and neutrophil counts were lower than Caucasian values. Our finding of higher Hb and lower eosinophil counts compared to other studies conducted in rural Kenya most likely reflects the strict recruitment criteria and healthier reference population after secondary exclusion of individuals with possible sub-clinical diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2807390427,"Straw return plays an important role in reducing the use of chemical fertilizer, promoting soil carbon sequestration, thus maintaining soil fertility and alleviating environmental pollution. To examine the effects of straw return on soil bacterial communities, quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing approaches were used to analyze the bacterial abundance and community structures at the depths of 5-25 cm and 25-45 cm in the soils under six-year continuous straw return and removal treatments in Langfang, Hebei, the North China Plain. As a result, straw return had no effects on soil chemical properties, bacterial abundance, richness or diversity at both soil depths. In contrast, vertical distributions of available nitrogen and available potassium were affected. Similarly, straw return also changed the vertical distributions of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. Principal coordinate analysis based on weighted UniFrac distance matrix indicated a moderate separation of the bacterial community in the soil treated with straw return from that with straw removal at 5-25 cm depth, but they were not distinctly distinguished at 25-45 cm depth. T-test identified increased abundance of Candidatus Latescibacteria in the soil under straw return treatment at 5-25 cm depth but no differentially abundant phyla at 25-45 cm depth was found. These results suggested a selection effect from the six-year continuous straw return treatment and the soil bacterial communities were moderately changed."
https://openalex.org/W2807526836,"There is limited data on third-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). This study was conducted to assess third-line treatment patterns, outcomes, and clinical parameters related to survival outcomes in patients with MGC.Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, a nationwide population-based outcomes study was conducted. From the HIRA database, patients newly diagnosed in 2010 with MGC were identified (N = 1,871), and of these, 229 patients who had received third-line chemotherapy were finally selected for this study.Prior to third-line chemotherapy, more than 90% of patients received fluoropyrimidine and platinum, and 43.7% and 40.6% received taxane and irinotecan, respectively. Various third-line chemotherapy regimens containing taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin were prescribed. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients receiving third-line chemotherapy was 4.4 months. The median time from the start date of first-line chemotherapy to the start date of third-line chemotherapy (TF1T3) was 9.5 months, and a longer TF1T3 was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased OS. The median OS of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and taxane followed by third-line irinotecan-based therapy was similar to that of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and irinotecan followed by third-line taxane-based therapy (p = 0.894).In patients with MGC receiving third-line chemotherapy, TF1T3 was the only significant factor associated with OS. The sequence of using taxane and irinotecan as subsequent therapy after first-line failure was not shown to impact survival outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2805269073,"Objectives The prevalence of pressure injuries is an essential indicator of prevention and quality of care. Population-based prevalence data on pressure injuries are scarce in Japan. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of pressure injuries per 1000 adults and per 1000 older people in Japan. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting This study was conducted in Goto, a city located on a remote rural archipelago in Japan. In 2017, the population was 37,855; older people aged ≥65 years accounted for 37.7%. Participants Participants were enrolled in various facilities in the city. In total, 1126 participants (median age 85 years) were assessed to calculate age-specific numbers of people with pressure injuries. Measurements Participants were directly evaluated by the research team between August and September 2017, and pressure injuries were classified using DESIGN-R schema. We calculated the number of adults with pressure injuries in Goto based on the proportion of pressure injuries in specific age categories. In these prevalence estimations, we assumed that all cases aged ≥65 years were long-term care insurance-certified older people, and all cases aged 18–64 years were people with physical disabilities who received social welfare services. Results Of the 1126 participants, 113 (10%) had one or more pressure injuries. Overall, the estimated number of adults with pressure injuries in Goto was 301.4. The prevalence rate of pressure injuries was 9.2 per 1000 population in adults aged ≥18 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.1–10.2), 20.3 in those aged ≥65 years (95% CI 18.1–22.7), and 44.6 in those aged ≥80 years (95% CI 39.5–50.2). Conclusions This study revealed a high population-based prevalence of pressure injuries in a rural Japanese community. A key reason for this high disease burden in Japan appears to be the susceptibility of the aged population to pressure injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2805343431,"Between August-2016 and April-2017, Solomon Islands experienced the largest and longest-running dengue outbreak on record in the country, with 12,329 suspected cases, 877 hospitalisations and 16 deaths. We conducted a retrospective review of related data and documents, and conducted key informant interviews to characterise the event and investigate the adaptability of syndromic surveillance for enhanced and expanded data collection during a public health emergency in a low resource country setting. While the outbreak quickly consumed available public and clinical resources, we found that authorities were able to scale up the conventional national syndrome-based early warning surveillance system to support the increased information demands during the event demonstrating the flexibility of the system and syndromic surveillance more broadly. Challenges in scaling up included upskilling and assisting staff with no previous experience of the tasks required; managing large volumes of data; maintaining data quality for the duration of the outbreak; harmonising routine and enhanced surveillance data and maintaining surveillance for other diseases; producing information optimally useful for response planning; and managing staff fatigue. Solomon Islands, along with other countries of the region remains vulnerable to outbreaks of dengue and other communicable diseases. Ensuring surveillance systems are robust and able to adapt to changing demands during emergencies should be a health protection priority."
https://openalex.org/W2806987219,"Background In industrialized areas of the world, including Europe, Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is considered an emerging pathogen. In fact, autochthonous cases caused by HEV genotype 3 (HEV-3) are increasingly reported. Several studies described the human HEV-3 subtypes and strains circulating in West Europe countries; in contrast, very little is known about the HEV strains responsible for acute hepatitis E in countries of East Europe/Balkans, such as Bulgaria. Methods and findings Anti-HEV IgM positive serum samples (n = 103) from acute hepatitis cases (2013–2015) from all over Bulgaria were analysed for HEV RNA by Real-Time PCR. Viremia was detected in 90/103 samples. A fragment of the viral genome (ORF-2 region) was amplified by nested PCR from 76/90 viremic samples, leading to a sequence in 64 of them. Genotyping by phylogenetic analysis with standard reference sequences showed HEV-1 in 1/64 cases, HEV-3 in 63/64. Subtyping of HEV-3 sequences showed 3e (39/63, 62%), 3f (n = 15/63, 24%) and 3c (n = 8/63, 13%) subtypes; in one case the sequence subtype was uncertain and classified as 3hi. In the phylogenetic tree, most 3e sequences grouped in two well distinct clusters (A and B), each one with very low intragroup genetic distances. In contrast, 3f and 3c were interspersed with reference sequences and showed lower tendency to cluster and/or higher intragroup distances. Geographically, while 3f and 3c were scattered throughout the country, 3e was restricted to the South-West area, with most cases in two towns about 40 kilometres apart from each other. Conclusions Most acute hepatitis E cases in Bulgaria are caused by HEV-3, subtypes 3e, 3f and 3c. Circulation of 3e appears quite different from 3f and 3c, with 3e restricted to the South-West area while 3f and 3c diffused over the country. The factors underlying the observed molecular and geographical differences remain to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2807125088,"The first laboratory confirmed dengue outbreak in Kenya was reported in coastal towns of Malindi and Kilifi in 1982. Since then, no other outbreak had been confirmed in Kenya. Dengue outbreak was confirmed among African Mission soldiers in Somalia (AMISOM) between May to October 2011. From September 2011, an upsurge of febrile patients who were negative for malaria on microscopy were reported in several health facilities in Mandera town, an adjacent area to Somalia in northern Kenya. We investigated a suspected dengue outbreak in Mandera town from 26th September 2011 to 5th October 2011. A suspected case was defined as acute onset of fever with two or more of the following: headache, arthralgia, myalgia, rash and hemorrhages and negative malaria microscopy results in a person presenting to a health facility in Mandera town from 1st August to 2nd October 2011. We prospectively identified new cases meeting the suspect case definition from 2nd October to 5th October 2011 and we collected blood samples from consenting patients. Blood was collected into plastic vacutainers and stored in dry shipper at -80oc to laboratory for dengue virus testing using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We administered a standardized form to obtain clinical information. We calculated descriptive statistics to describe the outbreak. A total of 1,332 patients had been line listed by the district surveillance team, of which 381 (29%) met our suspect case definition of dengue. Cases peaked between 10th September and 1st October 2011 and thereafter declined. We prospectively identified 33 cases meeting the suspect case definition, of whom 30 (91%) were positive for dengue virus serotype 3 by PCR. Among the 30 laboratory confirmed patients, 20 (67%) required hospitalization (Median hospitalization period, two days with a range: 1–4 days)). And of these, 26 (86%) patients reported aches and pain, 16 (53%) reported vomiting, and four (13%) gingival bleeding. Twenty-three (77%) received anti-malarial therapy. Among laboratory-confirmed dengue patients, seven (23%) had malaria co-infection. This was the second confirmed Dengue outbreak in Kenya, and highlighted the need for improved surveillance to better define disease burden and continuous education to medical personnel to improve detection and clinical management. We also recommended enhanced community education for disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2805725587,"Introduction Mobile Health (mHealth) programs have increasingly been used to tackle maternal and child health problems in low and middle income countries. However, few studies have evaluated how these programs have been perceived by intended users and beneficiaries. Therefore, we explored perceptions of healthcare officials and beneficiaries regarding RapidSMS Rwanda, an mHealth system used by Community Health Workers (CHWs) that was scaled up nationwide in 2013. Methods We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders, providers, and beneficiaries of maternal and child health services at both the national and community levels. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess perceptions about the impact of and challenges facing the RapidSMS system. Interviews and focus group discussions were recorded (with the exception of one), transcribed verbatim, and analyzed. Results We conducted a total of 28 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (93 total participants). A majority of respondents believed that RapidSMS contributed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. RapidSMS was generally accepted by both CHWs and parents. Participants identified insufficient training, a lack of equipment, and low CHW motivation as the main challenges facing RapidSMS. Conclusion Our findings suggest that an mHealth program can be well accepted by both policymakers, health providers, and the community. We also found significant technical challenges that have likely reduced its impact. Addressing these challenges will serve to strengthen future mHealth programs."
https://openalex.org/W2806386009,"The extensive use of daptomycin (DAP) for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in the last decade has led to the emergence of DAP non-susceptible (DNS) Staphylococcus aureus strains. A better understanding of the molecular changes underlying DAP-non-susceptibility is required for early diagnosis and intervention with alternate combination therapies. The phenotypic changes associated with DNS strains have been well established. However, the genotypic changes—especially the kinetics of expression of the genes responsible for DAP-non-susceptibility are not well understood. In this study, we used three clinically derived isogenic pairs of DAP-susceptible (DAP-S) and DNS S. aureus strains to study gene expression profiles with the objective of identifying the potential genotypic changes associated with DAP-nonsusceptibility. We determined the expression profiles of genes involved in cell membrane (CM) charge, autolysis, cell wall (CW) synthesis, and penicillin binding proteins in DAP-S and DNS isogenic pairs. Our results demonstrate characteristic expression profiles for mprF, dltABCD, vraS, femB, and pbp2a genes, which are common to all the DNS S. aureus strains tested. Whole genome sequencing of DAP-S and DNS clinical isolates of S. aureus showed non-synonymous mutations in all DNS strains in genes involved in CM charge, CM composition, CW thickness and CW composition. To conclude, this study unravels some of the complex molecular changes involved in the development of DAP-nonsusceptibility by demonstrating distinct differences in gene expression profiles and mutations in the DNS S. aureus strains. This knowledge will aid in rapid identification of DNS S. aureus in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2806915322,"Background Dengue epidemics have occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) since 1986. In the year 2015, Zika and chikungunya viruses were introduced in the city, causing sequential and simultaneous epidemics. Poor socioeconomic conditions have been suggested as contributing factors of arboviral infection. Objective To describe the spatial distribution of human cases of symptomatic arboviral infections and to identify risk factors for infection in a poor community of Rio de Janeiro in the years 2015 and 2016. Methods We built thematic maps of incidence rates for 78 micro-areas in the Manguinhos neighborhood. The micro-areas congregate about 600 inhabitants. Simple and multiple multilevel logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the incidence of arboviral diseases and socio-demographic factors at both the individual and micro-area levels. Results From 2015 to 2016, 370 human cases of arbovirus infection were reported in the Manguinhos community: 123 in 2015 and 247 in 2016. There was a significant difference in the risk of arbovirus diseases among different micro-areas, but this was not explained by water and sanitation indicators. The cumulative incidence rate was 849/100,000 in two years. The incidence was greater in those individuals with familiar vulnerability (1,156/100,000 vs. 794/100,000). The multilevel adjusted model showed that the odds of acquiring an arbovirus infection was 55% greater in those with familiar vulnerability. Conclusion Arbovirus infections cause a high burden of disease in Brazilian urban centers. Our results suggest that even in poor neighborhoods, there is a high spatial variability in the risk of acquiring an arbovirus infection. The conditions that favor vector proliferation and infection by arboviruses are complex and involve both individual and environmental characteristics that vary from place to place. To reduce the burden of arboviral diseases, continued public health policies and basic services should be provided to the communities at risk that consider specific local needs."
https://openalex.org/W2806103324,"Purpose To estimate and characterize the use of informal care by people with vision impairment in Portugal. Methods A total of 546 visually impaired individuals were recruited from Portuguese hospitals. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, socio-demographic details and informal care use were collected during face-to-face interviews. In addition, participants responded to a functional vision questionnaire (activity inventory) to assess their visual ability. Logistic regression was used to determine independent factors associated with informal care use and linear regression was used to determine independent predictors of intensity of informal care use. Results Informal care was reported by 39.6% of the participants. The probability of reporting informal care was higher in non-married, those with comorbidities, with lower visual ability and worse visual acuity. The median number of caregivers’ hours per year was 390 (mean = 470; 95%CI = 488–407), which represent a median opportunity cost of €2,586. Visual ability was the only independent predictor of number of hours of informal care received. Conclusions Informal care was frequently used by individuals with impaired vision. Improving visual ability of people with impaired vision when performing valued activities may reduce the burden of visual loss at personal and societal level. This could be achieved with person-centred visual rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2806276574,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has previously been demonstrated to accelerate compensatory lung growth (CLG) in mice and may be a useful therapy for pulmonary hypoplasia. Systemic administration of VEGF can result in side effects such as hypotension and edema. The aim of this study was to explore nasal delivery as a route for intrapulmonary VEGF administration. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily nasal instillation of VEGF at 0.5 mg/kg or isovolumetric saline. Lung volume measurement, morphometric analysis, and protein expression studies were performed on lung tissues harvested on postoperative day (POD) 4. To understand the mechanism by which VEGF accelerates lung growth, proliferation of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was assessed in a co-culture model with lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with and without VEGF (10 ng/mL). The assay was then repeated with a heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) neutralizing antibody ranging from 0.5–50 μg/mL. Compared to control mice, the VEGF-treated group displayed significantly higher lung volume (P = 0.001) and alveolar count (P = 0.005) on POD 4. VEGF treatment resulted in increased pulmonary expression of HB-EGF (P = 0.02). VEGF-treated HMVEC-L increased HBEC proliferation (P = 0.002) while the addition of an HB-EGF neutralizing antibody at 5 and 50 μg/mL abolished this effect (P = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). These findings demonstrate that nasal delivery of VEGF enhanced CLG. These effects could be mediated by a paracrine mechanism through upregulation of HB-EGF, an epithelial cell mitogen."
https://openalex.org/W2805059185,"Gfi1 is a key molecule in hematopoietic lineage development and mutations in GFI1 cause severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Neutropenia is associated with low bone mass, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. Using Gfi1 knock-out mice (Gfi1-ko/ko) as SCN model, we studied the relationship between neutropenia and bone mass upon different pathogen load conditions. Our analysis reveals that Gfi1-ko/ko mice kept under strict specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions demonstrate normal bone mass and survival. However, Gfi1-ko/ko mice with early (nonSPF) or late (SPF+nonSPF) pathogen exposure develop low bone mass. Gfi1-ko/ko mice demonstrate a striking rise of systemic inflammatory markers according to elevated pathogen exposure and reduced bone mass. Elevated inflammatory cytokines include for instance Il-1b, Il-6, and Tnf-alpha that regulate osteoclast development. We conclude that low bone mass, due to low neutrophil counts, is caused by the degree of systemic inflammation promoting osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2805323244,"Aim Alcohol related disease conditions are responsible for a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality in Sri Lanka. This study quantified the economic cost of selected alcohol related disease conditions in Sri Lanka in 2015. Methods This study uses the prevalence-based cost of illness methodology specified by the World Health Organization, and uses the gross costing approach. The direct costs includes the costs of curative care (inpatient and outpatient care borne by the state and out of pocket expenditure borne by patients) for alcohol related diseases, weighted by the respective population attributable fractions. Indirect costs consist of lost earnings due to absenteeism of the patient and carers due to seeking care and recuperation, and the loss of income due to mortality. Data form the Ministry of Health, Registrar General’s Department, Department of Census and Statistics and the National Cancer Registry was used. Systemic and house costs and population attributable fractions were obtained from research studies. Economists, Public Health Experts, Medical Administrators and Clinical Specialists were iteratively consulted during the estimation and validation of the costs and the results. Results The estimated present value of current and future economic cost of the alcohol-related conditions for Sri Lanka in 2015 was USD 885.86 million, 1.07% of the GDP of that year. The direct cost of alcohol related disease conditions was USD 388.35 million, which was 44% of the total cost, while the indirect cost was USD 497.50 million, which was 66% of the total cost. Road Injury cost was the highest cost category among the conditions studied. Conclusion Addressing alcohol use and its harms through effective implementation of evidence-based polices and interventions is urgently required to address the economic costs of alcohol use in Sri Lanka as it imposes a significant burden to the country."
https://openalex.org/W2805701067,"Background Depression is currently the second largest contributor to non-fatal disease burden globally. For that reason, economic evaluations are increasingly being conducted using data from depression prevalence estimates to analyze return on investments for services that target mental health. Psychiatric epidemiology studies have reported large cross-national differences in the prevalence of depression. These differences may impact the cost-effectiveness assessments of mental health interventions, thereby affecting decisions regarding government and multi-lateral investment in mental health services. Some portion of the differences in prevalence estimates across countries may be due to true discrepancies in depression prevalence, resulting from differential levels of risk in environmental and demographic factors. However, some portion of those differences may reflect non-invariance in the way standard tools measure depression across countries. This paper attempts to discern the extent to which measurement differences are responsible for reported differences in the prevalence of depression across countries. Methods and findings This analysis uses data from the World Mental Health Surveys, a coordinated series of psychiatric epidemiology studies in 27 countries using multistage household probability samples to assess prevalence and correlates of mental disorders. Data in the current study include responses to the depression module of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in four countries: Two high-income, western countries—the United States (n = 20, 015) and New Zealand (n = 12,992)—an upper-middle income sub-Saharan African country, South Africa (n = 4,351), and a lower-middle income sub-Saharan African country, Nigeria (n = 6,752). Latent class analysis, a type of finite mixture modeling, was used to categorize respondents into underlying categories based on the variation in their responses to questions in each of three sequential parts of the CIDI depression module: 1) The initial screening items, 2) Additional duration and severity exclusion criteria, and 3) The core symptom questions. After each of these parts, exclusion criteria expel respondents from the remainder of the diagnostic interview, rendering a diagnosis of “not depressed”. Latent class models were fit to each of the three parts in each of the four countries, and model fit was assessed using overall chi-square values and Pearson standardized residuals. Latent transition analysis was then applied in order to model participants’ progression through the CIDI depression module. Proportion of individuals falling into each latent class and probabilities of transitioning into subsequent classes were used to estimate the percentage in each country that ultimately fell into the more symptomatic class, i.e. classified as “depressed”. This latent variable design allows for a non-zero probability that individuals were incorrectly excluded from or retained in the diagnostic interview at any of the three exclusion points and therefore incorrectly diagnosed. Prevalence estimates based on the latent transition model reversed the order of depression prevalence across countries. Based on the latent transition model in this analysis, Nigeria has the highest prevalence (21.6%), followed by New Zealand (17.4%), then South Africa (15.0%), and finally the US (12.5%). That is compared to the estimates in the World Mental Health Surveys that do not allow for measurement differences, in which Nigeria had by far the lowest prevalence (3.1%), followed by South Africa (9.8%), then the United States (13.5%) and finally New Zealand (17.8%). Individuals endorsing the screening questions in Nigeria and South Africa were more likely to endorse more severe depression symptomology later in the module (i.e. they had higher transition probabilities), suggesting that individuals in the two Western countries may be more likely to endorse screening questions even when they don’t have as severe symptoms. These differences narrow the range of depression prevalence between countries 14 percentage points in the original estimates to 6 percentage points in the estimate taking account of measurement differences. Conclusions These data suggest fewer differences in cross-national prevalence of depression than previous estimates. Given that prevalence data are used to support key decisions regarding resource-allocation for mental health services, more critical attention should be paid to differences in the functioning of measurement across contexts and the impact these differences have on prevalence estimates. Future research should include qualitative methods as well as external measures of disease severity, such as impairment, to assess how the latent classes predict these external variables, to better understand the way that standard tools estimate depression prevalence across contexts. Adjustments could then be made to prevalence estimates used in cost-effectiveness analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2805894840,"A campaign for malaria control, using Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) was launched in South Sudan in 2009. The success of such a campaign often depends upon adequate available resources and reliable surveillance data which help officials understand existing infections. An optimal allocation of resources for malaria control at a sub-national scale is therefore paramount to the success of efforts to reduce malaria prevalence. In this paper, we extend an existing SIR mathematical model to capture the effect of LLINs on malaria transmission. Available data on malaria is utilized to determine realistic parameter values of this model using a Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Then, we explore the parasite prevalence on a continued rollout of LLINs in three different settings in order to create a sub-national projection of malaria. Further, we calculate the model’s basic reproductive number and study its sensitivity to LLINs’ coverage and its efficacy. From the numerical simulation results, we notice a basic reproduction number, , confirming a substantial increase of incidence cases if no form of intervention takes place in the community. This work indicates that an effective use of LLINs may reduce and hence malaria transmission. We hope that this study will provide a basis for recommending a scaling-up of the entry point of LLINs’ distribution that targets households in areas at risk of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2807319703,"To determine whether vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is independently predictive of intra-amniotic infection and imminent spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD, delivery within 48 hours) in women with preterm labor with intact membranes (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. CVF samples for VDBP assays were obtained along with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels immediately after amniocentesis in consecutive women with PTL (n = 148) or PPROM (n = 103) between 23.0 and 34.0 weeks of gestation. VDBP levels in CVF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The primary outcome measures were intra-amniotic infection [defined as positive amniotic fluid (AF) culture] and SPTD within 48 hours after sampling.In the multivariable analysis, elevated VDBP levels in CVF samples of PTL women were significantly associated with intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery, even after adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., gestational age at sampling, parity, and serum CRP). However, these relationships were not found in women with PPROM. In women with PTL, the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of CVF VDBP level for predicting intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery were 0.66 and 0.71, with cut-off values of 1.76 μg/mL (sensitivity of 64.3% and specificity of 78.4%) and 1.37 μg/mL (sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 72.6%), respectively. The CVF VDBP levels were significantly higher in women with PPROM than in those with PTL.VDBP in the CVF independently predicts intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery in women with PTL, whereas in women with PPROM, an elevated VDBP level in CVF is not associated with increased risks of these two outcome variables."
https://openalex.org/W2805455879,"Background From late 2014 multiple atolls in Kiribati reported an unusual and sometimes fatal illness. We conducted an investigation to identify the etiology of the outbreak on the most severely affected atoll, Kuria, and identified thiamine deficiency disease as the cause. Thiamine deficiency disease has not been reported in the Pacific islands for >5 decades. We present the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the investigation. Methodology/Principal findings We initially conducted detailed interviews and examinations on previously identified cases to characterize the unknown illness and develop a case definition. Active and passive surveillance was then conducted to identify additional cases. A questionnaire to identify potential risk factors and blood samples to assay biochemical indices were collected from cases and asymptomatic controls. Thiamine hydrochloride treatment was implemented and the response to treatment was systematically monitored using a five-point visual analogue scale and by assessing resolution of previously abnormal neurological examination findings. Risk factors and biochemical results were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. 69 cases were identified on Kuria (7% attack rate) including 34 confirmed and 35 unconfirmed. Most were adults (median age 28 years [range 0–62]) and 83% were male. Seven adult males and two infants died (13% case fatality rate). Resolution of objective clinical signs (78%) or symptoms (94%) were identified within one week of starting treatment. Risk factors included having a friend with thiamine deficiency disease and drinking kava; drinking yeast alcohol reduced the risk of disease. Higher chromium (p<0·001) but not thiamine deficiency (p = 0·66) or other biochemical indices were associated with disease by univariate analyses. Chromium (p<0·001) and thiamine deficiency (p = 0·02) were associated with disease by multivariate analysis. Conclusions/Significance An outbreak of thiamine deficiency disease (beriberi) in Kiribati signals the re-emergence of a classic nutritional disease in the Pacific islands after five decades. Although treatment is safe and effective, the underlying reason for the re-emergence remains unknown. Chromium was highly and positively correlated with disease in this study raising questions about the potential role of factors other than thiamine in the biochemistry and pathophysiology of clinical disease."
https://openalex.org/W2805546224,"Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, or BRK) is aberrantly expressed in breast cancers, and emerging as an oncogene that promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration and evasion. Both kinase-dependent and -independent functions of PTK6 in driving tumor growth have been described, therefore targeting PTK6 kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat cancers remains to be validated. In this study, we identified novel, potent and selective PTK6 kinase inhibitors as a means to investigate the role of PTK6 kinase activity in breast tumorigenesis. We report here the crystal structures of apo-PTK6 and inhibitor-bound PTK6 complexes, providing the structural basis for small molecule interaction with PTK6. The kinase inhibitors moderately suppress tumor cell growth in 2D and 3D cell cultures. However, the tumor cell growth inhibition shows neither correlation with the PTK6 kinase activity inhibition, nor the total or activated PTK6 protein levels in tumor cells, suggesting that the tumor cell growth is independent of PTK6 kinase activity. Furthermore, in engineered breast tumor cells overexpressing PTK6, the inhibition of PTK6 kinase activity does not parallel the inhibition of tumor cell growth with a >500-fold shift in compound potencies (IC50 values). Overall, these findings suggest that the kinase activity of PTK6 does not play a significant role in tumorigenesis, thus providing important evidence against PTK6 kinase as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2806384700,"Drug-related sinusoidal dilatation (SD) is a common form of hepatotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy used prior to resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Recently, hepatic SD has also been associated with anti-delta like 4 (DLL4) cancer therapies targeting the NOTCH pathway. To investigate the hypothesis that NOTCH signaling plays an important role in drug-induced SD, gene expression changes were examined in livers from anti-DLL4 and oxaliplatin-induced SD in non-human primate (NHP) and patients, respectively. Putative mechanistic biomarkers of bevacizumab (bev)-mediated protection against oxaliplatin-induced SD were also investigated. RNA was extracted from whole liver sections or centrilobular regions by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) obtained from NHP administered anti-DLL4 fragment antigen-binding (F(ab')2 or patients with CRLM receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bev. mRNA expression was quantified using high-throughput real-time quantitative PCR. Significance analysis was used to identify genes with differential expression patterns (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Eleven (CCL2, CCND1, EFNB2, ERG, ICAM1, IL16, LFNG, NOTCH1, NOTCH4, PRDX1, and TGFB1) and six (CDH5, EFNB2, HES1, IL16, MIK67, HES1 and VWF) candidate genes were differentially expressed in the liver of anti-DLL4- and oxaliplatin-induced SD, respectively. Addition of bev to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy resulted in differential changes in hepatic CDH5, HEY1, IL16, JAG1, MMP9, NOTCH4 and TIMP1 expression. This work implicates NOTCH and IL16 pathways in the pathogenesis of drug-induced SD and further explains the hepato-protective effect of bev in oxaliplatin-induced SD observed in CRLM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2806793082,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, second only to respiratory tract infections and particularly prevalent within primary care. Conventional detection of UTIs is culture, however, return of results can take between 24 and 72 hours. The introduction of a point of care (POC) test would allow for more timely identification of UTIs, facilitating improved, targeted treatment. This study aimed to obtain consensus on the criteria required for a POC UTI test, to meet patient need within primary care.Criteria for consideration were compiled by the research team. These criteria were validated through a two-round Delphi process, utilising an expert panel of healthcare professionals from across Europe and United States of America. Using web-based questionnaires, panellists recorded their level of agreement with each criterion based on a 5-point Likert Scale, with space for comments. Using median response, interquartile range and comments provided, criteria were accepted/rejected/revised depending on pre-agreed cut-off scores.The first round questionnaire presented thirty-three criteria to the panel, of which 22 were accepted. Consensus was not achieved for the remaining 11 criteria. Following response review, one criterion was removed, while after revision, the remaining 10 criteria entered the second round. Of these, four were subsequently accepted, resulting in 26 criteria considered appropriate for a POC test to detect urinary infections.This study generated an approved set of criteria for a POC test to detect urinary infections. Criteria acceptance and comments provided by the healthcare professionals also supports the development of a multiplex point of care UTI test."
https://openalex.org/W2807570342,"Citrus canker is a disease caused by the phytopathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc), bacterium which is unable to survive out of the host for extended periods of time. Once established inside the plant, the pathogen must compete for resources and evade the defenses of the host cell. However, a number of aspects of Xcc metabolic and nutritional state, during the epiphytic stage and at different phases of infection, are poorly characterized. The 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase complex (MCC) is an essential enzyme for the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid leucine, which prevents the accumulation of toxic intermediaries, facilitates the generation of branched chain fatty acids and/or provides energy to the cell. The MCC complexes belong to a group of acyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCase) enzymes dependent of biotin. In this work, we have identified two ORFs (XAC0263 and XAC0264) encoding for the α and β subunits of an acyl-CoA carboxylase complex from Xanthomonas and demonstrated that this enzyme has MCC activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that this MCC complex is conserved in a group of pathogenic gram negative bacteria. The generation and analysis of an Xcc mutant strain deficient in MCC showed less canker lesions in the interaction with the host plant, suggesting that the expression of these proteins is necessary for Xcc fitness during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2805863443,"Background It is reported that glaucoma may be associated with vascular dysregulation. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), which feature different intraocular pressure levels, may manifest differential features of systemic autonomic dysregulation. Methods and results We investigated autonomic regulation to carbohydrate ingestion and postural change in 37 glaucoma patients (19 NTG and 18 POAG) and 36 controls. Subjects were age and gender-matched, normotensive, and had normal comparable insulin sensitivity. Continuous finger arterial pressure and ECG was recorded in supine and standing positions before and after carbohydrate ingestion. Low frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.15–0.4Hz) spectral power of heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability (HRV and SBPV) were calculated to estimate sympathovagal function. Overall comparison glaucoma (N = 37) and controls (N = 36) showed an increased sympathetic excitation, vagal withdrawal and unstable mean arterial pressure after carbohydrate ingestion in glaucoma patients. Glaucoma severity by retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness is positively correlated to autonomic responses (HRV LF power and HF power in normalised units (nu), and HRV LF/HF ratio) after carbohydrate ingestion. Early (30 minutes) following carbohydrate ingestion, SBP LF power and HRV parameters remained unchanged in controls; while POAG showed abnormal autonomic responses, with a paradoxical vagal enhancement (increased HRV HF power in nu) and sympathetic inhibition (decreased HRV LF power nu and HRV LF/HF ratio), and associated hypotension. Later (60–120 minutes) following carbohydrate ingestion, HRV parameters remained unaltered in controls; whereas NTG manifested vagal withdrawal (reduced HRV HF power nu) and sympathetic hyper-responsiveness (increased HRV LF power nu and HRV LF/HF ratio), despite increased SBP LF power in both controls and NTG. Both NTG and POAG exhibited attenuated autonomic responses to postural stress. Conclusions NTG and POAG both manifest some systemic autonomic cardiovascular dysregulation. However, the two forms of glaucoma respond differentially to carbohydrate ingestion, irrespective of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2806519768,"The capture of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) plays a critical role in resistance acquisition for human-associated bacteria. Although aquaculture environments are recognized as important reservoirs of ARGs, intra- and intercellular mobility of MGEs discovered in marine organisms is poorly characterized. Here, we show a new pattern of interspecies ARGs transfer involving a 'non-conjugative' integrative element. To identify active MGEs in a Vibrio ponticus isolate, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a transconjugant obtained by mating between Escherichia coli and Vibrio ponticus. This revealed integration of a plasmid (designated pSEA1) into the chromosome, consisting of a self-transmissible plasmid backbone of the MOBH group, ARGs, and a 13.8-kb integrative element Tn6283. Molecular genetics analysis suggested a two-step gene transfer model. First, Tn6283 integrates into the recipient chromosome during suicidal plasmid transfer, followed by homologous recombination between the Tn6283 copy in the chromosome and that in the newly transferred pSEA1. Tn6283 is unusual among integrative elements in that it apparently does not encode transfer function and its excision barely generates unoccupied donor sites. Thus, its movement is analogous to the transposition of insertion sequences rather than to that of canonical integrative and conjugative elements. Overall, this study reveals the presence of a previously unrecognized type of MGE in a marine organism, highlighting diversity in the mode of interspecies gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2805225497,"Mother-child relationships change considerably in adolescence, but it is not yet understood how mothers experience vicarious rewards for their adolescent children. In the current study, we investigated neural responses of twenty mothers winning and losing money for their best friend and for their adolescent child in a gambling task. During the task, functional neuroimaging data were acquired. We examined the activation patterns when playing for or winning for self, adolescent children and friends in four a-priori selected ROIs (nucleus accumbens, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporo-parietal junction). Behaviorally, mothers indicated that they experienced most enjoyment when they gained money for their children and that their children deserved to win more, relative to friends and self. At the neural level, nucleus accumbens activity was stronger when winning versus losing. This pattern was not only found when playing for self, but also for friends and children, possibly reflecting the rewarding value of vicarious prosocial gains. In addition, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction were more active when receiving outcomes for children and friends compared to self, possibly reflecting increased recruitment of mentalizing processes. Interestingly, activity in this network was stronger for mothers who indicated that their children and friends deserved to win more. These findings provide initial evidence that vicarious rewards for one's children are processed similarly as rewards for self, and that activation in social brain regions are related to social closeness."
https://openalex.org/W2806976351,"This paper studies the drive-response synchronization for quaternion-valued shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks (QVSICNNs) with mixed delays. First, QVSICNN is decomposed into an equivalent real-valued system in order to avoid the non-commutativity of the multiplicity. Then, the existence of almost periodic solutions is obtained based on the Banach fixed point theorem. An novel state-feedback controller is designed to ensure the global exponential almost periodic synchronization. At the end of the paper, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results."
https://openalex.org/W2807497938,"Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested as novel biomarkers for diagnosing gastric cancer (GC) at an early stage, but the single-marker strategy may ignore the co-regulatory relationships and lead to low diagnostic specificity. Thus, multi-target modular diagnostic biomarkers are urgently needed. In this study, a Zsummary and NetSVM-based method was used to identify GC-related hub miRNAs and activated modules from clinical miRNA co-expression networks. The NetSVM-based sub-network consisting of the top 20 hub miRNAs reached a high sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.82. The Zsummary algorithm identified an activated module (miR-486, miR-451, miR-185, and miR-600) which might serve as diagnostic biomarker of GC. Three members of this module were previously suggested as biomarkers of GC and its 24 target genes were significantly enriched in pathways directly related to cancer. The weighted diagnostic ROC AUC of this module was 0.838, and an optimized module unit (miR-451 and miR-185) obtained a higher value of 0.904, both of which were higher than that of individual miRNAs. These hub miRNAs and module have the potential to become robust biomarkers for early diagnosis of GC with further validations. Moreover, such modular analysis may offer valuable insights into multi-target approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2807518083,"Plant hormones play important roles in regulating every aspect of growth, development, and metabolism of plants. We are interested in understanding hormonal regulation of floret opening and closure in plants. This is a particularly important problem for hybrid rice because regulation of flowering time is vitally important in hybrid rice seed production. However, little was known about the effects of plant hormones on rice flowering. We have shown that jasmonate and methyl jasmonate play significant roles in promoting rice floret opening. In this study, we investigated the effects of auxins including indole-3-acidic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 1-naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (DIC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on floret closure of four fertile and three sterile varieties of rice. The results from field studies in three growing seasons in 2013–2015 showed that the percentages of closed florets were significantly lower in plants treated with IAA, IBA, 2,4-D, DIC and NAA and that the durations of floret opening were significantly longer in plants treated with the same auxins. The auxins exhibited time- and concentration-dependant effects on floret closure. ABA displayed opposite effects of auxins because it increased the percentages of floret closure and decreased the length of floret opening of rice varieties. The degree of auxin-inhibiting and ABA-promoting effects on floret closure was varied somewhat but not significantly different among the rice varieties. Endogenous IAA levels were the highest in florets collected shortly before opening followed by a sharp decline in florets with maximal angles of opening and a significant jump of IAA levels shortly after floret closure in both fertile and sterile rice plants. ABA levels showed an opposite trend in the same samples. Our results showed that auxins delayed but ABA promoted the closure of rice floret regardless of the varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2806728686,"Several types of size-based models have been developed to model the size spectra of marine communities, in which abundance scales strongly with body size, using continuous differential equations. In this study, we develop a size-structured matrix model, which can be seen as a discretization of the Mckendrick-von Foerster equation, to simulate the dynamics of marine communities. The developed model uses a series of simple body size power functions to describe the basic processes of predator–prey interactions, reproduction, metabolism, and non-predation mortality based on the principle of mass balance. Linear size spectra with slopes of approximately –1 are successfully reproduced by this model. Several examples of numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the model’s behavior. Size spectra with cut-offs and/or waves are also found for certain parameter values. The matrix model is flexible and can be freely manipulated by users to answer different questions and is executed over a shorter numerical calculation running time than continuous models."
https://openalex.org/W2805259753,"According to the 2016 World Malaria Report, the malaria incidence in Haiti declined by > 40% between 2010 and 2015. Though elimination efforts have likely contributed, this time period also corresponded to a national change in diagnostic methods.Monthly reports of aggregated patient data were acquired from five clinics in the Ouest Department of Haiti. Generalized linear models were used to compare the number of febrile patients tested, the number of positive tests, and the proportion of tests that were positive (TRP) before and after the national adoption of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).Prior to the earthquake when microcopy was used for diagnosis, a total of 1,727 patients with 557 (32.3%) positive; post-earthquake testing was reduced and the TPR was variable; during the post recovery period when RDTs were used exclusivly, a total of 5,132 patients were tested using RDTs, only 83 (1.62%) were positive. Compared to the pre-earthquake period, there was a 69% increase in the number of patients tested (IRR: 1.69; 95% CI IRR 1.59, 2.79), and a 97.0% decrease in the proportion of patients with a positive test result (IRR: 0.03; 95% CI IRR 0.02, 0.04) in the post-recovery period.While the decline in malaria indicators between 2010 and 2015 has been cited as evidence of progress towards elimination, these reports derived estimates of the malaria burden in Haiti using two different diagnostic tests. Thus, comparison of these periods in the context of malaria elimination should be made with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2806491003,"Water level (WL) fluctuations in lakes influence many aspects of ecosystem processes. Concern about the potential impact of WL fluctuations on fisheries was one of the factors that motivated the decision in 2000 to alter the management of WL in the Rainy-Namakan reservoir complex (on the border between the U.S. state of Minnesota and the Canadian province of Ontario). We used a Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) framework to identify potential impacts of the change in WL management to Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch catch per unit effort (CPUE). The CPUE of these species from 1990–1999 and from 2005–2014 were compared in four impact lakes (Lake Kabetogama, Namakan Lake, Rainy Lake and Sand Point Lake) and two control lakes (Lake of the Woods and Lake Vermilion) using a simple Bayesian model. Changes in fish CPUE in the impact lakes were often similar to changes that occurred in at least one control lake. The only change that was not similar to changes in control lakes was an increase of Yellow Perch in Lake Kabetogama. The two control lakes often differed substantially from each other, such that if only one had been available our conclusions about the role of WL management on fisheries would be very different. In general, identifying cause-and-effect relationships in observational field data is very difficult, and the BACI analysis used here does not specify a causative mechanism, so co-occurring environmental and management changes may obscure the effect of WL management."
https://openalex.org/W2807032186,"The lack of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) compromises the integrity and function of muscle fibers. Skeletal muscles, except the diaphragm, do not undergo progressive degeneration in adult mdx mice due to compensatory mechanisms, including structural protein upregulation. New mouse models, including utrophin haploinsufficient mdx (mdx/utrn+/-) mice, may better recapitulate DMD. Our goal was to determine whether mdx/utrn+/- worsens the mdx phenotype and to characterize the course of the disease on muscle function and contractility at 1, 2, and 5 months of age, which encompass all stages of development relevant to DMD therapy. The functional performances of mdx/utrn+/- mice showed that they are not more affected than mdx/utrn+/+ mice based on downhill treadmill running parameters and subsequent recovery measured by open-field voluntary activity. WT mice ran the entire distance (450 m) on the treadmill, with an additional 561 m during the 4 h of open-field while mdx/utrn+/+ and mdx/utrn+/- mice completed, respectively, 236 m and 273 m on the treadmill and 341 m and 287 m during the open-field period. In addition, isolated ex vivo contractile properties and repeated eccentric contractions showed that mdx/utrn+/- does not significantly worsen the function of dystrophic EDL muscles, which are mainly composed of fast-twitch fibers that are preferentially affected in DMD. Twitch, absolute tetanic, and specific tetanic forces were very similar in dystrophic EDL muscles from mdx/utrn+/+ and mdx utrn+/- mice at 1, 2, and 5 months of age. Five-month-old mdx/utrn+/+ and mdx/utrn+/- mice lost roughly 50% of their force due to repeated eccentric contractions. Thus, histological, morphological, biochemical functional and contractile observations showed that utrophin haploinsufficiency has a very limited impact on mdx mice."
https://openalex.org/W2805229694,"Production of higher-fidelity digital elevation models is important; as such models are indispensable components of space data infrastructure. However, loss of terrain features is a constant problem for grid digital elevation models, although these models have already been defined in such a way that their distinct usage as data sources in terrain modeling processing is prohibited. Therefore, in this study, the novel concept-terrain semanteme is proposed to define local space terrain features, and a new process for generating grid digital elevation models based on this new concept is designed. A prototype system is programmed to test the proposed approach; the results indicate that terrain semanteme can be applied in the process of grid digital elevation model generation, and that usage of this new concept improves the digital elevation model fidelity. Moreover, the terrain semanteme technique can be applied for recovery of distorted digital elevation model regions containing terrain semantemes, with good recovery efficiency indicated by experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2805594346,"Metabolic disturbances induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in pancreatic beta cells. This study aims to investigate whether a common pathway exists in the ERS induced by various chemicals, including high levels of glucose and palmitate in INS-1-3 cells.ERS in INS-1-3 cells was induced by exposure cells to thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM) or palmitic acid (PA) +high glucose (HG). Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling technique was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The profile of gene expression was detected by gene oncology (GO) function and pathway enrichment analysis. Nkx6.1 over-expression was established in INS-1-3 cell lines by lentivirus infection to revert the inhibition of Nkx6.1 expression found in the situation of ERS. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression changes of key genes. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. INS-1-3 cell function was measured by glucose stimulated insulin secretion test(GSIS).As compared to control, DGE demonstrated that there were 135, 57 and 74 differentially expressed genes in TM, TG and HG+PA groups, respectively. Those differentially expressed genes were enriched to ERS, antigen processing and presentation, protein export pathways, and interestingly, the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathway. Nkx6.1 is one of common down-regulated gene in MODY signaling pathway among TM, TG and HG+PA groups. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 ameliorated glucolipotoxicity induced apoptosis rate by 45.4%, and increased proliferation by 40.9%. At the same time, GSIS increased by 1.82 folds.MODY pathway genes expression was changed in the state of ERS. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 protected the INS-1-3 cells from glucolipotoxicity."
